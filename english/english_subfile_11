No venerable here means internal venerables the venerable qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha within the mind
When we meditate we're handing our minds over to these venerable qualities
They're qualities that are kind and considerate
They won't abuse us or cause anyone any harm
This is why we can wholeheartedly entrust our valuables  our mind  to them
For example when we meditate buddho buddho we have to be sincere to these qualities
We really have to think about them
We don't just think about them in jest
Thinking in jest means that we think without really being intent
We have to be really intent on keeping buddho with the mind and the mind with buddho each and every time we breathe in and out
This is what it means to be sincere in our thinking
It's the kind of thinking that serves a purpose
The purpose here is to develop something of real and abundant essence within ourselves  to create results that will be lasting
Things that don't serve any real purpose are those giving results that don't last
When we talk about lasting results for example when you sit here and meditate you'll find that the results will continue appearing even after you die
But if you aren't really meditating if you let your mind think about other things you'll find that the results will vanish at death because the things you think about aren't certain or sure
They're not lasting
They'll have to change deteriorate and end up disappearing and dying in the same way that you will
When we make ourselves quiet and still  when we put the mind into concentration  it's as if we're charging our battery
Once our battery is charged we can put it to use whenever we want
When our battery is fully charged  full of discernment  we can use it for any sort of purpose at all
We can hook it up to a wire and use it to cook our food or light our home
If we simply charge it without connecting it up to anything the current will stay there cool in the battery without causing danger of any sort like the current in a flashlight cell
If a battery is just sitting there we can touch it with our hands and see that it feels cool not the least bit hot  and yet there's still the fire of electricity in there
If we need light or want to cook our food all we have to do is hook up a wire and turn on the switch and the electricity will come out of the battery to achieve whatever aims we have in mind
Our battery is the mind in concentration
If we hook up the wire of ardency to roast our defilements the power of our current or discernment will burn them to ashes
As when we cook food to get rid of its rawness the food will be saved from going spoiled and will benefit the body
In the same way people who have discernment within themselves can eliminate all the defilements that present a danger and cause suffering to the body and mind
This is why we're taught to develop concentration so as to accumulate the discernment that will benefit us both in this present lifetime and on into the next
When you sit and meditate keep observing two important factors  the body which is where the mind dwells and  the mind which is the factor responsible for good and evil
The mind is a factor that's extremely fickle and fast
It likes to slip off looking for all sorts of nonsense for things that bring us nothing but trouble
It doesn't like to stay in place
Now it goes running here now it goes running there bringing back different kinds of suffering
That's why we say that it's fickle and fast easily diverted hard to look after
Now since our mind is so fickle and fast the Buddha had to search for a method by which we can take this weak point and turn it around into something good
He teaches us to develop concentration by focusing on the body
In other words he has us fix our attention on one of the really important factors of the body the breath
The breath is what helps us find comfort and ease in all the parts of the body
It's what keeps the body alive
All of our sense doors  the eyes the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mind  depend on the breath to create the sensations by which they receive impressions of outside things and bring them in to have an effect on the body
For instance the function of the eyes is to receive impressions of forms for us to see
The function of the ears is to receive impressions of sounds for us to hear
The function of the nose is to receive impressions of aromas for us to smell
The function of the tongue is to receive impressions of flavors for us to taste
The function of the body is to receive impressions of tactile sensations for us to touch
The function of the mind is to receive impressions of the various things that come in via these other five senses
So when we meditate we have to close all of these sense doors off tight
We close our eyes we don't have to look at pretty sights or ugly ones
We close our ears so that we don't listen to anything that isn't necessary  ie anything that isn't beneficial to listen to
Only the words that advise us to do good should we listen to
As for the nose it's necessary for life
If we don't have the nose as our breathing passage we start having problems in the other parts of the body so we keep it open
As for the mouth we keep it closed
And as for the body we keep it in one position as when we sit with our legs crossed like we're doing right now
We have to try to keep these sense doors closed off so that we don't use our eyes ears nose tongue body or mind in any other activity aside from practicing concentration
We herd the mind into one preoccupation so that it stays in its home the body with the windows and doors all shut
The mind is the heartproperty or heartelement
The nature of the mind is that it's faster than the wind in the air which flows to and fro up and down and never stays in place
So we have to bring our mindfulness into the mind so that we can take this weak point and turn it around into something good
This is called bhavana or mental development through meditation
We focus on the breath and recollect the qualities of the Buddha
When we start off recollecting the Buddha in this way we simply think of the word buddho
We don't yet have to analyze what it means
Buddho is a name for mindfulness
It means being aware being awake
But if we simply think of the word buddho it doesn't fulfill all the factors for mental development through meditation
When we think the word we have to steady and adjust it so that it stays in rhythm with the breath
When we breathe we have to breathe just right not too slow not too fast whatever feels natural
Then we think buddho back and forth with the breath adjusting our thinking so that it merges with the breathing
That's when we can say that we're fulfilling the factors of meditation
This is called recollection of the Buddha in which we think of the qualities of the Buddha in an abbreviated way depending on the breath as our focal point and keeping our mindfulness in charge of the thinking
When mindfulness becomes one with the breath and with our awareness in this way our various senses will grow even and calm
The mind will gradually grow more and more quiet bit by bit
This is called getting established in the first guardian meditation  recollection of the Buddha  in which we use our thinking as a path of practice
This kind of thinking gives results for Buddhists of all sorts
At the same time it brings us into the factors that are helpful for the mind  mindfulness and alertness  the factors that support the mind in getting established in goodness
The second guardian meditation is good will
The word good will  metta  comes from mitta or friend
As a quality it means love benevolence familiarity intimacy
When we imbue our mind with good will we escape from animosity and hostility
In other words we should remind ourselves that we're going to stay with our friend at all times
We won't go wandering off
We won't leave our friend in a lurch
Our friend here is the body because the body and mind have to depend on each other at all times
The body has to depend on the mind
The mind has to depend on the body
When people are friends they have to love each other wish each other well stick with each other be intent on helping each other at all times
They don't abandon each other
So tell yourself that when the body breathes in you're going to stick with the breath
In Pali the breath is called kayasankhara or bodily fabrication because it's what fixes the body to keep it alive
It's like the cook who fixes food in a home so that the people in the family can eat their fill and be happy
If there's something wrong with the cook then there's going to be turmoil and chaos in the house
If the cook of the body  the breath  gets weird everyone else in the body  the properties of earth water wind and fire  will all have to suffer and get thrown into a turmoil as well
So we can say that the breath is the property that looks after all the properties in the body
For example we inhale the breath into the lungs
There it cleanses the blood in the lungs which gets sent to the heart
The function of the heart is to send the blood out to nourish all the parts of the body so that the blood and the breath energy flow normally
If the breath isn't as good as it should be the lungs won't be as good as they should be
The heart won't be good the blood it pumps out won't be good so all the various parts of the body will have to suffer as a result
This is when the properties of the body are said to be defiled
If the mind really has good will for the body then it has to look after the breath in the body to keep it functioning properly
So we have to keep after our cook to make sure that she isn't filthy lazy or apathetic
Otherwise she'll put poison in our food to kill us or filth in our food to make us sick
So we have to make sure that our cook is clean and pure in her habits as when we breathe the qualities of the Buddha in with the breath
The breath accompanied by buddho is called the sukka breath or the clean clear breath
When the master of the house is clean and circumspect like this the cook will have to be clean and circumspect too
All the employees in the house will have to be clean
In other words when we're mindful the breath that goes into the body will be a pure breath
When it reaches the heart it will cleanse the blood in the heart so that it's pure as well
When the heart pumps this pure blood sending it to nourish the body the body will be purified too
And then the mind will have to feel well
In other words the heart is good the nourishment in the blood is good
When the mind is in good shape like this the blood won't become abnormal
And when this good blood is sent to nourish the nerves throughout the body the body will have to function well
It won't feel tired or aching
This is because we've adjusted our breath well so that we can treat all kinds of diseases and pains
When the purity of the breath spreads throughout every blood vessel the bad things already there in the body will have to scatter
Those that haven't yet appeared won't be able to appear
This will help the body to be balanced and normal
When the breath is in good shape and the heart is in good shape then the fire property in the body won't be too strong
If the breath isn't right or if it's too hot then the fire property gets thrown out of balance
When it grows too hot the blood thickens and gets stuck in the capillaries making us sleepy or giving us a headache
If it grows too cold it gives us the shivers or makes us feverish
So the breath is more important than any of the other the properties in the body
It assists the fire property which in turn distills the liquid property
The liquid property in the body falls into two sorts the part that hardens and turns into earth and the part that stays liquid by its nature
When the breath functions properly all the other properties function properly and the body will feel rested and at ease
This is called showing good will for yourself
The mind sticks with the breath the breath sticks with the body the body sticks with the mind
They don't abandon one another
They're affectionate intimate harmonious  they're good friends
When people stay together they become intimate and familiar with one another
If they don't stay with one another they can't become familiar with one another
And when they're not on familiar terms they don't really know one another
When people are friends and on familiar terms they trust one another
They tell one another their secrets
They don't hide what's going on
In the same way when we become close friends with the body and on familiar terms we're going to learn all the body's secrets
For instance we may learn what kamma in the past led to the birth of the body the way it is  what our previous lifetimes were like what good and bad things we did that led to the body's being like this or that
We'll learn how the four properties of the body function
We'll learn how things arise and pass away at the properties of the eye ear nose tongue body and intellect
We'll get to know the secrets of the various affairs connected with the body because it will have to reveal its true nature to us in every way  just as when we open the cover on a serving dish enabling us to see what's there in the dish
When we come to know how things function in the body this way that's called vijja or clear knowing
This sort of clear knowing arises from the stillness of the mind
When the body and mind are both quiet together they give knowledge to each other
Just as with people if we're friendly with them they're bound to be friendly with us
If we're antagonistic with them they're bound to be antagonistic with us
In the same way when the body is friendly with the mind the mind is bound to be friendly with the body
In other words it can help the various parts of the body
It can help make the body act in line with its thoughts
If for instance there's a feeling of pain or weariness we can gather the power of the mind at full strength to think of the feeling going away and that feeling of pain or weariness may completely vanish simply through the power of a single mental moment
People who have helped each other in the past have to help each other all the time
If we can help them they're bound to be able to help us
The ability to do this comes from the power of the mind that's capable of giving orders in line with its aspirations
When we can make our friend good through the power of our thought then all our friends can become good
For example when we think of purifying the breath the breath will help improve the fire property
The fire property will help improve the liquid property
The liquid property will help improve the earth property
When all the properties help one another in this way they become balanced and a help to the body so that the body can be healthy
As for the mind it grows cool and calm
Anyone who comes near will pick up some of that calmness as well
Just like a mountain cool in its depths whoever walks past will be cooled as well even though the mountain didn't make a point of splashing water on them to cool them off
Here we've been speaking about the body
As for the mind when it's pure it gives even greater results
When we think using the power of the pure mind the currents go faster than lightning through the sky and they can go all around the world
If anyone wants to come and harm us they can't get near because the current of a pure strong mind has the power to ward off all kinds of danger
Take the Buddha as an example No one could kill him
People who thought of killing him as soon as they got near him saw him as their loving father
Those who were subject to the current of the Buddha's purity let go of their evil habits and turned into good people they let go of their violence and viciousness becoming gentle and mild
Angulimala for instance If he hadn't been willing to listen to the Buddha he would have been swallowed up by the earth
But he was able to think The Buddha won't kill me
I won't kill anyone He immediately put down his weapons gave up killing once and for all ordained and became one of the Buddha's noble disciples
So in the same way we should think of the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha with every inandout breath
When we stay within the territory of the Dhamma in this way it's as if we were having an audience with the Buddha himself
Even though  when we keep thinking of the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  we keep going over the same old territory over and over again what's wrong with that
Actually when we use our powers of directed thought and evaluation back and forth this way the results we end up with are positive a sense of fullness that spreads throughout every part of the body
The mind will feel full and bright
The heart will feel blossoming established in the sense of fullness or rapture that comes with thoughts of good will
When the heart is full in this way it's at ease just as when we've eaten our fill of food
And when the heart is full its friend the body is sure to feel full and rested as well
We'll be at our ease both in body and in mind just as when we see our children and grandchildren wellfed and sleeping soundly
This is called pleasure
And when we see that something gives pleasure to our children and grandchildren we have to focus our efforts on it continually
This is how the mind reaches singleness of preoccupation entering into a state of peace free from every sort of disturbance and danger
When you sit and meditate tell yourself that your body is like your home
When you repeat the word buddho in with the breath it's like inviting a monk into your home
When people invite a monk into their home what do they do in order to qualify as having good manners
 They have to prepare a place for him to sit down
 They provide him with good food or drinking water
 They have to converse with him
When we meditate preparing a place to sit down means thinking bud in with the inbreath and dho out with the out
If we're mindful to think in this way the word buddho will always stay snug with the breath
Whenever our thinking slips away from the breath it's as if we put a rip in the seat we're preparing for our guest
And don't forget that before you prepare a seat you first have to sweep the place clean
In other words when you first start out you should breathe in long and deep and then let the breath come all the way out two or three times
Then you gradually allow the breath to grow lighter bit by bit until it's just enough for you to follow comfortably
Don't let it grow any weaker or stay any stronger than just right
Then you start combining buddho with the inandout breath
When you do this your visiting monk will come into your home
Now make sure that you stay with him
Don't go running off anywhere else
If your mind runs off to hang around with external concepts of past or future it's as if you've run away from the monk you've invited into your home  which is really bad manners
Once the monk has sat down in the seat you've prepared for him you have to give him some good food or water and then find good things to converse with him
The good food here is the food of intentions the food of sensory contact and the food of consciousness
The food of intentions stands for the way you adjust the breath so as to make it comfortable both for the body and for the mind
For instance you're observant to see which kind of breathing is good for the body and which kind is bad
What kind of inbreathing feels easy
What kind of outbreathing feels easy
Does it feel good to breathe in fast and out fast
How about in slow and out slow
You have to experiment and then taste the food you've prepared
This is one kind of food for the mind
This is why being intent to stay with the breath is called the food of intention
When you adjust the breath to the point where it feels comfortable and in good order it'll give rise to a sense of fullness and ease
That's when you can say that you've provided your visiting monk with good nourishing food
When he's finished his meal he's going to chant blessings for the sake of your wellbeing and happiness so that you'll be free from pain and suffering
Or as the saying goes the power of the Buddha gets rid of suffering
In other words when you've adjusted the breath properly the pains in the body will disappear
Even though there may be some that don't disappear they don't impinge on the mind
As for pain and suffering in the heart that will all disappear
The mind will cool down
When it cools down it'll be at its ease  quiet blooming and bright
And as for the saying the power of the Dhamma gets rid of dangers the various forms of Mara coming to disturb the body such as the pains of the aggregates will all vanish
The mind will be free from dangers and animosities
And as for the saying the power of the Sangha gets rid of disease all the various diseases in the mind  sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair  will disappear
This way once you've invited this monk into your home and provided him with good food he's going to give you three kinds of blessing you escape from pain from danger and from disease
This is part of the blessing that your visiting monk will give you
But if when you've invited a monk into your home you go running off outside  in other words if you forget the breath or go hanging around with external thoughts  it's really impolite and the monk is going to be put to difficulties
It's as if you had invited him into your home but had forgotten to prepare his meal
So if you aren't really intent on the breath and don't really welcome your monk into your home you won't get this kind of blessing
The last part of inviting your monk into your home is to converse with him
Once he's eaten his fill you talk with him
This stands for the qualities of directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
You connect all six types of breath energy in the body so that they all flow into one another  as when you put up a telephone line
If the line stays in good shape you can hear what they say all over the world
But if the line is cut you can't get word of what they're saying even in Bangkok just down the road
So when you keep your line in good shape you can hear anything being said anywhere at all
When the mind stays in the first jhana this way it's as if your visiting monk is talking with you and you're talking with him
And the things you're talking about are all Dhamma
This puts you in a good mood
As time passes you feel so good that you don't even want to eat
This is rapture the body feels full
At the same time the mind is free from disturbances and so feels pleasure
Wherever you get a sense of pleasure you keep staying interested in that point this is singleness of preoccupation
When you welcome your visiting monk in this way he's going to keep coming to visit you
No matter where you go he'll be able to reach you
Even if you're staying in the mountains or forest wilderness he'll be able to give you whatever help you need
Our goodness what can we do to make it really good
For today's goodness I want each of us to set our minds on casting a Buddha within the mind to protect ourselves because Buddhas are things that are more sacred and numinous that any other object in the world
They can protect us and help us survive all sorts of danger and suffering
As we're told in the Pali chant Sabbadukkha sabbabhaya sabbaroga vinassantu which means All sufferings all dangers all diseases can be destroyed through the power of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
Whoever has an inner Buddha is protected from all three major fears
The first kind is the fear of suffering ie birth aging illness and death
The Buddha isn't afraid of these things at all for he has warded them off in all their forms The various kinds of danger such as danger from criminals Whoever might try to come and steal his valuables the Buddha isn't the least bit afraid for his valuables aren't the kind that anyone can steal
The danger of fire Don't mention house fires or being bombed by nuclear weapons
Even if the fires of the end of the aeon were to burn up the entire world he wouldn't be startled or fearful
The danger of floods even if water were to flood from the earth up to the sky he wouldn't be concerned
The danger of famine drought and pestilence wouldn't make him suffer or put him to any hardship
The various diseases that arise in the body don't cause him any fear
Just look at the Buddha image in front of you What dangers is he afraid of
From where
No matter what anyone does to him he just sits there perfectly still not afraid of anything at all
This is why we should cast a Buddha within ourselves so that we can wear it around our neck and protect ourselves from fear wherever we go
Now when they cast a Buddha image what do they do
The first thing is to make a mold that's beautiful and wellproportioned
Then they heat it until it's hot through and through
Then they pour molten metal into the mold
Then they let it cool
When it's thoroughly cooled they pull off the pieces of the mold leaving only the Buddha image but even then the image is still rough and unattractive
They have to polish it until it gives off clear reflections or else paint it with lacquer and cover it with gold leaf
Only then will they have a finished Buddha image in line with their aims
So now that we're casting a Buddha within ourselves we have to heat our mold before we can pour the metal into it
Pretend that the body here is your mold your mind is the expert craftsman
I want us all to set our minds on casting a Buddha within ourselves
Who's going to have the most beautiful Buddha will depend on how skillful and capable each craftsman is at smelting
How do we heat our mold
We heat the mold by sitting in concentration your right leg on top of the left your hands placed palmup in your lap your right hand on top of your left
Sit up straight
Don't lean forward or back or tilt to either side
If the mold is offcenter your Buddha will have to be offcenter too
The next step is to fix your mindfulness on the breath thinking bud with the inbreath and dho with the out
Stay focused exclusively on the breath
You don't have to think of anything else  just as if you were pumping air into your furnace to heat up the mold
If your mindfulness doesn't stay with the breath  if you forget or absentmindedly think of other things  it's as if your air pump breaks down
The fire won't grow strong and the mold won't get heated through
If the mold isn't heated through then when you pour your molten metal into it the mold will crack and the metal will leak out all over the place
So you have to be careful that your mold doesn't crack and make sure that your air pump doesn't wear out either
In other words keep watch over your mindfulness so that it isn't absentminded or forgetful
Now let's talk about how you melt your metal  the bronze gold silver or whatever kind of metal you're going to use to cast your Buddha image
When they cast an image they have to melt the metal and remove all the specks and impurities leaving nothing but the metal in its pure form
Only then do they use it to cast the image
In the same way we have to cut away from the heart all the concepts and preoccupations that act as Hindrances
The five Hindrances are like impurities mixed in with gold
If we don't melt them away or remove them from the heart our Buddha image won't turn out as perfect and powerful as we'd like
It'll be blemished and full of holes
If you were to put it on an altar it wouldn't look inspiring
If you were to give it away no one would want to receive it
Therefore it's necessary  crucial  that your expert craftsman be meticulous circumspect and not careless that he make a concerted effort to purify the metal he's using
In other words you have to brush away all concepts of past and future leaving only the present the breath
Be aware only of the breath
When your mold is thoroughly heated your air pump is working well and your metal is pure and free from specks then the Buddha image you're casting will be beautiful to your satisfaction
Casting a Buddha image within you means sitting in concentration giving rise to peace and calm in the mind
When the mind is at peace the body is at peace
Rapture  a sense of fullness in body and mind  will arise within you
When rapture arises in full force it gives way to pleasure
When there's a lot of pleasure the mind grows clear and bright
The brightness of the mind is the knowledge of liberating insight
You come to see the truth of the body that it's simply the four properties of earth water fire and wind  not yours or anyone else's
It's inconstant
Stressful
This gives rise to a sense of weariness and disenchantment so that you let go of the process of mental and physical fabrication seeing that there's no real substance to it
You can separate the body from the mind
The mind will then be free of its burden in having to haul the physical body around
It turns into a mind that's free light and at ease
Whichever way you look is wide open  as if you were to remove the floors walls and roof of your home if you look down you see the ground
If you look up you'll see the stars
Look around in all four directions and you'll see that there's nothing to obstruct your line of sight
You can see everything clearly
If you look to the west you'll see the noble truth of stress
Look south and you'll see the cause of stress
Look east and you'll see the cessation of stress
Look north and you'll see the path
If you can see in this way you're said to be a full dollar ie worth four full quarters
And if you get four full quarters many times over you'll grow more and more valuable all the time
You'll turn into a rich person with lots of wealth  ie noble treasures
You'll be released from poverty
Whoever has noble treasures is said to be a noble person
Noble people are those who have seen the four noble truths
Whoever sees the four noble truths is said to see the Buddha within
The Buddha likes to stay with people of that sort  and when the Buddha is staying with us we'll be blessed and won't fall into hardship
We'll simply keep heading higher and higher
This is why we should all cast a Buddha within ourselves by practicing concentration whenever we have the opportunity
Another way of casting a Buddha within ourselves is to meditate constantly on the foulness of the body as when we chant Ayam kho me kayo this body of mine
Uddham padatala from the tip of our big toe up to the head  what is it like
Addho kesamatthaka from the crown of the head down to the big toe what is it like
Tacapariyanto inside this burlap bag what valuables do we have
The skin covering the body is like a burlap bag full of all kinds of things so let's see what fantastic valuables we have here in this bag
Starting with the ribs heart liver lungs intestines food in the stomach and intestines blood gall lymph urine
What kind of lovely valuables are these things
If you look carefully at your body you'll see that what you have here is the four states of deprivation nothing wonderful at all
The first state of deprivation is the animal kingdom all the worms and germs that live in our stomach and intestines in our blood vessels and in our pores
As long as there's food for these things to eat in there they're always going to be with us multiplying like crazy making us ill
On the outside of the body there are fleas and lice
They like staying with those who don't keep themselves clean making their skin red and sore
As for the animals living in the blood vessels and pores they give us rashes and infections
The second state of deprivation is the kingdom of hungry ghosts ie the properties of earth water fire and wind in the body
First they feel too cold then too warm then they feel ill then they want to eat this or that
We have to keep pandering to them running around to find things for them to eat with never any chance to stop and rest
And they never have enough  like the hungry ghosts who starve after they die with no one to feed them
These properties keep pestering you and no matter what you do you can never please them
First the food is too hot so you have to put ice in it
Then it's too cold so you have to put it back on the stove
All of this comes down to an imbalance in the properties sometimes good sometimes bad never coming to a stable state of normalcy at all making us suffer in various ways
The third state of deprivation is the land of angry demons
Sometimes when we get ill or lose our senses we run around naked without a stitch of clothing as if we were possessed by angry demons
Some people have to undergo operations getting this removed or cutting out that or sucking out this waving their arms and moaning in a way that's really pitiful
Some people get so poor that they have nothing to eat they get so thin that they have nothing left but ribs and eyeballs suffering like the angry demons who can't see the brightness of the world
The fourth state of deprivation is purgatory
Purgatory is the home of all the spirits with a lot of bad karma who have to suffer being roasted speared with redhot iron spikes and pierced with thorns
All the animals whose flesh we've eaten after they've been killed and cooked gather together in our stomach and then disappear into our body in huge numbers
If you were to count them you'd have whole coops of chickens herds of cattle and half a sea's worth of fish
Our stomach is such a tiny thing and yet no matter how much you eat you can never keep it full
And you have to feed it hot things too like the denizens of purgatory who have to live with fire and flame
If there's no fire they can't live
So there's a big copper frying pan for them
All the various spirits we've eaten gather in the big copper frying pan of our stomach where they're consumed by the fires of digestion and then they haunt us Their powers penetrate throughout our flesh and blood giving rise to passion aversion and delusion making us squirm as if we were burned by the fires of purgatory too
So look at the body
Is it really yours
Where did it come from
Whose is it
No matter how much you care for it it's not going to stay with you
It'll have to go back to where it came from the properties of earth water fire and wind
The fact that it's able to stay for a while depends entirely on the breath
When there's no more breath to it it starts to decay and no one wants it then
You won't be able to take it with you when you go
There's no one who can take his arms legs feet or hands along with him
This is why we say that the body is notself
It belongs to the world
As for the mind it's the one that does good and evil and will be reborn in line with its karma
The mind is what doesn't die
It's the one that experiences all pleasure and pain
So when you realize this you should do as much good as you can for your own sake
The Buddha felt compassion for us and taught us in this way but we don't feel much compassion for ourselves
We prefer to fill ourselves with suffering
When other people teach us it's no match for our teaching ourselves for other people will teach us only once in a while
The possibility of being a common animal a human being a heavenly being or of entering nibbana all lie within us so we have to choose which one we want
The good you do is what will go with you in the future
This is why the Buddha taught us to meditate to contemplate the body to give rise to dispassion
It's inconstant stressful and nothing of ours
You borrow it for a while and then have to return it
The body doesn't belong to the mind and the mind doesn't belong to the body
They're separate things that depend on each other
When you can see this you have no more worries or attachments
You can let go of the body and three hunks of rust  selfidentity views attachments to precepts and practices and uncertainty in the Path  will fall away from your heart
You'll see that all good and evil come from the heart
If the heart is pure that's the highest good in the world
When you meditate you have to be mindful of three things at once
In other words as you breathe in and out three things  the breath the meditation word and the mind  have to stay together with every moment
At the same time alertness always has to be in charge
Only then can you say that you're established in the factors of meditation lying at the essence of what's meritorious and skillful
Mindfulness  heedfulness  counts as what's meritorious here
Forgetfulness  heedlessness  counts as evil
Alertness is what surveys the results of our activities  seeing what we do that gives good results what we do that gives bad  and then makes adjustments
For example if the breath isn't yet comfortable we move the mind to a new spot or change the way we're breathing
It's like changing the place where we sit
If where we're sitting isn't comfortable we have to get up and find a new place to sit down
Once we've found a comfortable place to sit we have to keep it going as long as we can
We don't have to change seats any more
When mindfulness stays with the breath it's called anapanasati
When it's immersed in the body it's called kayagatasati
When mindfulness stays with the body and mind at all times it's called developing our meditation theme  as when we sit here meditating we're doing our work ie our work on our meditation theme
Mindfulness is the cause
If we focus our attention on working with the mind we'll get lots of results on the level of the mind
If we focus on working with the body we'll get lots of results on the level of the body
The results that come from developing our meditation theme are we calm down the evil qualities of the mind and we calm down the physical properties of the body
The mind will be wide open and free like the ocean when it's free of waves the wind is still the water smooth and the air is clear
When this is the case we can see all kinds of far distant things
This way we get to know the affairs of the body
On the lowest level we come to know the body in the present we understand what's going on with the properties of earth water fire and wind both in their important parts and in their unimportant parts
The important parts are the ones that stay in the body the unimportant parts are the ones that come and go forming a bridge between the properties inside the body and those outside
In terms of the wind property we'll see how many types of breath energy stay in the body and how many types of breath come in and out
We'll see which parts of the earth water fire and space properties stay in the body and which parts come and go
The same holds true with the property of consciousness
For instance when our eyes don't see clearly what's wrong with the property of eyeconsciousness
We'll be able to see all the ways in which it changes as well as all the changes in the properties of ear nose tongue body and intellectconsciousness
We'll have mindfulness and alertness constantly in charge
Mindfulness and alertness are like binoculars for seeing great distances
The mind is like the binoculars' owner
If the properties in the body aren't at normalcy if they aren't smooth and calm then no matter how fantastic our binoculars we won't be able to see anything
For example when the Buddha surveyed the beings of the world he'd wait until the world was quiet and still  the last watch of the night before dawn when the minds of human beings were quiet still and asleep
That's when he'd use his special binoculars to survey all that was going on in the world
When the mind is calm it's like an ocean that's calm the wind is still the boat isn't rocking the water is clear and the air wide open
As we keep training the mind it keeps getting more and more mature more tempered and sharp able to cut right through anything at all
Like a knife that we always keep sharpening there's no way it can't become sharp
So we should keep at the practice in the same way we sharpen a knife
If any part of the body or mind isn't in good shape we keep adjusting it until we get good results
When good results arise we'll be in a state of Right Concentration
The mind will be firmly established in the present in a state of singleness of preoccupation
We'll gain power both in body and in mind
Power in body means that wherever there are pains we can adjust the properties of earth water fire and wind to give rise to a sense of comfort in the same way we trim a tree
If any branches are broken or rotten we cut them away and graft on new branches
If the new ones break we graft on more new ones
We keep doing this until the tree is healthy and strong
When we work at the mind in this way the four bases for success arise in full strength
And as the Buddha said whoever develops the bases for success will live long
In other words
viriya we stick with our work and don't get discouraged or give up
citta we focus our full attention on nothing but our work
vimansa we're circumspect in the mind circumspect in the causes and results of what we're doing
All four of these qualities are bases or steps to the Path
They're the cause for developing power in body and power in mind all the way to the knowledge of the ending of mental fermentations and on into nibbana
What I've said so far is meant to give us all a sense of how to develop mindfulness and alertness as our own special binoculars for surveying events in terms of the world and of the Dhamma
So you should train your mind to stay firm and upright in the factors of your meditation riding herd on it so that it will stay with the body in the present
Regardless of how much you can remember of what I've said you should set your mind on practicing at all times
Don't abandon the practice or do it in fits and starts for that will prevent you from reaching any kind of success
Think of yourself as a supervisor constantly keeping an eye on the body and mind
When you do this your workers  the properties of earth water fire and wind  won't dare shirk their jobs or be slack in their work
Each will have to fulfill its responsibilities to the full
In this way you'll come to succeed in your work in every way
At the same time once you've developed your special binoculars your eyesight will go further than that of ordinary people
In this way you'll be able to keep yourself protected on all sides
You'll escape from dangers and meet with happiness and fulfillment in every way
The currents of the heart are fast erratic and don't take on any shape that can appear to the eye
The currents of sound and smell can be measured in terms of numbers  etc
 but the currents of the mind can't be measured at all
And it's the nature of fast things that they be subtle as well
That's why the currents of the mind are impossible for anyone who's not really interested in researching them to see
Some people even maintain that there is no mind in any individual that all we have is a body like trees
When we die there's nothing left nothing to take rebirth
There's only the properties of earth water wind and fire
It's the nature of really fastmoving things that we can't see them  what they are what their shape or characteristics are
For example when we ride in a car or a boat passing another one coming in the opposite direction at top speed we can't see the faces of the people riding in the other car or boat well enough to recognize who they are
Or suppose that two people run past each other at high speed
They won't be able to see each other's faces
Some birds fly through the air so quickly that we can't even see them
All we can hear is the whoosh going past in the air
The currents of the mind that flash out of the body are the same sort of thing
The Buddha discovered that the human mind is something powerful  stronger and more numinous than anything else there is
But because the mind spins so fast we can't see it
If we want to see it we have to get it to spin more slowly
As it spins more and more slowly we can get it to stop
When it stops we'll realize that the mind is something true something that doesn't die
At the same time it's cool
When it hasn't yet stopped it's hot
The heat comes from the spinning
When it spins really fast it can generate the electricity of passion aversion and delusion
As we generate these three kinds of electricity within ourselves the mind will go running out the six wires  the nerves of the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind
If any of these wires get shorted they can set our home our town on fire
When these currents flare up in the mind they can wear out the nerves of our eyes ears nose tongue and body so that they start sending us the wrong information and make us misunderstand things
If we go around with exposed wires and meet up with someone else whose wires are exposed we're going to get shorted and both of us will be devastated
It's bad enough that both of us are generating electricity to make things worse we go ahead and put our hands right on each other's exposed wires
When this happens we'll get electrocuted
The danger of exposed wires is that their current sucks us in
When we connect the heat builds up and explodes into fire
The spinning of the mind builds up heat in the properties of the body and when the properties get unbalanced like this they can give rise to pain and illness
When the mind spins in this way it darkens everything
Our eyes ears etc get darkened so that they can't see the truth of sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas
This is why the Buddha teaches us to give rise to stillness by developing the ballast of skillful and meritorious actions
And what acts as ballast for the mind
We're taught to create ballast for the mind by looking for three big hunks of rock generosity making donations of material things virtue keeping our words and deeds at normalcy and meditation training the mind
If the mind isn't slowed down by the weights of what's skillful and meritorious there's no way it can get relief from the heat of its fires
Sometimes evil pulls it in one direction while goodness pulls it in another
Goodness is like the positive current evil like the negative current
The mind alternates between good and evil looking for good only from time to time but it doesn't find any real peace and quiet
Still it's beginning to see things a little more clearly as when a car begins to slow down but hasn't yet stopped
So we have to find four other ways to slow the mind down
In other words we have to make sure that our thoughts words and deeds don't fall under the four kinds of bias bias based on desire based on aversion based on delusion and based on fear
We have to be fair and gentle with other people harming neither ourselves nor others
This helps our mind spin even more slowly
If it spins forward it has four blockades in the way
If it spins back it has three rocks weighing it down
We need principles in how we sit stand walk lie down speak act
These are the mainstays of the mind in developing tranquillity and insight
This is what's meant by meditation
The mind is like a machine
When the machine stops we can safely touch all its belts and gears
The belts here are its various concepts and perceptions
In other words perceptions of past and future spin back and forth which is why the mind can't find any coolness
As it keeps spinning it develops heat
If it spins really fast it'll set on fire burning itself and spreading out to burn other people as well
This is why we're taught to stop the spinning by cutting the belts
In other words we practice tranquillity meditation not allowing the mind to spin along after the currents of the world
Whatever activity you're involved in keep the mind fully involved in what you're doing
This is like water in the ocean when it's full of waves if we take a bowlful of water and set it apart until the waves grow still or if we clarify the water with an alum crystal we can look into the water and see our reflection clearly
Our face is something that normally we never see
Even though we use our mouth to speak day in and day out we've never seen what shape it is
Even though we breathe through our nose with every moment we've never seen it
Our ears hear sounds all day long but we've never seen what they look like
Our eyes can see all kinds of things but they can't see themselves
This is why we have to depend on mirrors to see our reflections
Only then can we see our face
When people have discernment it's as if they have a large mirror for looking at themselves because discernment is the clear knowing that comes from a mind bright clean and pure free from spinning free from waves
When the mind stops spinning it comes to stillness
This stillness is what gives rise to the discernment that develops into cognitive skills within us  the three skills and the eight such as recollection of former lives which enables us to see ourselves knowledge of the passing away and arising of living beings  once we've seen enough of ourselves we can see other people and knowledge of the ending of mental fermentations we can see what's good what's evil what should be abandoned what should be developed what takes birth and dies what doesn't take birth and doesn't die
When these skills arise within us we will thoroughly comprehend our own bodies and minds as well as fabricated things in general
The three fires of passion aversion and delusion will stay separated far from the heart
The heart stops spinning and when there's no more spinning the fire and electricity stop leaving nothing but coolness and ease
This is why we're taught to find ballast and blockades for the mind so that it will spin more and more slowly more and more slowly until it stops for the sake of the coolness ease and peace I've mentioned here
Restraint of the senses means making sure they're in harmony with their objects
In other words
Cakkhusamvaro Exercise restraint over the eyes
Don't let your eyes be bigger than their visual objects and don't let the visual objects be bigger than your eyes
An example of small eyes and big objects is when you see something and the heart latches onto it for days on end
This is called not being straightforward in your practice because you've let the visual object get bigger than your eyes
As for big eyes and small objects that's when you can't see enough of an object
When it disappears you want to see it again and again
You can't let go of it
This is called eyes bigger than their objects
This is what gives rise to greed
When objects are bigger than your eyes that also gives rise to greed and delusion
Anyone who doesn't know how to exercise restraint over the eyes gives rise to the three fires of passion aversion and delusion which burn the eyes and give rise to suffering
Sotasamvaro Exercise restraint over your ears and their sounds so that they're the right size for each other
Sometimes your ears are bigger than the sounds they hear sometimes the sounds are bigger than the ears
For example someone says something and you take it to think about for many days
That's a case of the sound being bigger than the ears
This gives rise to liking or disliking
The fires of passion aversion and delusion burn the ears of people like this for they haven't watched out for evil and so evil can come flowing into their hearts
Ghanasamvaro Exercise restraint over the nose and smells
If a smell smells good don't fall for it
If it smells bad and you can't stand it get away from it
Don't hate it
If you contemplate the nose and its smells you'll see that sometimes a smell is bigger than the nose ie one whiff and it gets stuck in the heart for many days months and years
The smell may have been over and gone for many days months and years but the nose hasn't gotten over it
Passion and aversion get provoked and then delusion goes running after the smell
This is called not exercising restraint over the nose
Jivhasamvaro means restraint over the tongue and flavors
If the food you get is edible don't go struggling to look for things to make it more special than it already is
If you like it eat your fill
If you don't like it eat just a little
Choose foods that benefit the body
Otherwise you'll suffer
Don't follow your taste buds
Sometimes the flavors are bigger than the tongue
You sit thinking about eating chicken or duck pork or fish and so you go looking for them
When you get them your tongue shrivels up and you can hardly eat them at all
This is called not having a sense of enough not exercising restraint
In addition to eating the tongue plays a role in speaking
Sometimes the tongue grows large what you say goes way beyond the truth
You speak without stopping and it's all nonsense
Other times the topic is big but the tongue grows small there's a lot to be explained but you hem and haw so that no one can understand the truth
This is called not exercising restraint so that the tongue is the same size as its topics and it's one way of bringing on suffering
Kayasamvaro means restraint over the body and tactile sensations
Sometimes they feel comfortable together sometimes they don't
In other words the place where you're staying may be big but the body is small
Sometimes the place is small but the body feels big
They don't go together
The tactile sensations that touch the body don't fit
Sometimes the body is small but the sensations are big
For example you come across a sensation you like
Then even when it's vanished for many days you still miss it
Sometimes the body is big but the sensations are small
For example you don't feel comfortable wherever you sit or lie down for the whole world seems narrow and confining
That's called not exercising restraint to keep the body and its tactile sensations in line with each other
And that gives rise to suffering
Manosamvaro Exercise restraint over the heart to keep it on the right path in line with things as they arise
Sometimes your thoughts are bigger than the mind you worry and stew about something going way beyond the truth of the situation
This leads to misunderstandings making the mind restless and anxious
Sometimes the mind is bigger than your thoughts you take a minor problem and turn it into four or five big ones
In other words you don't exercise restraint over the heart to keep it in line with your situation  what they call harvesting grass to roof the field This leads to useless distraction which opens the way for greed anger and delusion
This is why we're taught to exercise careful restraint over the heart to bring it to peace and calm
That's what's meant by restraint of the senses
The dangers faced by the mind are like poisonous snakes fires and great thieves  things that are always lying in wait to lay us to waste robbing us killing us and stripping us of our valuables our human goodness every day and night
Poisonous snakes here stand for passion aversion and delusion which have a painful poison that seeps into the minds of runofthemill people
When it reaches the heart this poison can kill you
As for fires there are two kinds forest fires and house fires
A forest fire doesn't have any one owner
It arises of its own accord by its nature and spreads its destruction far and wide without bounds until it dies out on its own
This stands for the fires of birth aging illness and death forms of suffering that arise in the bodies of all living beings
This fire can burn up both our worldly treasures and our noble treasures
As for house fires those are the fires that arise from within the heart  defilements ignorance craving and clinging  the hindrances that get in the way of the goodness that comes from training the heart and mind
The great thieves or  most wanted criminals stand for our five aggregates form feeling perception thoughtconstructs and consciousness which are constantly robbing us killing us and oppressing us destroying both our worldly treasures and our noble ones
In addition there are the underground criminals that keep sneaking up on us without our realizing it material gain status praise and pleasure from external things
Whoever gets duped by these criminals finds it hard to work free
This is why they can destroy the goodness that we'd otherwise be able to attain in the area of the heart and mind
All of these poisonous snakes fires and criminals pose a tremendous danger to the heart
They keep destroying our goodness every moment
If we're not wise to them we'll have trouble gaining release from them
The only way to prevent these dangers is through the power of the Dhamma in other words the practice of meditation using our powers of directed thought and evaluation within ourselves to the point where we give rise to the discernment that clearly knows and sees the truth of all fabricated things
When we can see the dangers on all sides we'll learn to be careful and on our guard to look for ways of destroying them or of escaping from them
When we can do this our lives will be happy
When we practice the Dhamma it's as if we were going through a lonely desolate forest on the way to a goal that's the highest form of happiness and safety
To get through the forest we have to depend on the practice of concentration with our mindfulness circumspect on all sides
We can't be heedless or complacent
We must make the effort to cut away all the concepts and preoccupations that come in to destroy the goodness of the mind
When we know that there are poisonous snakes fires and the most wanted criminals lying in wait for us along our way we have to be mindful alert and wakeful at all times and to get good weapons ready so that we can fight them off
At the same time we need provisions to help us on our way  in other words the factors of jhana
Directed thought is what focuses the mind on what it wants to know
Evaluation is what kills off the Hindrances
These two qualities are like fixing dinner
But if we have only these two qualities it's as if we've prepared our dinner but don't yet know the flavor of the different kinds of food we have
If we can still the mind until it's one with its object that's like eating and swallowing our food
That's when we'll know its flavor and be able to gain a sense of fullness and nourishment from it in other words a sense of rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
The heart will then be able to gain full strength just like the body when it's had a nourishing meal
Outer food is what nourishes the body and gives it strength
When the body has strength we can walk or run anywhere we want
Whatever we want to do we'll have the strength to succeed
As for inner food  the Dhamma  that's what nourishes the heart and mind
When the heart and mind are well nourished the power of the heart is made resilient and strong
Whatever we set our mind on will succeed in line with our thoughts
If the mind is deprived of the food of the Dhamma it gets feeble and weak
Its thoughts meet with no success or at best with success in some things and not in others not fully in line with our hopes
That's why we have to shore up the strength of our own minds as much as we can for the strength of the mind is the most important thing within us that will take us to our goal of the highest happiness
As long as you're still alive and breathing don't let yourself be heedless or complacent
Don't let time pass you by to no purpose
Hurry up and accelerate your efforts at developing goodness  for when there's no more breath for you to breathe you'll have no more opportunity to do good
You should focus exclusively on whatever thoughts help make the mind firm so that it can give rise to goodness
Don't dally with any other kinds of thinking regardless of whether they seem more sophisticated or less
Shake them all off
Don't bring them into the mind to think about
Keep the mind firmly set in a single preoccupation that's your true heart the true heart of the Buddha's teachings
Those of us who are training our hearts and minds in hopes of the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana if we don't study to understand the fundamental principles of the world are likely to wander off the path
Or else we'll keeping circling around without ever reaching our goal
So if we really want to put an end to suffering we should ask ourselves what do we have within us that can act as a true refuge for ourselves
This is the sort of question we should keep reflecting on all the time
As we chant every day Svakkhato bhagavata dhammo sanditthiko akaliko  The Dhamma wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now is timeless In other words if we want to reach it we'll be able to reach it
If we don't want to reach it we won't
But whether or not we'll reach it depends on underlying causes which come in two sorts an enduring principle and supporting principles
The enduring principle called dhammathiti is what stays unmoving by its nature
The supporting principles are our training and education which can be either good or bad
This is why our practice sways back and forth like a tree in the middle of an open field swaying back and forth in the wind
If we don't discover the enduring principle within us we won't be able to find anything to act as a true refuge  for our training and education are simply supporting factors
This is why we should keep asking ourselves Have we found any principle within ourselves that can act as our refuge As long as we're still depending on other people other things we don't have a true refuge
Our training and education are nothing more than supporting factors  like the fertilizer we give to plants
When the fertilizer runs out the plant will have to fall to the ground and decompose
The same holds true for the Buddha when his body ran out of strength it turned into the four elements
The Dhamma when it no longer has any power turns into nothing but letters on paper or palm leaves which then disintegrate
As for the Sangha when they run out of strength they die
So the refuge we take in these things is nothing more than a snack or finger food but people for the most part misunderstand them to be our true refuge
They think that the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha will carry or drag them to heaven or nibbana
From one angle this is right but from another it's wrong
It's right in the sense that the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha keep alive the tradition of goodness that we can hold onto and follow
It's wrong though in the sense that they aren't the things that will make us reach the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
Reaching nibbana depends on our own actions our practice
So we have to ask ourselves What do we want in life If we really want something we're sure to succeed at it in every way
But the fact that we don't succeed comes from ourselves
If we want to be millionaires we'll have to become millionaires
If we want to be beggars we'll have to become beggars
Success and lack of success come from within ourselves  in other words from the causal factors lying within the limits of our own goodness
If we practice correctly we're sure to succeed
It all depends on the enduring principles in the world together with the supporting factors that point us in the right direction
The supporting factors are the teachings formulated by wise people and sages
The enduring principles  dhammathiti  come from the principles of nature
To reach the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana requires dhammathiti
Take our Buddha or the Private Buddhas as an example when they were born there was no Buddha to teach them
But they had met up with sages and Buddhas in previous lives so they were born with character traits that spurred them on to be highminded to see the drawbacks of the world so crowded with defilement and craving with birth aging illness and death
Disenchanted they aspired to gain release from all this suffering  for as long as we human beings are subject to birth and death then even if we had wings to fly we still wouldn't escape from our suffering
But if we're free from birth and death then even if we have to crawl on all fours in the dirt we won't feel any suffering
This is why the Buddha left the householder life and went off into the wilderness to be alone developing virtue concentration and discernment until he attained full Buddhahood
Once he had attained his goal he had another character trait  his great compassion  that inspired him to teach the Dhamma to his relatives and to living beings in general so that they could gain release from suffering as well
Practicing virtue is called compassion in terms of one's actions
This is followed by compassion in terms of one's speech and thoughts
When the Buddha expressed this sort of compassion people responded to him in kind they loved him respected him and were willing to grant him power
The Buddha's compassion expressed itself in two ways for the well being of the world and the well being of his relatives
In terms of the world the Buddha spread his good will and compassion to beings all over the world without showing any partiality for any group or individual at all
As for the well being of his relatives like everyone else he had parents grandparents and siblings and these people in turn had children grandchildren and inlaws
The Buddha's compassion spread out along all of these connections expressed in terms of compassionate actions compassionate words and compassionate thoughts
This compassion spread out from a heart that had found its own dependable refuge within
This was why he was able to spread his compassion so that others could depend on him as well
It's the nature of the heart that when it can depend on itself its goodness gradually spreads out of its own accord
If there's any kind of connection  whether people are relatives or not  it spreads out along those connections
It spreads out in terms of words when you can teach and instruct others
In terms of thoughts there's no anger hatred or jealousy
There's simply the willingness to sacrifice for others
When there were ways the Buddha could help others with his thoughts he spread those thoughts at all times
He had seen that the lay life wasn't convenient for spreading goodness so far and wide which was why he became a monk
He had seen that being a member of the noble warrior class involved both good and evil for it's the nature of the world that people are proud of their birth their race their class which divides us into factions and creates inequalities
When divisions like this arise in the world it's difficult to spread goodness
That was why he left his relatives cutting himself off from his class and race
And this is why when a new monk is being ordained the announcing teacher asks him Have your mother and father given their permission and the candidate answers Yes He has left the limitations of the worldly life and now doesn't belong to any family at all
Then once he's ordained he's taught not to go hanging around with his old family
So when the Buddha left home he went off on his own to find the truth of the Dhamma
Regardless of whether he was to get teachings from others he explored within himself without depending on his old wealth or family connections
He gave himself totally to the practice
At first he had studied with the Six Teachers but they were unable to convince him of their teachings
The first teacher was Teacher Eye
This teacher fools us in all sorts of ways
It tells us that this sight is beautiful that sight is ugly this sight is good that sight is bad
It whispers to the heart causing us to trip and fall because we don't see things in terms of their basic principles  that all sights are the same
Whether they're birds rats people animals trees vines whatever they differ only in terms of their features
Their basic condition is the same they arise decay and then disappear in line with the principles of nature
The second teacher was Teacher Ear
At first there are two of these teachers but then they turn into four which gets things even more confusing
In other words the left ear hears good sounds and bad sounds the right ear hears good sounds and bad sounds all of which gives rise to distorted perceptions
We imagine good things to be bad and bad things to be good true things to be false and false things to be true
So Teacher Ear is another teacher who fools us
The Buddha thus left both Teacher Eye and Teacher Ear to study with
Teacher Nose
At first this teacher has two nostrils but then they split into four
Sometimes it likes good smells sometimes it doesn't like good smells and likes bad smells instead
Then it goes whispering to the heart to make it misunderstand things
If we could take a photo of the mind we'd see that the eyes are big and bulging the ears are set out like huge sails while the nose is wide wide open
When the Buddha saw that he had no use for these three teachers he went on to study with
Teacher Tongue
This teacher  the mouth  is even more of a turmoil
If it were part of the army it'd be called a multitask force
On the one hand it eats food on the other it says all kinds of things
Sometimes it likes to say good things sometimes bad things
Sometimes it doesn't like to say good things and prefers to say bad things instead
One little tongue but it too splits into four
When it's not speaking it eats
Sometimes that person gets to eat this person doesn't get to eat
This person has only a little to eat that person starves while that person over there has more than enough to eat
The dangers that come from these affairs block the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
So the Buddha moved on to study with the fifth teacher
Teacher Body
This teacher is made up of the six elements but as soon as the elements get unbalanced it gets feverish or chilled weak or stiff
As it meets up with friction it wears out
As for the sixth teacher that's
Teacher Mind
This teacher thinks and worries deluding itself in all sorts of ways
Suppose for instance that we're leaving the house to come to the monastery
As soon as we've left the door it starts deceiving us What a pain
It's so far to walk
A waste of time
The sun is hot When we get to the monastery and start sitting in meditation it starts deceiving us again We've been sitting too long
I'm tired
My legs hurt
They're numb
My back is stiff Then it squeezes our legs squeezes our arms beats our back pokes our stomach giving us heartburn or a stomachache
When we're whipped and beaten like this we eventually give in
Sometimes it comes whispering Why don't you stop
Time's almost up
Open your eyes So we leave meditation raise our hands in respect and bow down to the Buddha
And that's it
If we're weak by nature we fall for it
This is why the Buddha left all of these six teachers closed his eyes closed his ears nose tongue body and mind not letting his heart go running after sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations or ideas
He closed off his senses to escape from these things leaving only the door of the mind which he focused on goodness
When this was the case he didn't concern himself with any of the senses
He went to sit crosslegged under the Bodhi tree on the full moon day in May and gave rise to discernment within himself
He gathered all his thoughts so that they were right and didn't let them associate with anything outside of the Dhamma
He began meditating cutting off all connection to the past and future cutting all connection to the nerves of the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind
He focused on the breath making it more and more refined to the point where the condition of the body disappeared leaving just the qualities of the six elements seeing for example how the breath actually moves how it stops
This is called buddhavijja the skill of the awakened ones
This skill sees things in terms not of their characteristics but in terms of their basic qualities
Inconstancy is a characteristic
Stress and notself  burdensomeness what can't be controlled  are all characteristics
Basic qualities though are neutral and constant
Inconstancy is on the level of characteristics
To make an analogy the mouth can't turn into the nose
That's an affair of basic qualities
If things could change like that we wouldn't be able to live
For example if tonight our ears changed into eyes or our leg became an arm or our nose became a mouth if this happened everything would break out into chaos
If we see things only in terms of their characteristics that's the knowledge of the six teachers
Changeoflineage knowledge though sees from both sides both as characteristics and as basic qualities
To make another analogy our leg ever since we were two has been a leg
It'll still be a leg when we're in line with it's basic quality
This is constancy
Whatever it's been that's what it'll continue to be until we die
Whoever doesn't see through to basic qualities like this will get dragged off by the six teachers
This is why the Buddha left the six teachers to study the skill of the awakened ones to see both what it is that changes and what it is that doesn't
Whoever sees both sides  the side of inconstancy and the side of constancy  without getting stuck on either side that's changeoflineage knowledge knowing the principles of the world and the basic quality of the Dhamma
This is why the Buddha taught Sabbe sankhara anicca sabbe dhamma anatta All conditioned things are inconstant all phenomena are notself Regardless of whether people might say constant or inconstant stress or bliss There is a self or There is no self the Buddha could remain unswayed
This is called Attahi attano natho Those who can give rise to this knowledge and skill within themselves can truly depend on themselves
They're not attached to knowledge of the past knowledge of the future knowledge of the present
They're not stuck on any dimension of time at all
They can let go of conventions formulated teachings formulated ultimate truths
They can let go within themselves alone know within themselves alone
This is called truly depending on yourself
When you reach this point your training for the sake of the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana will have to succeed in line with your aims
There won't be any wandering astray
And that's enough for now
Now I'm going to remind you of some of the Buddha's teachings as a way of encouraging you to be intent on practicing correctly in line with the Buddha's instructions
These teachings are called Dhamma
The Dhamma is an ornament for the mind
It's also a means for developing the faculties of the mind
The teachings I'm about to discuss come in the OvadaPatimokkha the Patimokkha Exhortation
This is a talk that deals with the duties of those who have ordained in line with the Buddha's instructions but these practices also apply to lay people as well
Lay people can take these practices and train themselves to be good people so that they can be eyes and ears legs feet and hands to help look after the work of the religion and to help it prosper
These guidelines which apply to all of us fall under six headings
The first guideline anupavado
Don't go finding fault with one another
In other words don't say evil things about one another don't misrepresent one another don't say anything that will cause people to fall apart from one another
Don't start false reports about one another and don't encourage them
Don't curse or yell at one another
Instead of finding fault with one another each of us should look at his or her own faults
This is what's meant by anupavado
You can use this principle anywhere whether you're ordained or not
Anupaghato Don't allow yourself to hate one another
It's only normal that when people live together their behavior isn't going to be on an equal level
Some people have good manners some people have coarse manners  not evil mind you just that their manners are coarse
Physically some people are energetic industrious and strong others are weak and sickly
Verbally some people are skilled at speaking others are not
Some people talk a lot some people hardly talk at all some people like to talk about worldly things some people like to talk about the Dhamma some people speak wrong some people speak right
This is called inequality
When this is the case there are bound to be conflicts and clashes at least to some extent
When these things arise among us while we live together within the boundaries of the same Dhamma we shouldn't hold grudges
We should forgive one another and wash away that stain from our hearts
Why
Because otherwise it turns into animosity and enmity
The act of forgiving is called the gift of forgiveness
It turns you into the sort of person who doesn't hold onto things doesn't carry things around doesn't get caught up on things  the sort of person who doesn't bear grudges
Even when there are missteps or mistakes from time to time we should forgive one another
We should have a sense of love affection and kindness for everyone around us as much as we can
This is called anupaghato
It's a part of our training as Buddhists both for householders and for contemplatives
Patimokkhe ca samvaro Act in a way that keeps you near the entrance to nibbana
What's the entrance to nibbana
The Patimokkha
Mukha means mouth or entrance
Mokkha means liberation
Sit close to your food so that your mouth is near liberation
Don't sit far away or you'll have trouble eating
Sit close enough so that liberation is within reach and you can stick it right in your mouth
In other words whatever behavior is near the ways of the religion that's the behavior you should follow
To be near the religion means following the holy life
Lay people have their holy life too you know just as monks have theirs
Lay people follow the holy life in two ways
The first is observing the first five of the eight precepts no killing no stealing no sex  this is what makes it the holy life no telling lies and no intoxicants
This is one form of holy life near the entrance to nibbana
The second way for lay people to follow the holy life is by observing all eight precepts
As for novices and monks they should maintain restraint in line with the ten or precepts
At the same time they shouldn't omit any of the good types of behavior that they should follow
This is called acaragocarasampanno
Don't go wandering around in areas that are out of bounds and can harm you
In other words don't let your body go there don't let your speech dwell on those places and don't let your mind go there either
Don't associate with immoral people who are coarse in their habits
Don't ask advice from unvirtuous people
Don't let your mind get entangled with them
Try to keep in mind people who are good together with the goodness that you yourself are trying to develop
This is called the holy life
Whoever behaves in this way is said to be restrained in line with the Patimokkha right next to nibbana
Mattaññuta ca bhattasmim Have a sense of moderation in the food you eat
Here I'll talk about physical food
People eat in three ways and the first is eating greedily
Even though the stomach is full the mind isn't full
The mouth is full you can't swallow what you've got the stomach is full and yet the mind still wants to eat more
This is called eating greedily
Don't let this greed take charge of the heart
The second type is eating contentedly
You're content with what you have in your alms bowl and don't eat anything outside your bowl
Or you're content with the food within reach
You don't ask for anything out of reach
You don't give any sign with your hand your eyes or your expression that you'd like more to eat
You eat only what's on your plate what's in your bowl
This is called eating contentedly
The third type is eating modestly
This type of eating is very good both in terms of the world and of the Dhamma
Take Ven
Sivali as an example
He ate modestly
How did he eat modestly
All that most of us know about Ven
Sivali is that he was wealthy in terms of the donations he received
But where did that wealth come from
It comes from eating modestly
Eating modestly is the source that gives rise to wealth
What Ven
Sivali did was this whenever he received cloth if he didn't then give a gift of cloth he wouldn't wear what he had received
When he received food in his bowl he wouldn't eat until he had given some of it as a gift to someone else
No matter which of the four requisites he received  food clothing shelter or medicine no matter how much or how little  once it was in his possession he wouldn't use it until he had shared some of it with those around him
When he received a lot he would make a large gift to benefit many people
When he received just a little he'd still try to benefit others
This gave rise to all sorts of good things
His friends loved him his community loved him and they were kind to him
This is why being generous is said to tie the knot of friendship and to wipe out your enemies
So that's what Ven
Sivali did
When he passed away from that lifetime and was reborn in his last lifetime he gained all kinds of wealth and never had to go hungry
Even when he went to live in places where food should have been scarce he never suffered from scarcity never had to do without
What this means for us is that whatever we get we eat only a third and give the other two thirds away
The parts appropriate for animals we give to animals
The parts appropriate for human beings we give to human beings
The parts we should share with our fellows in the holy life we give with a clear heart
This is what it means to be modest in our consumption
We feel ease of heart and ease of body
When we die we won't be poor
This principle is something very good not only in terms of the religion but also in terms of the modern world at large
It's a great means for subduing terrorism
How does it subdue terrorism
When people aren't poor they don't get stirred up
Where does terrorism come from
It comes from people having nowhere to live nothing to eat no one to look after them
When they're poor and starving like this they think As long as I'm suffering let's have everyone else suffer all the same
Don't let there be any private property
Let everything be owned in common This kind of thinking comes from poverty and deprivation
And why is there poverty
Because some people eat all alone
They don't share with people at large
Then when people at large suffer and feel revenge they turn into communists and terrorists
So terrorism comes from greed and selfishness from not sharing what we've got
If we get ten baht we can give away nine and eat what we can get for the one baht remaining
That way we'll have lots of friends
There will be love and affection peace and prosperity
How can that come about
When people have places to live and food to eat when they can eat their fill and can sleep when they lie down why would they want to bother their heads with the confusion of politics
This is why the Buddha taught us that modesty in our consumption is something good something noble and outstanding
When we practice in this way we're in line with the phrase mattaññuta ca bhattasmim
We'll be practicing right practicing properly for the benefit of ourselves and others
Pantañca sayanasanam Don't be a busybody
Wherever you live try to be quiet and at peace
Don't get entangled or play the gongs with the other members of the group
Don't get involved in issues unless it really can't be helped
When you've studied and understand your duties look for quiet solitary places to live and to meditate
When you live with others look for quiet groups to live with
When you live alone in physical seclusion be a quiet person
Even when you live with the group be a secluded person
Take only the good peaceful things the group has to offer
When you live alone don't get involved in a lot of activity
Be quiet in your actions quiet in your speech quiet in your mind
When you live in a group  either two or three people  don't get involved in quarrels for when there's quarreling there's no peace
Your actions aren't peaceful for you have to get up and storm around
Your words aren't peaceful
Your mind  with its thoughts of anger revenge and ill will  isn't peaceful
And this gives rise to all sorts of bad karma
When you live in a community  anywhere from four on up to  you have to make sure that the community is at peace that there's no conflict no quarreling no hurting one another's feelings or doing one another harm
The community should be a cooperative for training peacefully in virtue and the Dhamma
That's when it's a good community orderly and civilized fostering progress for all its members
This is one of our duties as part of the Buddha's following in line with the Buddha's instructions
It's called patañca sayanasanam creating a quiet place to live at your ease in both body and mind
Adhicitte ca ayogo Don't be complacent
Be diligent in practicing concentration to the level of adhicitta or the heightened mind
Practice concentration frequently sit in concentration frequently as an example to the rest of the community
When you talk seek advice in how to develop your meditation theme
Discuss the rewards of concentration
Practice ridding the heart of its hindrances
When you do this you're acting in line with the principle of heightened mind
Another level of heightened mind is when the mind has been freed from its hindrances and has entered concentration without any ups or downs
It's solid stalwart and strong with nothing defiling it
This is called adhicitte ca ayogo commitment to the heightened mind
So don't be complacent
Keep working at this always
Etam buddhanasasanam When you do this you're acting in line with the Buddhas' instructions
These are the Buddha's words straight from his mouth
So we should all work at giving rise to these principles within ourselves
If you establish yourself in these teachings in all honesty and integrity then even if you can't liberate your mind totally from suffering at the very least you'll be developing yourself in the right direction
Your bad habits will disappear day by day and the good habits you've never had before will arise in their place
As for the good habits you already have they'll prosper and flourish
So now that you've listened to this take it and put it into practice
Train yourself to behave in line with the Buddha's exhortation
When you do that you'll meet with happiness and prosperity as you flourish in line with his instructions
During my second year as a monk I was invited to give a Dhamma talk to the woman  whom I knew only as Aunty  who had raised the woman who had sponsored my ordination
Aunty had suddenly fallen ill and her relatives were sure that she didn't have much longer to live
In her time she had known many of the great masters of the forest tradition so rather than give her a talk of my own I decided to read her some by Ajaan Lee
When I finished she asked Whose talks were those
Ajaan Lee's I told her
That's what I thought she replied
Nobody could give a Dhamma talk as beautifully as he
I've often thought of her comment since then and in particular of what she meant by beautiful
For most Thais of her day a beautiful talk was one that made use of formal courtly language with heavy literary embellishments often saying as little as possible with a maximum number of words
That however was not Ajaan Lee's style
What I think Aunty meant was a different kind of beauty a directness and clarity of expression with imaginative similes and metaphors
Ajaan Lee was skilled at making obscure points of Dhamma clear and more familiar teachings memorable
Although he had a poet's sense of how to play with words the beauty of his talks was more a natural beauty of the mind than of studied verbal effects
In this book which is drawn from Ajaan Lee's collected talks this is the kind of beauty I have kept in mind in selecting the passages for translation
Only in the last year of his life were any of Ajaan Lee's talks taperecorded
We owe our records of his earlier talks to a handful of followers who took notes while he spoke a nun Arun Abhivanna a monk Phra Bunkuu Anuvaddhano and a lay woman Thao Satyanurak who included some of Ajaan Lee's talks in her diary which was published after her death
In compiling this book I have drawn on notes made by all three
Of the three Arun Abhivanna was by far the most prolific
For years she took notes of Ajaan Lee's talks  sometimes simply jotting down catchy phrases other times reconstructing entire talks
Her notes  together with those by Phra Bunkuu and transcripts of the recorded talks  have more recently been collected in two large volumes
Because of their haphazard arrangement the collections are hard to read straight through but they are excellent companions for meditators who simply want to open to a passage at random read enough to throw light on their problems and then return to the practice
Ajaan Lee was unique among the forest masters in leaving behind systematic guides to meditation and Buddhist practice in general books like Keeping the Breath in Mind The Craft of the Heart Frames of Reference and Basic Themes
Anyone who wants to understand the general outlines of his teaching should turn to those books first
His talks though are where he reveals something of his roughandready personality giving small asides that throw a revealing light on his more systematic teachings and making points that he makes nowhere else
I have already translated a number of the talks in Lessons in Samadhi Food for Thought and Inner Strength
Those volumes though consist entirely of reconstructed talks that fit around specific themes
In this volume I have given a more general selection including a few full talks some short passages and sometimes even halfthoughts if they seemed provocative enough
This book is designed to be read reflectively a little at a time
Many of the short passages in particular will reveal their meaning only after repeated thought
Also some of the passages that present Ajaan Lee's personality will challenge many current ideas on how a Dhamma practitioner ought to speak
As Ajaan Lee cautioned his listeners Dhamma teachings should not be accepted or rejected right off hand
Instead they should be listened to with an open mind and then put to the test in experience to see if they can help uncover unwitting preconceptions
This is how I hope this book will be read
In the course of selecting the passages that make up this book I found that two themes in particular stood out
The first which has provided the book with its title is Ajaan Lee's frequent portrayal of Buddhism as a skill
This skill involves mastery not only of the techniques of meditation but also of adroit ways of viewing the world and events in daily life so that one can gain freedom from all the burdens that the unskillful mind places on itself
This approach culminates in what he calls the skill of release the awareness that brings about the mind's total liberation
The second theme concerns the central role that breath meditation plays in developing this skill
For Ajaan Lee Buddhist doctrines show their true meaning only when one refers them to the practice of keeping the breath in mind
To underline this point I have included a section on the Wings to Awakening  the Buddha's own list of his central teachings  to show how Ajaan Lee interprets them in terms of the breath
Although the passages presented here have been arranged so that the book will stand on its own they are also meant to fill in some of the gaps left by Ajaan Lee's other writings
My hope is that this will give the Englishspeaking world a more rounded picture of the skill of release and of the beauty with which Ajaan Lee presented it
I like going different places not just for the fun of it but also because I want to learn
To learn something of value depends on three things seeing listening and thinking ie using all of your senses so as to serve a purpose
Sometimes when you meet people and find that their beliefs and practices are on a level lower than yours you can serve a purpose by teaching them to get started on the right path
But when you see with your eyes hear with your ears and are convinced in your heart that something is really good don't think about whether it's yours or theirs
Remember it and put it into practice yourself
Because my heart has been set on serving the purposes of the religion I've kept on trying to do what's good
No matter whether I'm in a high place or a lowly one I always think only of serving a purpose
As for the question of manners  in other words how to benefit advanced people and people not so advanced  that depends on the situation
The religion isn't the exclusive property of homes or monasteries of this or that city or nation
The religion is something meant to benefit everyone everywhere
It belongs to the world
The further we can spread its benefits the better
But even though I've meant well practicing in line with these thoughts I can't escape being criticized probably because the people who criticize don't understand
Just a short while back  last April th  I was talking with an old nobleman but I didn't want to come down too hard on him
His criticism to put it briefly was You spend an awful lot of time involved with lay people so how can you practice for the sake of release
I answered him frankly  but first I asked him just to make sure What are you getting at
Teach people to reach nibbana he said
Don't get too involved with them
So I said I like teaching people to reach nibbana but it's hard
I like it mind you I like it but if I did as you said I'd be crazy
Suppose you plant some rice
When it's golden and ripe can you harvest just the white grains of rice
Without taking anything else
I take everything
People may say I'm crazy but why should I care
I take the whole plant because it has lots of uses
The straw you can keep to feed water buffaloes or sell or use as kindling
As for the rice husks you can use them to feed pigs
You know he said you're right And that was the end of the matter
I'm different from most other monks in that I don't like to eat only one flavor of food ie the physical food we eat every day
I like the kind of food that has three flavors in every bite
It's a fine food  food for the heart not food for the body
Its three flavors are the food of sensory contact the food of consciousness and the food of intentions
If you were to compare it to durian fruit it's the type that's sweet and rich and a little bit bitter all at once  the kind of durian that people really love to eat
The nourishment of the food of sensory contact here means likable sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas
The nourishment of the food of consciousness means taking note of likable things by way of the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind
And the nourishment of intentions means the success of the good things we aim at
Taken together these things are called Dhamma food three flavors in a single bite
Whoever keeps eating this kind of food regularly will have a long happy and healthy life
This is the kind of food I want
To put it in simple terms it's the sense of satisfaction I get when I see my students  monks novices and lay people  practicing rightly
This isn't rice food it's people food
I'm a monster monk I like to eat people
If anyone acts in a way to make me feel happy and satisfied that's going to help me live longer
If anyone misbehaves that's going to make me die faster
The reason I'm here is to help benefit the religion to benefit the world
I'm looking for a living hoping to make a profit
If the rice I plant produces big fat grains and good profits I'll hang around for a good while
If all I get are stunted grains and nothing but losses I'll be on my way
So if I see that staying on will serve a purpose I'll try to breathe good and long good and long
If I see that staying on doesn't serve a purpose any more I'll try to breathe shorter and shorter until I go in an instant
That's when I can be at my ease the kind of happiness that nothing else can match with no need to sit here tormenting my body listening to anyone's troubles any more shining bright all by myself with no worries or concerns at all
So that's the kind of food I like
As for food for the body I eat it because I have to that's all
It's not that I really want it for there's no real substance to it
You eat it today and tomorrow you have to get rid of it
But with food for the heart what you eat in one day can stay with you for ten years years
You never grow tired of it and you stay full until you forget what it's like to be hungry
Turmoil comes from our own defilements not from other people
You have to solve the problem within yourself if you want to find peace
Whatever has anything to do with the world no matter how good it may be is all an affair of stress and suffering
If you have one dollar you have one dollar's worth of suffering
If you have  you have 's worth of suffering  because the affairs of money are heavy and weighty
As for the affairs of the Dhamma they're light with no need to wrap them up and carry them with you nothing but shedding setting aside and letting go
Our major loves are our major enemies
Our minor loves are our minor enemies
Whatever we don't love at all is simply neutral
Things of the world at best are either good but not true or true but not good
Other people's thoughts words and deeds are things that aren't true
They're affairs of the world
The Dhamma though is really true and really good and really beneficial
It's an affair of the heart something very profound
So when we know that the affairs of the world aren't true in their goodness or good in their truth we shouldn't latch onto them
We have to brush them aside
If people say we're good or bad there's no truth to their words  because good is true only in the mouth of the person speaking and the same is the case with bad So don't latch onto anything they say
Focus instead on the good and bad that are actually within you
Don't latch onto outside words
If people say you're good or bad or if they curse you let them keep it for themselves
If there's a dog barking in the middle of the road kick it off to one side
Barking dogs don't bite
Silent dogs might so watch out
Ears that listen to gossip are the ears of a pitcher not the ears of a person
Don't believe everything you hear
If they say you're a dog check to see for yourself if you've got a tail
If you don't then they're wrong
The world is taken with words but I don't go along with that
I'd rather take hold of the truth in the heart
As for words they're things you spit out not things you should keep
They're not the truth
The truth lies in your heart
So whether your words are good or not pleasing or not make sure at least that your heart's good
Being easygoing and being at ease are two different things
Easygoing means that you're slow and laid back and don't finish the things you should
You spoil your work and waste your time
Being at ease means that there's a subtle comfort and coolness in the heart with no inner stress or turmoil mixed in at all
People who can be at ease in this way are people the world really wants  and the Dhamma wants even more because coolness is like medicine that can drive away fever and soothe burning pain
A person in charge of the work means that we use concentration and discernment to get the job done
Work in charge of the person means that we're lacking in concentration and discernment and think of the work even when we're lying in bed
Work in charge of the work means that everything is all out of control
My motto is Make yourself as good as possible and everything else will have to turn good in your wake If you don't abandon your own inner goodness for the sake of outer goodness things will have to go well
Don't cut down a tree that gives you shade Give it fertilizer and look after it so that it will grow
Don't forget the people who have helped you
Find some way of doing good to repay them
If you can't do it with your words or actions then at least do it with your thoughts
If people can kill off their own goodness there's nothing to keep them from killing off other people as well
If what you're going to say isn't good or true keep still
Even if it's good and true but serves no purpose it'll still cause harm
A stupid person can sit in a gold mine but won't have the sense to make anything of it
An intelligent person can take dirt and grass and turn them into silver and gold
Even if a stupid person gets a huge inheritance from his parents or grandparents he won't be able to prevent himself from creating a lot of bad kamma with it
An intelligent person though even if he has only an ax to his name can use it to set himself up for life
Most of us know so much that there are no bounds to our knowledge
When our knowledge has no bounds it's like a forest fire that burns everything in sight
In other words we're so smart that we outsmart ourselves
We know what's right and wrong but can't keep ourselves from doing what's wrong
This kind of knowledge serves no purpose and can only cause us harm
That's why it's like a forest fire that goes out of control and destroys everyone's orchards and fields
People like this end up a total loss
They know everything in the world except for themselves
Knowledge with no bounds can cause two sorts of harm We ourselves are harmed by it and other people get harmed as well
People who are thick with ignorance see turmoil as something fun just like a fish that sees waves in the ocean as a fun place to play
Greed means getting fixated and attached to things our own things or those of others
If we get attached it's like getting sucked into an electric current until we die
The nature of everything in the world is that it spins around with each moment just like an electric generator
If we touch the wires without any insulation the current will suck us in until we're fried to a crisp
We see the current as something pretty and bright and so we want to fondle it  and it'll electrocute us
If we latch onto things our desires will get us stuck right there
Don't let defilements inside make contact with defilements outside
If we have defilements at the same time that other people do the result will be trouble
For instance if we're angry when they're angry or we're greedy when they're greedy or we're deluded when they're deluded it spells ruination for everyone
People aren't equal but you have to make your heart equal for everyone
If you see other people's bad side turn your eyes around until you can see their good side as well
A person who makes a mistake is better than a person who doesn't act at all for mistakes can be corrected
But if you don't act how will you know how to correct yourself
 for you don't know whether you're mistaken or not
The fact that you don't act is a mistake in and of itself
The more you study the affairs of the world the more they branch out
The more you study the affairs of the Dhamma the more they narrow down and converge
The treasures of the world last only as long as our breathing
As soon as we die they go to somebody else
The King of Death keeps changing our clothes  our eyes our hair our skin etc
 as a way of forewarning us that we're going to be evacuated to another country
If we don't get our provisions ready we're going to be in trouble when the evacuation order comes
This body that we've borrowed from the world The original owners keep coming to take it back bit by bit without our realizing it
For example the hair on our head They take it back one or two strands at a time turning it gray
Our eyes they take back one at a time making them blurry
Our ears they take back bit by bit as our hearing starts to go
Our teeth they take back one by one
A tooth will start feeling loose then it stops for a while and then it starts growing loose again
Eventually it whispers to the dentist to take all the teeth out
The original owners also cut away our flesh bit by bit as our muscles atrophy and our skin gets loose and wrinkled
Our spine they keep coming to pull forward until it's so bent that we can't straighten up
Some people end up having to crawl or to walk with a cane stumbling and swaying falling down and picking themselves back up a sorry sight to see
Ultimately the owners come and call for the whole thing back in what we call death
If you look carefully at the body you'll see that what you have here is the four states of deprivation nothing wonderful at all
The first state of deprivation is the animal kingdom all the worms and germs that live in our stomach and intestines in our blood vessels and in our pores
As long as there's food for these things to eat in there they're always going to be with us multiplying like crazy making us ill
On the outside of the body there are fleas and lice
They like staying with whoever doesn't keep himself clean making his skin red and sore
As for the animals living in the blood vessels and pores they give us rashes and infections
The second state of deprivation is the kingdom of hungry ghosts ie the properties of earth water fire and wind in the body
First they feel too cold then too warm then they feel ill then they want to eat this or that
We have to keep pandering to them running around to find things for them to eat with no chance to stop and rest
And they never have enough  like the hungry ghosts who starve after they die with no one to feed them
These properties keep pestering you and no matter what you do you can never please them
First the food is too hot so you have to put ice in it
Then it's too cold so you have to put it back on the stove
All of this comes down to an imbalance in the properties sometimes good sometimes bad never coming to a stable state of normalcy at all making us suffer in various ways
The third state of deprivation is the land of angry demons
Sometimes when we get ill or lose our senses we run around naked without a stitch of clothing as if we were possessed by angry demons
Some people have to undergo operations getting this removed or cutting out that or sucking out this waving their arms and moaning in a way that's really pitiful
Some people get so poor that they have nothing to eat they get so thin that they're all eyeballs and ribs suffering like the angry demons who can't see the brightness of the world
The fourth state of deprivation is purgatory
Purgatory is the home of the spirits with a lot of bad kamma who have to suffer being roasted speared with redhot iron spikes and pierced with thorns
All the animals whose flesh we've eaten after they've been killed and cooked gather together in our stomach and then disappear into our body in huge numbers
If you were to count them you'd have whole coops of chickens herds of cattle and half a sea's worth of fish
Our stomach is such a tiny thing and yet no matter how much you eat you can never keep it full
And you have to feed it hot things too like the denizens of purgatory who have to live with fire and flame
If there's no fire they can't live
So there's a big copper frying pan for them
All the various spirits we've eaten gather in the big copper frying pan of our stomach where they're consumed by the fires of digestion and then they haunt us Their powers penetrate throughout our flesh and blood giving rise to passion aversion and delusion making us squirm as if we were burned by the fires of purgatory too
So look at the body
Whose is it
Is it really yours
Where did it come from
No matter how much you care for it it's not going to stay with you
It'll have to go back to where it came from the properties of earth water fire and wind
The fact that it's able to stay for a while depends entirely on the breath
When there's no more breath to it it starts to decay and no one wants it then
You won't be able to take it with you when you go
No one can take his arms legs feet or hands along with him
This is why we say that the body is notself
It belongs to the world
As for the mind it's the one that does good and evil and will be reborn in line with its kamma
The mind is what doesn't die
It's the one that experiences all pleasure and pain
So when you realize this you should do as much good as you can for your own sake
The Buddha felt compassion for us and taught us in this way but we don't feel much compassion for ourselves
We prefer to fill ourselves with suffering
When other people teach us it's no match for our teaching ourselves for other people will teach us only once in a while
The possibility of being a common animal a human being a heavenly being or of reaching nibbana all lie within us so we have to choose which one we want
The good you do is what will go with you in the future
This is why the Buddha taught us to meditate to contemplate the body to give rise to dispassion
It's inconstant stressful and nothing of ours
You borrow it for a while and then have to return it
The body doesn't belong to the mind and the mind doesn't belong to the body
They're separate things that depend on each other
When we can see this we have no more worries or attachments
We can let go of the body and three hunks of rust  selfidentity views attachments to precepts and practices and uncertainty in the Path  will fall from our heart
We'll see that all good and evil come from the heart
If the heart is pure that's the highest good in the world
 Someone once came to Ajaan Lee with a problem
Some of his friends had said to him If the body's notself why can't we hit you Ajaan Lee said to answer them by saying Look
It's not mine
I've borrowed it so I have to take good care of it
I can't let anyone else mistreat it
The Dhamma doesn't belong to anyone
It's common property like unsettled land If we don't lay claim to it by developing it it's simply vacant uncleared land without any crops
If we want to lay claim to it we have to develop it in line with established principles if we want it really to be ours
When difficulties arise  poverty pain illness and death  we'll then have something to protect us
But if we haven't followed the established principles then we'll put the blame on the Buddha Dhamma Sangha and inner worth in general for not helping us when these things arise
And that will discourage us from developing any inner worth at all
The mind is the most important factor in life the most important factor in the world for it's the basic foundation of our inner worth
If the mind is dark and defiled instead of being bright and pure then no matter how much we practice generosity virtue or meditation we won't get any results
The Buddha knew that we're all going to have to go abroad which is why he taught us to develop inner worth as a way of knowing how to get our provisions ready
We have to know how to get to where we want to go how to dress properly and how to speak their language
We'll also have to put money in the bank so that we'll be able to exchange it for their currency
Putting money in the bank means generosity in making donations and being charitable
Learning their language means knowing how to say that we take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
Being complete in our virtue is like having fashionable clothes to wear
Yet even if we have funds to exchange good clothes to wear and know how to speak their language but are basically loony  ie our minds are wandering all over the place with no basis in concentration  we still won't pass inspection
This is why the Buddha wanted us to develop our minds as much as possible making them pure and bright
When our wealth and inner merit are complete in this way they'll spread to our children and other people around us
All people have inner worth within them but whoever doesn't know how to lay claim to it and develop it won't get any benefit from it at all
Human treasures aren't important
Thieves and fools can find them with no problem at all
But the treasure of a human rebirth is something that people without virtue can't gain
The Buddha taught that with noble treasures whoever has a lot isn't poor whoever has even a little isn't poor
The important thing is that you give rise to them within yourself and you'll always be wealthy
For example if you make up your mind to donate a material object to Buddhism it immediately turns into the noble treasure of generosity in your heart
When you abstain from evil in your words and deeds they turn into the noble treasure of virtue
When this is the case your treasures are within you
You haven't deposited them with anyone else
Your generosity lies within you your virtue  the virtue of restraint of the senses  lies in your eyes your ears your mouth
When your treasures are with you like this it's like keeping your money in your own pocket without depositing it with anyone else There are bound to be no problems
You don't have to worry that they'll swindle or cheat you
When you've got your money right in your own pocket what is there to fear
The Buddha teaches us not to be possessive of things
Let them go in line with their nature and take only the nourishment they have to offer
Material things are dregs and leavings their nourishment is the joy we feel when we're willing to give them away
So don't eat the dregs
Spit them out so that they can be of use both to others and to yourself in the sense of inner worth that comes from being generous
We have to build up our inner worth our perfections as quickly as possible because our conviction in these things isn't yet sure
Some days it shrinks out of sight That's called turtlehead conviction
Some days it stretches back out again
So if it stretches out today act on it
Tomorrow it may shrink back in again
Two legs two arms two hands two eyes one mouth These are your perfections
Put them to use
People who don't believe in goodness rarely do good but people who don't believe in evil do evil all the time
Evil isn't something natural that happens on its own
It happens only if we do it
The Buddha teaches us to develop inner worth by meditating on good will but you have to be intent on really doing it if you want to get real results
Even if it's only for a short time  the wiggle of an elephant's ears or the flicker of a snake's tongue  it can give rise to amazing power like the power of an elephant or a snake in being able to kill off people or other animals in the twinkling of an eye
All an elephant has to do is wiggle his ears just once and people trip all over themselves trying to run away
But if you're not really true in what you do the power of truth won't appear in the mind and you won't be able to use it to get any results  like the ear of a dog or a cat It can wiggle all day long and yet it won't cause anyone any fear
Mindfulness and alertness are the quality of the Buddha
The cool sense of happiness they give is the quality of the Dhamma
If you can maintain that coolness until it hardens into a block of ice  ie you make that goodness solid and strong in your heart  that's the quality of the Sangha
Once you've got a solid block of goodness like this you can pick it up and put it to any use that you like
Being a slave to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha is called being a slave to a noble family the kind of people we can willingly be slaves to
But being a slave to our moods  cravings and defilements  is like being a slave to bandits and thieves
What sort of valuables are they going to have to give us
But even though it's proper to be a slave to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha it's still no match for not having to be a slave to anyone for the word slave means that we're not yet free
So the Buddha teaches us to learn how to depend on ourselves  attahi attano natho the self is its own mainstay
That's when we'll be able to rise up free released from our slavery with no need to have anyone order us around ever again
When we come to the monastery we come looking for peace and calm so don't go releasing tigers crocodiles and rabid dogs into the monastery grounds endangering everyone who comes here
Tigers crocodiles and rabid dogs stand for our very own greed anger and delusion
We have to chain them and cage them and lock them up tight
Make absolutely sure that they don't come escaping out your thoughts words and deeds in any way
People who don't get ahead in life are the ones whose bodies are human but whose minds drop down to lower levels
In other words they're all right in physical terms but not in terms of their minds
For instance when we come to the monastery we depend on our feet to walk us here but then when we get here if we let our minds and manners fall into lower ways we're no different from bats that hook their feet up on high places and then let their heads hang down low
The Dhamma is an affair of the heart
The words spoken are Dhamma the intention in speaking is Dhamma and you have to make your heart into Dhamma if you want to hear it as Dhamma
When these three factors come together listening to the Dhamma can give countless rewards
When we listen to the Dhamma it's as if the monk is giving us each a knife it's up to us to accept it or not
When we get back home and run into problems or issues in our families we can use the knife to cut right through them
But if we throw the knife down right here or hand it back to the monk we won't have any weapon to use when we meet up with issues at home
The study of the Dhamma is like reading a cookbook
The practice of the Dhamma is like fixing food
The attainment of the Dhamma is like knowing the taste of the food
If we simply read the texts without putting them into practice it's like knowing that there are such things as peppers onions and garlic but without having them for a meal
If you study the Dhamma without practicing it it's as if you're missing parts of your body
If you study and practice it's like having two eyes two hands and two legs
You can do things a lot more easily than a person with only one eye one hand or one leg
Having selfrespect means that you respect your thoughts words and deeds
Respect for your deeds means that whatever you do you always follow the three principles of skillful action no killing no stealing no illicit sex
Respect for your words means that whatever you say you always follow the four principles of skillful speech no lying no divisive talebearing no harsh language and no idle chatter
Respect for your thoughts means that whatever you think you always follow the three principles of the skillful mind trying to keep your views straight with no greed or ill will
Having broken precepts is better than not having any precepts to break
Wearing torn clothes is better than going around naked
Lots of dead beings have gone into your mouth  pigs chickens cattle etc
 so make sure that it isn't possessed by their spirits
Before you say anything no matter what your intention look right and left and speak only when you're sure that it's just right for the situation
Don't give in to bad manners
Concerning Right Livelihood Even if our basic livelihood is honest but we practice it dishonestly it's considered wrong
For example we're farmers but we lay claim to other people's fields as our own This is Wrong Livelihood and the crops we grow on that land will do us harm
There are two kinds of foulness the kind the Buddha praised and the kind he criticized
The kind he praised is the filth and foulness of the body for it makes us see clearly the aging and unattractiveness of compounded things so that the mind will gain a chastened sense of dispassion grow disenchanted with its attachment to suffering and set its sights on developing its inner worth so as to escape from that suffering
As for the foulness the Buddha criticized that's the foulness of an evil mind which defiles our thoughts words and deeds
This is something the Buddha criticized and penalized in very heavy terms
So we have to keep washing off our actions in all situations
Only when our thoughts words and deeds are clean will wise people praise us as being uncomplacent and good
Restraint of the senses means that we bring the senses and their objects into proportion with one another
For instance guarding the eyes means that we don't let our eyes get bigger than the sights they see and we don't let the sights get bigger than the eyes
If the sights are bigger than the eyes they get lodged there
We think about them night and day
If the eyes are bigger than the sights that means we can't get enough of those sights and keep wanting to see them more
In either case we give rise to greed and delusion
The fires of passion aversion and delusion burn our eyes and make us suffer
One important noble treasure is meditation keeping the mind from wandering aimlessly around in all kinds of issues
When we keep the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in mind it's as if we were soaking in their virtues
When that's the case the mind will have to become saturated with inner worth
It's the same as if we were to take a handful of bitter herbs and soak them in syrup until the syrup saturates them
Their bitterness will disappear and be replaced with sweetness
No matter how shoddy a person's mind if it gets constantly soaked in goodness it will have to become more and more refined like bitter herbs sweetened in syrup
Whatever you do be true in doing it if you want to meet up with the truth
If you're really true in what you do doing just a little bit can be enough
One million in real money is better than ten million in counterfeit bills
When you speak stay right with your speaking
Whatever you do stay right with what you're doing
When you eat stay with your eating when you stand stay with your standing when you walk stay with your walking when you're sitting stay with your sitting when you're lying down stay with your lying down
Don't let your mind get ahead of the truth
The heart is like food in a serving dish
Mindfulness is like a cover over the dish
If you lack mindfulness it's as if you left the dish uncovered Flies are sure to come and land on it and contaminate it with all sorts of germs so that the food becomes toxic and can make you sick
So you always have to be careful to keep the dish covered
Don't let flies land on it
That way your heart will be clean and pure and will give rise to wisdom and knowledge
A deserted house a house where someone has died gives you the chills
Only if there are people in the house will you feel secure
A person who is not mindful of the present is like a deserted house
When you see such a person you don't feel secure
Defilements are like sand bars or stumps in a river that will keep our boat from getting to shore
In other words passion is something that snags us anger is something that bumps into us and delusion is something that makes us spin around and sink
There's a story they tell of two men who were hired to row a boat along the rivers and canals to sell plowshares shovels and hoes
If they sold all the wares in the boat their employer would give them their full wages of one kahapana which was equal to about four dollars a day
The first day their employer went out with them and they sold all their wares
After that he didn't go out with them so the two of them went out to sell their wares on their own
One day as they were out rowing along calling out Plowshares shovels and hoes their minds wandered and they started getting drowsy
All of a sudden they crashed smack into a stump and ran aground on a sandbar
Even after they got free they were so shaken up that instead of calling out Plowshares shovels and hoes they started calling out Sandbars and stumps
Sandbars and stumps all along the river but nobody wanted to buy
When evening came they rowed back to their employer's house their boat still full of plowshares shovels and hoes
They hadn't been able to sell a thing
So the employer gave them each only a dollar for their day's wages
One of the men took the money back to his wife who was surprised to see that she was getting only one dollar instead of the usual four
Maybe he's given the rest of the money to another woman she thought so she gave him a piece of her mind
No matter how much he tried to explain things she wouldn't listen
So he told her to go ask the employer
If what he said wasn't true he'd be willing to let her hit him once on the head
The wife impatient because she was so angry said No let me hit you first and then I'll go ask As she said this she reached for a shovel handle but all she could grab was the stick they used to drive the dog out of the house so she used that to bash her husband three times on the head
Later of course she found out the truth but by that time it was too late for the husband had already gotten three free hits on the head
This story shows the harm that can come from not being mindful
If you let your mind wander away from what you're doing you can end up getting yourself into trouble
There's danger that comes from being good
If you're not especially good nobody gets fixated on you
The important thing is that you know how to use your goodness to your benefit
If you're a good person but don't know how to use your goodness  ie you use it at the wrong time or place or in a way that gets other people upset  it won't benefit you and will instead cause you harm
In this way your goodness turns into evil
So you have to be circumspect in how you let your goodness show
Keep your evil intentions to yourself and be careful with your good intentions too
It's like handing a knife to a person You may have good intentions hoping that he'll put it to good use but if he uses it to kill someone your intentions backfire on both of you
Goodness comes from evil in that once you really take a good look at evil it loses
Whatever you look at look at it from all sides
This is why they don't let you look a long time at pretty things or beautiful women because after a while you'll see that they aren't all that beautiful after all
So if you see something lovely look at it long and hard until you see that it's not as lovely as you thought
If someone makes you angry contemplate them until you feel compassion for them
The same principle holds for delusion
If you're wise then greed anger and delusion can help you
If you're wise even desire can help you by making you want to develop your inner worth
So don't look down on these things
You're sitting here listening to a sermon
What made you come
Desire did
When people ordain as monks and novices what gave the order
Craving
So don't look only at the drawbacks of craving and desire
If you don't have the desire to be good you can't develop inner worth
People who develop their inner worth have to start out with the intention to do it
Ignorance is good in that when we know we're ignorant we'll do something to remedy the situation
Ignorance leads us astray but in the end it will lead us back
Knowledge never led anyone to look for learning
Ignorance is what leads people to look for knowledge
If you already know what's there to look for
When we practice the Dhamma it gives three kinds of benefits We help ourselves gain release from suffering we help other people and we help keep the religion alive
Wherever there are effects there always have to be causes
The world we experience comes from the heart as its cause
If the heart is good the world will have to be good
If the heart is bad the world will have to be bad
The mind when it's not with the body in the present is world When it's with the body in the present it's Dhamma
If it's world it has to be as hot as fire
If it's Dhamma it's as cool as water
Don't be complacent
Remind yourself that we're all being chased out of the world day by day
In other words aging rears up illness roars and death runs up the score
So don't be oblivious partying around with your defilements
Associate with the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha until your mind develops Right Concentration
That way you won't have anything to fear from the dangers of the world
Believing other people is all right but it's not really special
It's like borrowing money We'll have to share the return on our investment with our lenders
When we don't yet know can't yet have any real conviction in ourselves and still have to believe what other people say it's like being an infant who has to depend on its parents
If we don't get stronger we'll have to keep being nursed all the way through old age
If we don't try to train the mind until it's firm and unwavering it won't give rise to the strength of concentration and will have to keep on being a child
When we're able to shake off all the issues in the mind leaving just the mind in and of itself three gems will appear in it the Gem of the Buddha the Gem of the Dhamma and the Gem of the Sangha
Once these three gems appear within us we won't have to load ourselves down by carrying around much of anything else
Simply put them under your arm if you like or even up your nose
When you have this kind of wealth your mind can be light and noble treasures will arise within you
In other words conviction in the qualities of the Buddha will appear within the mind
Then you practice in line with those qualities until you gain the various results they have to offer
You'll see the true Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in your heart
If you try to take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha on the outer level you're going to die for sure
The Buddha on the outer level entered nibbana a long time ago
The Dhamma on the outer level is just letters in books
The Sangha on the outer level is the monks with shaven heads and yellow robes that you see roaming all over the country
If you try to hold onto these things it's like carrying a heavy hoe that won't do you any good
But if you hold onto the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha within you and then put them into practice you'll realize that what you're looking for is right here in the heart
And then what do you want
To return to the human state
To attain a heavenly state
To attain nibbana
Or go to hell
They're all possible without your having to look for them anywhere else
The Buddha taught that the five aggregates are a heavy burden because they all get to the point where we can't bear carrying them around anymore and have to throw them down in the mud
If you don't keep cleansing them they keep getting heavier and heavier
If you then try to go depending on other people you weigh them down and you yourself are helpless
This is because stashing things away in the heart is like taking pictures without ever developing the film
What you eat gets put on the film what you say gets put on the film what you hear gets put on the film but that's as far as it gets on the film
You've never stopped to look at what kind of pictures you have pretty or ugly
If you want to see your pictures you have to take the film into the darkroom by closing your eyes and practicing concentration attaining the first jhana directing your thoughts to the present and evaluating it until you can see yourself clearly
If you don't go into the darkroom now someday the King of Death is going to blindfold you tie up your feet and hands and drag you into his darkroom
In other words when you're on the verge of death you won't be able to open your mouth or eyes
Nobody will be able to feed you
You'll want to eat but won't be able to eat
You'll want to speak but won't be able to speak
Your ears will get closed off so that you can't hear anything clearly
You won't be able to see your parents family children or grandchildren
You won't be able to tell them your last wishes
That's called the darkroom of the King of Death
The mind is the only thing that senses pleasure and pain
The body has no sense of these things at all
It's like taking a knife to murder someone They don't hunt down the knife and punish it
They punish only the person who used it to commit murder
If your mind isn't good then the goodness of your actions isn't really good and the goodness of your words isn't really good either
You have to develop power within yourself like stocking up on gunpowder
If a gun has no gunpowder it can't be used to destroy anything
People who have to be servants are the ones who lack the power to be anyone else's boss
As for the people who have that power all they have to do is point their fingers and other people will jump up and run
If we don't develop our own powers we'll have to be servants  slaves to defilement  throughout time
The body is like a knife
If you have a knife but don't keep sharpening it it will get coated thick with rust
In the same way if you have a body  physical elements aggregates and sense media  but don't train it and keep it polished it'll get coated thick with defilements
If it were a gun it wouldn't even kill a fly
Normally the mind doesn't like to stay where it is
It keeps flowing out the eyes ears nose tongue and body  like a river that splits into five streams instead of flowing as one
In a river like that the force of the current is weakened and can't run at full strength
In addition to flowing out the five senses the mind also leaks out through thoughts of the past and future instead of staying firm in the present
This is why the mind has no peace or strength because it never gets to rest
When the mind loses strength the body loses strength as well and won't be able to succeed at anything
If the mind doesn't stay with the body in the present and instead wanders around exposed to external perceptions it's bound to get into all sorts of difficulties just like a person who doesn't stay in his house and instead goes running around outside
He's bound to be exposed to sun and rain and he may get run over by a car or bitten by a rabid dog
If we stay in our home then even though there may still be some dangers they won't be too serious and we won't get into difficulties
When the mind isn't quiet it's like running around with a flaming torch
You're bound to burn yourself
Only when you stop running will you be able to cool down
People who accumulate merit but don't develop the heart's foundation are like people who own land but don't have a deed
They might be able to sell it for money but they're an easy mark for a swindler because they don't have any firm basis for their claim
If you practice generosity and virtue but not meditation it's like taking a bath on a hot day only from the waist down
If you don't bathe all the way from the head on down you won't get totally refreshed because the coolness doesn't go all the way to the heart
External merit  generosity and virtue  is like the skin of a fruit
Internal merit  meditation  is like the flesh of the fruit
You can't have one without the other
If fruit doesn't have skin its flesh won't grow
If it has skin but no flesh you can't eat it
Each helps the other but they differ in quality
External merit is what protects internal merit while the internal merit nourishes merit outside
Today I'm going to talk about how to drill a well
This is a difficult skill not like simply digging or plowing
We all want happiness but we don't really know what happiness is
Real happiness is nothing other than the inner worth and skillfulness of the heart
So where are we going to find inner worth
Inner worth is like a well
The first kind of well is simply a depression in the ground for catching rain water like a pond
We can't get too much use out of this kind of well because there are times when water buffaloes cattle and other animals get in the water to bathe and drink making it muddy
If you want to use the water you have to filter it many times
This kind of well is like generosity which gives only shallow rewards like the water in a shallow depression
The second kind of well is like a deep reservoir
Cattle can't bathe or drink in it
The only animals that go into the reservoir are toads and frogs but even so if we want to use the water we have to filter it first
This kind of well is like the virtue of observing the precepts which gives deeper rewards than generosity
The third kind of well is an artesian well with a constantly running spring
No matter how much water you use it never runs dry
This kind of well is so deep that even mosquitoes can't get down into the water
To drill this kind of well you need to use a drill with a diamond bit and a strong steel shaft if you want to reach the underground water
This kind of well is like meditation because you have to use strong mindfulness discernment persistence and endurance if you want to succeed at drilling
Mindfulness has to be like the diamond bit and endurance the steel shaft
When you use your persistence to drill on down the results will arise as inner worth and skillfulness that keep flowing in bathing the mind like the waters of immortality that provide the mind with a constant stream of refreshment and delight
If we don't have a safe place for our inner worth how is it going to help us
It's like raising horses or cows but not fencing in a place for them to stay
If they go wandering off it's your fault not theirs
If you don't practice virtue concentration and discernment on your own you're going to get taken in by the symbols of refuge and never get to the real thing
The symbols of refuge are Buddha images which are just symbols of the Buddha Buddhist texts which are symbols of the Dhamma and Buddhist monks and nuns who are symbols of those who have practiced rightly and well until becoming noble disciples
If you get stuck on the outer level you'll never meet with the real thing
Inner worth is like money
If your pocket has a hole it'll let your money slip right through
If you do things that give rise to inner worth but don't keep that worth in your heart it won't stay with you
When you're about to die and you call on it to help you what will there be to answer your call
When this is the case you can't criticize all the good things you've done for not helping you
You have to put the blame on yourself
If you stick a dollar in your pocket but your pocket is torn then when the time comes to buy a cup of coffee you won't have any money to buy it
In that case what are you going to blame the money or your pocket
To practice meditation is like harvesting your crop of inner worth and eating it
If you don't harvest it it'll spoil
If you eat it in time it'll nourish your body
If you don't eat it in time it'll go to waste
If you don't take your inner worth into your heart you'll never feel full
Generosity is something that poor people can't practice but crazy people can
Virtue is something that crazy people can't practice but poor people can
As for meditation everyone can practice it no matter what their age sex or station in life
A mind without concentration is like a pile of wooden posts left lying on the ground for people and animals to step all over
But if we stand the posts up and plant them in the soil we can get good use out of them
Even if they're not tall  only a meter or so  but we put them close together in a line we can fence in our yard and prevent people and animals from coming in and traipsing all over our property
It's the same with the mind
If we take a firm stance in concentration as the heart's foundation keeping our mindfulness and alertness close together in line we can keep defilements from slipping into the mind and making it soiled
The Dhamma is something constant and true
The reason we don't see the truth is because we're always on the move
If we're riding in a car we can't clearly see the things that pass near by us on the road such as how big the stones on the ground are their color or shape
We look at trees and mountains and they all seem to be on the move
If we've been in a car since birth without stopping to get out and walk around on our own we're sure to think that cars run trees run and mountains run
What we see isn't in line with the truth
The running is in us in the car not in the mountains and trees
Whoever develops concentration will end up with three eyes
In other words your outer left eye will see good things your outer right eye will see bad things and they'll send them in to the inner eye which will remain normal
You'll also have three ears Your outer left ear will hear praise your outer right ear will hear criticism and they'll send them in to the inner ear which will stay normal
This is how you can receive all the guests the world sends your way
As for the eye of the mind  intuitive insight  it will receive your defilements
Once it really understands them it will be able to send them packing
That way you'll be able to live in the world without suffering
If you really apply yourself you can accomplish all kinds of things even with a single pocket knife
In the same way if you really apply yourself to making the mind still you can get much better results than a person who studies and memorizes hundreds and thousands of texts
Making the mind still is something we can all do
If it were beyond our powers the Buddha wouldn't have taught us to do it
The paths and fruitions leading to nibbana aren't the property of stupid people and they don't belong to smart people either
They belong to those who are true and really determined in developing goodness for themselves
The body is like a mountain containing all kinds of minerals
There's gold silver and diamond ore buried here in this rock  ie the Unconditioned is in here
And there's also the Conditioned which is like trees weeds dirt and rocks where all sorts of people and animals  monkeys tigers and elephants  dwell
As for the gold and silver they're not a dwelling place for animals at all
So if we act like monkeys tigers and elephants we'll meet up with nothing but trees weeds dirt and rocks
We'll never meet up with things of value like silver or gold
To act like monkeys means that we never apply ourselves to anything
We wander everywhere with no fixed place to eat or sleep swinging from branch to branch as we feel like it
What this means is that our minds have no firm place to stay no concentration
We wander here and there in the past and future in our thoughts and moods with no time to stop and stay in place
This is what it means to act like a monkey
As for tigers they're violent and fierce
This stands for the anger that arises in the human heart and erupts outward smothering whatever goodness we may have
As for elephants they like to hear nothing but sweet words and praise
They can't take criticism at all
This is like people who when they do something wrong can't stand to be told that it's wrong
If they do something right and get a little praise they smile until their cheeks hurt
This is what it means to be like an elephant
So we have to get rid of the monkeys tigers and elephants in ourselves so that we can turn into human beings
That way we can look at our mountain and realize that if we want valuable things we'll be able to get valuable things out of it
If we want worthless things we'll get worthless things out of it
We can then gather all kinds of treasures
We can level the dirt and turn it into fields
We can take the rocks and extract the silver and gold
As for the trees we can cut them down and turn them into firewood or charcoal so that we can cook our food and fire our smelter or else turn them into posts and boards so that we can build ourselves a home
All of these things we'll be able to get from our mountain but we have to apply ourselves and really be persistent
If we want silver and gold we have to set up a smelter and heat the rocks to see which elements are there in a pure form and which ones are mixed
This is how we do it We have to get a lot of fuel we have to set up a furnace and we have to start a fire
Only then will we be able to extract the ore from our rock
Finding lots of fuel means being willing to let go of things both inside and out
As for setting up a furnace we have to find a place with good solid ground and a roof that doesn't leak
This stands for our persistence
Once we've got our furnace we start a fire
This refers to the ardency of our practice
Once our practice is ardent the various elements in our rock  the body  will melt and separate out on their own just as when they melt down minerals the silver lead and tin etc will separate out on their own
The same holds true with the body
When it undergoes ardent inspection by the mind the pure ore and the various impurities will separate out of their own accord
But most meditators nowadays want to separate things out even before they've put their rock into the smelter
They think things out on their own without a single one of the tools needed for smelting
No fuel no furnace no fire a leaky roof and a piece of cavedin ground What are they going to smelt
They say that the transcendent has to be like this insight meditation has to be like that streamentry has to be like this you have to let go like this and that in order to reach this and that stage the stages of oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship have to be reached in this and that way the four levels of jhana have to be done in this and that way
They try to separate things out in line with their own ideas but no matter how much they try they can't get things to separate because they don't have any fuel any fire any furnace
Where are they going to get any results
Results don't come from thinking
They come from the qualities we build into the mind
So don't try to separate things out in line with your own notions
Some people see a person carrying a big hunk of rock to his home and think that he's a stupid fool
First of all the rock is heavy and besides  what can there be of any value in a plain old rock
So they take a shovel to the mountain to dig up only the silver and gold  not too much just some tiny light nuggets to wrap up and carry back home in a cloth
But they end up with nothing at all because the nuggets they want are firmly embedded in the mountain they'll need more than a shovel to get them out
As for the stupid person as soon as he gets home he clears out a space builds a furnace gathers fuel starts a fire and throws the rock in
When the rock is subjected to strong heat the various ores in the rock will begin to melt and to separate
The silver will come seeping out and go one way the gold another the tin and lead another the diamond another without getting mixed
This way the stupid person will be able to choose the silver gold and diamond as he likes
As for the people who think they're intelligent who know that this is this and that is that that you have to reach this level before you can reach that level that concentration is like this insight meditation is like that the transcendent is like this In the end they have nothing to swallow but their own saliva
They gain no valuables at all
The person who thinks he's stupid when he encounters something has to keep contemplating reflecting digging away until he comes to an understanding
If we want happiness we have to give rise to the causes
Gather a lot of fuel
What this means is that we're willing to give up the sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas within ourselves as well as being generous with outside things by making donations observing the precepts and practicing meditation
This is how we burn away our defilements through the perfection of generosity
The perfection of generosity is excellent fuel for roasting our defilements
Set up a furnace
This stands for the effort we put into abandoning physical pleasure and sitting in meditation thinking of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as a way of calming the mind
Then we keep pumping the breath into the body in the same way that they pump air into a furnace for casting a bronze Buddha image
We make the heart steady and firm with mindfulness and alertness constantly in control
This way the inner fire of our ardency will get stronger and stronger
As we keep pumping the breath in the sense of inner light will get brighter and brighter
Once you're able to keep this up gather your body and mind together into one
Don't try to crack or divide them up at all for that's the way of a fool who thinks he knows everything beforehand
As the fire of our ardency keeps getting stronger the various elements in the body will melt and separate out of their own accord
When you practice the Dhamma don't worry about how it's going to go
Don't try to plan or arrange things to go this way or that
When the fire of your practice reaches full strength all the various impurities will fall away on their own leaving just the pure ore
The rock clinging to the ore  the various Hindrances  will fall away from the heart
But if your furnace is full of holes the fire will flicker outside and the heat inside will dissipate
You won't be able to burn away the heart's various impurities
So you have to learn how to act like a person making charcoal
Start a fire
When people make charcoal they start their fire and then close off their furnace leaving just a tiny air vent
With the furnace entirely closed off in this way the wood they place in the furnace won't burn up or turn into ashes
When they finally open the furnace they'll find hard highquality charcoal
In the same way once we can remember our meditation word without getting distracted the closing off of the furnace means that we close off the various perceptions that register by way of the eyes ears nose tongue body and intellect
We close off the Hindrances and don't let the mind flicker out after outside perceptions
Once everything is closed off in this way the wood will keep smoldering away in the furnace
When the time comes to open it up we'll find that there are no ashes and that we've ended up with good hard charcoal of high quality
The solid goodness we develop in the heart is like charcoal that we can then use to smelt our ore
This way the elements within us will gain strength able to separate themselves into the Conditioned and the Unconditioned
Once we give rise to the four stages of jhana unskillful mental states  the rock  will separate out and fall away
Sensual desire will separate out ill will torpor  lethargy restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty will all separate out and fall away
The mind will be totally absorbed in jhana with directed thought and evaluation in charge
Just this is enough for insight to arise
We'll be able to see clearly what's diamond what's silver and what's gold
The silver is the sense of fullness or rapture the gold is the sense of pleasure and ease that arises within
Once there's pleasure no disturbances will appear in the mind like a burning lantern when there's no wind to disturb the flame
This is the light of the Dhamma or the brilliance of discernment ie insight meditation arising
We'll see the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha within
The heart will give rise to treasures
This is like setting up a furnace and using charcoal to smelt ore
The various elements in the rock will separate out leaving the Unconditioned
Insight meditation is the fire we use to heat the rock
If we want things to separate out like this we have to use insight meditation
Don't try to separate things out on your own
Whatever is going to turn into light ashes charcoal or smoke will do so of its own accord
This is how we get past the Conditioned
The Unconditioned will separate out to one side the Conditioned to another
This way we'll get to see what's really true
But however things separate out you have to keep using your discernment even further
If you get attached to good things they can backfire on you
If you get attached to bad you've gone wrong
When we practice breath meditation we've been given methods for warding off the various Hindrances that will destroy the good results of what we're doing
We're told to focus on the inandout breath and to keep mindfulness in charge together with the meditation word buddho buddho in and out with the breath
If you want just to think buddho you can but it's too light
Your awareness won't go deep
It's the nature of shallow things that dust and dirt can blow in easily and fill them up quickly
As for deep things dust and dirt can't easily blow in
In the same way when the mind is deep it isn't easily affected by preoccupations
So when you simply focus on buddho buddho it doesn't carry much weight
It's like taking a knife and slicing away at the air
You don't feel much of anything because there's nothing for the knife to strike against
But if you take the same knife and use it to slice away at a stump or any other object you'll feel that your hand has more weight and your arm gains strength able to ward off any enemies that may threaten you
This is why we're taught to focus on a single spot so that the mind will gain strength solid and steady in a single preoccupation
Take as your target any of the meditation objects in the basic list of forty
Your mind will gain strength your mindfulness will mature into Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration
Buddho is the meditation word
Being mindful and alert to the inandout breath is the actual meditation
Once the mind is in place you can let go of your meditation word
The meditation word is like bait
For example if we want a chicken to come our way we scatter rice on the ground
Once the chicken comes for the rice we don't have to scatter any more
Being mindful remembering to stay with the breath is one thing
Alertness  examining the breath sensations that flow throughout the entire body knowing whether the breath feels constricted or broad shallow or deep heavy or light fast or slow  is something else
Together they form the component factors of meditation
The inandout breath is like the wick of a candle or a lantern
Focusing mindfulness on the breath is like lighting the wick so that it gives off light
A single candle if its wick is lit can burn down an entire city
In the same way mindfulness can destroy all the bad things within us defilement unawareness craving and attachment
Mindfulness is the consuming fire of the practice
Being mindful of the breath is like casting a Buddha image inside yourself
Your body is like the furnace mindfulness is like the mold
If mindfulness lapses the bronze will leak out of the mold and your Buddha image will be ruined
Letting mindfulness lapse is like getting a hole in your clothes
Letting it lapse again is like getting a second hole
If you keep letting it lapse it's like getting a third fourth fifth and sixth hole in your clothes until ultimately you can't wear them
There are three ways in which mindfulness lapses
The first is by bringing inside things out to think about
In other words you grab hold of any lights or visions that may appear and in this way your path washes out
The second way is by bringing outside things in to think about ie abandoning your meditation object
The third way is by losing consciousness
You sit there but it's as if you were asleep
All of these things are called a washedout path like a road that washes out and is full of deep potholes
To keep preoccupations out of the mind is to cut a path in the mind
To let outside preoccupations in is to let the path wash out
When the path washes out there's no way that insight or discernment will arise just as when a road washes out no cars or trucks can run along it
When concentration gets extinguished in this way you can't practice insight meditation
There's nothing left but thoughts about insight thoughts about concentration thinking guessing groping in line with your old preconceptions
The virtues of your heart disappear without your realizing it
If you want to go back and start all over it's hard  like going back over a washedout road
The mind in concentration is like genuine silver malleable and white because nothing else is adulterating it
We can make it into whatever we want easily and quickly without having to waste time placing it in a crucible and heating it to get rid of the impurities
The mind not in concentration is like imitation or adulterated silver hard brittle and black because it's mixed with copper or lead
The more the impurities the lower its value
A pure mind is thus like genuine silver
The various thoughts that darken the mind are like the impurities that make the silver black brittle and dull
So if we let thoughts get mixed up in the mind we turn the mind into imitation silver
We won't be able to find any purity in it at all
When this is the case the mind will have no stillness
But if we brush away the various thoughts and preoccupations adulterating the mind it will become firmly established in concentration in line with the factors of the path
Once the mind turns into the path we have to watch over it carefully in the same way that we try to keep a road from washing out
We have to survey it continually to see where it's getting rutted or forming potholes
Wherever it needs repairing we fix it right away
If we don't fix it immediately and let it get full of potholes or wash away it'll be really hard to repair
Once the mind is following the path any Hindrances that interfere are a break in the road
If we don't hurry up and repair it the break will get wider and deeper until the road turns into an ordinary piece of ground
So while you're trying to develop the path if you let yourself be forgetful  if you let your mindfulness lapse letting distractions into the mind  the state of mind that forms the path will immediately be destroyed
Your meditation will be spoiled your concentration will be spoiled the mind will return to its ordinary state and won't be able to find the path to genuine goodness
While we're sitting in concentration if our mind doesn't stay with the body in the present it's as if we've earned some food but don't watch over it
Dogs and cats are bound to come and eat it
The dogs and cats here are the five Hindrances  sensual desire ill will torpor  lethargy restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty  that we like to keep as our pets
As soon as our back is turned they're going to sneak in and eat up our food  the happiness and inner worth that we should have received from our practice
Being lost is better than being asleep
Being aware even if you have defilements is better than being absentminded
If you know you have defilements you can work to end them
A person who's not aware is dead
If your mind doesn't stay in one place it's like standing on a lawn If you stand in ten different places the grass will grow in all ten places because first you stand here for a while and then go stand there for a while and then go stand over there
If you don't stay long in any one place grass will grow everywhere
But if you really stand still in one place how will the grass grow there
No grass will be able to grow on the spot where the soles of your feet are standing
In the same way if your mind stands firm in one place always mindful of the inandout breath no Hindrances or defilements will be able to arise
The path we're following is a shortcut
It's a path worn smooth
Following a smooth path means that there are no weeds growing on it no obstacles in our way no need to stop here and there and slow down our progress
The reason we don't yet know how to follow this path is because we don't know how to walk
We walk like people in general all over the world going forward turning back looking left and right
This is why we keep running into one another all the time falling down and then picking ourselves back up
Sometimes even when nobody runs into us we stagger
Even when nobody trips us up we fall
Sometimes we get lazy and lie down to rest
Sometimes we stop to look at things we meet along the way
This way we never get to the goal because we aren't really intent on walking
We wander here and there without following the path
So we have to learn a new way to walk the Buddha's way
What is the Buddha's way
The Buddha's way of walking is to walk like a soldier
Soldiers don't stagger back and forth the way we do
They walk standing up straight staying in place stamping their feet on the ground
This way they don't get tired because they don't have to go far
If we were to walk in place for three hours the grass beneath our feet would be flattened out
Any grass that tried to grow in its place wouldn't be able to get above ground level
It's the same with the work we're doing right now being mindful to focus on the breath
If we're really intent on it focusing our attention solely on the breath without letting it wander off and disappear all the various Hindrances  thoughts of past and future good and bad  won't be able to reach in to touch us
All the Hindrances which are like grass will have to be flattened out
No evil unskillful thoughts will be able to appear in the heart
When this is the case the mind won't have to follow the paths to deprivation and instead will keep following the path that goes higher and higher
This is called following the path worn smooth in line with the Buddha's way
Practicing meditation is like digging a diamond mine
The body is like a big rock mindfulness is like a shovel
If you don't really dig  ie if you dig little shallow holes here and there instead of digging away at one place  you can dig for a month and yet get no deeper than your knees
But if you're really intent on digging away at one place the hole you dig will keep getting deeper and deeper until you get down to the rock
Now when stupid people hit the rock they throw down their shovels and run away
As for intelligent people when they meet up with the rock they keep chipping away at it until they get past it and that's when they find the valuable diamond that lies on the underside of the rock
If it's a diamond seam they won't have to work again for the rest of their lives
Gems and diamonds that are really valuable lie deep so we'll have to dig deep if we want to find things of value
If we don't go far beneath the surface we'll end up with dirt and sand that sells for only five cents a bushel
When we're true in what we do  when we don't stop or grow lax or give up  the results even if they show up slowly are bound to be great
The fact that they are all growing at once is what makes them slow
It's like a tree with lots of branches to protect itself and give lots of shade
It's bound to grow more slowly than a banana tree which has only one stem and gives good fruit but is exposed to lots of dangers
Some people get results quickly others more slowly
The slower people shouldn't compare themselves or compete with the quick ones
The quick ones shouldn't compete with the slow ones
It's like polishing boards and mirrors
Polishing a mirror so that you can see your reflection in it doesn't take all that much talent because the nature of the mirror is already reflective
But to polish a board so that you can see your reflection in it even though it may take a long time is a sign of real expertise
In keeping the mind pure we have to cut away perceptions so that they don't stick in the heart
It's like looking after a white sheet that we spread on our bed
We have to watch out for the dust or insects that blow in on the wind and land on the sheet
If we see any dust we have to take the sheet and shake it out
Wherever there are any stains we have to launder it immediately
Don't let them stay long on the sheet or else they'll be hard to wash out
If there are any insects we have to remove them for they may bite us and give us a rash or keep us from sleeping soundly
When we keep looking after our sheet in this way it will have to stay clean and white and be a comfortable place for us to sleep
The dust and insects here are the Hindrances that are the enemies of the heart
We have to look after our heart in just the same way that we look after our bedding
We can't let any outside perceptions come in and stick to the heart or nibble at it
We have to brush them all away
That way the mind will become calm free from distractions
Once you cut off thoughts of past and future you don't have to worry about the Hindrances
When you think about things outside you have to choose carefully what you're going to think about
Think only about good things and not about things that will cause harm
When you think about things inside though you can think about anything good or bad old or new
In other words mindfulness and alertness can handle whatever comes their way
It's as if we have our curry in a pot that's tightly covered where no flies can get to it
Whether it's bland or salty it's all safe to eat
Thinking about is long
Thinking of is short
You have to focus them both into one when you're making the mind still
Thinking of means that you focus on a single preoccupation
Thinking about means that you examine and evaluate to see that when you arrange the causes a certain way what results do you get good or bad
If you look with both of your eyes you won't be able to see your target clearly
If you want to see it clearly you have to look with one eye in the same way that when people shoot a rifle or an arrow they use only one eye to aim
If you make your mind one with its object you'll be able to see things clearly within yourself in just the same way
You have to practice concentration in all four postures
When the body sits the mind sits with it
When the body stands the mind stands with it
When the body walks the mind walks with it
When the body lies down the mind lies down with it
If the body sits but the mind stands or if the body walks and the mind sits or lies down that's no good at all
The six elements in the body are earth water fire wind space and consciousness
You have to keep familiarizing yourself with them until they become your friends
They'll then tell you their secrets and won't put you in chains or throw you in prison
The mind is like a child
Mindfulness is like an adult
The adult is responsible for looking after the child and taking good care of it
Only then will the child eat and sleep properly without crying and making a fuss
You have to give the child good food to eat by focusing the mind on the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
Then you have to give it four big dolls to play with the properties of earth water fire and wind in the body
When the child is wellfed and has dolls to play with it won't run outside and get into mischief
If you let it go wandering outside all kinds of dangers can happen
But if it stays in the house even though there are some dangers they're not all that serious
You have to teach the mind how to play around in the elements of this body a cubit wide a span thick a fathom long
That way it won't get into trouble
Once the child gets tired of playing it will lie in its crib
In other words the mind will settle down in jhana the resting place of sages
That way the mind will gather into oneness
When the body is still you gain knowledge from the body
When the mind is still you gain knowledge from the mind
When the breath is still you gain knowledge from the breath
Ordinary everyday breathing doesn't do anything special for you except keep you from dying
The breathing on which your awareness is intent can give rise to all kinds of good things
Ordinary breathing is the breath of suffering and stress
In other words when it comes in it reaches a point of discomfort so it has to go back out
When it goes out it runs into discomfort again so it comes back in
This kind of breathing isn't called meditation
Meditation means gathering all your awareness into the mind
The present aspect of the body is the breath
The present aspect of the mind is mindfulness and alertness
So bring the present of the mind together with the present of the body
The breath is like water
Mindfulness is like soap
The mind is like clothing
If you don't keep washing the mind it'll get dirty
When your clothing isn't white and clean it doesn't feel comfortable to wear
Don't put pressure on the breath force it or hold it
Let the breath flow easily and comfortably as when you put a fresh egg in cotton batting
If you don't throw it or push it down the egg won't get dented or cracked
This way your meditation will progress smoothly
If the mind isn't yet still just watch the inandout breath without trying to notice whether it's comfortable or not
Otherwise the mind will start to stray
It's like a farmer planting an orchard If he mows down too much grass all at once he won't be able to plant all his trees in time and the grass will start growing again
He has to mow down just the area that he can plant in one day
That's how he'll get the results he wants
Whether or not the breath is even you have to keep your mindfulness even
The breath is like waves
Mindfulness is like a boat
The mind is like a person sitting in the boat
If the waves of the breath aren't still the boat will tip or overturn and the person in the boat will drown or at the least get into difficulties
You have to make your mind still like a boat that has cast anchor in the middle of the sea when there's no wind or waves
The boat won't tip and the person in the boat will be still and at peace
This is the point where the mind enters the noble path It's a free mind with full power released from the sway of the Hindrances
The breath in the body isn't limited just to the breath that flows in and out the nose
The breath in the body spreads out to every pore like the vapor that gets exhaled from an ice cube
It's much more refined than the air outside
When the internal breath goes out the pores it gets reflected back into the body
This breath is called the supporting breath
It helps keep the body and mind cool and still
So when you breathe in let the breath fill the inside of your body when you breathe out let it spread in all directions
When you breathe in you have to feel the effects of the inner breath in three parts of the body the lungs  heart the liver stomach  intestines and the rib cage  spine
If the breath doesn't have an effect all over the body you're not getting the full results of concentration
Hot breathing is destructive
It gives rise to pain and makes the body age
Cool breathing is constructive
Warm breathing is like medicine
The common breath is like an emetic
The refined breathed is like a curative
The intermediate breath is like a food supplement
The common breath is long and slow
The refined breath is short and light
It can penetrate into every blood vessel
It's a breath of extremely high quality
If the breath is heavy you can keep it in a narrow range
When it's light you have to make it broad
If it's so light that it's very refined you don't have to breathe through the nose
You can be aware of the breath coming in and out through every pore all over the body
Wherever there's pain in the body focus on making the breath go past it if you want to get results
Suppose you have a pain in your knee You have to focus on breathing all the way down to the ends of your toes
If you have a pain in your shoulder focus the breath past it to your arm
Breath subdues pain
Mindfulness subdues the Hindrances
When we meditate it's as if we were milling the rice grains in our granary so that they'll be ready to cook
The mind is like grains of rice
The Hindrances are like the husks
We have to crack the husks and then polish away the dirty red skin underneath
That's when we'll end up with good white rice
The way to polish is to use directed thought and evaluation
Directed thought is when we focus the mind on being aware of the inandout breath which is like taking a handful of rice and putting it in the teeth of our mill
We have to make sure that the teeth of the mill are in good shape
If we're aware of just the inbreath and then get distracted with the outbreath it's as if the teeth of our mill were broken
When this happens we have to fix them immediately
In other words we reestablish mindfulness on the breath and brush away all other perceptions
Evaluation is being observant taking careful note of the breath as we breathe in to see what it's like to see whether it's comfortable easy and freeflowing
We then let the good breaths spread throughout the body to chase out the bad breath sensations
All the properties of the body will become pure the mind will become bright
The body will feel cool and at ease
We have to look after the breath in this way in the same way that we catch baby chicks to put in the coop
If we hold them too tight they die
If we hold them too loosely they run away
We have to gather them in our hands in a way that's just right
That way they'll all end up safely in the coop
When we use directed thought and evaluation it's as if we polish away the dirty red skin from our rice grains
We'll end up with nice white rice
If we take the rice to market it'll fetch a good price
If we cook it it will taste good and nourish the body
This is why we should all be intent on polishing the rice in our granary so that we'll end up with Grade A rice
The factors of jhana  directed thought evaluation rapture and pleasure  all have to be gathered at the breath if you want to reach singleness of preoccupation
Directed thought is like laying claim to a piece of land
Evaluation is like planting it with seed
When the seed bears fruit that's rapture and pleasure
Keeping awareness with the breath is directed thought
Knowing the characteristics of the breath is evaluation
Spreading the breath so that it permeates and fills the entire body is rapture
The sense of serenity and wellbeing in body and mind is pleasure
When the mind is freed from the Hindrances so that it's one with the breath that's singleness of preoccupation
All of these factors of jhana turn mindfulness into a factor of Awakening
Spreading the breath letting all the breath sensations spread throughout all the elements and parts of the body  the blood vessels the tendons etc
 is like cutting a system of connecting roads through the wilderness
Any country with a good system of roads is bound to develop because communication is easy
If we constantly adjust and improve the breath in the various parts of the body it's like cutting away the dead parts of a plant so that it can begin to grow again
Directed thought focusing on the breath is like putting food in your mouth
Evaluation  adjusting spreading and improving the breath  is like chewing your food
If you chew it carefully before swallowing the food will digest easily and give full benefits to your body
The digesting is the duty of the body but if you want to get good results you have to help with the chewing
The more refined you can make the breath the better the results you'll get
There are two kinds of evaluation when we meditate on the breath
The first is to evaluate the inandout breath
The second is to evaluate the inner breath sensations in the body until you can spread them out through all the properties of the body to the point where you forget all distractions
If both the body and mind are full there's a sense of rapture and ease that results from our directed thought and evaluation
This is Right Action in the mind
One of the benefits from working with the breath is that the properties of the body become friendly and harmonious with one another
We spread the breath all over the body and then when it grows still it gives you a sense of physical seclusion
This is one of the physical benefits
As for the mental benefits mindfulness becomes enlarged
When mindfulness is enlarged awareness is enlarged
The mind becomes an adult and doesn't go sneaking off like an ordinary mind
If you want it to think it thinks
If you want it to stop it stops
If you want it to go it goes
When the mind is welltrained it gains knowledge like an educated adult
When you converse with it you understand each other
The mind of a person who hasn't trained it is like a child
This kind of mind doesn't understand what you say and likes to slip off to roam around  and it goes without saying goodbye
You have no idea what it takes with it when it goes or what it brings back when it returns
When the breath mindfulness and awareness are all enlarged they all become adults
They don't get into spats with one another the body doesn't quarrel with the mind mindfulness doesn't quarrel with the mind
That's when we can be at our ease
When you spread the breath as you evaluate it mindfulness runs throughout the body like an electric wire
Making yourself mindful is like letting the current run along the wire
Alertness is like the energy that wakes the body up
When the body is awake pains can't overcome it
In other words it wakes up the properties of earth water fire and wind so that they get to work
When the properties are balanced and full they put the body at ease
When the body is nourished with breath and mindfulness like this it grows into an adult
When the properties are at peace they all become adults the great frame of reference
This is called threshold concentration or evaluation
When the mind is broad wandering after outside perceptions it loses the strength it needs to deal with its various affairs
Whatever it thinks of doing will succeed only with difficulty
It's like a gun with a broadgauged barrel
If you put tiny bullets into it they rattle around inside and don't come out with much force
The narrower the gauge of the barrel the more force the bullets will have when you shoot them
It's the same with the breath The more you refine your focus the more refined the breath will become until eventually you can breathe through your pores
The mind at this stage has more strength than an atomic bomb
Making the mind snug with mindfulness and the breath is like weaving cloth
If the weave is so fine that water won't pass through the cloth will fetch a high price
If you use it to sift flour you'll get very fine flour
If the weave is coarse the cloth won't be worth much
If you use it to sift flour the flour will come out all lumpy
In the same way the more refined you can make your awareness the more refined and valuable the results you'll get
When the breath fills the body awareness gets more refined
The breath that used to be fast will slow down
If it used to be strong it will become more gentle
If it used to be heavy it will grow light  to the point where you don't have to breathe because the body is full of breath with no empty spaces
It's like water we pour into a vessel until it's full
That's the point of enough you don't have to add any more
This sense of fullness gives rise to a feeling of coolness and clarity
There are five levels to the breath
The first level is the most blatant one the breath that we breathe in and out
The second level is the breath that goes past the lungs and connects with the various properties of the body giving rise to a sense of comfort or discomfort
The third level is the breath that stays in place throughout the body
It doesn't flow here or there
The breath sensations that used to flow up and down the body stop flowing
The sensations that used to run to the front or the back stop running
Everything stops and is still
The fourth level is the breath that gives rise to a sense of coolness and light
The fifth level is the really refined breath so refined that it's like atoms
It can penetrate the entire world
Its power is very fast and strong
The most refined level of awareness which is like atoms has the same sort of power as an atomic bomb buried underground that can explode people and animals to smithereens
When the refined mind is buried in the breath it can explode people and animals to smithereens too
What this means is that when the mind reaches this level of refinement its sense of self and other disappears without a trace
It lets go of its attachments to body and self people and beings This is why we say that it's like an atomic bomb that can explode people and animals to smithereens
Momentary concentration is like a house roofed with thatch its posts are made out of softwood
Momentary concentration isn't jhana
Threshold concentration is like a house made out of hardwood with a tile roof
Fixed penetration is like an immovable concrete building
This is where we become one in a single preoccupation on the single or direct path
It's like sitting alone in a chair or lying alone on a bed without anyone trying to come and take up our space or like being alone in a room without anyone else coming in to disturb us
When we're alone in a room we can be at our ease
We can even take off our clothes if we like
We can behave with good manners or bad and no one will complain
This is why a mind with jhana as its dwelling can be at its ease
It has a deep well so that it can get plenty of water  to the point where it can drop directed thought and evaluation leaving nothing but pleasure This is where feeling becomes your frame of reference
The body feels full
All four properties  earth water fire and wind  feel full
When the mind feels full in this way nothing is lacking
That's rapture
You don't want any more of the four properties
When the mind soaks for a long time in this sense of rapture it's like something you've soaked in water for a long time The water is bound to permeate it to a point of saturation
This sense of rapture is the second jhana
When the sense of rapture begins to move you don't feel at ease in the same way as when a boat begins to sway you want to get back on land
So once rapture fills the body you let go of it leaving nothing but pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
When the mind has soaked itself in pleasure to a point of saturation it lets go leaving an empty sense of equanimity
When the mind is really empty it feels spacious and light
The more it soaks in equanimity the more still it gets giving rise to an inner sense of light
When the light is really intense you arrive at Right Mindfulness
Directed thought  focusing on the breath without getting distracted  is like planting a tree
Evaluation is like loosening the soil around the roots giving it fertilizer and watering it from the roots to the topmost branches
The body which can be compared to the soil will soften allowing the fertilizer and water to penetrate down to the roots
Rapture is like the tree's being fresh and green and bursting into bloom
an unusual sense of heaviness or lightness in the body a sense of the body floating a sense of coolness or heat a sense of thrill passing over the surface of the body the body beginning to sway Pleasure means stillness of body and mind free from Hindrances
Singleness of preoccupation means being neutral toward other things perfectly still in a single preoccupation
This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said that concentration matured with virtue is of great benefit great rewards
Directed thought is like standing and looking out a window
Whoever walks past we know but we don't call out to them or turn to look after them as they walk down the road
We simply stand perfectly still at the window
Directed thought and evaluation applied to the breath are like car mechanics
The mind is like the head mechanic
When we drive our car we have to be observant and keep checking all the mechanical parts  such as the steering wheel the springs the tires the gas line  to see if anything is wearing out or not working properly
If we find that anything is not working properly we have to fix it immediately
That way the car will take us safely to our destination
When you practice concentration you have to be observant checking your breath to see whether or not it's coming in smoothly and adjusting it to make it comfortable
Your concentration will then progress step by step and ultimately take you to the transcendent
When people criticize you saying that you're in a blind state of jhana it's still better than having no jhana to be in
And if they say that you're like a baby chick that hasn't come out of its egg that's okay too
When a baby chick is still in the egg no hawk can swoop down on it and catch it
When it comes out of the egg is when it becomes prey
They may say that you're sitting in stump concentration but don't pay them any mind because stumps can have their uses
Sometimes they grow new branches with tender leaves you can eat
But if the stump catches fire and burns to a crisp that's no good at all
As we keep training the mind it keeps getting more and more mature more tempered and sharp able to cut right through anything at all
Like a knife that we always keep sharpening There's no way it can not become sharp
So we should keep at the practice in the same way that we sharpen a knife
If any part of the body or mind isn't in good shape we keep adjusting it until we get good results
When good results arise we'll be in a state of Right Concentration
The mind will be firmly established in the present in a state of singleness of preoccupation
We'll gain power both in body and mind
Power in body means that wherever there are pains we can adjust the properties of earth water fire and wind to give rise to a sense of comfort in the same way that we trim a tree
If any branches are broken or rotten we cut them away and graft on new branches
If the new ones break we graft on more new ones
We keep on doing this until the tree is healthy and strong
Making the mind still is good for two things suppressing and cutting
If we can't yet cut we can still suppress
Suppressing means that there are defilements in the mind but we don't let them flare up into action
We keep them in line
Cutting means that we don't even let them arise
In putting the mind in shape we have to be observant to see what things need correcting what things need fostering what things need letting go
If you do nothing but correcting it won't work
The same holds true for just letting go
We do whatever the practice requires
When the mind is in concentration it doesn't get distracted by any thoughts that come passing by
It's like a person entirely focused on his work If anyone walks by and tries to strike up a conversation he doesn't want to respond or even look up from his work
In the same way when the mind has really cut away its outside preoccupations it's bound to stay entirely in the object of its meditation
The mind full of defilements is like salt water in the ocean
You have to use a lot of directed thought and evaluation to filter and distill the mind to the point where the salt water turns into rain water
People in the world are like people floating in boats in the middle of the sea when it's filled with waves and monsoon winds
Some people are so far out that they can't even see land
Some are bobbing up and down sometimes able to see land and sometimes not
This stands for people who are meditating buddho Others are beginning to come into harbor where they can see fish traps sailboats and the green trees on the coast
Some have swum in so far that they're almost ashore but not quite
As for the Buddha he's like someone who has reached the shore and is standing on the land free from every kind of danger
He sees all the perils that human beings are subject to and so he feels compassion for us trying to help us reach the shore and escape from the dangers at sea
This is why he teaches us to develop generosity virtue and meditation which are things that are going to pull us safely to solid ground
When we develop the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha within ourselves we won't have to suffer
We make the mind into Dhamma and the various defilements that spoil it will disappear
This is how we can escape from the sea
Once we get on land we can have lots of fun because there are a lot of things we never saw at sea
It's like when we come into the mouth of the Chao Phraya River where there are marsh trees and fresh green plants
We become enchanted and keep walking further inland to Sukhumvit Road
There we see bicycles and trucks and jeeps and pretty automobiles of different colors
This gets us even more excited and some of us get smitten with what we see on land
In other words we fall for the visions and signs that come in meditation
For instance we may begin to remember previous lifetimes
If we remember bad things we become sad
If we remember good things we get happy
This turns into craving the desire to be this or that and some people get really deluded thinking that they actually are the things they see
If our discernment isn't strong enough then whatever we see will turn into the corruptions of insight  like people who get all excited the first time they see a car
They go running to the car wanting to ride in it wanting to drive it but without looking right or left or stopping to take note of anything
They run right out into the middle of the road get run over and either die or break an arm or a leg
After all the trouble they went to in order to get out of the sea they get deluded and put themselves in danger all over again
But if our discernment is strong enough whatever we see will turn into noble treasures
If we see a forest of marsh tress we can put them to use
We can cut them into firewood to use ourselves or sell in the market
If the land is a tangle of weeds we can clear it and turn it into fields
If we don't let it lie fallow it's sure to yield crops
Falling for visions is also called skewed perception The right way to act when you see a vision is to remember to evaluate it and then let it go in line with its true nature
Don't latch onto what you see because all things are inconstant
If you're born poor you suffer from your desire to be rich
If you're born rich you suffer in looking after your possessions afraid that they'll wear out afraid that you'll get cheated out of them afraid that thieves will break in and steal them
There's nothing certain or dependable at all
The same holds true with visions
So whatever you see you have to let it go in line with its nature
Leave the trees in the forest the grass in the meadows and the rice in the fields
If you can do this you can be at your ease because you know what it's like on land what it's like in the water when to get in and when to get out
Once you're skilled you can travel on water or land at your ease in every way
You can go forward or back without any obstacles
This is called lokavidu knowing the world
You can stay with what you know but you're not stuck on it
You can live in the ocean without drowning
You can live in the world without getting sunk in the world  like a lotus leaf in the water the water doesn't seep into the leaf at all
When you're true in what you do your work will succeed in every way
For instance if you're true in observing the precepts your precepts will get results
If you're true in practicing concentration your concentration will get results
If you're true in developing discernment your discernment will get results
The reason we don't see results is because we're not true in what we do
Only five precepts and yet we can't catch them by the head or the tail
And when this is the case how can we ever hope to make a living at anything
Only four concentrations  the four stages of jhana  and yet we keep groping around and can't find them
There are people who can manage farms covering hundreds and thousands of acres and yet we can't even manage just four concentrations
Isn't that embarrassing
If we aren't true to the Buddha's teachings in our thoughts and actions the results of our not being true will keep pushing us further and further away from the Dhamma
We'll have to be hungry and suffer in various ways
For this reason the Buddha taught us to be true in whatever we do
When we're true in this way then even though we live in the world we can be at our ease
We know how to flush the suffering out of our heart to the point where the body feels comfortable in every part
Peace and calm depend on the heart's having enough and being full
If the heart is full external fires won't be able to seep into it
When the body is filled with mindfulness then where will there be anything lacking in the heart
This is why if we want to be full we have to make an effort at developing our meditation as much as possible
Rapture will then arise
When rapture arises we're not stuck on it because we realize that it's undependable
It eventually has to fade away
So we let go of the rapture
When we let go of the rapture the mind is at ease in a sense of pleasure
This sense of pleasure and ease is much more refined and profound than rapture with none of its active symptoms
Rapture is like a person who's pleased by something and so shows it by smiling or laughing
As for pleasure it doesn't have any external signs
It's hidden in the heart as when a person is very rich but doesn't show his wealth in any way that people would catch on
This pleasure is what calms the mind
If it were to show itself externally it wouldn't serve any purpose
Pleasure of this sort can cool the heart and give it respite and this is what leads to stillness and peace
When the mind is at peace it grows bright and clear just like a sea without any waves You can see the boats ten miles away
Whatever comes from the north south east or west you can see it clearly without having to use a spyglass
Our vision goes out further than normal
This is how we give rise to vipassana or the insight that allows us to know and see the truths of the world
If we have a coconut crack it open and eat the flesh it fills us up only once
If we forego eating it and plant it in the ground until it grows into a tree with more coconuts then take those coconuts and plant them eventually we'll become coconut plantation millionaires
If we get money and simply stash it away it won't serve any purpose and the day will come when it's no longer safe
So we have to find the right place to put it by making donations to the religion
That's when it will give rise to further results
If the mind goes no further than concentration it simply gets a sense of ease
We have to invest that stillness in giving rise to discernment
That's when we'll meet with the highest happiness
If the mind has a sense of inner fullness then when we associate with other people they'll pick up on that sense of fullness as well
If we're miserable then when we associate with other people we'll make them miserable too
If we can develop the power of the mind we can send thoughts of good will to help lessen the sufferings of other people
But if we don't straighten ourselves out first we can't really help anyone else in the same way that a crazy person can't help another crazy person become sane
If we're on fire and other people are on fire how can we help them
We have to put out our own fires first before we can help them cool down
We have to have before we can give
When you keep the breath in mind you get all four frames of reference in one
The breath is body feelings lie in the body the mind lies in the body mental qualities lie in the mind
The four frames of reference when we sit in meditation The breath is body comfort and discomfort are feeling purity and clarity are states of mind and steadiness of mind is mental quality
When practicing concentration we have to imbue it with the four paths to success
Chanda Have a friendly interest in the breath keeping track of it to see when we breathe in what we breathe in with it
If we don't breathe out we'll have to die
If we breathe out but don't breathe back in we'll have to die as well
We keep focused on this without focusing the mind on anything else
Viriya Be diligent in all affairs related to the breath
You have to be intent that Now I'm going to breathe in now I'm going to breathe out I'm going to make it long short heavy light cool warm etc You have to be in charge of the breath
Citta Focus intently on the breath
Be observant of how the external breath comes in and connects with the internal breath in the upper middle and lower parts of the body in the chest  the lungs the heart the ribs the backbone in the abdomen  stomach liver kidneys intestines the breath that goes out the ends of the fingers and toes and out every pore
Vimansa Contemplate and evaluate the breath that comes in to nourish the body to see whether it fills the body to see whether it feels easy and natural to see if there are any parts where you still have to adjust it
Notice the characteristics of how the external breath strikes the internal breath to see if they connect everywhere or not to see how the effects of the breath on the properties of earth water and fire arise remain and pass away
All of this comes under meditation on physical events and qualifies as the great frame of reference as well
When the mind has fully developed the four paths to success complete with mindfulness and alertness the results in terms of the body are the stilling of pain
In terms of the mind they can lead all the way to the transcendent the stages of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship
If you really develop concentration it will result in the five kinds of strength conviction when you gain conviction in the results you see coming from your efforts then persistence arises without anyone having to force you
From there mindfulness becomes more comprehensive in what you are doing concentration becomes firmly established in what you are doing giving rise to discernment of all things right and wrong
Altogether these are called the five strengths
Tranquillity meditation is a mind snug in a single preoccupation
It doesn't establish contact with anything else it keeps itself cleansed of outside preoccupations
Insight meditation is when the mind lets go of all preoccupations in a state of allaround mindfulness and alertness
When tranquillity imbued with insight arises in the mind five faculties arise and become dominant all at once Saddhindriya Your conviction becomes solid and strong
Whatever anyone else may say good or bad your mind isn't affected
Viriyindriya Your persistence becomes resilient
Whether anyone teaches you the path or not you keep at it constantly without flagging or getting discouraged
Satindriya Mindfulness becomes dominant enlarged in the great frame of reference
You don't have to force it
It spreads all over the body in the same way that the branches of a large tree protect the entire trunk without anyone having to pull them down or shake them up
Awareness becomes entirely radiant in every posture sitting standing walking and lying down
It knows on its own without your having to think
This allaround awareness is what is meant by the great frame of reference
Samadhindriya Your concentration becomes dominant too
Whatever you're doing the mind doesn't waver or stray
Even if you're talking to the point where your mouth opens a meter wide the mind is still at normalcy
If the body wants to eat lie down sit stand walk run think whatever that's its business
Or if any part of it gets weary or pained again that's its business but the mind remains straight and set still in a single preoccupation without straying off into anything else
Paññindriya Discernment becomes dominant within you as well to the point where you can make the mind attain streamentry oncereturning nonreturning or even arahantship
In order to divest our hearts of sights sounds smells tastes etc we have to develop concentration which is composed of seven basic qualities 
Analysis of present qualities as a factor of Awakening We let the breath spread throughout the body making an enlarged frame of reference
We know how to adjust improve choose and use our breaths so that they give us comfort
We throw out whichever breaths are harmful and foster whichever ones are beneficial
Persistence as a factor of Awakening We don't abandon or forget the breath
We stick with it and it sticks with us as we keep warding the Hindrances from the heart
We don't fasten on or become involved with distracting perceptions
We keep trying to make our stillness of mind stronger and stronger
Rapture as a factor of Awakening When the mind is quiet the breath is full and refreshing
We're free from the Hindrances and from every sort of restlessness like a white cloth that's spotlessly clean
When the mind is clear in this way it feels nothing but comfort and fullness which gives rise to a sense of satisfaction termed rapture
Serenity as a factor of Awakening The breath is solid throughout the body
The elements are at peace and so is the mind
Nothing feels troublesome or aroused
Concentration as a factor of Awakening The breath is firm steady and unwavering
The mind takes a firm stance in a single preoccupation
Equanimity as a factor of Awakening When body feelings mind and mental qualities are fully snug with one another in these two types of breath  when the mind stays with these aspects of the breath  it doesn't have to fashion anything at all
It doesn't latch onto any manifestation of good or bad
Neutral and unperturbed it doesn't approve or disapprove of anything
Make a resolution intending to keep mindfulness and alertness firmly focused
Keep continual watch over the mind to keep it with the breath in line with your original intention
Keep warding off the Hindrances the various distractions that will come to spoil the energy of your concentration
This is mindfulness as a factor of Awakening
Once the breath is well cleansed and purified let this purified breath spread to care for the body throughout its various parts
Once the body is nourished with this purified breath it becomes purified as well
Our words and thoughts become purified too
What we experience now is pleasure and ease
Or if you want to use the breath to care for any particular part of the body  a great deal or a little heavily or lightly blatantly or subtly  you can do so as you like
This is analysis of present qualities as a factor of Awakening
Tend to the breath keeping watch over the mind not letting it stray off in search of other preoccupations that would break your original resolution
Don't grow discouraged in the face of weariness or difficulties for body or mind
Be resolved on cutting away obstacles whatever direction they may come from even if you have to put your life on the line
This is persistence as a factor of Awakening
When these first three qualities are fully developed and pure they give rise to a feeling of brightness fullness and satisfaction
The breath is full
This is the breath of cognitive skill
In other words the breath lies under the direction of mindfulness
This is rapture as a factor of Awakening
When the mind stays with the full breath it doesn't waver or loosen its grip in the wake of any passing distractions as when sounds strike the ear and so forth
Feelings are still experienced as they are felt but at this point they don't give rise to craving attachment states of being or birth
Awareness is simply aware
This is serenity as a factor of Awakening
When awareness is solid and sure radiant and full in every way knowledge arises
We both know and see what our present condition comes from and where it will go
We see this so clearly that we will perceive kamma and its results both in ourselves and other people
This is concentration as a factor of Awakening
Once the mind has followed these steps from the first to the sixth and then lets go to be still with a spacious sense of relaxation not fastening onto any sign preoccupation or anything at all that's equanimity as a factor of Awakening
When we understand all seven of these qualities and can develop them in full measure within the heart they all come together at a single point in a single moment
The reason we're taught to develop these seven qualities in our breathing is so that we can still the feelings within us  because feelings lie at the essence of the Hindrances
The Hindrances are the breath impregnated with ignorance and darkness
When this happens we're like a person standing in the darkness who can't see himself or anyone else because we lie fermenting in our defilements full of conditions
This is the ordinary breath untended and undirected
It's full all right but full of darkness
This state is the important one that cuts and closes off our path
Only when we get rid of these Hindrances will the mind be radiant and bright seeing the Dhamma clearly in terms of both cause and effect
When mindfulness saturates the body the way flame saturates every thread in the mantle of a Coleman lantern the elements throughout the body work together like a group of people working together on a job Each person helps a little here and there and in no time at all  almost effortlessly  the job is done
Just as the mantle of a Coleman lantern whose every thread is soaked in flame becomes light white and dazzling so if you soak your mind in mindfulness until it's aware of the entire body both the body and mind become buoyant
When you think using the power of mindfulness your sense of the body will immediately become thoroughly bright helping to develop both body and mind
You'll be able to sit or stand for long periods of time without getting tired to walk for great distances without getting fatigued to go for unusually long periods of time on just a little food without getting hungry or to go without food and sleep altogether for several days running without losing energy
As for the heart it will become pure open and free from blemish
The mind will become bright energetic and strong
Saddhabalam Your conviction will run like a car running without stop along the road
Viriyabalam Your persistence will accelerate and advance
Satibalam Your mindfulness will be robust and vigorous
Samadhibalam Your concentration will become unwavering and resilient
No activity will be able to kill it
In other words no matter what you're doing  sitting standing walking talking whatever  as soon as you think of practicing concentration your mind will immediately be centered
Whenever you want it just think of it and you have it
When your concentration is this powerful insight meditation is no problem
Paññabalam Your discernment will be like a doubleedged sword Your discernment of what's outside will be sharp
Your discernment of what's inside will be sharp
When these five strengths appear in the heart the heart will be fully mature
Your conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment will all be mature and preeminent in their own spheres
It's the nature of mature adults that they cooperate
When they work together on a job they finish it
So it is when you have these five adults working together for you You'll be able to complete any task
Your mind will have the power to demolish every defilement in the heart just as a nuclear bomb can demolish anything anywhere in the world
When your concentration has strength it gives rise to discernment the ability to see stress its cause its disbanding and the Path to its disbanding all clearly within the breath
We can explain this as follows The inandout breath is stress  the inbreath the stress of arising the outbreath the stress of passing away
Not being aware of the breath as it goes in and out not knowing the characteristics of the breath This is the cause of stress
Knowing when the breath is coming in knowing when it's going out knowing its characteristics clearly  ie keeping your views in line with the truth of the breath This is Right View part of the Noble Path
Knowing which ways of breathing are uncomfortable knowing how to vary the breath knowing That way of breathing is uncomfortable we'll have to breathe like this in order to feel at ease This is Right Consideration
The mental factors that think about and properly evaluate all aspects of the breath are Right Speech
Knowing various ways of improving the breath breathing for example in long and out long in short and out short in short and out long in long and out short until you come across the breath that's most comfortable for you This is Right Action
Knowing how to use the breath to purify the blood how to let this purified blood nourish the heart muscles how to adjust the breath so that it eases the body and soothes the mind how to breathe so that you feel full and refreshed in body and mind This is Right Livelihood
Trying to adjust the breath so that it comforts the body and mind and to keep trying as long as you aren't fully at ease This is Right Effort
Being mindful of the inandout breath at all times knowing the various aspects of the breath  the upflowing breath the downflowing breath the breath in the stomach the breath in the intestines the breath flowing along the muscles and out to every pore  keeping track of these things with every inandout breath This is Right Mindfulness
A mind intent only on matters of the breath not pulling any other objects in to interfere until the breath is refined giving rise to fixed absorption and then liberating insight This is Right Concentration
When all of these aspects of the Noble Path  virtue concentration and discernment  are brought together fully mature within the heart you gain insight into all aspects of the breath knowing that Breathing this way gives rise to good mental states breathing that way gives rise to bad mental states You let go of the factors  ie the breath in all its aspects  that fashion the body the factors that fashion speech the factors that fashion the mind whether good or bad letting them be as they truly are in line with their own inherent nature This is the disbanding of stress
Why did the Buddha grow weary of the world
Because he asked himself When we're born in the world what does the world have to offer that's really satisfying
Parents
Relatives
Servants
Friends
Wealth
There's nothing really satisfying about any of these things at all
When this is the case why should we put up with staying in the world This is why he went out into the homeless life so that he could find the way to keep us from having to come back and be reborn in the world
When we ordain we have to practice in line with the training rules the Buddha laid down if we want to live up to our name as Sons of the Sakyan
The Buddha's true children are the four groups of Noble Disciples streamwinners oncereturners nonreturners and arahants those who have released their hearts step by step from defilements and mental fermentations in line with their strength of mind
These are the religion's true relatives the Buddha's children who deserve to receive his inheritance without a doubt
This kind of ordination anyone can undergo  women men novices anyone
It's internal ordination
As for the monks who shave their heads and wear the ochre robe that's external ordination
Whoever can undergo both internal and external ordination so much the better
Whenever you find pleasure you should transform it so that it won't spoil on you
This is like the women who sell fruit in the market
When they see that their mangoes are getting overripe and they won't be able to eat them keep them overnight or sell them before they spoil they take them peel them cut them up and make them into jam
This way they can keep them for a long time
The jam tastes good and it can fetch a good price
This is called having the intelligence to keep ripe things from spoiling
In the same way when we gain pleasure we shouldn't get complacent
We should take that pleasure and pulverize it into pain so that we can uncover the kind of inner pleasure and wellbeing that doesn't change that's solid longlasting and valuable
For example there are monks and novices who find themselves wellprovided with the necessities of life that other people have given them without having to work hard the way lay people do  carrying loads and responsibilities taming the wilderness exposed to the sun and rain
All they have to do is harvest cooked rice and they can eat their fill
This is the kind of pleasure that comes with the renunciate life
But if monks like this get stuck on their material possessions  robes almsfood lodgings and medicine  without behaving themselves properly in line with the sacrifices that other people have made for their sake then they're not really contemplatives
They're simply taking advantage of their donors
So when you find that your needs are being taken care of you should take that sense of ease and pleasure and pulverize it into pain by putting effort into the practice sacrificing the pleasure you're receiving by taking on the dhutanga practices in line with the Buddha's example
This way you'll come to comprehend the pain and stress that are an inherent part of having a body
You should contemplate the pleasure you receive from others to realize that there's nothing of any lasting essence to it
The pleasure with a lasting essence has to be the type that you give rise to yourself
What this means is that you have to practice patience and endurance contending with the stress and pain that come from the body
When you can do this the mind will become steady and solid so strong that it rises step by step to higher levels
Eventually you'll come to realize the true pleasure and wellbeing that the Buddha called the highest form of happiness
Wherever you live you should take care of it as your home
Wherever you sleep you should take care of it as your home
Wherever you eat you should take care of it as your home
This way you can find happiness wherever you stay and wherever you go
Open your ears and eyes wide so that you can do a thorough job of helping to look after the monastery
Each of us should have big big eyes
When you stay here in the monastery your eyes have to be as big as the monastery and so do your ears
People who have a good opinion of themselves but aren't good in their behavior are burdensome and heavy causing cracks wherever they stay
This is why wise people are said to be light like cat's paws soft and furry with safe places to keep the claws until they're really needed
If they walk on a floor they don't make sound or leave any footprints
As for fools people who don't know how to behave themselves they're said to be like dog's paws
They're heavy
If they walk on a floor their claws make a noise and their paws leave prints
When we live together in a group like this there are bound to be all kinds of sounds when we come into contact with one another
If you were to make a comparison we're no different from an orchestra which has to include the sound of the oboes the sound of the gong the sound of the xylophones high sounds low sounds treble and bass
If all the instruments had the same sound there would be no fun in listening to the orchestra for a onesound orchestra wouldn't sound good at all
In the same way when lots of people live together there are bound to be good and bad sounds arising in the group
So each of us has to look after his or her own heart
Don't let yourself feel anger or dislike for the bad sounds because when there's a lot of disliking it's bound to turn to anger
When there's a lot of anger it's bound to turn to ill will
When there's ill will it's bound to lead to quarrels and disturbances
For this reason we should spread thoughts of good will to people above us below us and on the same level
When people below us show disagreeable attitudes in their words or actions we should forgive them
When we can do this we'll be contributing to the peace and calm of the group
Don't hang around with the group more than you have to or you'll waste your time for meditating
The dangers of associating are if your behavior isn't on the same level it gives rise to irritation
If your views aren't in line with one another you're going to argue which will give rise to defilements
It's just like water where the land is on two different levels
The water on the higher level will flow down to the lower level and make a big roar
If water is flowing along a piece of level ground the flow of the water hardly makes a sound at all
Hanging around with the group is like curry ladled onto a plate of rice It spoils quickly and you can't keep it for long
If the rice and the curry are kept in two separate dishes they don't spoil as quickly
When people keep to themselves they rarely have issues
To be a monk who ordains without spending time in the wilds is like knowing the taste of rice but not curry
Monks who go looking for seclusion in the forest are bound to know the taste of the Dhamma like a person who eats rice with curry
The taste is sure to be very different
Take roosters for instance
Wild roosters are very different from domesticated roosters
Their eyes are quick their tailfeathers short their call short their wings strong
They have to be this way because they always need to keep up their guard
As for domesticated roosters their tail feathers are long their eyes slow their wings weak and their call long
When they're this way they're bound to become the prey of leopards
This goes to show that the taste of living in the forest and the taste of living in a settled area are bound to be different
There have been times when I've been criticized for going out into the forest but I just smile to myself
They say I'm a coward that I can't contend with people and so run off and hide
So I keep quiet and laugh to myself until I have to speak up and say Living in town is good all right but it doesn't require any special talents
Why
I've never seen town people last any length of time in the forest but in towns  to say nothing of monks  there are dogs and chickens all over the place
People with thick defilements are easier to teach than people with thin defilements
They've got a thick shell so it's easy to crack open
If their skin is thin it's hard to peel

People come in all types
Some make themselves into pigs some make themselves into chickens some make themselves into water buffaloes and some make themselves into people
Only when people are like people can you feed them rice  and even people like people come on many levels
Some eat the best rice others eat second best and others take what's left
Someone once came to me and said Unawareness and ignorance are what cause people to think so actually they're something positive  because if people don't think how are they going to become intelligent
But here you are teaching people to sit still with their minds quiet and not thinking
What good can it accomplish
So I answered him There's no need to talk about subtle things like unawareness
Let's talk about simple things
When you were small and learning how to read they started out by having you put letters together  s plus o is so n plus o is no g plus o is go and so on  until you knew that g plus o is go
Now you're in Bangkok
Suppose you put your learning aside and go to Chantaburi
If you meet a sign that says go you can tell immediately that it says go without having to think  right
 because you already know
If someone really knows why does he have to think
The person who has to think is the one who doesn't really know
Sometimes if you want to serve a purpose you have to take their own words and pour them back down their throats
It makes them sit up and take notice
When I'm in Bangkok everyone who comes to my quarters sits still and meditates  not because I tell them to but because that's what I'm doing myself
That in and of itself is enough to teach them
I sit with my eyes closed when they see me sitting with my eyes closed they sit with their eyes closed as well and don't dare say anything
If I were to get involved in their issues they'd get involved in mine
When your eyes are blurry you have to learn how to put eyedrops in them yourself
If you go around trying to get other people to put them in for you you're weighing them down
What this means is that you have to take note of things
For example they may be speaking to you or not but if you notice something about what they say you take note of it When this person does this what is he after
When she acts in this way what does she want Just this is enough for you to begin to understand things
This is what it means to put drops in our own eyes
With some people you have to pry their eyelids open with a rod and even then they don't want to open up
That's when they're impossible to teach
If your eyes aren't too blurry you don't have to watch things too often
If you see something once it's enough for you to take as a guide for a long time to come with no need for too many examples
Like expert shoemakers All they need is one model and they can set themselves up in business making hundreds and thousands of shoes
What it means to be a person with good ears Your teacher may say something only once but you can put it to use the rest of your life
Whatever appears and takes shape is bound to give rise to stress
If we lay claim to unstable things as our own our lives will have to be unstable too
When pain arises stay right there with the pain
When pleasure arises stay right there with the pleasure
Get to know them
Get to know what arises when
When you stay with them really focus on being observant to see them all the way through
Ultimately they'll fade away in the same way as when we place a rock on a lawn the grass underneath it gradually dies on its own
When pain arises you can focus your attention on something or somebody else in order to forget the pain all right but that's just mindfulness not alertness
Your awareness has to be right at what's happening within you if you want to have both mindfulness and alertness together
Aging illness and death are treasures for those who understand them
They're Noble Truths Noble Treasures
If they were people I'd bow down to their feet every day
It's because of illness that I've been able to stay a monk as long as I have
Eating just a little food is very useful in the practice
When I want to make a careful survey of my breath I eat as little as possible
When the body is hungry I can see right where all the painful breath sensations arise
If the body is wellfed it's hard to observe these things because nothing usually happens in the body in its normal state
So from my point of view when I'm hungry or sick it's good for the practice
When I'm really in pain so much the better
I can close the door and don't have to get involved with anyone else
The body is death The mind is birth If we can separate them from each other we'll gain release from birth and death
If the mind is endowed with defilements and mental fermentations it will have to experience birth aging illness and death as a matter of course
It's like grains of rice covered by their outer coating and kept in a granary
As soon as the conditions are right in terms of the soil moisture sunlight and air the grains are bound to sprout and grow into rice plants resulting in even more grains of rice without end
But if we scrape off the covering and roast the grains in a pan they won't be able to sprout
In the same way if we use the effort of the practice to burn away the defilements that arise in the mind  by practicing concentration and constantly contemplating the qualities of the mind in line with the four frames of reference  the defilements will pop out of the mind in the same way that roasted rice will pop out of the pan
When we reach this point we reach the mind that doesn't die that gains release from death
When we see the aspect of the body that doesn't die and the aspect of the mind that doesn't die that's when we reach the truth
Wise people see that death is like stripping off old ragged clothes and throwing them away
The mind is like a body the body is like ragged clothing
There's nothing of any real essence to the rags but they have us scared
As soon as we see that there's the tiniest hole in our clothes we rush to find something to patch them up
The more patches we put on our clothes the thicker they get
The thicker they get the warmer they feel
The warmer they feel the more we get attached to them
The more we get attached to them the more deluded we become
As a result we'll never get away
Wise people though see that the issue of whether we live or die is not as important as the issue of whether we can serve a purpose
If living on will serve a purpose for themselves or other people then even if their clothes are nothing but rags they'll put up with wearing them
But if they see that living on will serve no purpose at all then when the time comes to take off their clothes they immediately let them go
Practicing concentration is like gathering vegetable seeds and storing them until they're mature
As soon as they get moistened they're going to sprout into plants with branches and leaves and flowers
In the same way our concentration will sprout into discernment giving us allaround insight into the affairs of the world and the affairs of the Dhamma
We'll come to know what the elements aggregates and the sense media in the body are  to the point where we see that there's no reason to fear aging illness and death
It's just like when we grow up and our childishness disappears
Don't make an issue out of whether or not you're going to die
Don't even think of it
Just purify your mind and that will take care of everything
The Dhamma is in everyone
Whether or not you realize it it's there
Whether or not you study it it's there
It's simply a matter of whether you know how to decipher it
Once you know the labels formulated by the Buddha you can decipher yourself in the same way that you learn how to read a book
Take a baby who doesn't know anything As soon as it's born it cries Wae That's feeling
If it's eating and comes across something it doesn't like it throws it away and goes for something better That's thoughtformation
When it gets older it can begin to remember things That's perception
So the Dhamma is in everyone
So why do we study
We study to learn the names for things and then we eventually have to get rid of all perceptions old new past and future
That's when we'll reach nibbana
Policemen who don't take off their uniforms and go around as plainclothesmen will have trouble uncovering the secrets of criminals
This is why we have to practice virtue concentration and discernment so that we can get on familiar terms with the five aggregates
That's what's meant by insight meditation
Concentration is something you do
Insight meditation is letting go
You can't do insight meditation
It's a result
When virtue is the cause concentration is the result
When concentration is the cause discernment is the result
When discernment is the cause release is the result
The skills of insight are things that can't be taught
At most you can teach people to do the meditation but you can't teach them to be insightful
You have to do before you can know You have to know before you can let go
You have to give rise to the causes and then the results will come on their own
When people out in the sun keep running around they don't realize how hot the sun really is
If you want to know how hot it is you have to sit out in the middle of a field when the sun is really strong for about five minutes
That's when you'll know what real heat is like
It's the same with stress and pain
If the mind goes running around without stopping it doesn't really see stress and pain
It has to be still if it wants to see
Concentration is like a mirror for seeing ourselves clearly
Discernment is like a telescope so that small things will appear large and distant things near
You have to stop searching  in other words the mind has to be still  before you can give rise to discernment
Searching is ignorance or avijja
The understanding you gain from listening and reading is like a person who has woken up but hasn't yet opened his eyes
He doesn't see any light and so has to grope around uncertain sometimes laying hold of the right things and sometimes laying hold of the wrong
The understanding you gain from thinking is like a person who has woken up but hasn't yet left the mosquito net and hasn't yet washed the sleep out of his eyes
His vision is blurry and unclear
As for the understanding you gain from meditation that's like getting out of the mosquito net and washing your face so that you're able to see things clearly
This is the highest kind of understanding
Try to develop it
To get full results from our meditation the mind has to give the orders
Mindfulness is what does the work and assists in the progress of all our activities while alertness is what observes the results of what we've done
To speak in terms of the frames of reference these qualities are called mindfulness and alertness
To speak in terms of jhana they're called directed thought and evaluation
They're the qualities that give rise to discernment
Discernment comes from observing causes and effects
If we know effects without knowing causes that doesn't qualify as discernment
If we know causes without knowing effects that doesn't qualify either
We have to know both of them together with our mindfulness and alertness
This is what qualifies as allaround knowing in the full sense of the term
The allaround knowing that arises within us comes from causes and effects not from what we read in books hear other people tell us or conjecture on our own
Suppose we have some silver coins in our pocket
If all we know is that other people say it's money we don't know its qualities
But if we experiment with it and put it in a smelter to see what it's made of and to see how it can be made into other things that's when we'll know its true qualities
This is the kind of knowledge that comes from our own actions
This knowledge when we meditate comes in five forms
We find within ourselves that some things are caused by the properties of the body some are caused by the mind some causes come from the mind but have an effect on the body some causes come from the body but have an effect on the mind some causes come from the body and mind acting together
This kind of knowledge is discernment
So we have to learn from virtue concentration and discernment by giving rise to them
If we don't we'll suffer from unawareness and delusion
Mindfulness is what brings light to the mind like a candle
If we take a candle into a room at night close the windows and doors and fill in all the cracks in the walls no wind from outside will be able to slip in and make the flame waver
The flame will give off even more light and we'll be able to see everything in the room clearly
Closing the windows and doors and filling in the cracks means exercising restraint over our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind so that our attention doesn't go straying out after outside perceptions and preoccupations
This is called restraint through mindfulness
Our mindfulness will gather into one
When mindfulness is strong the results are immediate a sense of ease and mental wellbeing
When mindfulness is solid and unflagging our concentration will become stronger
The mind will be still and upright
Light will arise in one of two ways from within ourself or from what's reflected off the walls
This is why mindfulness is the cause the supporting factor that keeps our concentration progressing
For this reason we shouldn't forget to appreciate this mental quality
When we know that certain causes give rise to happiness and wellbeing we should look after those causes
It's like when other people share food with us
We shouldn't forget their kindness
Or when our parents raise us and care for us from when we were small When we grow up and can establish ourselves in the world we shouldn't forget their kindness
We have to show our gratitude and take care of them at all times to repay their kindness
Only then will we be able to progress in life without backsliding
So mindfulness is like our parents
We have to look after it always for it's the mother of all skillful qualities
The reason we gain any happiness in life is because of mindfulness
For this reason mindfulness is what brings peace to the mind
Sitting here and bringing the mind to stillness is not really all that hard to do
The reason it seems hard is because we misunderstand things
Our views are wrong and so are our presuppositions
If we study so as to understand this point we'll know the truth
For example when we think that the mind goes here or there that's not the truth
It's just a preconceived notion
Actually the mind stays with the body at all times
What goes is just the light as with a flashlight
The bulb stays in the flashlight it's simply the light that goes flashing out
The bulb and the light are two different things
The bulb has light but the light outside of the flashlight doesn't have a bulb
The mind  awareness itself  stays with the body with each inandout breath
The knowledge that goes flashing out isn't the real thing
You can't take the light and put it back in the flashlight just as when a person tries to catch a light beam it doesn't stick in his hands
So if the mind is always in the present why do we practice concentration
We practice concentration because there are two kinds of fire or electricity in the mind hot fire the fires of passion aversion  delusion and cool fire the fire of jhana or mental absorption
If we understand how to train the mind we'll meet with the cool fire
Hot fire is bad for the nerves of our eyes ears nose tongue and body
Our sense organs are like light bulbs
The nerves of the senses are like the filaments in the bulbs
If we hook them up to the wrong kind of current they'll explode immediately
If we hook them up to the right current but never turn them off they'll wear out
So we practice concentration because we want cool electricity the cool fire of jhana
Cool electricity does no damage to our senses and enables us to use our senses to see the truth to understand everything we see hear smell taste touch and think about
This way the mind can be cool and at peace
This is the skill of insight meditation
When sights strike against the eye perceptions arise right at the contact and we can see them with discernment
When sounds strike the ear when smells strike the nose when flavors strike the tongue when tactile sensations strike the body or ideas strike the mind discernment gets right there in between them
This way sights don't stick to the eye and the eye doesn't stick to sights sounds don't stick to the ears the ears don't stick to sounds and so forth
This is intuitive insight or sixfactored equanimity which can let go both of the senses and of their objects
The true mind stays cool and at peace like the cool fire that lasts and poses a danger to no one
When people don't train their minds they have to live with hot fire which wears down different parts of their minds such as the nerves of their eyes ears nose tongue and body
When these nerves wear down they become ignorant
Their eyesight is darkened
When they see sights they don't know the truth of those sights
This is called unawareness
Their ears go deaf When they hear sounds they don't know the truth of those sounds
The same holds for their nose tongue body and mind
Whatever they sense they don't know the truth of those things
This is called unawareness
It gives rise to craving and defilement and leads to suffering
This is what it means to be ignorant of the truth
People ignorant of the truth are like the blind
They have trouble everywhere they walk thinking that high things are low and low things are high  as when a blind person walks along level ground lifting his feet up high because he's afraid he might trip over something
In the same way people who don't know the truth think that deep Dhamma is shallow shallow Dhamma is deep high Dhamma is low low Dhamma is high
That's Wrong View
When your views are wrong your practice is wrong your release is wrong  like lifting your feet to walk up a set of stairs that doesn't have any steps
There are people who want to put themselves on a high level but without the proper basis
Their minds don't have any concentration
They keep walking thinking imagining about highlevel Dhamma but they end up back where they started
They're like a blind person trying to climb a staircase whose bottom step is missing
He'll just keep stomping on the same spot of ground
In the same way people on a low level who think they're on a high level end up sinking further and further into the ground
The more they try to climb up the deeper they go
Like an elephant fallen into the mud The more she struggles the deeper she sinks
The steps of the stairs are virtue concentration and discernment
If we follow the steps we'll get to where we want to go  like a person with good eyesight climbing stairs that actually have steps
People who practice concentration can know things whether their eyes are opened or closed because they have brightness within them
Sankhara means fashioning
Sankharas are things that we have to study in order to know them clearly for what they are
And we have to be wise to them too
There are two kinds
World sankharas are things like gain status praise and pleasure
These things arise and then pass away
Dhamma sankharas are our own physical and mental phenomena aggregates elements and sense media
These things also arise and pass away in just the same way
So as long as we have them we should put them to a good use
Otherwise they'll turn around and kill us
If we don't work at training them they simply stay at the level of plain phenomena
But if we train them we get more and more worth out of them
Like clay If we're intelligent enough we can make it into a pot to cook our food
Higher than that we can make it into tiles to cover our roof
If we put a glaze on the tiles they become even more valuable
It all depends on how much discernment we have in understanding how to work with things so as to increase their value
The breath is the bodily sankhara ie the factor that fashions the body
Verbal sankharas are the thoughts that you put into words so that you have them ready to say but without speaking out loud
Mental sankharas are thoughts that aren't involved with speaking
You simply think and then know what the thought is about
Verbal and mental sankharas are very similar
In training the mind the important point is to make an effort to prevent verbal sankharas from arising
Whether they deal with past or future perceptions you have to brush them all away
Bodily sankharas are the present aspect of the body ie the breath
Mental sankharas are the present aspect of the mind ie the awareness that forms the basis for thinking
Mental sankharas form the essence of suffering
Sankharas are the valuables of stupid people
You have to get rid of the smoke if you want to see the flame
You have to get rid of the sankharas in the mind if you want to see the Unfashioned
Taking pleasure in sights sounds smells tastes etc is sensual craving
The mental state that wanders out in search of an object but hasn't yet found anything that pleases it is craving for becoming
The mental state that wavers or leans in its present preoccupation is craving for no becoming
Not knowing these aspects of the mind is unawareness
Labels of the past and future are the world The present is the Dhamma
Don't let yourself get taken in by even the slightest labeling
Even if you get only slightly involved that's a state of becoming and you'll have to suffer more birth aging illness and death
The skill of release is when past is simply a movement future is simply a movement and present is simply a movement but there's no kamma
You can think of the past but the mind doesn't taste any results from the thinking
For the mind to attain dispassion you need to have the skill to determine what's detrimental in the present so that you can spit out any passion immediately
The past isn't for real the future isn't for real
If they were for real they would have to stay for good
If you're intelligent you won't take the things that you've already spit out and put them back in your mouth again
Passion and craving are like eating and swallowing or gathering in
Dispassion is like spitting out or throwing away
If you grasp after things that have gotten away from you or haven't reached you yet that's craving and passion
Dispassion is like when food touches your tongue you notice it immediately and spit it out before it gets swallowed
When the Buddha was still a lay person he tried to track down the source of true happiness
He asked himself Does happiness come from being wealthy But when he looked at wealth he saw that it had its drawbacks
So he turned to learning but learning also had its drawbacks
He turned to power but he saw that power involved killing and war
So he contemplated things back and forth like this asking himself what he could do to find true happiness
Finally he realized that happiness comes from pain pain comes from happiness
The world has to keep spinning around like this
And when something spins around it has to have an axle  otherwise how could it spin
So when there's something that spins there also has to be something that doesn't spin
He kept contemplating this until he found the source of all spinning and not spinning which lies right here in the heart
There are two kinds of knowing true knowing and imitation knowing
True knowing is what stays right here and now without going anywhere else
You know when you're standing you know when you're lying down speaking thinking etc
As for imitation knowing that's the knowledge that goes after labels and perceptions
Labels are an act of knowing but they're not the knowing itself
They're like the shadow of knowing
True knowing is being mindful of the present seeing causes and effects
This is discernment
Knowing in line with labels in line with books or with what people say is imitation knowing not the real thing
It's like the shadow of knowing
Real knowing is the knowing that arises within yourself
It's paccattam ie entirely personal
It's the kind of knowing that can't be taught and can't be told
It has to arise within you
Only then will you know what's inconstant stressful and notself and what's constant easeful and self
Changeoflineage knowledge sees both sides and lets go of both
The truth of the Dhamma is Dhammathiti the aspect of mind that stays in place without changing
The movements and characteristics of the mind are simply shadows or imitations of knowing
In practicing the Dhamma you want true knowing
If you don't really practice you'll meet up only with the shadows of the Dhamma
For this reason we should practice so that true knowing will appear within us
 Dhammathiti is something that by its nature stays in place
It doesn't change or waver rise or fall in line with the mental objects that come into contact
It's the mind released from suffering and stress the mind that stays in line with its true nature
Even though there may be thinking or talking or acting in all kinds of ways the mind simply is aware
It doesn't show any symptoms of changing from its primal nature
Say for example that we place a glass here without anyone or anything touching it or moving it
It will stay right there for ten years one hundred years without breaking
The mind that's Dhammathiti is just like that
Or you can say that it's like writing the number without changing it into anything else
It will have to stay the same it was in the first place
This is called Dhammathiti
Always contemplate things in terms of inconstancy stress and notself  but you also have to look at them in terms of constancy ease and self as well
You have to look at things from both sides and not just at their shortcomings
You have to look at their uses too but you can't let yourself get attached to either side
Otherwise you'll be like a person with one eye Constancy ease and self will be able to sneak up and hit you over the head without your realizing it
Insight has two sides the side that sees in line with what we're taught and the side that sees in the other direction
Seeing in line with what people say can turn into a corruption of insight
Seeing in the other direction means seeing in line with things they don't say
Wherever they say there's inconstancy that's where there's constancy
Wherever they say there's stress that's where there's ease
Wherever they say there's notself that's where there's self
This is intuitive insight
The still calm of discernment is not something the Buddha wanted because it's not really calm not really still
The ultimate happiness is something even higher than discernment
Those who have attained the transcendent  streamwinners oncereturners nonreturners and arahants These terms apply not to people but to the mind
We are like a tree
Attachment is like vines
If we feel desire for sights they'll wind around our eyes
If we feel desire for sounds they'll wind around our ears and so forth
When we're all tangled up like this we'll have to die
Some people don't let themselves die naturally
They take their attachments and tie up their own throats
The world is like red ants that crawl along vines
If we cut away the vines that entangle our tree the ants won't be able to get to it
We have to cut away whatever we can
If the mind is long make it short
If it's short make it round
If it's round make it smooth
If it's smooth make it shine
That way it can roll around without getting stuck on anything and can gain release from all suffering and stress
Suffering comes from having This is why people in the world are suffering so
If they have five they want to increase it to ten
Once they have ten they think they'll be able to relax
But when they actually get ten they then increase it to
And then they have to keep looking for more all the time for fear that they'll lose what they have
Only when they stop breathing will they stop looking for more
This is why we're taught that having is suffering
And this is why the Buddha arranged not to have anything at all
He said Physical form feeling perception thoughtformations and consciousness are not mine
The senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation are not mine When nothing was his how could anyone take anything away from him
Who could come and oppress him
If people give us things we say that we get that we have If they take them away we say that we lose But when there's nothing to own there's no having or losing
And when that's the case where will there be any suffering
Nibbana is the end of all having and lacking
If we don't know how to let go we're going to suffer
Suppose that we're carrying something in our hand
If we don't let it go and put it down we won't be able to take hold of anything better than what we've got
This is why the Buddha taught us to let go
For one thing our hand won't get sweaty from carrying things around
Secondly we can take what we've put down turn it over and look at it from every side to see what it really is
Say that we're holding a knife tight in our fist
We can't look at it to see what kind of knife it is
But if we open our fist and put the knife down we can then look at it carefully to see whether it's made from steel wood horn or ivory whether it's wellmade or not and what uses it's good for
To hold onto the body is to hold onto old kamma
To let go of the body is to let go of old kamma
And when we can let go in this way there will be no more kamma in the body
It's the same as with a piece of property
If we take possession of it with a deed and the boundary staked out there tend to be problems with trespassing swindling boundary disputes and cases in court
But if we don't take possession of it and simply let it be public property there will be no troubles or quarrels
This way the heart can be at its ease
If the heart gets caught up on anything it's got to be bad
If you can see being born and not being born as equal being sick and not being sick as equal dying and not dying as equal as having the same price then the mind can relax and not be caught up on anything at all
In the first stage we let go of evil and start doing good
In the second stage we let go of evil and some forms of good
In the third stage we let go of everything good and evil because everything is fashioned by nature and thus undependable
We do good but we're not attached to it
When you let go you have to do it intelligently and not in a ruinous way  ie by not doing good
You can't hold on even to your opinions much less to material things
When you do good you do it for the sake of the living beings of the world for your children and grandchildren
You do everything in the best way possible but you're not attached to it because you know that all things fashioned are inconstant
This way your heart can be clear and bright like a jewel
If you get caught up on praise or blame you're foolish
It's like drinking other people's saliva
When you act rightly there are people who will say that you're right and those who will say that you're wrong
When you act wrong there are people who will say that you're wrong and those who will say that you're right
There's nothing constant about good or evil right or wrong
Evil comes from good and good from evil
For example when we eat rice we say it's delicious but then as it goes down through the body it turns into something just the opposite
Thieves come from rich people
If people didn't have possessions and treasures where would there be any thieves to steal from them
The Buddha saw that evil isn't something you can depend upon
Good isn't something you can depend upon
That's why he let go of both good and evil by not connecting their wires into his heart
He gained release from all good and evil and so transcended all the affairs of the world
That was how he entered the highest happiness
The power of good and evil is like a magnet that pulls the mind to do good or evil and then be born in good or evil places in line with its pull
If we do good or evil it's as if we leave magnets behind in the world
Those magnets will pull our minds to their level
People who aren't intelligent enough to know how to avoid or extract themselves from the power of good and evil are sure to be pulled along by the force field of these magnets
They'll have to keep swimming around in the world of rebirth
This is why wise people try to find a way to cut the force field so that they can escape its power and float free
In other words they do good and cut the force field
They do things that may not be good and they cut the force field
They don't let these things connect
In other words they don't get attached to the things they've done
They don't keep fondling them
This is what it means to be discerning knowing how to cut the force fields of the world
The mind is neither good nor evil but it's what knows good and knows evil
It's what does good and does evil
And it's what lets go of good and lets go of evil
It's not the case that things will progress if we cling to them or deteriorate if we let them go
Attachment is like a bridge
If there's no bridge who's going to walk across it
There's just this side of the river and the other side
The eye exists so it can see both sides but there's no connection
The mind that isn't caught up on its preoccupations is like a lotus leaf in the water
The water can't seep into the leaf
It simply rolls around as a bead across the surface
There's awareness but no attachment
Awareness without attachment is like electricity without a wire
There's just brightness
When there's no wire no one can get electrocuted
Or you could say that it's like a flame that doesn't need a lamp
No wick gets used up no oil gets consumed and yet there's light
If we separate the body and the mind from each other our ordinary awareness disappears but that doesn't mean that awareness is annihilated
It's still there but it's a special awareness that doesn't have to depend on the body or mind
It's the same as when we separate the wax of a candle from its wick The flame disappears but the fire potential isn't annihilated
Whether or not there's fuel it exists in the world by its very nature
This is the awareness of nibbana
Arahants can speak and act but they don't speak or act the way ordinary people do
They know how to separate things
Like a person speaking over the radio Even though we may hit the radio it doesn't reach the person speaking
The experience of release has no sense of before or after or even any present
When the heart is empty it feels light and free with no preoccupations at all
Like a bird Even though it has feet it doesn't leave any tracks in the air
In the same way when the mind is empty even if people criticize you there's no writing in the air
Nothing gets stuck in the heart
Tranquillity meditation means to keep the mind quiet in craving
Insight meditation means knowing both the mind with craving and the mind without craving
Knowing perceptions of past and future for what they are is intuitive knowledge
This kind of knowledge isn't stuck on any perceptions at all
This is called the skill of release
It's not stuck on the mind with craving or the mind without craving
It's like writing letters in the air
The air doesn't get used up the writing doesn't require any effort and you can't read what it says at all
Whether you write good or bad things you can't read what they say
The air is there but as for shapes in the air there are none
Nibbana The unbinding of the mind from sensations and mental acts preoccupations and suppositions
As this term is also used to refer to the extinguishing of a fire it carries the connotations of stilling cooling and peace

In Buddhism we use the words self and noself and so it is important to understand just what this noself anatta is all about even if it is first just an idea because the essence of the Buddha's teaching hinges on this concept
And in this teaching Buddhism is unique
No one no other spiritual teacher has formulated noself in just this way
And because it has been formulated by him in this way there is also the possibility of speaking about it
Much has been written about noself but in order to know it one has to experience it
And that is what the teaching aims at the experience of noself
Yet in order to experience noself one has first to fully know self
Actually know it
But unless we do know what this self is this self called me it is impossible to know what is meant by there is no self there In order to give something away we have to first fully have it in hand
We are constantly trying to reaffirm self
Which already shows that this self is a very fragile and rather wispy sort of affair because if it weren't why would we constantly have to reaffirm it
Why are we constantly afraid of the self being threatened of its being insecure of its not getting what it needs for survival
If it were such a solid entity as we believe it to be we would not feel threatened so often
We affirm self again and again through identification
We identify with a certain name an age a sex an ability an occupation
I am a lawyer I am a doctor
I am an accountant I am a student And we identify with the people we are attached to
I am a husband I am a wife I am a mother I am a daughter I am a son Now in the manner of speech we have to use self in that way  but it isn't only in speech
We really think that that self is who we are
We really believe it
There is no doubt in our mind that that self is who we are
When any of these factors is threatened if being a wife is threatened if being a mother is threatened if being a lawyer is threatened if being a teacher is threatened  or if we lose the people who enable us to retain that self  what a tragedy
The selfidentification becomes insecure and me finds it hard to say look at me this is me Praise and blame are included
Praise reaffirms me Blame threatens me So we like the praise and we dislike the blame
The ego is threatened
Fame and infamy  same thing
Loss and gain
If we gain the ego gets bigger if we lose it gets a bit smaller
So we are constantly in a quandary and in constant fear
The ego might lose a little bit of its grandeur
It might be made a bit smaller by someone
And it happens to all of us
Somebody is undoubtedly going to blame us for something eventually
Even the Buddha was blamed
Now the blame that is levied at us is not the problem
The problem is our reaction
The problem is that we feel smaller
The ego has a hard time reasserting itself
So what we usually do is we blame back making the other's ego a bit smaller too
Identification with whatever it is that we do and whatever it is that we have be it possessions or people is so we believe needed for our survival
Self survival
If we don't identify with this or that we feel as if we are in limbo
This is the reason why it is difficult to stop thinking in meditation
Because without thinking there would be no identification
If I don't think what do I identify with
It is difficult to come to a stage in meditation in which there is actually nothing to identify with any more
Happiness too may be an identification
I am happy I am unhappy Because we are so keen on survival we have got to keep on identifying
When this identification becomes a matter of the life or death of the ego which it usually is then the fear of loss becomes so great that we can be in a constant state of fear
Constantly afraid to lose either the possessions that make us what we are or the people that make us what we are
If we have no children or if they all die we are no longer a mother
So fear is paramount
The same goes for all other identifications
Not a very peaceful state of living and what is it due to
Only one thing ego the craving to be
This identification results of course in craving for possessing
And this possessing results in attachment
What we have what we identify with we are attached to
That attachment that clinging makes it extremely difficult to have a free and open viewpoint
This kind of clinging whatever it may be that we cling to  it may not be clinging to motor cars and houses it may not even be clinging to people  but we certainly cling to views and opinions
We cling to our world view
We cling to the view of how we are going to be happy
Maybe we cling to a view of who created this universe
Whatever it is we cling to even how the government should run the country all of that makes it extremely difficult to see things as they really are
To be openminded
And it is only an open mind which can take in new ideas and understanding
Lord Buddha compared listeners to four different kinds of clay vessels
The first clay vessel is one that has holes at the bottom
If you pour water into it it runs right out
In other words whatever you teach that person is useless
The second clay vessel he compared to one that had cracks in it
If you pour water into it the water seeps out
These people cannot remember
Cannot put two and two together
Cracks in the understanding
The third listener he compared to a vessel that was completely full
Water cannot be poured in for it's full to the brim
Such a person so full of views he can't learn anything new
But hopefully we are the fourth kind
The empty vessels without any holes or cracks
Completely empty
I dare say we are not
But may be empty enough to take in enough
To be empty like that of views and opinions means a lack of clinging
Even a lack of clinging to what we think is reality
Whatever we think reality is it surely is not because if it were we would never be unhappy for a single moment
We would never feel a lack of anything
We would never feel a lack of companionship of ownership
We would never feel frustrated bored
If we ever do whatever we think is real is not
What is truly reality is completely fulfilling
If we aren't completely fulfilled we aren't seeing complete reality
So any view that we may have is either wrong or it is partial
Because it is wrong or partial and bounded by the ego we must look at it with suspicion
Anything we cling to keeps us bound to it
If I cling to a tableleg I can't possibly get out the door
There is no way I can move
I am stuck
Not until I let go will I have the opportunity to get out
Any identification any possession that is clung to is what stops us from reaching transcendental reality
Now we can easily see this clinging when we cling to things and people but we cannot easily see why the five khandhas are called the five clungto aggregates
That is their name and they are in fact what we cling to most
That is an entire clinging
We don't even stop to consider when we look at our body and when we look at our mind or when we look at feeling perception mental formations and consciousness  vedana sañña sankhara and viññana
We look at this mindandbody namarupa and we don't even doubt the fact that this is my feeling my perception my memory my thoughts and my awareness of my consciousness
And no one starts doubting until they start seeing
And for that seeing we need a fair bit of empty space apart from views and opinions
Clinging is the greatest possessiveness and attachment we have
As long as we cling we cannot see reality
We cannot see reality because clinging is in the way
Clinging colors whatever we believe to be true
Now it is not possible to say all right I'll stop clinging We can't do that
The process of taking the me apart of not believing any more that this is one whole is a gradual one
But if meditation has any benefit and success it must show that first of all there is mind and there is body
There isn't one single thing acting in accord all the time
There is mind which is thinking and making the body act
Now that is the first step in knowing oneself a little clearer
And then we can note this is a feeling and I am giving this feeling a name which means memory and perception
This is the thought that I am having about this feeling
The feeling has come about because the mindconsciousness has connected with the feeling that has arisen
Take the four parts of the khandhas that belong to the mind apart
When we do that while it is happening  not now when we are thinking about atbut while it is happening then we get an inkling that this isn't really me that these are phenomena that are arising which stay a moment and then cease
How long does mindconsciousness stay on one object
And how long do thoughts last
And have we really invited them
The clinging the clungto are what make the ego arise
Because of clinging the notion of me arises and then there is me and me having all the problems
Without me would there be problems
If there weren't anyone sitting inside me  as we think there is  who is called I or me or John Claire then who is having the problem
The khandhas do not have any problems
The khandhas are just processes
They are phenomena and that is all
They are just going on and on and on
But because I am grasping at them and trying to hold on to them and saying it's me it's me feeling it's me wanting then problems arise
If we really want to get rid of suffering completely and totally then clinging has to go
The spiritual path is never one of achievement it is always one of letting go
The more we let go the more there is empty and open space for us to see reality
Because what we let go of is no longer there there is the possibility of just moving without clinging to the results of the movement
As long as we cling to the results of what we do as long as we cling to the results of what we think we are bound we are hemmed in
Now there is a third thing that we do we are interested in becoming something or somebody
Interested in becoming an excellent meditator
Interested in becoming a graduate
Interested in becoming something which we are not
And becoming something stops us from being
When we are stopped from being we cannot pay attention to what there really is
All this becoming business is of course in the future
Since whatever there is in the future is conjecture it is a dream world we live in
The only reality we can be sure of is this particular moment right now and this particular moment as you must be able to be aware of  has already passed and this one has passed and the next one has also passed
See how they are all passing
That is the impermanence of it all
Each moment passes but we cling trying to hold on to them
Trying to make them a reality
Trying to make them a security
Trying to make them be something which they are not
See how they are all passing
We cannot even say it as quickly as they are doing it
There is nothing that is secure
Nothing to hold on to nothing that is stable
The whole universe is constantly falling apart and coming back together
And that includes the mind and the body which we call I You may believe it or not it makes no difference
In order to know it you must experience it when you experience it it's perfectly clear
What one experiences is totally clear
No one can say it is not
They may try but their objections make no sense because you have experienced it
It's the same thing as biting into the mango to know its taste
To experience it one needs meditation
An ordinary mind can only know ordinary concepts and ideas
If one wants to understand and experience extraordinary experiences and ideas one has to have an extraordinary mind
An extraordinary mind comes about through concentration
Most meditators have experienced some stage that is different then the one they are use to
So it is not ordinary any more
But we have to fortify that far more than just the beginning stage
To the point where the mind is truly extraordinary
Extraordinary in the sense that it can direct itself to where it wants to go
Extraordinary in the sense that it no longer gets perturbed by everyday events
And when the mind can concentrate then it experiences states which it has never known before
To realize that your universe constantly falls apart and comes back together again is a meditative experience
It takes practice perseverance and patience
And when the mind is unperturbed and still equanimity evenmindedness peacefulness arise
At that time the mind understands the idea of impermanence to such an extent that it sees itself as totally impermanent
And when one sees one's own mind as being totally impermanent there is a shift in one's viewpoint
That shift I like to compare with a kaleidoscope that children play with
A slight touch and you get a different picture
The whole thing looks quite different with just a slight shift
Nonself is experienced through the aspect of impermanence through the aspect of unsatisfactoriness and through the aspect of emptiness
Empty of what
The word emptiness is so often misunderstood because when one only thinks of it as a concept one says what do you mean by empty Everything is there there are the people and there are their insides guts and their bones and blood and everything is full of stuff  and the mind is not empty either
It's got ideas thoughts and feelings
And even when it doesn't have those what do you mean by emptiness
The only thing that is empty is the emptiness of an entity
There is no specific entity in anything
That is emptiness
That is the nothingness
That nothingness is also experienced in meditation
It is empty it is devoid of a specific person devoid of a specific thing devoid of anything which makes it permanent devoid of anything which even makes it important
The whole thing is in flux
So the emptiness is that
And the emptiness is to be seen everywhere to be seen in oneself
And that is what is called anatta nonself
Empty of an entity
There is nobody there
It is all imagination
At first that feels very insecure
That person that I've been regarding with so much concern that person trying to do this or that that person who will be my security will be my insurance for a happy life  once I find that person  that person does not really exist
What a frightening and insecure idea that is
What a feeling of fear arises
But as a matter of fact it's just the reverse
If one accepts and bears that fright and goes through it one comes to complete and utter relief and release
I'll give you a simile Imagine you own a very valuable jewel which is so valuable that you place your trust in it so that should you fall upon hard times it will look after you
It's so valuable that you can have it as your security
You don't trust anybody
So you have a safe inside your house and that is where you put your jewel
Now you have been working hard for a number of years and you think you deserve a holiday
So now what to do with the jewel
Obviously you cannot take it with you on your seaside holiday
So you buy new locks for the doors to your house and you bar your windows and you alert your neighbors
You tell them about the proposed holiday and ask them to look after you house  and the safe in it
And they say they will of course
You should be quite at ease and so you go off on your holiday
You go to the beach and it's wonderful
Marvelous
The palm trees are swaying in the wind and the spot you've chosen on the beach is nice and clean
The waves are warm and it's all lovely
The first day you really enjoy yourself
But on the second day you begin to wonder the neighbors are very nice people but they do go and visit their children
They are not always at home and lately there has been a rash of burglaries in the neighborhood
And on the third day you've convinced yourself that something dreadful is going to happen and you go back home
You walk in and open the safe
Everything is all right
You go over to the neighbors and they ask Why did you come back
We were looking after your place
You didn't have to come back
Everything is fine
The next year the same thing
Again you tell the neighbors Now this time I am really going to stay away for a month
I need this holiday as I've been working hard So they say Absolutely no need to worry just take off
Go to the beach So once more you bar the windows lock the doors get everything shipshape and take off for the beach
Again it's wonderful beautiful
This time you last for five days
On the fifth day you are convinced that something dreadful must have happened
And you go home
You go home and by golly it has
The jewel is gone
You are in a state of complete collapse
Total desperation
Depressed
So you go to the neighbors but they have no idea what has happened
they've been around all the time
Then you sit and consider the matter and you realize that since the jewel is gone you might as well go back to the beach and enjoy yourself
That jewel is self
Once it is gone all the burden of looking after it all the fears about it all the barring of doors and windows and heart and mind is no longer necessary
You can just go and enjoy yourself while you're still in this body
After proper investigation the frightening aspect of losing this thing that seemed so precious turns out to be the only relief and release from worry that there is
There are three doors to liberation the signless the desireless and emptiness
If we understand impermanence anicca fully it is called the signless liberation
If we understand suffering dukkha fully it is the desireless liberation
If we understand noself anatta fully then it is the emptiness liberation
Which means we can go through any of these three doors
And to be liberated means never to have to experience an unhappy moment again
It also means something else it means we are no longer creating kamma
A person who has been completely liberated still acts still thinks still speaks and still looks to all intents and purposes like anybody else but that person has lost the idea that I am thinking I am speaking I am acting
Kamma is no longer being made because there is just the thought just the speech just the action
There is the experience but no experiencer
And because no kamma is being made any longer there is no rebirth
That is full enlightenment
In this tradition three stages of enlightenment have been classified before one comes to the fourth stage full enlightenment
The first stage the one we can concern ourselves with  at least theoretically  is called sotapanna streamenterer
It means a person who has seen Nibbana once and has thereby entered the stream
That person cannot be deterred from the Path any more
If the insight is strong there may be only one more lifetime
If the insight is weak it can be seven more lifetimes
Having seen Nibbana for oneself once one loses some of the difficulties one had before
The most drastic hindrance that one loses is the idea that this person we call I is a separate entity
The wrong view of self is lost
But that doesn't mean that a sotapanna is constantly aware of noself
The wrong view is lost
But the right view has to be reinforced again and again and experienced again and again through that reinforcement
Such a person no longer has any great interest and certainly no belief in rites and rituals
They may still be performed because they are traditional or that are customary but such a person no longer believes they can bring about any kind of liberation
And then a very interesting thing is lost skeptical doubt
Skeptical doubt is lost because one has seen for oneself that what the Buddha taught was actually so
Until that time skeptical doubt will have to arise again and again because one can easily think Well maybe
Maybe it's so but how can I be sure One can only be sure through one's own experience
Then of course there is no skeptical doubt left because one has seen exactly that which has been described and having seen it one's own heart and mind gives an understanding which makes it possible to see everything else
Dhamma must have as its base the understanding that there is no special entity
There is continuity but there is no special entity
And that continuity is what makes it so difficult for us to see that there really isn't anybody inside the body making things happen
Things are happening anyway
So the first instance of having seen a glimpse of freedom called streamentry makes changes within us
It certainly does not uproot greed and hate  in fact they are not even mentioned
But through the greater understanding such a person has the greed and the hate lessen
They are not as strong anymore and they do not manifest in gross ways but do remain in subtle ways
The next stages are the oncereturner then the nonreturner then the arahant
Oncereturner one more life in the fivesense world
Nonreturner no human life necessary and arahant fully enlightened
Sensual desire and hate only go with nonreturners and complete conceit of self only with arahant
So we can be quite accepting of the fact that since we are not arahants we still have greed and hate
It isn't a matter of blaming oneself for having them it's a matter of understanding where these come from
They come from the delusion of me
I want to protect this jewel which is me
That is how they arise
But with the continued practice of meditation the mind can become clearer and clearer
It finally understands
And when it does understand it can see transcendental reality
Even if seen for one thoughtmoment the experience is of great impact and makes a marked change in our lives
Sister Khema was born in Germany educated in Scotland and China and later became a United States citizen
She now lives at Wat Buddha Dhamma Forest Monastery near Sydney Australia which was established in on land purchased and donated by her
In she ordained as a Nun in Sri Lanka and in she established the International Buddhist Women's Centre near Colombo
She spends most of her time teaching meditation course in different parts of the world
Rains Retreat is spent in Sri Lanka
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
It's the nature of the world that nothing is totally bad
Everything has to have at least some good to it
The same holds true with the various forms of Mara or the demons of temptation that get in the way of our practice
It's not the case that they always obstruct us
Sometimes they turn into our friends and companions sometimes into our workers and supporters sometimes into our slaves helping us and caring for us
This is why if you're discerning you have to walk a middle course
On one hand you have to focus on their bad side
On the other you have to focus on their good
Their good and bad sides are realities that have to exist together
As for us we have to take a stance in the middle examining things so that we don't act out of suspicion or prejudice
Once we see the good side of these things we can get more familiar with them
We can get intimate
When we get familiar and intimate we develop a sense of kinship with them
As the Buddha said vissasa parama ñati familiarity is the highest form of kinship
Even our enemies when we become familiar with them can become our friends
Our companions
Our servants
Our slaves
When we can look at things in this way both sides benefit
We benefit and our Maras benefit as well
In the time of the Buddha for instance the Buddha got so familiar with Mara that eventually Mara got converted and felt favorably inclined to the merit and skillfulness that the Buddha had developed
Once Mara had no more power over the Buddha he paid homage to the Buddha and found himself transported to heaven
And that's not all
He became a bodhisattva
In the future he'll gain Awakening as a fully selfawakened Buddha
So he benefited and the Buddha benefited
This is the nature of people with discernment they can take bad things and turn them into good
As for us we still lie under the sway of Maras of various kinds
These intimidating Maras are called KilesaMaras the demons of defilement
The big ones the really infamous ones are greed aversion and delusion
These are the famous ones
As for the ones that stay more in the background behind the scenes those are kamatanha craving for sensuality struggling to get things in ways that are offensive to the Dhamma bhavatanha craving for things to be this way or that and vibhavatanha craving that things not happen
For instance once we've gained wealth we don't want to lose it once we've gained status we don't want anyone to wipe out the edge we have over others
This is vibhavatanha
These three forms of craving are also demons of defilement but they're not very well known
Only once in a long long while do you hear anyone mention their names
As for greed aversion and delusion they're very big very powerful very well known
The mother of all these Maras is ignorance
Everything comes out of ignorance
Goodness comes from ignorance
Evil comes from ignorance
To call things by their proper names ignorance is the requisite condition for fabrications and fabrications when they arise come in three sorts
These forms of fabrication are also demons of defilement
They're the children of Mara but they rarely show their faces in public
They're like the children of nobility children in the royal palace
They hardly ever show their faces outside so very few people know their names very few people have seen their faces
Unless you develop the mind in concentration you won't get to see these beauties
If you develop concentration you can peer inside using your discernment to part the curtains and then you'll get to see these children of Mara
The mother of Mara ignorance lies even deeper inside
Ignorance means not being acquainted with your own mind  mistaking your thinking for your mind mistaking your knowledge for the mind thinking that your thoughts of the past or future are the mind thinking that the body is the mind or the mind is the body that feeling is the mind or the mind is feeling that mental qualities are the mind or that the mind is mental qualities that the mind is the self or the self is the mind not being able to separate these things from yourself getting yourself all entangled that's called ignorance
In short ignorance means getting caught up on the present
All of the things I've mentioned so far are called the demons of defilement
They bother us all the time get in our way all the time which is why they're called the demons of defilement
How are they demons
When you get really greedy for instance it gets in the way of your being generous and giving donations
You simply want to get and don't want to give
That's how greed is a demon
When we get possessive of things holding on tight and someone destroys what we're holding onto we get upset and feel mistreated
This puts our mind into a turmoil and gets it all stirred up
This is how greed is a demon
The same holds true for anger
Once it arises you don't give a damn about anything
You see other people as nothing more than red or black ants all you have to do is step on them and they're done for
The explosive power of anger is more violent than anything else
Whether or not you'll actually be able to get your way you don't care
You're brazen and foolhardy
But if anyone comes along at that time and tries to persuade you to act in a skillful way you don't want anything of what they have to say
The anger has to go its course until it runs out on its own
This is why it's called a demon because you can't do anything good while you're under its power
Delusion is even worse
Delusion seeps into you the way blood seeps throughout every part of your body
When we do evil we're deluded
When we do good we're still deluded
Even though we're welleducated in the Dhamma we can't yet escape from the power of delusion
No matter who we are it stays right on our heels
We may want to make merit but when we're deluded we don't know what's right and what's wrong
We simply want the merit
We observe the precepts because we want to be good but we don't know what real virtue is
It's the same when we practice concentration
We want to get results but we can't tell right concentration from wrong
We simply keep on wanting
This is called delusion in that our knowledge isn't in line with the truth
It's not that we don't know anything
We know but what we know goes straying away from the truth
We're like a person who has lost his way he can still keep going it's just that he's not on the right path
Suppose for instance that we want to go to Bangkok but we get confused about the way and start heading to BangPuu
We're off the path as far as Bangkok is concerned but we're on the right path for BangPuu  and we can keep on going
It's not the case that when you're on the wrong path you can't go
You can but it's the wrong path as far as the destination you want
You're simply going to end up disappointed
This is why delusion is called a demon
The second level of demons are the forms of craving
There are three forms of craving but they boil down to two sorts
We translate craving as desire and desire has two types
One is desire mixed with lust in the ordinary way of the world
The second has no lust
It's simply a sense of inclination affection a liking for objects
For example we feel a liking for certain sights
We see certain material objects and we like the way they look so we search for them  in other words we want to get them
This too is a type of craving
The same holds true for the various sounds we like
We struggle to get hold of them
Our desire pulls us yanks us drags us along  whether or not we'll get what we want we have to keep running
If we get what we want we at least have something to show for our efforts
If we don't it's a waste of time and energy and we suffer
This kind of desire is also called craving craving for objects for sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations things we like
This is desire combined not with lust but with greed
So craving has these two flavors distilled out of kamatanha bhavatanha and vibhavatanha desire combined with lust and desire free of lust
These too are demons of defilement
Each of them prevents the mind from inclining toward right concentration
This is why desire  chanda  is classed as a hindrance
Desire on the level of a hindrance covers inclination a sense of liking without any lust mixed in
But there's another type of chanda  called chandaraga or desireandpassion  which is heavier than chanda as a hindrance
Chanda as a hindrance is light
Chandaraga is an enemy of the precepts
Chanda as a hindrance is an enemy of concentration
This is why desire in either sense of the word is classed as a demon a demon of defilement
This is the second level
The next level of demons are the forms of mental fabrication
For example meritorious fabrications the mind's thoughts of concocting or giving rise to merit
Now suppose that those thoughts don't succeed
The mind sours
Like King Asoka who ruled over the Indian subcontinent governing in two ways
One was through his goodness as a person
His subjects respected him honored him and so they obeyed him
The other way was through his military power and might
This was why there was law and order among his people
In the area of the religion he gave tremendous support and encouragement building a great deal of goodness  so much so that it backfired on him
He gave continual donations to the bhikkhu sangha until one day toward the end of his life he decided that he wanted to use some money to buy donations as a form of homage to the Buddha homage to the Dhamma and homage to the Sangha
After he had formulated this intention but before he had had the opportunity to spend as much as he wanted he fell ill
So he wanted to hurry up and finish making merit in line with his plans
He sent one of his officials to draw more money from the treasury which held both government funds and the king's private funds
When the official got to the treasury the treasurer wouldn't hand over the money because he felt that it should go only to the government
So the official returned to inform King Asoka who got upset
These are my funds he thought
He wanted to use the funds as a form of homage to the Buddha homage to the Dhamma and homage to the Sangha but when he couldn't do it his mind turned sour
And it so happened that while his mind was soured he died
Now because he died while he was angry at his treasurer for not letting him make merit the result was that he was born as a gigantic snake an enormous python slithering back and forth around the royal treasury
And there he had to stay fixated on his possessions for many days which prevented him from enjoying the results of the good he had done
When he was alive he had done good in lots of ways building temples building chedis planting huge numbers of Bodhi trees giving huge donations to the Sangha observing the precepts listening to the Dhamma
When he died he should have been reborn as a male or female deva but instead he went and took birth as a snake
This is an instance of how good intentions meritorious intentions when they aren't fulfilled can lead to defilement and rebirth as a common animal
This is why thoughts of making merit even though they're meritorious can turn into demons
The same is even more true with demeritorious fabrications thoughts of doing evil
Simply thinking evil is enough to get in the way of our goodness
When thoughts of this kind arise in the mind even though we haven't yet acted on them even though we haven't yet spoken under their influence the simple fact of having a bad intention in the mind is enough to prevent us from reaching the noble paths and fruitions
An example of this is the story of two villagers two friends on the Buddhist sabbath
Early in the morning the people in the village heard the sound of the bell and gong in the local temple so they got up before daylight and got ready to go give food and listen to a sermon at the temple
One of the friends thought to himself If I go make merit at the temple then when I get back home I won't have anything to eat
I'd better go fishing instead So he cooked some rice and prepared the food for the other friend to take to the temple
As for the friend who went to the temple while he was placing food in the monks' bowls taking the precepts and listening to the sermon all he could think was evil thoughts Will my friend catch any fish for us to eat this evening I wonder As he thought about this he developed a strong desire to eat fish curry made from the fish his friend was out killing in the stream
That's all he could think about as he was putting food in the monks' bowls and listening to the sermon
He wasn't thinking about the killing
He simply thought If my friend catches some fish I'll get to eat As for the friend who was out catching fish all he could think about was I wonder if my friend has put food in the monks' bowls yet By now he's probably taken the precepts By now he's probably listening to the sermon and getting lots and lots of merit That's all he could think about
Now through the strong meritorious power of his thinking not a single fish got caught in his net
Every time he heard the gong being struck at the temple he'd put down his net raise his hands and say Sadhu  all day until darkness fell
Because his thoughts were so lost in doing good his efforts to do evil didn't succeed
As for the friend who went to make merit in the temple his thoughts were lost in eating fish with his friend so he ended up getting hardly any merit at all
The returns on his merit weren't worth all the time and effort that had gone into fixing food for the monks taking the precepts and listening to the sermon with his hands folded in respect
In other words his state of mind canceled out his goodness so he ended up no match for his friend who was out doing evil without really wanting to
Thus his state of mind turned into a demon and harmed him in two ways The first was that he wanted to eat fish but didn't get a single bite
The second was that even though he did gain some merit from the donations he had made to the monks it was only a little bit
He simply went through the motions of putting food in the monks' bowls taking the precepts listening to the sermon but his mind was focused on eating murrelfish curry with his friend
So he didn't get any of the good results that he should have from his actions
This is why it's said that evil thoughts cancel out our goodness
Even if we're doing good thoughts of this sort cut off our goodness like a palm tree or a coconut tree with its crown cut off
Or a banana tree that has borne fruit it won't be able to grow any further to bear flowers or produce any more fruit
People who think in ways that are evil even if they do good don't meet with any progress in life
They meet with nothing but failure
This is called demeritorious fabrication another kind of demon that prevents us from succeeding at giving rise to goodness
The third kind of mental fabrication is thinking that's neutral that isn't yet good or evil
This kind of thinking can also be a demon of defilement
Say for instance that we plan to work on our farm
We don't have time to go to the monastery we tell ourselves
We don't yet have enough to eat Or if we plan to go selling things
If we go to the monastery we won't have time to get a good return Or we spend our time thinking about some important business we have to do that we'll have to do this and say that
Or we think about going out to cruise around and relax a bit
When we think in this way it takes up the time we can use to develop goodness within ourselves
We keep putting it off
In what way
When we're children we tell ourselves that we can wait until we're older
We're not going to die anytime soon so we should take the time to study instead
When we become young adults we tell ourselves that we can wait until we get married
Once we get married and get ourselves established in our career we tell ourselves to wait until our children are grown and they get married
Going to the monastery can wait until we've aged a bit
We keep on putting it off and turn ourselves into nice sweet pigs for Mara to swallow down easily without our even realizing it
Finally if we really do survive until old age our children get worried and try to dissuade us from going
Mom don't go to the monastery
You're old
You'll suffer all sorts of hardships And we believe them
If you feel faint or get sick it's going to be hard for you Your eyes get so that you can't see your ears get so that you can't hear
You can't hear the sermons can't hear when they're giving the precepts
Your eyes your ears every path for doing good gets closed off and sealed up tight
This is what happens to people who get all wrapped up in their work  worried about how they're going to eat sleep and live worried about wealth and poverty to the point where they can't develop any skillfulness and see it through
These ways of thinking are a type of mental fabrication that fools us trips us up pulls us back ties us down
That's why they count as a type of Mara as demons of defilement
The demon of defilement on the fourth level is ignorance not being acquainted with things
We aren't acquainted with suffering and stress aren't acquainted with the cause of stress aren't acquainted with the cessation of stress or with the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress
Our not being acquainted with these four noble truths is one aspect of ignorance
Another aspect is not knowing which affairs are past which ones are future and which ones are present
These three plus the four noble truths add up to seven
And then there's not knowing ignorance itself which makes eight
These forms of unawareness are called avijja or ignorance
What this all boils down to is not knowing the path
For instance when we practice the four frames of reference kayanupassana  we focus on the body in and of itself but we don't understand the body
We think that the body is the mind or the mind is the body
This is ignorance
It's dark
It closes off the body and closes off the mind so that we think that they're one and the same thing
We can't separate the body from the mind or the mind from the body
This is called not knowing our path
Vedananupassana we focus on feelings in and of themselves but we aren't really acquainted with feelings
Feelings here means the act of savoring sensations which sometimes are pleasant sometimes painful sometimes neither pleasant nor painful
We think that the pleasure is the same thing as our own mind or that our self is what has pleasure
Or we think that the pain is the same thing as our self or that our self is what has pain
We can't separate the pleasure and pain from the mind so they get tightly tangled up together
We can't separate them can't tell what's what
This is called ignorance not being acquainted with the path
Cittanupassana we focus on the mind in and of itself but we aren't really acquainted with the mind
What is the mind
Actually there are two aspects to the mind
There's mental consciousness and then there's the mind itself
We think that consciousness is the mind that the mind is consciousness
Actually consciousness is what goes
Say that we see a sight in Bangkok
Cakkhuviññana  eyeconsciousness  is what goes to the sight but the mind doesn't go
The act of going is what's called consciousness but there's no substance to it
Sotaviññana Sometimes we remember sounds from the past
Thoughts of sounds appear in the mind and we focus on them so that we can remember what this or that person said how beautiful it was
What we've remembered is sotaviññana consciousness at the ear
Then there's consciousness at the nose
We can recognize what smells are making contact
We can remember what smells there were and what things we smelled in the past
The mental current that goes out to know these things is called ghanaviññana
Then there's kayaviññana consciousness at the body
We can recognize hot air cold air
We can recognize that This kind of coolness is the coolness of water that kind of coolness is the coolness of wind this kind of heat is the heat of fire this kind of heat is the heat of hot air that kind of heat is the heat of the sun We can recognize these things clearly
We could even write a textbook about them
Knowing these things is called kayaviññana
Manoviññana consciousness at the intellect
Our thinking goes out to Bangkok to the forest to the wilderness all around the world
Our knowledge of these thoughts is manoviññana while the mind is what stays right here in the present
It can't go anywhere
The part of the mind that's awareness itself can't go anywhere at all
It stays right here
It goes out only as far as the skin
There's awareness of things beyond the skin but that awareness isn't the mind
It's consciousness
There's no substance to consciousness no substance at all just like the air
So we don't have to get entangled with it
We can separate consciousness out of the mind separate the mind out of consciousness
The mind is like a fire consciousness the light of the fire
The light and the fire are two different things even though the light comes out of the fire
When we don't understand this that's called ignorance
We conceive consciousness to be the mind and the mind to be consciousness
When we have things all mixed up like this that's called ignorance
Dhammanupassana
We focus on dhammas in and of themselves ie the mental qualities that arise in the mind
When unskillful qualities arise in the mind we don't know how much harm they cause
That's ignorance
As for skillful qualities which ones give only small benefits which ones give medium benefits and which ones give overwhelming benefits we don't know
This means that we aren't acquainted with the qualities of the mind
When we don't know the qualities of the mind we can't separate good from evil or evil from good we can't separate the mind from its qualities or the qualities from the mind
Everything is firmly stuck together in a big thick mass so that we can't pry them apart
This is called ignorance
Ignorance is a Mara a demon a demon that stands in the way preventing us from attaining the highest good ie nibbana
All four of these types of defilement are called the Maras or demons of defilement
The mother of Mara is ignorance
The children of Mara are mental fabrications the grandchildren of Mara are the three forms of craving and the greatgrandchildren of Mara are greed aversion and delusion
Sometimes these members of the Mara family help us develop merit and skill
Sometimes they get up and sit on our heads lording it over us ordering us around
Say for instance that greed gets really strong
We grab hold of whatever we can get our hands on with no thought for who it belongs to or whether taking it is right or wrong
When greed gets really strong it can pressure us into doing evil
When anger gets really strong it puts pressure on our nerves to the point where we can hand down a death sentence and commit murder
The same is true with delusion
Each of these things is an enemy blocking off our goodness but each can also benefit us as well
If we have any discernment greed can help us
Anger can help us
Delusion can help us
If we have any discernment craving can help motivate us to develop goodness
Don't look down on it
We've come here to listen to a sermon
Who talked us into coming
Craving that's who
When people ordain as monks and novices what forces them to do it
Craving that's what
We shouldn't focus only on its bad side
As for meritorious fabrications if we didn't have any of them at all we wouldn't be able to develop any goodness
Everyone who develops goodness in any way has to start out with the intention to do it
Ignorance is also good
When we know that we have ignorance we hurry up and find some way to overcome it
Ignorance is what leads us astray but ultimately ignorance is what will have to lead us back
Knowledge never led anyone to study
Ignorance is what makes people want to learn
When people already know why would they want to look further
Delusion is what makes us look for knowledge  by joining society by associating with people
Our knowledge grows broader and broader from the first impulse born in ignorance
So when dealing with the demons of defilement you have to look for both their good and their bad points
Only when you see both sides can you be said to be discerning and wise
When you can take bad things and make them good that's when you're really outstanding
If you take good things and make them bad that's no good at all
Even when you take good things and make other good things out of them that's not really special
There are three levels of goodness good excellent and outstanding
A good person does good
An excellent person takes something good and makes it better
That's excellent but not outstanding
An outstanding person takes bad things and makes them good takes good things and makes them excellent
So these are the three levels of goodness good excellent and outstanding
So today I've talked about the demons of defilement after the talk the other day on the demons of the aggregates
We should all learn to think to consider things to ponder things over so that we can find goodness on every side in every corner we look
This way if we look beneath us we'll find treasures
If we look above us we'll find treasures
Looking beneath us means looking at the things that are our enemies
We'll be able to gain treasures from them goodness on the outstanding level
When we look at the things that are our friends we can gain excellence from them
We should try to develop all three levels of goodness
If we have discernment we can gain all three levels of goodness from the demons of defilement and the demons of the aggregates and we'll gain all three of the benefits I've mentioned
For this reason we should develop our mental faculties until they're strong capable and mature so that they don't fear Maras of any sort
A person who has studied snakes can pick them up with no fear of their venom
A person who has studied tigers can catch them and they won't bite
In the same way if we have any discernment we can capture and tame the demons of defilement so that they support us in being outstanding all the way to the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
Whoever doesn't have the ability or discernment will get carried off by the demons of defilement to get tortured and killed
So we should use our sharpest discernment to consider these things
That's what will lead us to the noble paths and their fruitions
So when we've heard this we should consider what we've heard and take it to heart bringing it inside to see the ways things actually are inside us and then practicing accordingly in line with the way of right practice
That's when we can be at our ease
Evil people will help us
Good people will help us
We'll be free of danger
Thieves will be our servants helping us in our various tasks
Wise people will help us in our work  so how can we fail
If we look to bad people they come and help us
If we look to good people they come and help us
If we focus on the Maras who are our enemies they turn into our friends and companions
When we reach this point we won't know what's a Mara  because nothing's a Mara in any way at all
Everything's neutral the common property of the world
Whoever can see things in this way has no more suffering no more obstacles
Everything is bright beaming and easy
If you go forward you don't get stuck
If you go back you don't get entangled
You can go as smoothly as a boat over water
That's why this sort of person is said to be sugato someone who goes well who's wellgone
So all of us who are developing our perfections should practice in this way
And now that I've explained the demons of defilement I'll end right here
I'd now like to explain the Dhamma as a gift for those of us who have gathered here
All of us both lay and ordained have come here with skillful intentions from many different provinces
Our coming here is of two sorts
The first sort is connected with our having received an invitation or notice of this gathering so that we've come to join in with the meritmaking for the past eleven days
The second sort didn't receive any notice or invitation but as soon as word of this gathering passed by our ears we gave rise to a good intention  good in one of two ways
The first is that we see that people here are doing something good and so we should join in
That's why some of you are here
This includes many of the monks and novices who came you simply heard the news of this gathering and so you came to join your hearts with ours
This is called a skillful intention that has borne fruit in the hearts of all of us
And then there are those who considered that this is a gathering of our friends of our teacher even though we haven't been called to join we should go
Some of you have thought in this way and so have joined in our gathering participating in the various activities up to today
For all of these things I'd like to express my thanks and appreciation to each and every one of you  because this celebration has involved many duties many activities of many sorts
If I were to try to do it all by myself I'm sure I wouldn't succeed
The fact that we have managed to succeed so well is due to the goodness of all of you together
Now the fact that you've succeeded in completing these activities will give you results in two ways the first is through merit  there's no need to doubt that
The second is through benefaction
Results through merit means that we've never been here before we're not intimate with the people here but we've learned that what they're doing here is meritorious and so we've come in hopes of merit
The other way is as I've said earlier we've come on the basis of being students or friends or of being students of the same teacher
When we willingly come to help in these activities this too is meritorious
The results we'll receive will come in two ways through merit and through benefaction
Merit is an individual affair something for which each person has to be responsible in terms of him or her own self
As for benefaction the person who has benefited from your help and support won't forget your kindness
The memory will stay buried there in the heart that when we held the celebration in that year or that time our friends came to help us
If they have any need for our help then  to the extent that we're able  we should take the opportunity to return their kindness in line with our ability
Whether they call for our help or not and whether or not we can actually go to help we can't escape having the intention to benefit them in one way or another
Even though my body may not be able to go or my words can't reach you still my mind  when I hear the news one way or another of any meritorious activities and there's some way I can help  will remember your kindness and the merit that I've accumulated myself and so I'll spread thoughts of good will dedicating the fruits of that merit to pour down on you all
It's as if all of you were farming in a certain place planting rice or vegetables or starting an orchard and then ran into difficulties such as a drought
When this happens there are things that have to be done finding water for instance or repairing the dikes in the rice field
When a person who has received your help in the past learns of your difficulties but can't carry the water to you or help with the repair work he'll spread thoughts of good will
Spreading thoughts of good will is something subtle and hard to perceive like the energy that flows out of our eyes
The eyes of every person shoot beams of energy out into the air the same way that the beams of car headlights light up a road
The energy from our eyes though is refined
No matter where we look we don't see the energy flowing past because the current is subtle
It's because the current is subtle though that it can flow far
If the current were blatant it would go only a short distance
This is why when people develop solid concentration they're able to see many subtle worlds
In other words the nature of eyeenergy has no limit but we simply get no use out of it
Why
Because our minds aren't still
If our minds aren't still we're like a person preoccupied all wrapped up in his work
When the mind is wrapped up in confusion this way then even though the eyes have potential energy we can't get any use out of it because it's very subtle
The energy can go very far but the problem is that the mind isn't quiet
If the mind were really quiet we could immediately see very far
That's clairvoyance
This is something ordinary and natural that exists in every human being
If the mind is weak then outside currents cut off the energy coming from our eyes
If the mind is strong and resilient the currents of the world can't cut that energy off
Such people can see far regardless of whether their eyes are open or closed
This is a quality that exists in the human body  something of very high quality by its nature but we can't get any use out of it because our minds are distracted and restless
When our minds are distracted and restless we're like people who are dead drunk even though drunk people may have tools in their possession they can't put them to any use other than as weapons to kill one another
Only if they're good and sober will they be able to use those tools to amass wealth and provide for their physical wellbeing
But if they're mentally unbalanced you give them a knife and they'll use it to slice somebody's head open
As a result they end up in prison
Even if they don't end up in prison they'll have to get caged or locked up at home
The same is true with the human beings born in this world even though they're endowed with good things by nature their minds aren't at normalcy
And so the good things within them end up causing various kinds of harm
Here we've been talking about physical nature
When we talk about subtle matters like merit or the mind they're much more refined than the body
For this reason helping people by way of the mind is something much more profound
When a person trains his own mind and trains it well to the point where he experiences happiness and peace and then hears that other people are suffering and that there's a way he can be of help he uses the strength of the mind
He cultivates the mind until it's firmly established and then can send that clean current to be of immediate help
The hearts of ordinary people though are like salt water in the ocean
If you use it to bathe you're not really comfortable  although it can help you get by in a pinch
If you try to drink it it doesn't nourish the body
You use it only if you really don't have anything else at all
In the same way the hearts of human beings in this world are adrift in the ocean the flood of sensuality the flood of becoming the flood of views the flood of ignorance
These four oceans are deep deeper than the water in the sea
We depend on our minds that are swimming in these oceans sinking in salt water
That's why when some people are in really salty water the waves are strong
If they lie down to sleep they toss and turn just like waves in the sea
They lie down on their left side and can't sleep
They turn over and lie on their right side and still can't sleep
It comes from the waves
And where do these waves come from
The ocean
In other words they come from
 the flood of sensuality sensual desires attachment to sensual objects
 the flood of becoming wanting to be this wanting to be that struggling to escape from the state we're in
 the flood of views holding fast to our own views to the point of getting into arguments  a sign that we're adrift in salt water
 and the flood of ignorance darkness behind us  not knowing the past darkness in front of us  not knowing the future darkness in the present  not knowing what's good and evil within ourselves letting the mind fall for the ways of the world of rebirth
That's what's meant by ignorance
The normal nature of the human mind is to be floating adrift in this way which is why the Buddha had the great kindness to want us to develop our merit and skillfulness
That's why he advised us to build a boat for ourselves the boat here is the activity of our physical body
As for the provisions that we'll need for crossing the ocean those are the requisites that we as Buddhists sacrifice in order to benefit monastics in our development of generosity
If you can give a lot it means that you'll have enough to help you cross over the ocean for you'll have enough to eat
If you give only a little you might run out of provisions and start drifting aimlessly with the currents and waves in the middle of the ocean
If you're lucky the waves may wash you ashore so that you manage to survive
But if the waves are large and your boat small you won't be able to reach land
You'll end up sinking in the middle of the sea
The Buddha contemplated this fact which is why he advised us to develop our goodness
On one level developing goodness is involved with the way we use our material possessions
On another it's involved with the way we look after our actions improving the way we use our physical body so that it becomes fully trained
The results we'll receive are of two sorts
The first is that our boat won't sink
The second is that we'll have plenty of provisions for crossing over the vast expanse of the sea
But even when people have a seaworthy boat and plenty of provisions they can still run out of water to drink
When that happens then although they have plenty of provisions they're put to difficulties
To prevent this the Buddha taught us another skill how to distill salt water so that we can drink it
If we're intelligent we can distill salt water so that we can drink it
We'll be able to reach America without having to stop off anywhere along the way
If we have discernment we'll be able to drink salt water
In what way
Salt water comes from fresh water so wherever there's salt water there has to be fresh water
They can't escape from each other
Once you realize this you can travel around the world
If you're skilled at distilling your salt water can turn into fresh water
Once we can turn salt water into fresh water in this way we can be at our ease
Even though we're in the middle of the ocean we'll have fresh water to drink and to bathe our bodies
That way we'll be at our ease
In the same way those of us who are adrift in the ocean of life have to
The boat here stands for our body
It's not a big boat  if it were larger than this we human beings would have lots of hardships
The body is a fathom long a cubit wide and a span thick
This is a boat that we have to caulk so that it's nice and tight
Caulking the boat here stands for restraint of the senses restraining the eye  being careful not to give rise to bad kamma because of the eye not letting barnacles build up on it restraining the ear  don't let anything evil come in by way of the ear for anything that's evil is like a barnacle
The same holds true with our nose tongue body and mind we shouldn't take an interest in anything evil or bad for things of that sort are like barnacles or insects that will bore into the wood of our boat and destroy it
This is why we're taught to practice restraint over our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind
We abstain from doing whatever shouldn't be done
We have to protect ourselves and practice restraint considering things thoroughly before we act
If we let barnacles develop all over our body this boat of ours  this Body Ship  will wear out and sink into the ocean
As for the mind we have to be careful that defilements don't arise in the heart
We have to exercise restraint like this at all times continually caulking our six sense media caulking our eyes with the right sights our ears with the right sounds our nose with the right smells our tongue with the right flavors our body with the right tactile sensations and our mind with the Dhamma
Caulking the eye means that if we see a lack anywhere that will give us a chance to develop merit and skillfulness  whether it's inside the monastery or out  we shouldn't be indifferent to it
We should fill up the lack as we can step by step
This is called caulking the eye
Caulking the ear means that when we hear people say anything  regardless of whether they have the intention of telling or teaching us  when their voices come scraping into our ears we should tell ourselves that the sound is a chance for us to develop our goodness
In that way the sound will be useful to us
No matter what kind of person is speaking  child or adult monk novice or nun tall short black white whatever we should choose to pay attention only to the things that will be of use to us
This is called using sounds as pitch for caulking for the ears
When we encounter smells passing by our nose we should search only for smells that will make us cheerful that will give rise to skillful mental states as a way of caulking our nose
This is what will bring happiness and peace to the mind
Caulking the body stands for the way we sit here quietly listening to the Dhamma without moving around or making any disturbance
It also stands for sitting in meditation sitting and chanting performing a candle circumambulation ceremony using the body to bow down to the Buddha
All of these things count as caulking for the body
As for caulking the mind that stands for dhammaosatha the medicine of the Dhamma
We caulk the mind by the way we think
If when we think of something the mind sours we shouldn't think about that thing
Whether it's a matter of the world or of the Dhamma if thinking about it gives rise to anger or delusion in the mind we shouldn't pay it any attention
We should think instead of the good we've done in the past
For example we can think of the good things we did together in the celebration of the year BE
Even though we've parted ways since then we've come back together to do skillful and meritorious things once more
This is a caulking for the mind
In addition to that we foster another form of goodness called developing concentration
Developing concentration is a way of caulking the mind so that it doesn't develop any gaps leaks or holes
All of this is called caulking our boat  the boat of the body
In Pali this is called indriyasamvarasila the principles of restraint over the sense faculties
We exercise restraint over our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind so that our boat will float on the ocean without sinking
This is called caulking our boat
What do we do next
We have to stock our boat with provisions
Once we're born in the world our wellbeing depends on the requisites of life
We've eaten food worn clothing lived in shelter and used medicine to treat the body
That's why we've been able to find as much comfort as we have
When we consider this fact we have to turn and consider how others are getting along
When we see that we need these things to get along we start stocking our boat by giving gifts of almsfood and making other donations to provide all four requisites
That's called stocking our boat with provisions
Then we put up a mast and unfurl a sail
In other words we invite a monk to get up on the sermon seat and teach the Dhamma as a way of inclining the mind in the right direction
The mind will then zip right along in line with the breeze of the Dhamma
And the body will go right along with it
For example once we've heard the Dhamma we gain a feeling of contentment so that we want to hear it again
This is a sign that our boat has caught wind and the wind is strong so we sail right along
This will help our boat reach the other shore easily
If there's no sail to help it along and we stock the boat with too many things it may sink
This is why there's the custom when anyone makes a donation to have a sermon at the same time as a way of inclining the mind in the direction of the Dhamma
For our boat to get anywhere it needs a sail
Then no matter how many or how few provisions we haul on board the boat will head in the direction we want it to
This is the second thing we need to know
The third thing is the method for distilling salt water so that it can become fresh
This stands for practicing tranquillity meditation and insight meditation
We give rise to directed thought and evaluation within the mind
And what is salt water
Salt water stands for defilement
The defilements of the mind are saltier than salt
When we try to eat salt  even just a little  we can't swallow it because we find it so salty but the defilements are even saltier than that
They can crust us over so that we spoil and rot in all sorts of ways
When this is the case what can we do
We have to filter or distill them
Filtering refers to yoniso manasikara appropriate attention
Whatever we do we have to reflect to be observant to consider things carefully before we act
This is the first vat in our distillery
Our second vat is meditation contemplating our fabrications by using skillful strategies giving rise to the factors of jhana
The first factor is directed thought keeping in mind the preoccupation that can act as a foundation for the mind  its gocaradhamma or proper range  as a way of aiming it in the right direction by developing the four frames of reference
This is how we distill salt water
The four frames of reference are
All four of these are gathered in the body and mind
This is one way of looking at them called anuloma or in line with the standard way
The other way is called patiloma in reverse of the standard way in which we take all four and turn them into one
The standard way is when we practice directed thought and evaluation
But when we take all four and turn them into one we take only one part of the body as they say in the Great Frames of Reference Discourse we focus on the body in and of itself as an object of tranquillity meditation
In other words we take all four parts and gather them into the body the properties of earth water fire and wind
That's the body
When we see that it has many parts and many aspects preventing the mind from growing still making it distracted we choose only one of the parts
For example we put aside the properties of earth water and fire and stay still only with the property of wind
We focus down on the wind property as the object we keep in mind this is called the body in and of itself
The wind property here means the inandout breath
When we keep the breath in mind and watch constantly over it that's called developing the body in and of itself
When the breath comes in we watch it
When it goes out we watch it
We keep surveying it constantly
Sometimes it's coarse sometimes it's refined sometimes it's cool sometimes it's warm
No matter what it's like we keep watching it
Sometimes just as we're about to reach something good in the meditation we get discouraged
It's like boiling water in our distillery
Normally two sorts of things can happen
If the fire is too strong the water starts boiling so fast that it all turns into steam overflows the vat and puts out the fire
If the fire is too weak the water doesn't boil and so it produces no steam at all
Sometimes the fire is just right  not too strong not too weak  just right in between
The middle way
The fire is just enough to give rise to steam  not so much that it overflows the vat but enough for steam to come out of the vat enough for the steam to become drops of fresh water
This is why we're taught to be observant
When the desire to succeed in the meditation is really strong it can prevent the mind from growing still
The breath gets stirred up and can't grow subtle
This is called desire getting in the way
Sometimes the desire is too weak
You sit there the mind still the breath refined light  and you drift right to sleep
The water never comes to a boil
You have to put things together in the right proportions just right with mindfulness and alertness monitoring things at all times
When the mind is staying with coarse breathing you know
When it's staying with refined breathing you know
When your mindfulness and alertness are constant in this way the result is rapture the body is light cool comfortable and at ease
The mind has a sense of fullness blooming and bright in its concentration
This is where fresh water is beginning to gather in your distillery
The salt water begins to disappear
In other words the salt water of sensual desire ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty  letting the mind run to the past run to the future not clearly seeing the present  begins to disappear
When the mind is really still and refined it gives rise to concentration with a sense of ease and fullness so that you can sit for many hours
This is the same as taking a single jar of fresh water with us in our boat
If we have the intelligence to distill fresh water out of salt water our one jar of water will become a magic jar providing us with enough water to drink all the way around the world
In the same way when we develop concentration by using directed thought to lift the mind to its object as the first step in the first jhana and evaluation to keep contemplating the object of our meditation to make it subtle and refined  when the properties of the body have been thoroughly evaluated the mind will be able to contemplate the drawbacks of the five hindrances
The body will grow quiet  this is called kayapassaddhi physical serenity and the mind will grow still  cittapassaddhi mental serenity
The body will be at ease with no pains or heaviness this is kayalahuta physical lightness
This is where rapture arises
The mind will feel full and satisfied with no restlessness or distraction like a person who has eaten his fill or a child who has eaten its fill so that it no longer disturbs its mother or father
When the heart has rapture as its companion it will be free from unrest
It will be cool
It will be able to use the fresh water it has distilled from salt water as a means of washing its clothing as a means of bathing its body
Then it will be able to wash the earth property  which is like a rag  the water property the wind property and the fire property all of which are like rags they're always ripping and tearing always getting dirty
This is why we have to care for them at all times
When the mind has given rise to the factors of concentration the power of rapture will come to wash our properties of earth water wind and fire
Then if we want to be warm we won't have to sit in the sunlight if we want to be cool we won't have to sit in the breeze
If when we're stuck in the sunlight we want to be cool we'll be cool
If when we're stuck in water we want to be warm we'll be warm
That way we can be at our ease like a person who has clothing to cover his body and so has no need to feel bashful when he enters human society
This is why meditators have no fear of difficult conditions
Why is that
Because they have their own source of fresh water water to bathe in water to drink
They've got all the water they need to use for bathing their body for bathing their eyes ears nose tongue body and mind for bathing the properties of earth water wind and fire
That's water for using
As for water for drinking they can develop concentration to an even higher level to give rise to a sense of inner pleasure pleasure that arises from within the mind itself
When the mind feels pleasure both the body and mind will be at their ease
The mind will imbibe nothing but pleasure  and there's no pleasure higher than that of the mind at peace
Thus rapture is water for using for bathing the body and mind whereas pleasure is drinking water specifically for the mind
So whoever has the discernment to distill fresh water from salt water will experience ease and wellbeing
This is our first distillery
The second distillery is where we take the water from the first and distill it to even greater purity
This is the same as when they refine sugar after the first stage it still contains some alcohol so they have to refine it a second time
This stands for developing insight meditation something very refined  so refined that nobody else can see it
You can stand and practice insight meditation sit and practice insight meditation you can lie down you can even be giving a Dhamma talk and practice insight meditation the mouth speaks the mind thinks of its topic  when you think of something to say or thoughts simply arise within the mind there's no attachment to bodily fabrication ie the processes of the body no attachment to verbal fabrication ie the thoughts that fabricate words for other people to hear
There's no attachment to your words and your mind doesn't run out after them
As for thoughts that arise from ignorance and craving you know them immediately for what they are
The mind in that state isn't involved in bodily fabrication verbal fabrication or mental fabrication
The mind is then released from all fabrications
All fabrications that arise simply change and then disband
This is true of bodily fabrications verbal fabrications and mental fabrications
When you see these things in terms of their common characteristics when you see them as
then whether you're standing sitting lying down performing physical work or speaking  even when you're just sitting and thinking alone by yourself  you'll find all things good and noble flowing to you at all times
This is called practicing insight meditation
A person like this can then set up an enormous distillery turning the water of the sea into clouds
When the water of the sea has been turned into clouds they'll float through the sky
Wherever people are suffering from hardships the water in the clouds will come raining down watering the land where people live so that they can grow food conveniently
In the same way when people have released their hearts from the power of worldliness their goodness is like clouds
When the clouds turn into rain the rain water will help good people live in happiness and wellbeing
This is one of the benefits that comes from those who have developed discernment
So I ask that all of you make a mental note of these three maxims
Whoever can give rise to these skills within themselves will at the very least become good people
If they're not heedless and make a continual effort they will be able to take the mind beyond all becoming
So all of you who have gathered together to make merit on this occasion I ask that you accept as a gift the Dhamma described here take it with you and put it into practice
You will experience pleasure flourish and thrive in the Buddha's teachings
Less than a year before Ajaan Lee's death some of his students began taperecording his Dhamma talks
The following talk is one of the nine for which we have transcripts from the tapes  and one of the four for which the tapes are still extant
It's a very unusual talk showing his distinctive humor and style and providing a lively discussion of the ways in which the concepts of self and notself actually function in practice
 the translator
In all our activities persistence and endurance are things we have to foster within ourselves at all times
There have been cases both in the past and in the present where people with little education  who couldn't even read or write  have thrown themselves into the effort of the practice and discover that they can read and even memorize whole passages
Some of them have even earned the right to sit for the government exams  this sort of thing has happened
So we should keep reminding ourselves that everything in the world comes from effort and persistence
No matter what kind of person you are  very smart or very stupid with a poor education and poor social skills  as long as you have these qualities of persistence and endurance in your heart there's hope for you
As for people who are very smart sophisticated and welleducated if they lack effort and persistence they won't be able to succeed in their aims in terms either of the world or of the Dhamma
Especially for those of us who aim at the highest happiness or nibbana effort and persistence are the magnets that will pull us toward our goal
Now when effort and persistence are present within us then endurance will have to be present as well
Why
When you put effort and persistence into something there are bound to be obstacles that get in your way
If you're really persistent those obstacles will have to disappear which means that you've been using endurance as well
If you have effort but no endurance you won't get anywhere
If you have persistence that means that your effort has endurance too
So we should regard effort as coming first and endurance second
Once these qualities are constantly working together within you then no matter how deep or faraway your aims may be the Buddha has forecast that you'll attain them in line with your hopes
This is why he said as a way of ensuring that we'll make the proper effort that Viriyena dukkhamacceti It's through effort and persistence that people gain release from the world and reach nibbana
Effort and persistence are our roots or the magnets that will pull us to nibbana
That's what the Buddha said
But our own wrong views which come from the power of defilement take issue with his teaching
In other words they don't believe it
They believe themselves by and large and aren't willing to believe the teachings of the wise
This is why we have to keep stumbling and crawling along in this world
We simply believe in ourselves in our own views but ourself is made up of defilement
This defilement is the obstacle that keeps us from believing the Buddha when he tells us that it's through effort and persistence that people will gain release from suffering and stress
We simply hear the words but don't understand them
What we hear goes only as far as our ears and doesn't enter into our hearts
And this means that we're working at cross purposes
Even within a single you you're working at cross purposes
What you hear is one thing what you think is something else and they don't go together
When this happens you start having doubts
Uncertainty
Things aren't clear to the heart
Your practice turns into nothing but ups and downs right things and wrong
This is because the heart of every person Of course there's only one heart in every person but how is it that the heart has so many issues
This is a really complicated question
Why
Because if we look only on the surface we'll say that each person has only one mind
That's all we know
But if we look in another way the texts tell us that there are so many mental consciousnesses that they can't be counted
This makes us wonder How can that be
And when we turn from the texts and really look at ourselves we'll see that the body of a human being doesn't have only one consciousness
There are lots of consciousnesses in there
Your own real consciousness you can hardly find at all
You may have up to three kinds of consciousness inside your body
The first is your own consciousness which entered your mother's womb at the time of your conception without any other consciousnesses mixing in with it
There were lots of other consciousnesses around it at the time but they all died out before they could take birth
You can't count how many there are at a time like that but in the fight to take birth only one of them has the merit to make it and the rest all fall away in huge numbers by the wayside
So when we make it into a human womb at the time of conception we can chalk it up to our merit that we've been able to establish a foothold for ourselves in the human world
Once our consciousness gets established like this it begins to develop
The body develops
As it develops other consciousnesses start infiltrating without our realizing it
If you want to see a really clear example look at the human body after it takes birth
Sometimes a worm two feet long can come out of your intestines
What does that come from if not from a consciousness
Or how about germs
Some diseases are actually caused by little animals in your body that cause swellings and tumors
As the traditional doctors used to say there are eight families and twelve clans of diseasecausing animals in our body
What do they come from
From consciousness that's what
If there were no consciousness how could there be animals
Animals arise from consciousness
And some of them you can clearly see as they come crawling in huge numbers out of wounds out your ears and eyes nose teeth anus whole swarms of them
So what are they
They're a form of consciousness
This kind of consciousness you can see clearly but there's another group of consciousnesses that are more insidious that don't have a body you can see
Only if you meditate and gain psychic powers can you see them
That's the third kind of consciousness inhabiting your body
So altogether there are three Your own consciousness and there's only one of that
And then all the many consciousnesses lurking in your body so many that you can't say exactly how many there are
The ones with bodies you can see are more than many
And as for the ones with no bodies but are living in your body there's no telling how many there are
Now it's because there are so many of them with so many agendas that the Buddha tells us not to go joining in with them
They're not us not ours none of our business
Sometimes we sit around with absolutely nothing wrong and all of a sudden one thing starts leading to another inside the mind
We don't want it to happen but the mind seems to take on a mind of its own
That's a clear case of these consciousnesses these crazy consciousnesses getting into the act seeping into our own consciousness and making us fall in line with them
These consciousnesses that lurk in our bodies without any bodies of their own They can get angry too you know
They can get greedy and deluded they can feel love and hate just like us
Once they start feeling things like this and they're right next to us our own consciousness follows along with them without our even realizing it
This is why there are so many issues in the heart
It's entirely possible you know
Suppose for instance that two of your children are quarreling right in front of you
That's enough to put you in a bad mood yourself
Even though you didn't get involved in the quarrel along with them there's a connection and so you end up with a lot of hurt feelings too
This is why we're taught Yam ve sevati tadiso You end up being like the people you hang around with
So we're taught to analyze things
There are lots of minds in your mind
Some of them are animal minds
It's not your mind that gets worked up their minds are the ones getting worked up but they're right next to yours and as a result you start tilting in their direction
This is why we're taught that they're anatta notself
Consciousness is notself
So don't get involved with it
We have to use effort persistence endurance to keep things under our thumb
As soon as these things disappear that's when the heart can be bright and at ease
Because actually when things like this arise in the heart it's not our doing
It's their doing
If it were really our own doing then when things like this appear in the heart we should feel happy and content
When they disappear we should feel happy and content
But actually when things arise in the heart there are only some cases where we're delighted about what's happening
There are other cases where no we're not happy at all
There's a conflict in the mind
Sometimes there are huge numbers of these other consciousnesses and they have lots of agendas of their own
We get outnumbered and start falling in line with them
When this happens we do things wrong and say things wrong and end up sorry afterwards
This is because we act in line with them and not in line with our own true heart
So you have to keep this point in mind if you want to understand consciousness
The Buddha tells us in really simple terms but we don't understand him
He says Consciousness isn't our self Only four words and yet we can't understand them
And how can we expect to understand them
Our hearts aren't established in concentration so everything we hear gets all confused
All we can think is that consciousness is our mind
That's all we can think so we start aligning ourselves with everything taking sides
This is us
That's us
We start siding with everything which is why we don't understand consciousness
Now when we start considering things carefully to see what our own real consciousness is like we'll check to see if there's anything in there that's honest and loyal and true to us
If there's something that you like to do  you realize it's proper you know it's right  and you go ahead and do it to completion then that's something you can trust
But there are other things that you don't really like  part of you wants to do them another part doesn't  so when there's a split like this you should realize that you've been associating with fools with certain kinds of consciousnesses that have come to deceive you
That's when you have to resist to persist to pen that thinking in
In other words you have to focus on contemplating that particular consciousness to see what kind of consciousness it is
Is it your own consciousness
Or is it another consciousness that has snuck in to trip up your consciousness so that you fall in line with it
If you fall in line with it and end up doing things that you later regret that's called getting taken in by consciousness
When the Buddha tells us that consciousness isn't our self that it's anatta we don't understand what he says
There's one sort of consciousness that's really ours
The consciousness that's really ours is loyal honest and true to us
Suppose that you make up your mind that tomorrow you want to go to the monastery to hear a sermon
Now going to the monastery to hear a sermon is something good that you like to do
You really benefit from it
You're really clear on this point
But by the time tomorrow comes your mind has changed because  it's simply changed
When this happens you should realize that your consciousness has gotten mixed up with some other kind of consciousness
That's how you have to look at things
Don't think that it's really your consciousness
The new thought that repeals your old thought isn't really you
It's cheating you
It's not really you
Normally if something is really you it's not going to cheat you
It has to be honest and loyal and devoted to you
Once you make up your mind to do something good you have to stick with it until you succeed and feel happy afterwards
That sort of thinking is your own real consciousness
It's honest
It doesn't deceive you
Most people though deceive themselves
Actually they don't deceive themselves
They're perfectly all right but these other consciousnesses seep into them so that they end up getting deceived
This is why the Buddha teaches us asevana ca balanam don't go associating with fools
If you hang around with that kind of consciousness often you'll end up suffering
So  panditanañca  associate with wise people
Make your mind firmly settled and established
If you think of doing something good make it good all the way until you succeed in line with your aims
That's you
Don't let any other consciousnesses in to meddle with your affairs
If you run across any thoughts that would make you abandon your efforts realize that you've been associating with fools associating with consciousnesses aside from yourself
That's how you should look at things
Now if we were to go into detail on all the consciousnesses living in our bodies there would be lots to say
Basically there are two kinds those whose thoughts are in line with ours and those whose thoughts are not
For example when we want to do good there are hungry ghosts and spirits that would like to do good too but they can't because they don't have a body
So they take up residence in our body in order to do good along with us
But there are other spirits who want to destroy whatever good we're trying to do
They were probably our enemies in past lives We probably oppressed them imprisoned them or had them put to death
We got in the way of the good they were trying to do so they've got some old scores to settle
They want to block the path we're trying to practice so that we don't make any progress
They come whispering into our ears Stop
Stop
You're going to die
You're going to starve
It's going to rain too hard the sun's too hot it's too early too late they go on and on
These are the consciousnesses that come as our enemies
There are others that used to be our relatives and friends
They want to do good but they can't so they take up residence in our body so that they can bow down to the Buddha and chant along with us
Because of all this there are times when our hearts are like monsters and ogres
We can't imagine why it's happening and yet it's happening even though we don't want it to
Then there are other times when our hearts are like devas  so sweet and goodtempered that other people can curse our mother and grandmother and we won't get mad
Then there are other times when there's no call for anger and yet we manage to get angry in really ugly nasty ways
That's the way it is with these consciousnesses all very confused and confusing and they come seeping into our bodies
That's how you should look at things
There's yet another group of consciousnesses the ones who have come to collect old kamma debts
They're the germs that eat away at our flesh  at our nose our ears  to ruin our looks
They eat away at our lower lip exposing our teeth making us embarrassed and ashamed
Sometimes they eat away at one of our ears or eat away at our nose all the way up to the forehead
Sometimes they eat at our eyes our hands our feet
Sometimes they eat away at our whole body making our skin diseased
These are kamma debt collectors
In the past we made life miserable for them so this time around they're ganging up to make us squirm
The one's that are really easy to see are the worms that help eat the food in our intestines
In the past we probably ate their flesh and skin so this time around they're going to eat ours
They eat eat eat  eat everything
Whatever you've got you bastard I'm going to eat it all That's what they say
How are we ever going to get rid of them
They eat our outsides where we can see them so we chase them away and they go running inside to eat in our stomach and intestines
That's when it really gets bad we can't even see them and they're even harder to get rid of
So they keep making us squirm as they keep eating eating away eating in our intestines eating in our stomach eating our kidneys our liver our lungs eating in our blood vessels eating our body hairs eating everything all over the place
They eat outside and turn into skin diseases
They eat inside as worms and germs
And they themselves get into fights  after all there are lots of different gangs in there
Even just the worms have clans
So when there are so many of them they're bound to quarrel creating a ruckus in our home
How can we ever hope to withstand them
Sometimes we fall in with them without realizing it
How can that happen
Because there are so many of them that we can't resist
These living beings in our body Sometimes they get angry and get into fights
Sometimes they run into one another on the street and start biting and hitting each other so that we itch in front and itch in back  scritch scritch scratch scratch The worms have gotten into a gang war
They cruise around in our body the way we do outside
The blood vessels are like roads so there are little animals cruising down the blood vessels
This one comes this way that one comes that they meet each other and start talking
Sometimes they have real conversations that know no end so they spend the night there eating right there and excreting right there until a swelling starts That's a little shack for the beings the consciousnesses in our body
This is how things keep happening
Our body is like a world
Just as the world has oceans mountains trees vines land so it is with the body
Each blood vessel is a road for living beings
They travel down our blood vessels down our breath channels
Some vessels get closed off like a dead end road
Others stay open
When they're open the blood flows the breath flows like the water in rivers and streams
When they flow boats can travel along them
When there are boats there are beings in the boats
Sometimes the boats crash into each other
That's why we have aches and pains in our legs and arms and along our breath channels
So go ahead keep rubbing them and massaging them  it's all an affair of the consciousnesses inhabiting our bodies
Some of them live in our eye sockets some live in our earholes some in our nostrils some in our mouth our throat our gums
They're just like people only we can't understand their language
They have jobs and careers families and homes and places to vacation all over our body
These consciousnesses in our bodies sometimes get into battles and wars just like red ants and black ants
Sometimes lizards and toads get into battles  I've seen it happen
It's the same in our body so where are we going to go to escape from it all
The beings in our eyes lay claim to our eyes as their home
The ones in our ears claim our ears as their home
The ones in our blood vessels claim those as their home
Sometimes their claims overlap so they get into feuds
As the texts say there are feelings that arise from consciousness
This is why there are so many things that can happen to the body
Some kinds of consciousness give rise to disease some are just waiting their chance
For instance some kinds of consciousness without bodies hang around our blood vessels waiting for wounds and boils to develop
That's their chance to take on bodies as worms and germs
As for the ones who don't yet have bodies they travel around as chills and thrills and itches and aches all over our body
It's all an affair of consciousnesses
In short there are three classes in all  three clans and all of them great big ones
The first are the living beings with bodies that live in our body
Then there are the consciousnesses that don't have bodies of their own but inhabit our body
Then there's our own consciousness
So all in all there are three
These three types of consciousness get all mixed up together so we don't know which kinds of consciousness belong to animals with bodies which kinds belong to beings that don't yet have bodies and which kind of consciousness is our own
We don't know
When we don't know this how can we know the five aggregates
Viññanakkhandho that we chant every morning  how can we know it
All we know is consciousness consciousness but our own consciousness is so slack and limp that it's like a rope dragging on the ground
It's the same with the phrase Consciousness is notself All we know is the words they say
Only when we develop discernment from concentrating the mind will we be able to understand consciousness
That's when we'll be able to understand the properties starting with Cakkhudhatu rupadhatu cakkhuviññanadhatu  eye property form property eyeconsciousness property
To understand these three things you need the kind of knowledge that comes from concentration
For example how many kinds of consciousness are there in our eye
When a form appears to the eye and there's consciousness of the form  is it really our consciousness or is it the consciousness of some other being without a body that's getting into the act
Or is it the consciousness of a being with a body getting in our way making us doubtful and unsure
The three kinds of consciousness that arise at the eye that see forms how many different ways do they react
And are those reactions really a result of our own consciousness or of the consciousness of beings with bodies inhabiting our body
Or are they the result of consciousnesses without bodies
We don't know
We haven't the slightest idea
When we don't know even this much how are we going to know Cakkhudhatu rupadhatu cakkhuviññanadhatu
There's no way
We have no insight no knowledge no discernment at all
Sotadhatu our ear which is the basis for earconsciousness to arise
Which kind of earconsciousness arises first
Do we know
No not at all
Is it our own consciousness that goes out to listen to sounds
Is it the consciousness of some little animal lurking in our ears
Or is it the consciousness of some being that doesn't even have a body
Or is it really our own consciousness
Examine things carefully so that you know this before anything else
You can tell from the results There are some kinds of sounds that you like to hear but you know that they're not right and yet you still like to listen to them
You should realize when this happens that it's not your consciousness that's listening because it's not loyal to you
There are other kinds of sounds that are good and right but you don't like them
That's another case when it's not your consciousness
Something else has probably infiltrated and gotten in the way
You have to watch out for this carefully because there are a lot of different groups of consciousness with their own agendas
Sometimes you listen to other people speaking What they say is true and right but you don't like it
So you go assuming that this business of liking and disliking is yours
You never stop to think that consciousness is notself
The fact that you don't stop to think is why your ears are so deaf
You're not listening
Some hungry ghost is listening in your stead without your even realizing it
So how are you going to remember anything
Your mind isn't here with the body in the present so it's not listening
Hungry ghosts are listening dead spirits are listening angry demons are in the way so as a result you yourself don't know don't understand what's being said
Ghosts and demons are doing all the listening and thinking but you assume it's all you
This is why the Buddha said that ignorance blinds our eyes and deafens our ears
It's all an affair of consciousnesses
Cakkhudhatu rupadhatu cakkhuviññanadhatu There are these three things
The instant the eye sees a form what consciousness goes out to look
Have you ever stopped to take notice
No
Never
So you don't know whether it's really your own consciousness or the consciousness of an animal lurking in your eye whether it's an animal with a body or one without a body
You don't even know whether these things really exist
When you don't know this what can you hope to know
Sotadhatu saddadhatu sotaviññanadhatu You don't know this one either
And so on down the list Ghanadhatu The nose is where smells are known and noseconsciousness arises
Sometimes our consciousness likes certain kinds of smells smells that are proper in line with the Dhamma
So we search out and find those smells to make merit
Other times we give up
We like the smells but we don't follow through
We don't carry through with our own thoughts
Then there are certain kinds of smells that we don't like but we still go after them
Some kinds we like but we don't follow through
There are all kinds of issues surrounding smells
Smells appear in our nose and consciousness appears in our nose as well
Who knows how many hundreds of kinds of consciousness are living in there
Sometimes they know things before we do
They send us all kinds of false reports to deceive us
They whisper to us keeping us misinformed so that we believe them
As a result we close our eyes and follow along with them like a bear getting honey from a bee's nest
It just closes its eyes and keeps slurping away slurping away at the honey
It can't open its eyes because the bees are going to sting out its eye sockets
The same with us when consciousness comes whispering Go
Go we go along with it thinking that we're the ones who feel the need to go
Actually we don't know what it is that comes slipping in to pull us around like a medium possessed by a spirit
Jivhadhatu The tongue
The tongue is where tastes arise
Tastes come and make contact at the tongue and an awareness arises called consciousness
But the consciousness that arises exactly which consciousness arises first
There are living beings that reside in our taste buds and they have consciousness too you know
They may know even more than we do
For example say that there's food we know is bad for us to eat but there's the desire to eat it
Why is there the desire
Sometimes we don't want to eat it but the consciousness of some living being wants to eat it
If we eat it we know it will make us sick but there's still the desire to eat it
This is called getting fooled by flavors
Getting fooled by consciousness
There are three sorts of consciousness as we've already mentioned so which consciousness is getting in the act
Is it our consciousness or not
We've never stopped to check
Is it the kind of consciousness that doesn't yet have a body
Or is it the kind that already has a body appearing in our mouth
We don't know
When we don't know that's why everything we say comes out all screwy and wrong
These spirits are the ones that make us speak speaking in all kinds of ways that get us in trouble
Actually we don't want to say those things but we go ahead and say them
That's a sign that we've been associating with fools with the consciousness of angry demons without our even realizing it
It's only afterwards when we end up suffering that we realize what's happened
This is why we keep losing out to them
We don't know consciousness in the five aggregates
We keep chanting Viññanam anatta anatta ta ta every day but don't know a thing
This is what the Buddha called avijja or unawareness
Kayadhatu The same holds true with the body
The body is where tactile sensations are felt
Tactile sensations make contact and we can know them all cold hot soft hard
We know
This knowledge of tactile sensations is called consciousness
But whose consciousness it is we've never made a survey
So we think that we're the ones who are cold we're the ones who are hot and yet it's not us at all
Like a person possessed by a spirit
What happens when a person is possessed by a spirit
Suppose there's someone who has never drunk liquor
When a spirit possesses him he drinks two or three glasses  really enjoying it  but when the spirit leaves the person who has never drunk liquor is dead drunk
Why
Because there was a consciousness from outside possessing him
He  the real him  never drank liquor but he drank when an outside spirit possessed him
The same holds true with our mind
When these consciousnesses start getting obstreperous we start doing things even though we don't want to do them
Some forms of consciousness like the cold some like heat
Just like the animals in the world Some like hot weather some like cold weather some like to eat hard things some like to eat soft things
Worms and caterpillars for instance They like to eat hard things
It's the same with the living beings in our bodies Some like to eat hard things so they nibble at our bones  or at our flesh until it sloughs off in pieces
Some drink the liquid parts
Some like hot things some like cold things
So when it gets cold we feel that we're really cold but we've never stopped to think about what's made us cold
When it gets hot we don't know what's made us hot
We just think that it's us this is us that's us
When it was that we became a spiritconsciousness along with them we never noticed
This is why the Buddha said that we have no discernment
We fall for these forms of consciousness forgetting his teaching that consciousness is notself
Actually there's only one of us and it's not all complicated like this
As for our mind  manodhatu  the same holds true
It's been possessed by spirits so that it suffers from all sorts of symptoms
The ideas that get thought up in the mind the ideas that cause thoughts in the mind they come from a cause
Sometimes the cause may be the shock waves from other consciousnesses bumping into us
The thoughts of living beings with bodies may be directed at us
The consciousness of beings without bodies may have some unfinished business involving us and they may cause our own minds to fall in with them
When this happens you should know Oh
There's been an infiltration The thing that has infiltrated is the mood of another living being
It may be the mood of an animal
The mood of a deva
The mood of an angry demon
We have to decode them so that we'll know
When we can know in this way then there aren't all that many issues in our mind
There's only one mind
There's only one consciousness not a whole lot of them
When one is one it should stay as one
The problem is that one turns into two and then three and then so on without end
This is what blocks our senses
Unawareness blocks our eyes so that we don't know the consciousnesses that have built their homes in our eyeballs
Unawareness blocks our ears the consciousnesses of all the animals that have come and built their homes filling up our earholes
Unawareness blocks our nose the consciousnesses of all the animals that have come and built their homes in our nostrils
It blocks our tongue the consciousnesses of all the animals that have come and built their homes and cities in our tongue
It blocks our body the consciousnesses of all the animals that have come and built their homes in every pore
As for our own single consciousness it's no match for them
This is why the effort of our meditation is so limp and lax we don't understand what these things are doing to us
They close off our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind so that we can't see our way out
As a result the qualities we're trying to develop just don't grow
Now when we can wipe out the homes of unawareness that's when we'll understand what's going on
When we contemplate to the point where we understand these things we'll come to see the endless affairs of all the living beings that have taken up residence in our home
Anekajati samsaram They've come to quarrel and squabble and create a lot of trouble
They like to pull our mind into all kinds of harm
When we contemplate so as to see things in this way dispassion arises
Cakkhusmimpi nibbindati
We feel dispassion for the eye
Rupesupi nibbindati
Dispassion for forms
Cakkhuviññanepi nibbindati
Dispassion for consciousness
We really get tired of it
It's a genuine nuisance to our heart
Nibbindam virajjati viraga vimuccati
We spit them out
The eye spits out forms
It spits out consciousness
It spits them out because it's had enough
Sotasmimpi nibbindati
We feel dispassion for the ear
Saddesupi nibbindati
Dispassion for sounds
Sotaviññanepi nibbindati
Dispassion for consciousness
Viraga vimuccati
We spit them all out
When the eye spits out form forms don't get stuck in the eye so the eye can penetrate and see for miles
When sounds get spit out our ears can penetrate We can hear what the devas are chatting about
When the nose spits out aromas the entire world smells sweet
Our goodness when we let go of it smells sweet in every direction
The tongue spits out flavors it doesn't swallow them it spits out consciousness
The body spits out tactile sensations
Heat doesn't get stuck in the heart
Cold doesn't get stuck in the heart
Hard soft whatever in the body doesn't get stuck doesn't seep in
Everything gets spit out all the way to mental consciousness
The mind lets go of its goodness
It doesn't hold onto the view or conceit that its goodness belongs to it
It spits out evil unskillful states so that evil can't leak in to get it soaked
It spits out all the various things it knows such as That's the consciousness of living beings with bodies That's the consciousness of living beings without bodies That's really my consciousness All of this gets spit out
That's what's called viññanasmimpi nibbindati
Dispassion for consciousness dispassion for mental objects
Viraga vimuccati
Everything gets spit out nothing gets swallowed so nothing gets stuck in the throat
The eye doesn't swallow forms the ear doesn't swallow sounds the nose doesn't swallow smells the tongue doesn't swallow flavors the body doesn't swallow tactile sensations the mind doesn't swallow ideas
Vimuccati Release
There's no more turmoil or entanglement
That's when you're said to be in the presence of nibbana
Vimuttasmim vimuttamiti ñanam hoti khina jati vusitam brahmacariyam  In release there is the knowledge 'Released' Birth is ended the holy life has been fulfilled When we can practice in this way we'll know clearly what's the consciousness of animals what's our consciousness and we can let go of them all
That's when we'll know that we've gained release from all three sorts of consciousness
The consciousness of living beings with bodies isn't our consciousness
The consciousness of living beings without bodies isn't our consciousness
Our consciousness which is aware of these things isn't us
These things get let go in line with their nature
That's when we can be said to know the five aggregates the six sense media
We gain release from the world and can open our eyes
Our eyes will be able to see far as when we slide away the walls on our home and can see for hundreds of yards
When our eyes aren't stuck on forms we can gain clairvoyant powers and see far
When our ears aren't stuck on sounds we can hear distant sounds
When our nose isn't stuck on smells we can sniff the smell of the devas instead of irritating our nose with the smell of human beings
When flavors don't get stuck on the tongue we can taste heavenly medicine and food
When the mind isn't stuck on tactile sensations we can live in comfort
Wherever we sit we can be at our ease at ease when it's cold at ease when it's hot at ease in a soft seat at ease in a hard seat
Even if the sun burns us up we can be at our ease
The body can fall apart and we can be at our ease
This is called spitting out tactile sensations
As for the heart it spits out ideas
It's a heart released released from the five aggregates released from the three sorts of consciousness
They can't ever fool it again
The heart is released from stress and suffering and will reach the highest most ultimate happiness nibbana
Here I've been talking on the topic of consciousness
Take it to heart and train yourself to give rise to knowledge within
That's when you can be said to know the worlds
The consciousnesses that have bodies inhabit the worlds of sensuality from the levels of hell on up to heaven
The consciousnesses with no bodies inhabit the world of the formless Brahmas
Our own consciousness is what will take us to nibbana
When you know these three kinds of consciousness you can be said to be vijjacaranasampanno consummate in knowledge and conduct
Sugato You'll go well and come well and wherever you stay you'll stay well
All the beings of the world can then get some relief
In what way
We hand everything over to them
Any animals who want to eat away in our body can go ahead and do so
We're no longer possessive
Whatever they want whatever they like to eat they can go ahead and have it We don't give a damn
That's how we really feel
We're not attached
If they want to eat our intestines they can go ahead
If they want to eat our excrement they can have it
If they want to eat our blood they can eat all they like
We're not possessive
Whatever any type of consciousness wants they're welcome to it
We give them their independence so they can govern themselves without our trying to snitch anything away from them
As a result they gain a share of our goodness
The same for the bodiless consciousnesses in our body They gain their independence
And we gain our independence too
Everybody gets to live in his or her own house eat his or her own food sleep in his or her own bed
Everyone lives separately so everyone can be at his or her own ease
This is called bhagava The eye gets separated from forms forms get separated from the eye and consciousness gets separated from self
The ear gets separated from sounds sounds get separated from the ear and consciousness gets separated from self
The nose gets separated from smells smells get separated from the nose and consciousness gets separated from self
The tongue gets separated from flavors flavors get separated from the tongue and consciousness gets separated from self
The body gets separated from tactile sensations tactile sensations get separated from the body and consciousness gets separated from the body
The mind gets separated from ideas ideas get separated from the mind and consciousness gets separated from the mind
There's no sense that this is our self or that's our self
This is called Sabbe dhamma anatta all phenomena are notself
We don't claim rights over anything at all
Whoever can do this will gain release from the world from the cycle of death and rebirth
This is asavakkhayañana  the knowledge of the ending of mental fermentation  arising in the heart
So now that you've listened to this you should take it to ponder and contemplate so as to gain a clear understanding within yourself
That way you'll be on the path to release from stress and suffering using persistence and effort at all times to cleanse your own consciousness so as to know it clearly
That's what will lead you to purity
So for today's discussion of consciousnesses I'll ask to stop here
This book is an introduction to the Buddhist practice of training the heart
It is taken from the talks of Phra Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo a teacher in the Thai forest tradition of meditation and is called Food for Thought because it invites the reader to fill in the spaces suggested by the talks  to reflect on how the images and teachings they contain relate to one another and to one's own situation in life
Two of the talks included here Quiet Breathing and Centered Within briefly describe a technique of breath meditation aimed at giving rise to a centered and discerning state of mind
The rest of the talks deal with how to use such a state of mind in dealing with the problems of life the daytoday problems of anger anxiety disappointment etc and the larger problems of aging illness and death
In other words this is a book concerned less with the techniques of meditation than with its meaning and worth the questions of why should one train the heart to begin with what personal qualities are involved in its training and how to make the best use of it as it becomes trained
Readers interested in more detailed instructions in the techniques of formal meditation can find them in Ajaan Lee's other books  especially Keeping the Breath in Mind and Inner Strength  although it is wise to reflect on the sorts of questions raised by this book before actually sitting down to the practice
The talks translated here are actually reconstructions of Ajaan Lee's talks made by two of his followers  a nun Arun Abhivanna and a monk Phra Bunkuu Anuvaddhano  based on notes they made while listening to him teach
Some of the reconstructions are fairly fragmentary and disjointed and in presenting them here I have had to edit them somewhat cutting extraneous passages expanding on shorthand references to points of formal doctrine and filling in gaps by collating passages from different talks dealing with the same topic
Aside from changes of this sort though I have tried my best to convey both the letter and spirit of Ajaan Lee's message
I have also tried to keep the use of Pali words in the translation to a minimum
In all cases where English equivalents have been substituted for Pali terms I have chosen to convey the meanings Ajaan Lee gives to these terms in his writings even when this has meant departing from the interpretations given to these terms by scholars
A few Pali terms though have no adequate English equivalents so here is a brief glossary of the ones left untranslated or unexplained in this book
Brahma An inhabitant of the heavens of form and formlessness corresponding to the levels of meditative absorption in physical and nonphysical objects
Buddho Awake enlightened
An epithet of the Buddha
Dhamma The truth in and of itself the right natural order of things
Also the Buddha's teachings on these topics and the practice of those teachings aimed at realizing the true nature of the mind in and of itself
Kamma Intentional acts which create good or bad results in accordance with the quality of the intention
Kamma debts are the moral debts one owes to others for having caused them hardships or difficulties
Nibbana Liberation the unbinding of the mind from mental defilement and the cycle of death and rebirth
As this term refers also to the extinguishing of fire it carries connotations of stilling cooling and peace

Sangha The followers of the Buddha who have practiced his teachings at least to the point of gaining entry to the stream to Liberation
To take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha means to take them as the guide in one's search for happiness and to make the effort to give rise to their qualities within oneself
My hope is that the teachings in this book will serve as more than just food for thought and that they will inspire you to search for the inner worth and happiness that come with the practice of training the heart
Most of us tend to concern ourselves only with short small and narrow things
For instance we think that there isn't much to human life  we're born and then we die  so we pay attention only to our stomachs and appetites
There's hardly anyone who thinks further than that who thinks out past death
This is why we're shortsighted and don't think of developing any goodness or virtues within ourselves because we don't see the truth and the extremely important benefits we'll gain from these things in the future
Actually the affairs of each person are really long and drawn out and not at all short
If they were short we'd all know where we came from and how we got where we are
The same would hold true for the future If our affairs were really a short story we'd know where we're going and what we'll be after death
But the truth of the matter is that almost no one knows these things about themselves
The only ones who do know are those whose minds are strong in goodness and virtue and who have developed purity to the point where they gain the intuitive understanding that enables them to see where they've come from and where they're going
These people have the inner eye which is why they are able to see things past and future
Sometimes they can see not only their own but also other people's affairs
This is what makes them realize the hardships and difficulties suffered by human beings and other living beings born into this world
They see the cycle of birth aging illness and death
They see their past lives both good and bad and this makes them feel a sense of dismay and dispassion disenchanted with the idea of ever being born again
As a result they try to develop their goodness and virtues even further so that they can reduce the number of times they'll have to be reborn
For example streamwinners  those who have entered the stream to Liberation  will be reborn at most only seven more times and then will never have to be reborn again
Oncereturners will be reborn in the human world only once more while nonreturners will be reborn in the Brahma worlds and gain Liberation there
As for streamwinners even though they have to be reborn they're reborn in secure places
They aren't reborn in states of deprivation such as the realms of hungry shades angry demons or common animals
They're reborn as human beings but as special human beings not like the rest of us
How are they special
They have few defilements in their hearts not thick defilements like ordinary people
They have a builtin sense of conscience and scrupulousness
Even though they may do wrong from time to time they see the damage it does and feel a sense of shame so that they won't want their various defilements to lead them into doing wrong ever again
People disenchanted with rebirth make an extra effort to build up their virtues so that they won't have to come back and be reborn
If you want to cut down the number of times you'll take rebirth you should steadily increase your inner quality and worth
In other words make your heart clean and bright with generosity moral virtue and meditation
Keep your thoughts words and deeds at equilibrium secluded from evil both inside and out
If you have no vices in word and deed that's called being secluded from outside evil
If your mind is firmly centered in concentration and free from obstructing distractions that's called being secluded from inside evil
This way you can be at peace and at ease both within and without
As the Buddha said Happy is the person content in seclusion
When this kind of seclusion arises in the mind all sorts of worthwhile qualities will come flowing in without stop
The heart will keep growing higher and higher until it no longer wants anything at all
If you used to eat a lot you won't want to eat a lot
If you used to eat in moderation there'll be times when you won't want to eat at all
If you used to talk a lot you won't want to talk a lot
If you used to sleep a lot you'll want to sleep only a little
However you live the heart will be entirely happy with no more danger to fear from anyone
This is how you cut down the number of times you'll take rebirth
If you see any areas in which you're still lacking in inner worth you should try to fill in the lack right away
Be steady in your practice of meditation and make your mind clear free from the distractions that will drag it down into the dirt
Dirt is where animals live  pigs dogs ducks chickens and cows
It's no place for human beings
If you're really a human being you have to like living in clean places free from danger and germs
This is why the Buddha praised seclusion as the wellspring of happiness
So try to find a secluded spot for yourself to stay within the mind secluded from hindering distractions
Make your mind as bright as a jewel and don't let temptation come along and try to trade garbage for the good things you've got
You have to be mindful at all times so don't let yourself be absentminded or forgetful
If your mind doesn't stay with your body in the present all sorts of evil things  all sorts of distractions  will come flowing in to overwhelm it making it fall away from its inner worth just as a vacant house is sure to become a nest of spiders termites and all sorts of animals
If you keep your mind firmly with the body in the present you'll be safe
Like a person on a big ship in the middle of a smooth sea free from wind and waves Everywhere you look is clear and wide open
You can see far
Your eyes are quiet with regard to sights your ears quiet with regard to sounds and so on with your other senses
Your mind is quiet with regard to thoughts of sensuality ill will and harm
The mind is in a state of seclusion calm and at peace
This is where we'll let go of our sense of me and mine and reach the further shore free from constraints and bonds
Normally our hearts can hardly ever sit still
They have to think about all kinds of thoughts and ideas both good and bad
When good things happen we keep them to think about
When bad things happen we keep them to think about
When we succeed or fail at anything we keep it to think about
This shows how impoverished the mind is
When it thinks about things it likes it develops sensual craving
When it thinks about things that are possible it develops craving for possibilities
When it thinks about things that are impossible it develops craving for impossibilities all without our realizing it
This is called unawareness
It's because of this unawareness that we have thoughts judgments and worries that form the wellspring for likes dislikes and attachments
Sometimes the things we think about can come true in line with our thoughts sometimes they can't
While there's at least some use in thinking about things that are possible we like to go to the effort of thinking about things that are out of the question
Ie when certain things are no longer possible we still hold onto them to the point where we feel mistreated or depressed
We keep trying to get results out of things that can no longer be
When our hopes aren't satisfied we latch onto our dissatisfaction when they are satisfied we latch onto our satisfaction
This gives rise to likes and dislikes
We latch onto thoughts of the future and thoughts of the past
Most of us when we succeed at something latch onto our happiness
When we don't succeed we latch onto our disappointment
Sometimes we latch onto things that are good  although latching onto goodness leaves us some way to crawl along
Sometimes we actually latch onto things that are clearly bad
This is what made the Buddha feel such pity for us human beings
In what way
He pitied our stupidity in not understanding what suffering is
We know that red ants can really hurt when they bite us yet we go stick our heads in a red ant nest and then sit around in pain and torment
What good do we get out of it
When we see good or bad sights with our eyes we latch onto them
When we hear good or bad sounds with our ears we latch onto them
When we smell good or bad odors taste good or bad flavors feel good or bad sensations or think good or bad thoughts we latch onto them  so we end up all encumbered with sights dangling from our eyes sounds dangling from both of our ears odors dangling from the tip of our nose flavors dangling from the tip of our tongue tactile sensations dangling all over our body and thoughts dangling from our mind
This way sights are sure to close off our eyes sounds close off our ears odors close off our nostrils flavors close off our tongue tactile sensations close off our body and thoughts close off our mind
When our senses are completely closed off in this way we're in the dark  the darkness of unawareness  groping around without finding the right way unable to go any way at all
Our body is weighed down and our mind is dark
This is called harming yourself killing yourself destroying your own chances for progress
Thoughts are addictive and especially when they're about things that are bad
We remember them long and think of them often
This is delusion one of the campfollowers of unawareness
For this reason we have to drive this kind of delusion from our hearts by making ourselves mindful and alert fully conscious with each inandout breath
This is what awareness comes from
When awareness arises discernment arises as well
If awareness doesn't arise how will we be able to get rid of craving
When awareness arises craving for sensuality craving for possibilities and craving for impossibilities will all stop and attachment won't exist
This is the way of the Noble Path
Most of us tend to flow along in the direction of what's bad more than in the direction of what's good
When people try to convince us to do good they have to give us lots of reasons and even then we hardly budge
But if they try to talk us into doing bad all they have to do is say one or two words and we're already running with them
This is why the Buddha said People are foolish
They like to feed on bad preoccupations And that's not all
We even feed on things that have no truth to them at all
We can't be bothered with thinking about good things but we like to keep clambering after bad things trying to remember them and keep them in mind
We don't get to eat any meat or sit on any skin and yet we choke on the bones
We don't get to eat any meat This means that we gather up imaginary things to think about but they don't bring us any happiness
A person who opens his mouth to put food in it at least gets something to fill up his stomach but a person who clambers around with his mouth open craning his neck to swallow nothing but air That's really ridiculous
His stomach is empty without the least little thing to give it weight
This stands for thoughts that have no truth to them
We keep searching them out gathering them up and elaborating on them in various ways without getting any results out of them at all aside from making ourselves restless and distracted
We never have any time to sit still in one place and instead keep running and jumping around until the skin on our rears has no chance to make contact anywhere with a place to sit down
This is what is meant by We don't get to sit on any skin We can't lie down we can't stay seated  even though our bodies may be seated our minds aren't seated there with them
We don't get to eat any meat and instead we choke on the bones
We try to swallow them but they won't go down we try to cough them up but they won't come out
When we say We choke on the bones this refers to the various bad preoccupations that get stuck in the heart
The bones here are the five Hindrances
Ill will Things that displease us are like bones stuck in the heart
The mind fastens on things that are bad on things we dislike until we start feeling animosity anger and hatred
Sometimes we even gather up old tasteless bones that were thrown away long ago  like chicken bones that have been boiled to make stock The meat has fallen off the flavor has been boiled away and all that's left are the hard brittle bones they throw to dogs
This stands for old thoughts stretching back to years that we bring out to gnaw on
Look at yourself Your mind is so impoverished that it has to suck on old bones
It's really pitiful
Torpor  lethargy When the mind has been feeding on trash like this with nothing to nourish it its strength is bound to wane away
It becomes sleepy and depressed oblivious to other people's words not hearing their questions or understanding what they're trying to say
Restlessness  anxiety The mind then gets irritable and distracted which is followed by 
Uncertainty We may decide that good things are bad or bad things are good wrong things are right or right things are wrong
We may do things in line with the Dhamma and not realize it or contrary to the Dhamma  but in line with our own preconceptions  and not know it
Everything gets stuck in our throat and we can't decide which way to go so our thoughts keep running around in circles like a person who rows his boat around in a lake for hours and hours without getting anywhere
This is called harming yourself hurting yourself killing yourself
And when we can do this sort of thing to ourselves what's to keep us from doing it to others
This is why we shouldn't let ourselves harbor thoughts of envy jealousy or anger
If any of these five Hindrances arise in the heart then trouble and suffering will come flooding in like a torrential downpour and we won't be able to hold our own against them
All of this is because of the unawareness that keeps us from having any inner quality as a mainstay
Even though we may live in a seven or ninestorey mansion and eat food at  a plate we won't be able to find any happiness
People without any inner quality are like vagrants with no home to live in
They have to be exposed to sun rain and wind by day and by night so how can they find any relief from the heat or the cold
With nothing to shelter them they have to lie curled up until their backs get all crooked and bent
When a storm comes they need to scurry to find shelter They can't stay under trees because they're afraid the trees will be blown down on top of them
They can't stay in open fields because they're afraid lightning will strike
At midday the sun is so hot that they can't sit for long  like an old barefooted woman walking on an asphalt road when the sun is blazing She can't put her feet down because she's afraid they'll blister so she dances around in place on her tiptoes not knowing where she can rest her feet
This is why the Buddha felt such pity for us and taught us to find shelter for ourselves by doing good and developing concentration as a principle in our hearts so that we can have an inner home
This way we won't have to suffer and other people will benefit as well
This is called having a mainstay
People with no mainstay are bound to busy themselves with things that have no real meaning or worth  ie with things that can't protect them from suffering when the necessity arises
A person without the wisdom to search for a mainstay is sure to suffer hardships
I'll illustrate this point with a story
Once there was a band of monkeys living in the upper branches of a forest each one carrying its young wherever it went
One day a heavy wind storm came
As soon as the monkeys heard the sound of the approaching wind they broke off branches and twigs to make themselves a nest on one of the bigger branches
After they had piled on the twigs they went down under the nest and looked up to see if there were still any holes
Wherever they saw a hole they piled on more twigs and branches until the whole thing was piled thick and high
Then when the wind and rain came they got up on top of the nest sitting there with their mouths open shivering from the cold exposed to the wind and rain
Their nest hadn't offered them any protection at all simply because of their own stupidity
Eventually a gust of wind blew the nest apart
The monkeys were scattered every which way and ended up dangling here and there their babies falling from their grasp all of them thoroughly miserable from their hardship and pain
People who don't search for inner worth as their mainstay are no different from these monkeys
They work at amassing money and property thinking that these things will give them security but when death comes none of these things can offer any safety at all
This is why the Buddha felt such pity for all the deluded people in the world and went to great lengths to teach us to search for inner quality as a mainstay for ourselves
People who have inner quality as their mainstay are said to be kind not only to themselves but also to others as well in the same way that when we have a house of our own we can build a hut for other people to live in too
If we see that another person's hut is going to cave in we help find thatch to roof it make walls for the left side right side the front and the back to protect it from storm winds and raise the floor to get it above flood level
What this means is that we teach the other person how to escape from his or her own defilements in the same way that we've been able to whatever extent to escape from ours
When we tell others to practice concentration it's like helping them roof their house so that they won't have to be exposed to the sun and rain
Making walls for the front and back means that we tell them to shut off thoughts of past and future and walls for the left and right means that we tell them to shut off thoughts of likes and dislikes
Raising the floor above flood level means we get them to stay firmly centered in concentration keeping their minds still with their object of meditation
Once people have a house with good walls a sound roof and a solid floor then even if they don't have any other external belongings  just a single rag to their name  they can be happy secure and at peace
But if your house is sunk in the mud what hope is there for your belongings
You'll have to end up playing with crabs worms and other creepy things
Your walls are nothing but holes so that people can see straight through your house in one side and out the other
Even from four to five miles away they can see everything you've got
When this is the case thieves are going to gang up and rob you  ie all sorts of bad thoughts and preoccupations are going to come in and ransack your heart
As for your roof it's nothing but holes
You look up and can see the stars
Termite dust is going to sift into your ears and eyes and birds flying past will plaster you with their droppings
So in the end all you can do is sit scratching your head in misery because you haven't any shelter
When this is the case you should take pity on yourself and develop your own inner worth
Keep practicing concentration until your heart matures step by step
When you do this you'll develop the light of discernment that can chase the darkness of unawareness out of your heart
When there's no more unawareness you'll be free from craving and attachment and ultimately gain Liberation
For this reason we should all keep practicing meditation and set our hearts on developing nothing but inner goodness without retreating or getting discouraged
Whatever is a form of goodness roll up your sleeves and pitch right in
Don't feel any regrets even if you ram your head into a wall and die on the spot
If you're brave in your proper efforts this way all your affairs are sure to succeed in line with your hopes and aspirations
But if evil comes and asks to move into your home  your heart  chase it away
Don't let it stay even for a single night
People who like to gather up thoughts worries etc to hold onto are no different from prisoners tied down with a ball and chain
To fasten onto thoughts of the past is like having a rope around your waist tied to a post behind you
To fasten onto thoughts of the future is like having a rope around your neck tied to a door in front
To fasten onto thoughts you like is like having a rope around your right wrist tied to a post on your right
To fasten onto thoughts you don't like is like having a rope around your left wrist tied to a wall on your left
Whichever way you try to step you're pulled back by the rope on the opposite side so how can you hope to get anywhere at all
As for people who have unshackled themselves from their thoughts they stand tall and free like soldiers or warriors with weapons in both hands and no need to fear enemies from any direction
Any opponents who see them won't dare come near so they're always sure to come out winning
But if we're the type tied up with ropes on all sides nobody's going to fear us because there's no way we can take any kind of stance to fight them off
If enemies approach us all we can do is dance around in one spot
So I ask that we all take a good look at ourselves and try to unshackle ourselves from all outside thoughts and preoccupations
Don't let them get stuck in your heart
Your meditation will then give you results your mind will advance to the transcendent and you're sure to come out winning someday
Inner wealth according to the texts means seven things  conviction virtue a sense of conscience scrupulousness breadth of learning generosity and discernment  but to put it simply inner wealth refers to the inner quality we build within ourselves
Outer wealth  money and material goods  doesn't have any hard and fast owners
Today it may be ours tomorrow someone else may take it away
There are times when it belongs to us and times when it belongs to others
Even with things that are fixed in the ground like farms or orchards you can't keep them from changing hands
So when you develop yourself so as to gain the discernment that sees how worldly things are undependable and unsure don't let your property  your worldly possessions  sit idle
The Buddha teaches us to plant crops on our land so that we can benefit from it
If you don't make use of your land it's sure to fall into other people's hands
In other words when we stake out a claim to a piece of property we should plant it full of crops
Otherwise the government won't recognize our claim and we'll lose our rights to it
Even if we take the case to court we won't have a chance to win
So once you see the weakness of an idle claim you should hurry up and plant crops on it so that the government will recognize your claim and issue you a title to the land
What this means is that we should make use of our material possessions by being generous with them using them in a way that develops the inner wealth of generosity within us
This way they become the kind of wealth over which we have full rights and that will benefit us even into future lifetimes
This body of ours Actually there's not the least bit of it that's really ours at all
We've gotten it from animals and plants  the pigs prawns chickens fish crabs cows etc and all the various vegetables fruits and grains that have been made into the food we've eaten which the body has chewed and digested and turned into the blood that nourishes its various parts
In other words we've taken cooked things and turned them back into raw things ears eyes hands arms body etc
These then become male or female they're given ranks and titles and so we end up falling for all of these conventions
Actually these heads of ours are lettuce heads our hair is pigs' hair our bones are chicken bones and duck bones our muscles are cows' muscles etc
There's not one part that's really ours but we lay claim to the whole thing and say it's this and that
We forget the original owners from whom we got it all and so become possessive of it
When the time comes for them to come and take it back we're not willing to give it back which is where things get messy and complicated and cause us to suffer when death comes near
If all the various animals we've eaten were to come walking out of each of us right now there wouldn't be enough room for them all in this meditation hall
None of us would be able to live here in this monastery any more
How many pigs ducks chickens and shrimp have each of us eaten
How many bushels of fish
If we were to calculate it all who knows what the figures would be  all the animals we ourselves have killed for food or that we've gotten from others who've killed them
How do you think these animals won't come and demand repayment
If we don't have anything to give them they're sure to repossess everything we've got
Right when we're at death's door That's when they're going to crowd around and demand that we repay our debts
If we don't have anything to give them they're going to knock us flat
But if we have enough to give them we'll come out unscathed
In other words if we develop a lot of inner goodness we'll be able to contend with whatever pains we suffer by giving back the body with good grace  in other words by letting go of our attachment to it
That's when we'll be at peace
We should realize that the body leaves us and lets us go bit by bit every day
But we've never left it never let it go at all
We're attached to it in every way just as when we eat food We're attached to the food but the food isn't attached to us
If we don't eat it it'll never cry even once
All the attachment comes from our side alone
The pleasure we get from the body is a worldly pleasure good for a moment and then it changes
It's not at all lasting or permanent
Notice the food you eat At what point is it good and delicious
It looks good and inviting only when it's arranged nicely on a plate
It's delicious only for the brief moment it's in your mouth
After it goes down your throat what is it like then
And when it gets down to your intestines and comes out the other end what is it like then
It keeps changing all the time
When you think about this sort of thing it's enough to make you disillusioned with everything in the world
Worldly pleasure is good only when it's hot and fresh like freshcooked rice piled on a plate when it's still hot and steaming
If you leave it until it's cold there's no taste to it
If you let it go until it hardens you can't swallow it and if you let it sit overnight it spoils and you have to throw it away
As for the pleasure of the Dhamma it's like the brightness of stars or the color of gold
The brightness of stars is clear and glittering
Whoever sees it feels calmed and refreshed
When depressed people look at the stars no matter when their depression disappears
As for the color of gold it's always gleaming and golden
No matter what the gold is made into its color doesn't change
It's always gleaming and golden as it always was
In the same way the pleasure of the Dhamma is lasting and gives delight throughout time to those who practice it
For this reason intelligent people search for pleasure in the Dhamma by giving up their worthless meaningless worldly pleasures to trade them in for lasting pleasure by practicing meditation until their minds and actions reach the level of goodness beauty and purity that goes beyond all action all suffering and stress
Beautiful things come from things that are dirty and not at all from things that are pleasant and clean
Crops and trees for instance grow to be healthy and beautiful because of the rotten and smelly compost and nightsoil with which they're fertilized
In the same way a beautiful mind comes from meeting with things that aren't pleasant
When we meet with bad things the mind has a chance to grow
Bad things here refers to loss of wealth loss of status criticism and pain
When these things happen to a person whose mind is rightly centered in concentration they turn into good things
Before they were our enemies but eventually they become our friends
What this means is that when these four bad things occur to us we can come to our senses Oh
This is how loss of wealth is bad
This is how loss of status how pain and criticism are bad
This is how the ways of the world can change and turn on you so that you shouldn't get carried away with their good side
When meditators meet with these four kinds of bad things their minds develop
They become more and more dispassionate more and more disenchanted more and more detached from the four opposites of these bad things  wealth status pleasure and praise  so that when these good things happen they won't be fooled into getting attached or carried away with them and can instead push their minds on to a higher level
When they hear someone criticize or gossip about them it's as if that person were taking a knife to sharpen them
The more they get sharpened the more they grow to a finer and finer point
Loss of wealth is actually good for you you know
It can teach you not to be attached or carried away with the money or material benefits other people may offer you
Otherwise the more you have the deeper you sink  to the point where you drown because you get stuck on being possessive
Loss of status is also good for you
For instance you may be a person but they erase your good name and call you a dog  which makes things even easier for you because dogs have no laws
They can do what they like without any constraints without anyone to fine them or put them in jail
If people make you a prince or a duke you're really in bad straits
All of a sudden you're big Your arms hands feet and legs grow all out of size and get in your way wherever you try to go or whatever you do
As for wealth status pleasure and praise there's nothing the least bit constant or dependable about them
The more you really think about them the more disaffected and disenchanted you become to the point where you find that you're indifferent neither pleased nor displeased with them
This is where your mind develops equanimity and can become firm in concentration so that it can grow higher and higher in the practice  like the lettuce and cauliflower that Chinese farmers plant in rows The more they get fertilized with nightsoil the faster more beautiful and more healthy they grow
If they were fed nothing but clean clear water they'd end up all sickly and stunted
This is why we say that when people have developed mindfulness and concentration they're even better off when the ways of the world turn ugly and bad
If the world shows you only its good side you're sure to get infatuated and stuck like a seed that stays buried in its shell and will never grow
But once the seed comes out with its shoot then the more sun wind rain and fertilizer it gets the more it will grow and develop  ie the more your discernment will branch out into knowledge and wisdom leading you to intuitive insight and on into the transcendent like the old Chinese vegetable farmer who becomes a millionaire by building a fortune out of plain old excrement
When we first meet with the fires of greed aversion and delusion we find them comforting and warm
We're like a person sitting by a fire in the cold season As he sits soaking up the warmth he gets more and more sleepy and careless until he burns his hands and feet without realizing it and eventually falls headfirst into the flames
The pleasures felt by people in the world come from looking at things only on the surface
Take a plateful of rice for instance
If you ask people what's good about rice they'll say It tastes good and fills you up too But the Buddha wouldn't answer like that
He'd answer by talking about rice both when it goes in your mouth and when it comes out the other end
This is why his view of things covered both cause and effect
He didn't look at things from one side only
The Buddha saw that the ease and happiness of ordinary pleasures is nothing lasting
He wanted an ease and happiness that didn't follow the way of the worldly pleasures that most people want
This was why he left his family and friends and went off to live in seclusion
He said to himself I came alone when I was born and I'll go alone when I die
No one hired me to be born and no one will hire me to die so I'm beholden to no one
There's no one I have to fear
In all of my actions if there's anything that's right from the standpoint of the world but wrong from the standpoint of the truth  and wrong from the standpoint of my heart  there's no way I'll be willing to do it
So he posed himself a question Now that you've been born as a human being what is the highest thing you want in this world He then placed the following conditions on his answer In answering you have to be really honest and truthful with yourself
And once you've answered you have to hold to your answer as an unalterable law on which you've affixed your seal without ever letting a second seal be affixed on top
So what do you want and how do you want it
You have to give an honest answer understand
I won't accept anything false
And once you've answered you have to keep to your answer
Don't be a traitor to yourself
When he was sure of his answer he said to himself I want only the highest and most certain happiness and ease the happiness that won't change into anything else
Other than that I don't want anything else in the world
Once he had given this answer he kept to it firmly
He didn't allow anything that would have caused the least bit of pain or distraction to his heart to get stuck there as a stain on it
He kept making a persistent effort with all his might to discover the truth without retreat until he finally awakened to that truth the reality of Liberation
If we search for the truth like the Buddha  if we're true in our intent and true in what we do  there's no way the truth can escape us
But if we aren't true to ourselves we won't find the true happiness the Buddha found
We tell ourselves that we want to be happy but we go jumping into fires
We know what things are poison yet we go ahead and drink them anyway
This is called being a traitor to yourself
Every person alive wants happiness  even common animals struggle to find happiness  but our actions for the most part aren't in line with our intentions
This is why we don't get to realize the happiness we want simply because there's no truth to us
For example when people come to the monastery If they come to make offerings observe the precepts and sit in meditation for the sake of praise or a good reputation there's no real merit to what they're doing
They don't gain any real happiness from it so they end up disappointed and dissatisfied
Then they start saying that offerings precepts and meditation don't give any good results
Instead of reflecting on the fact that they weren't right and honest in doing these things they say that there's no real good to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha that the Buddha's teachings are a lot of nonsense and lies
But actually the Buddha's teachings are an affair of the truth
If a person isn't true to the Buddha's teachings the Buddha's teachings won't be true to that person  and that person won't be able to know what the Buddha's true teachings are
When we practice virtue concentration and discernment it's as if we were taking the jewels and robes of royalty and the Noble Ones to dress up our heart and make it beautiful
But if we aren't true in our practice it's like taking robes and jewels and giving them to a monkey
The monkey is bound to get them dirty and tear them to shreds because it has no sense of beauty at all
Whoever sees this kind of thing happening is sure to see right through it that it's a monkey show
Even though the costumes are genuine the monkey inside isn't genuine like the costumes
For instance if you take a soldier's cap and uniform to dress it up as a soldier it's a soldier only as far as the cap and uniform but the monkey inside is still a monkey and not a soldier at all
For this reason the Buddha teaches us to be true in whatever we do  true in being generous true in being virtuous true in developing concentration and discernment
Don't play around at these things
If you're true then these activities are sure to bear you the fruits of your own truthfulness without a doubt
In Christianity they teach that if you've done wrong or committed a sin you can ask to wash it away by confessing the sin and asking for God's forgiveness
God will then have the kindness to hold back punishment and you'll be pure
But Buddhism doesn't teach this sort of thing at all
If you do wrong you are the one who has to correct the error so as to do away with the punishment on your own behalf
What this means is that when a defilement  greed anger or delusion  arises in your heart you have to undo the defilement right there so as to escape from it
Only then will you escape from the suffering that would otherwise come as its natural consequence
We can compare this to a man who drinks poison and comes down with violent stomach cramps
If he then runs to a doctor and says Doctor doctor I've drunk poison and my stomach really hurts
Please take some medicine for me so that the pain will go away there's no way that this is going to cure the pain
If the doctor instead of the sick man is the one who takes the medicine the sick man can expect to die for sure
So I ask that we all understand this point that we have to wash away our own defilements by practicing the Dhamma  the medicine of the Buddha  in order to gain release from any evil and suffering in our hearts not that we can ask the Buddha to help wash away our mistakes and sufferings for us
The Buddha is simply the doctor who has discovered the formula for the medicine and prepared it for us
Whatever disease we have we need to take the medicine and treat the disease ourselves if we want to recover
A single mind moment can't carry out two tasks at once
In other words the evil you've done is really evil the goodness you've done really good
The mind can't carry out the tasks of evil and goodness both at the same time
It's like having only one hand
When the things you're carrying fill the hand it can't pick up anything else
You have to put down what you're already carrying
Only then can you pick up other things
This is an analogy for the mind
If the mind is continually in good shape evil won't have any place to land or catch hold
But if our goodness isn't constant evil will be able to find a perch
It's like rowing a boat out into the ocean
If we stay close to shore crows flying from the shore will be able to perch on the mast of the boat
If you don't want them perching there you have to row out as far as you can
The crows then won't be able to perch on the mast
If any crow tries to keep flying out to the boat it'll lose sight of the shore and is likely to die out there in the ocean because it'll run out of strength it'll run out of food
It'll have to die
In the same way if goodness catches hold of the greater part of the mind evil will have to circle aimlessly around with nowhere to land
If it stays close by  meaning that goodness has only a small part of the heart  evil will be able to come flying in
Sometimes it waits on the opposite shore
If your strength of mind runs low it'll stay right nearby and catch hold of you easily
For example if the goodness you get from coming to the monastery isn't yet enough when you get back home your mind will order you to do evil in this way or that and you'll go right along with it
Or while you're sitting here listening to this talk evil will perch on the handrail to the stairs outside
When you get up at the end of the talk and let yourself get distracted it'll immediately land right on you
Sometimes even while you're sitting here it'll come swooping in just like a crow
If the mind is good and strong though evil will wait at a distance
Even when you get home it won't dare land on you  but it might land on someone else someone without any Dhamma
As you talk with that person and your words begin to mesh with theirs evil might come sneaking in that way
That's because you're goodness isn't yet strong enough
If we have a wound on our body  ie evil in our mind  we have to wash off the wound put medicine in it and cover it with a clean bandage in other words observe the precepts and practice meditation
That way the wound has a chance to heal
Washing the wound means that we don't get involved in thinking about the good and bad points of other people
That right there is a skillful mind state arising
The mind will then be at its ease and will develop an inner nourishment coolness in heart and mind
It's like sitting in a mountain glen with a waterfall streaming down and a pure breeze blowing through a cleft in the rock
The mind will feel cool and undisturbed
The heart will blossom like a jasmine filled with dew in the middle of the cool season
The mind will give rise to strength

If the mind doesn't have any inner nourishment though it won't have any strength because it's hungry and thin
The Buddha saw that we human beings are thin and malnourished in this way which is why he felt compassion for us
He taught us The mind that goes around swallowing sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations is eating a ball of fire you know
Not any kind of food In other words The eye is burning Everything we see with the eye is a form and each of these forms contains a ball of fire even though on the outside it's coated to look pretty and attractive
The ear is burning All the pleasing sounds we search for and that come passing in through our ears from the day we're born to the day we die are burning sounds are flames of fire
The heat of the sun can't burn you to death but sounds can burn you to death which is why we say they're hotter than the sun
The nose is burning We've been smelling smells ever since the doctor cleaned out our nose right after birth and the nature of smells is that there's no such thing as a neutral smell
There are only two kinds good smelling and foulsmelling
If our strength is down and we're not alert we swallow these smells right into the mind  and that means we've swallowed a time bomb
We're safe only as long as nothing ignites the fuse
The tongue is burning Countless tastes come passing over our tongue
If we get attached to them it's as if we've eaten a ball of fire As soon as it explodes our intestines will come splattering out
If we human beings let ourselves get tied up in this sort of thing it's as if we've eaten the fire bombs of the King of Death
As soon as they explode we're finished
But if we know enough to spit them out we'll be safe
If we swallow them we're loading ourselves down
We won't be able to find any peace whether we're sitting standing walking or lying down because we're on fire inside
Only when we breathe our last will the fires go out
The body is burning Tactile sensations are also a fire that wipes human beings out
If you don't have any inner worth or goodness in your mind these things can really do you a lot of damage
Greed anger and delusion are like three enormous balls of redhot iron that the King of Death heats until they're glowing hot and then pokes into our heads
When greed doesn't get what it wants it turns into anger
Once we're angry we get overcome and lose control so that it turns into delusion
We forget everything  good bad our husbands wives parents children  to the point where we can even kill our husbands wives parents and children
This is all an affair of delusion
When these three defilements get mixed up in our minds they can take us to hell with no trouble at all
This is why they're called fire bombs in the human heart
But if when greed arises we have the sense to take only what should be taken and not what shouldn't it won't wipe us out even though it's burning us because we have fire insurance
People without fire insurance are those with really strong greed to the point where they're willing to cheat and get involved in corruption or crime
When this happens their inner fires wipe them out
To have fire insurance means that even though we feel greed we can hold it in check and be generous with our belongings by giving donations for instance to the religion
Then even though we may die from our greed we've still gained inner worth from making donations as an act of homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  which is like keeping our insurance payments up
This way even though our house may burn down we'll still have some property left
Anger
When this defilement really gets strong it has no sense of good or evil right or wrong husband wives or children
It can drink human blood
An example we often see is when people get quarreling and one of them ends up in prison or even on death row convicted for murder
This is even worse than your house burning down because you have nothing left at all
For this reason we have to get ourselves some life insurance by observing the five or eight precepts so that we can treat and bandage our open sores  ie so that we can wash away the evil and unwise things in our thoughts words and deeds
Even if we can't wash them all away we should try at least to relieve them somewhat
Although you may still have some fire left let there just be enough to cook your food or light your home
Don't let there be so much that it burns your house down
The only way to put out these fires is to meditate and develop thoughts of good will
The mind won't feel any anger hatred or ill will and instead will feel nothing but thoughts of sympathy seeing that everyone in the world aims at goodness but that our goodness isn't equal
You have to use really careful discernment to consider cause and effect and then be forgiving with the thought that we human beings aren't equal or identical in our goodness and evil
If everyone were equal the world would fall apart
If we were equally good or equally bad the world would have to fall apart for sure
Suppose that all the people in the world were farmers with no merchants or government officials
Or suppose there were only government officials with no farmers at all We'd all starve to death with our mouths gaping and dry
If everyone were equal and identical the end of the world would come in only a few days' time
Consider your body Even the different parts of your own body aren't equal
Some of your fingers are short some are long some small some large
If all ten of your fingers were equal you'd have a monster's hands
So when even your own fingers aren't equal how can you expect people to be equal in terms of their thoughts words and deeds
You have to think this way and be forgiving
When you can think in this way your good will can spread to all people everywhere and you'll feel sympathy for people on high levels low levels and in between
The big ball of fire inside you will go out through the power of your good will and loving kindness
This comes from getting life insurance practicing tranquillity meditation so as to chase the defilements away from the mind
Thoughts of sensual desire ill will lethargy restlessness and uncertainty will vanish and the mind will be firmly centered in concentration using its powers of directed thought to stay with its meditation word  buddho  and its powers of evaluation to create a sense of inner lightness and ease
When the mind fills itself with rapture  the flavor arising from concentration  it will have its own inner food and nourishment so that whatever you do in thought word or deed is sure to succeed
There are two kinds of food for the mind the kind that gives it strength and the kind that saps its strength
What this refers to is the food of sensory contact  the contact that takes place at the eye ear nose tongue body and intellect
There are six mouthfuls of this kind of food
The food of consciousness ie the consciousness of contact that takes place at each of the six senses
There are six mouthfuls of this kind too
The food of intention or mental concomitants ie the thoughts that are formed in the heart leading it to think of the past or future and to know if things are good or bad pleasant or painful
Once we know that our body and mind depend on these kinds of food we should use our discernment to reflect on them and evaluate them carefully
Discernment is what forms the teeth of the mind
When children are small they need to depend on others to mince or strain their food but when they grow up they have their own teeth and don't need to depend on anyone else
If people are really discerning they don't need to chew coarse food at all
For example an intelligent hunter once he's killed an animal will remove the feathers and wings or cut off the antlers and hooves and take home just the useful part
Then he cuts the meat off in pieces so that it can serve as food
In other words if he's intelligent he throws away the inedible parts piece by piece
In the same way intelligent people who want the inner quality of dispassion have to take the discernment that comes from concentration and use it to evaluate sights sounds smells tastes etc so that these things can serve a purpose and not do them any harm
Whoever eats an entire fish  bones scales fins feces and all  is sure to choke to death on the bones
For this reason we have to find a knife and chopping block  in other words use mindfulness to focus on say a visual object and discernment to consider what kind of object it is
Is it something we should get involved with or not
What kind of benefits or harm will it cause for the mind
If it's a visual object that will cause harm to the mind you shouldn't get involved with it
If it's a goodlooking object look for its bad side as well
Be a person with two eyes
Sometimes an object looks good but we don't look for its bad side
Sometimes it looks bad but we don't look for its good side
If something looks beautiful you have to focus on its bad side as well
If it looks bad you have to focus on its good side too
If you aren't selective in what you eat you can ruin your health
Pleasing objects are like sugar and honey They're sure to attract all sorts of ants and flies
Disagreeable objects are like filth In addition to carrying germs they're sure to attract all sorts of other bad things too because they're crawling with flies and worms
If we aren't discerning we'll gobble down the filth together with the worms and smelly parts and the sugar together with the ants and flies
Your heart is already in poor health and yet you go gobbling down things that are toxic
When this happens no one can cure you but you yourself
For this reason you have to keep the heart neutral on the middle path
Don't be pleased by the objects you think are pleasing don't hate the objects you think are disagreeable
Don't be a person with only one eye or one ear
When you can do this you're equipped with discernment
You can spit visual objects sounds smells tastes etc out of the heart
Once you can see that good has bad hiding behind it and bad has good hiding behind it  in the same way that the body has both a front and a back  you shouldn't let yourself fall for sights sounds smells etc
You have to consider them carefully
The mind has two basic sorts of food good mental states and bad mental states
If you think in ways that are good you'll give strength to the mind
If you're discerning you'll get to eat fine food
If you aren't you'll have to eat crude food  eg you'll get a crab and you'll eat the whole thing raw without knowing how to boil it and peel away the shell and the claws
The effort of meditation is like a fire concentration is like a pot mindfulness like a chopping block and discernment a knife
Intelligent people will use these things to prepare their food so that its nourishment  the nourishment of the Dhamma  will permeate into the heart to give it five kinds of strength
The strength of persistence The heart when we're persistent is like the wheels of an automobile that keep turning and propelling it toward its goal enabling us to see the gains that come from our persistence
The strength of mindfulness Having mindfulness is like knowing when to open and when to close your windows and doors
The strength of concentration Concentration will be firmly established in the mind whether we're sitting standing walking lying down speaking or listening
We can listen without getting stuck on what's said and speak without getting stuck on what we say
The strength of discernment We'll gain wisdom and understanding with regard to all things so that eventually we'll attain purity of mind  by letting go of all thoughts of past and future and not being pleased or displeased by any sights sounds smells tastes etc at all
There are three ways in which people order their priorities putting the world first putting themselves first and putting the Dhamma first
Putting the world first There's nothing at all dependable about the affairs of the world
Stop and think for a moment Ever since you were born from your first memory up to the present day what is the best thing that has ever happened in your life
What is the most enjoyable thing
What have you liked the most
If you answer you have to say that of all the things in the world only percent are satisfactory the other are unsatisfactory
But if you asked me I'd answer that there's nothing satisfactory about the world at all
There's nothing but stress and misery
You get friends and they take advantage of you
You get possessions and you have to worry about them
You get money and you end up suffering for it
The people you work with aren't as good as you'd like them to be
Your family and relatives are nothing but trouble
In short I don't see anything that really brings a person any real happiness
You get money and it brings trouble
You get friends and they make you suffer
The people you live and work with don't get along smoothly
This is the way it is with the world
For this reason anyone whose mind runs along in the current of the world is bound for nothing but pain and sorrow
The Buddha taught For the mind not to be affected by the ways of the world is to be serene and free from sorrow This is the highest good fortune
The world has eight edges and each edge is razor sharp capable of slicing human beings to bits without mercy
The eight edges of the world are on the one side the edge of wealth the edge of status the edge of praise and the edge of pleasure
These four edges are especially sharp because they're things we like
We keep polishing and sharpening them and the more we do this the sharper they get until ultimately they turn around and slit our throats
The other side has four edges too but actually they're not so sharp because no one likes to use them
No one wants them so no one sharpens them and as a result they're dull and blunt  and like dull knives they can't kill anyone
These four edges are loss of wealth loss of status criticism and pain
No one wants any of these things but they have to exist as part of the world
How are the sharp edges sharp
Take status for an example
As soon as people gain status and rank they start swelling up larger than they really are
You don't have to look far for examples of this sort of thing
Look at monks
When they start out as ordinary junior monks they can go anywhere with no trouble at all along highways and byways down narrow alleys and back streets anywhere they like
But as soon as they start getting a little ecclesiastical rank they start getting abnormally large
The roads they used to walk along start feeling too narrow
They have trouble walking anywhere  their legs are too long and their feet too heavy
Their rears are too large for ordinary seats
As for lay people once they're hit by the edge of status they start swelling up too to the point where they can hardly move
Their hands get too heavy to raise in respect to the Buddha
Their legs get so big they can't make it to the monastery to hear a sermon or observe the precepts  they're afraid they'd lose their edge
This is how one of the edges of the world kills the goodness in people
As for the edge of wealth this refers to money and possessions
As soon as we get a lot we start getting stingy
We become wary of making too many offerings or of being too generous with others because we're afraid we'll run out of money
This is why rich people tend to be stingy and drown in their wealth
As for poor people they can give away everything and then work to replace it
They can give offerings and be generous with rarely any sense of regret
Their arms and legs aren't too big so they can come to the monastery with no trouble at all
The edge of pleasure is very sharp because wherever you get your pleasure that's where you get stuck
If your pleasure comes from your friends you're stuck on your friends
If your pleasure comes from your children or grandchildren you're stuck on your children and grandchildren
If your pleasure comes from eating sleeping or going out at night then that's where you're stuck
You're not willing to trade in your pleasure for the sake of inner worth because you're afraid of letting your pleasure fall from your grasp
You can't observe the five or eight precepts because they make you force and deny yourself
If you observe the eight precepts you can't go see a movie or show and can't sleep on a nice soft mattress
You're afraid that if you miss one evening meal you'll get hungry or weak
You don't want to sit and meditate because you're afraid your back will hurt or your legs will go numb
So this is how the edge of pleasure destroys your goodness
As for the edge of praise this too is razor sharp
When people are praised they start floating and don't want to come down
They hear praise and it's so captivating that they forget themselves and think that they're already good enough  so they won't think of making the effort to make themselves better in other ways
All four of these edges are weapons that kill our goodness
They're like the paint people use on houses to make them pretty something that can last only a while and then has to fade and peel away
If you can view these things simply as part of the passing scenery without getting stuck on them they won't do you any harm
But if you latch onto them as really being your own the day is sure to come when you'll have to meet with disappointment  loss of wealth loss of status criticism and pain  because it's a law of nature that however far things advance that's how far they have to regress
If you don't lose them while you're alive you'll lose them when you die
They can't stay permanent and lasting
Once we realize this truth then when we meet with any of the good edges of the world we shouldn't get so carried away that we forget ourselves and when we meet with any of the bad edges we shouldn't let ourselves get so discouraged or sad that we lose hope
Stick to your duties as you always have
Don't let your goodness suffer because of these eight ways of the world
Putting yourself first This means acting speaking and thinking whatever way you like without any thought for what's right or wrong good or bad
In other words you feel you have the right to do whatever you want
You may see for instance that something isn't good and you know that other people don't like it but you like it so you go ahead and do it
Or you may see that something is good but you don't like it so you don't do it
Sometimes you may like something and it's good but you don't do it  it's good but you just can't do it
When you're practicing the Dhamma though then whether or not you like something you have to make yourself do it
You have to make the Dhamma your life and your life into Dhamma if you want to succeed
You can't use the principle of giving priority to your own likes at all
Putting the Dhamma first This is an important principle for those who practice
The duties of every Buddhist are to develop virtue by observing the precepts to center the mind in concentration and to use discernment to investigate the truth without giving rein to defilement
The basic level of virtue is to prevent our words and deeds from being bad or evil
This means observing the five precepts not killing any living beings not stealing not engaging in illicit sex not lying and not taking intoxicants
These are the precepts that wash away the gross stains on our conduct
They're precepts that turn us from common animals into human beings and prevent us from falling into states of deprivation and woe
The intermediate level of virtue turns human beings into celestial beings
This refers to restraint of the senses keeping watch over the way we react to our senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation so that they don't give rise to bad mental states
This can turn human beings into celestial beings but even then we haven't escaped from death and rebirth because when celestial beings run out of merit they have to come back and be reborn as human beings again
They still have to keep swimming around in the cycle of rebirth
Those who can gain release from all forms of evil however won't have to be reborn as animals human beings or celestial beings ever again
This refers to people who practice concentration and can abandon all evil in their hearts by developing the stages of absorption and discernment until they reach the level of nonreturning
When they die they go to the Brahma worlds and there they develop their hearts still further purifying them of all defilements becoming arahants and ultimately attaining total Liberation
The basic level of virtue protects our words and deeds from being evil
The intermediate level protects our senses and keeps them clean  which means that we don't let the three defilements of passion aversion and delusion be provoked into action by what we see hear smell taste touch or think
As for the highest level of virtue  inner virtue  this means giving rise to Right Concentration within the mind
On this level not killing means not killing off your goodness
For instance if bad thoughts arise and you aren't careful to wipe them out their evil will come pouring in and your goodness will have to die
This is because your mind is still caught up on good and evil
Sometimes you use good to kill evil
Sometimes you use evil to kill good This is called killing yourself
Stealing on this level refers to the way the mind likes to take the good and bad points of other people to think about
This sort of mind is a thief  because we've never once asked other people whether they're possessive of their good and bad points or are willing to share them with us
For the most part what we take is their old dried up garbage
Ie we like to focus on their bad points
Even though they may have good points we don't let ourselves see them
We take our own opinions as our guide and as a result we end up as fools without realizing it
Illicit sensuality on this level refers to the state of mind that is stuck on sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas or that lies fermenting in greed anger and delusion
In other words the mind is impure and is always involved with sensual objects and moods
Lying on this level means not being true
How are we not true
We come to the monastery but our minds are at home
We listen to the sermon but our hearts are thinking of something else
Our bodies may be sitting in the meditation position just like the Buddha but our minds are roaming around through all sorts of thoughts gnawing on the past nibbling at the future not finding any meat at all
This is called lying to yourself and to others as well
How is it lying to others
Suppose you go home and someone asks Where did you go today and you answer I went to the monastery to listen to a sermon Actually your body came but you didn't come
Your body listened but you didn't listen
This has to be classed as a kind of lying
Intoxication on this level refers to delusion and absentmindedness
If we're going to contemplate body feelings mind and mental qualities our minds have to be still and really focused on these things
But if we're absentminded and forgetful our minds go down the wrong path weaving in and out back and forth like a drunkard
Sometimes we end up falling down in a stupor and lying there on the side of the road
Nothing good will come of it
Those who are careful to keep their minds firmly centered in concentration and to keep the five precepts on this level pure and whole though are said to be developing the highest perfection of virtue  showing respect for the Dhamma above and beyond the world above and beyond themselves
This is called putting the Dhamma first in a way befitting those who practice it
This is what it means to be a true Buddhist in a way that will eventually lead us to release from all suffering and stress
Now I'd like to explain a little about how to meditate
Sitting in meditation is a worthwhile activity
The outer part of the activity is to sit in a halflotus position with your right leg on top of your left leg your hands palmup in your lap your right hand on top of your left
Keep your body erect
Close your eyes but don't close them off like a person asleep
Your optic nerves have to keep working to some extent or else you'll get drowsy
These activities are the outer aspects of good meditation but they aren't what makes the meditation good
You also need to have the right object for the mind to dwell on and the right intention the intention to keep the inandout breath in mind to adjust it so that it's comfortable and to keep the breath and mind together so that they don't slip away from each other
When you can do this properly you'll gain beneficial results in terms of both body and mind  ie the right quality you're looking for termed inner worth which means a soothing sense of ease comfort fullness and wellbeing
When you sit and meditate keep noticing whether or not your mind is staying with the inandout breath
You have to keep mindfulness in charge of the mind
For example when you breathe in think bud when you breathe out think dho
Buddho
Be mindful
Don't let yourself forget or slip away
Put aside all your outside responsibilities and let go of all outside thoughts and perceptions
Keep your mind with nothing but the breath
You don't have to turn your attention to anything else
Usually when you sit and meditate though thoughts of past and future tend to appear and get in the way of the quality of your meditation
Thoughts of this sort  whether they're about things past or yet to come about the world or the Dhamma  have no good to them at all
They'll simply cause you trouble and suffering
They make the mind restless and disturbed so that it can't gain any peace and calm  because things that are past have already passed
There's no way you can bring them back or change them
Things in the future haven't reached us yet so we can't know whether or not they'll be in line with our expectations
They're far away and uncertain so there's no way they'll be any help to our thinking at all
For this reason we have to keep hold on the mind to keep it in the present by fixing it on nothing but the breath
To think about the breath is called directed thought as when we think buddho together with the breath  bud in dho out like we're doing right now
When we start evaluating the breath we let go of buddho and start observing how far the effects of each inandout breath can be felt in the body
When the breath comes in does it feel comfortable or not
When it goes out does it feel relaxed or not
If it doesn't feel comfortable and relaxed change it
When you keep the mind preoccupied with investigating the breath let go of buddho
You don't have any need for it
The inbreath will start to spread throughout the body together with mindfulness and alertness
When we let go of buddho our evaluation of the breath becomes more refined the movement of the mind will calm down and become concentration outside perceptions will fall silent
Falling silent doesn't mean that our ears go blank or become deaf
It means that our attention doesn't go running to outside perceptions or to thoughts of past or future
Instead it stays exclusively in the present
When we fix our attention on the breath in this way constantly keeping watch and being observant of how the breath is flowing we'll come to know what the inbreath and outbreath are like whether or not they're comfortable what way of breathing in makes us feel good what way of breathing out makes us feel good what way of breathing makes us feel tense and uncomfortable
If the breath feels uncomfortable try to adjust it so that it gives rise to a sense of comfort and ease
When we keep surveying and evaluating the breath in this way mindfulness and alertness will take charge within us
Stillness will develop discernment will develop knowledge will develop within us
When you sit and meditate you should keep in mind the factors that make it a worthwhile activity
The right object for the mind  ie the breath which is the theme of your meditation
The right intention
This means that you focus your mind steadily on what you're doing and nothing else with the purpose of making it settle down firmly in stillness
The right quality  inner worth  ie the calm and ease you gain from your practice of concentration
To have the right object while you sit and meditate you should have your mind set on giving your heart solely to the qualities of the Buddha
What this means is that you focus on your inandout breathing together with the word buddho without thinking of anything else
This is your object or foundation for the mind
The mental side of the object is the word buddho but if you just think buddho buddho without joining it up with your breathing you won't get the results you want because simply thinking on its own is too weak to have a hold on the mind and as a result it doesn't fulfill all the factors of meditation
The mind won't be snug enough with its object to stay firmly put in its stillness and so will show signs of wavering
Since this is the case you have to find something to give it some resistance something for it to hold onto in the same way that a nail you drive into a board will hold it firmly to a post and not let it move
A mind without something to hold onto is bound not to be snug and firm with its object
This is why we're taught to think also of the breath which is the physical side of our object together with buddho thinking bud in with the inbreath and dho out with the out
As for the factor of intention in your meditation you have to be intent on your breathing
Don't leave it to the breath to happen on its own as you normally do
You have to be intent on synchronizing your thought of the inbreath with the inbreath and your thought of the outbreath with the out
If your thinking is faster or slower than your breathing it won't work
You have to be intent on keeping your thinking in tandem with the breath
If you breathe in this way this is the intention that forms the act of your meditation
If you simply let the breath happen on its own it's no longer a theme of meditation
It's simply the breath
So you have to be careful and intent at all times to keep the mind in place when you breathe in and in place when you breathe out
When you breathe in the mind has to think bud
When you breathe out it has to think dho
This is the way your meditation has to be
The quality of inner worth in centering the mind comes when you make the body and mind feel soothed and relaxed
Don't let yourself feel tense or constricted
Let the breath have its freedom
Don't block it or hold it force it or squeeze it
You have to let it flow smoothly and easily
Like washing a shirt and hanging it out to dry Let the sun shine and the wind blow and the water will drip away by itself
In no time at all the shirt will be clean and dry
When you meditate it's as if you were washing your body and mind
If you want the body to feel clean and fresh inside you have to put it at its ease
Put your eyes at ease your ears at ease your hands feet arms and legs all at their ease
Put your body at ease in every way and at the same time don't let your mind get involved in any outside thoughts
Let them all drop away
When you wash your mind so that it's clean and pure it's bound to become bright within itself with knowledge and understanding
Things you never knew or thought of before will appear to you
The Buddha thus taught that the brightness of the mind is discernment
When this discernment arises it can give us knowledge about ourselves  of how the body got to be the way it is and how the mind got to be the way it is
This is called knowledge of form and name or of physical and mental phenomena
Discernment is like a sail on a sailboat The wider it's spread the faster the boat will go
If it's tattered and torn it won't catch the wind and the boat will have to go slowly or might not even reach its goal at all
But if the sail is in good shape it will take the boat quickly to its destination
The same holds true with our discernment
If our knowledge is only in bits and pieces it won't be able to pull our minds up to the current of the Dhamma
We may end up sinking or giving up because we aren't true and sincere in what we do
When this is the case we won't be able to get any results
Our good qualities will fall away and sink into our bad ones
Why will they sink
Because our sails don't catch the wind
And why is that
Because they're torn into shreds
And why are they torn
Because we don't take care of them so they wear out fast and end up tattered and torn
This is because the mind spends all its time entangled with thoughts and ideas
It doesn't settle down into stillness so its discernment is tattered and torn
When our discernment is in bits and pieces like this it leads us down to a low level  like a log or post that we leave lying flat on the ground exposed to all sorts of dangers Termites may eat it or people and animals may trample all over it because it's left in a low place
But if we stand it up on its end in a posthole it's free from these dangers apart from the minor things that can happen to the part buried in the ground
The same holds true with the mind
If we let it drift along in its ideas instead of catching hold of it and making it stand firmly in one place  ie if we let it make its nest all the time in concepts and thoughts  it's bound to get defiled and sink to a low level
This is why the Buddha taught us to practice centering the mind in concentration so that it will stand firm in a single object
When the mind is centered it's free from turmoil and confusion like a person who has finished his work
The body is soothed and rested the mind is refreshed  and when the mind is refreshed it becomes steady still and advances to a higher level like a person on a high vantage point  the top of a mountain the mast of a boat or a tall tree  able to see all kinds of things in every direction near or far better than a person in a low place like a valley or ravine
In a low place the sun is visible for only a few hours of the day and there are corners where the daylight never reaches at all
A mind that hasn't been trained to stand firm in its goodness is sure to fall to a low level and not be bright
But if we train our minds to a higher and higher level we'll be sure to see things both near and far and to meet up with brightness
These are some of the rewards that come from centering the mind in concentration
When we start seeing these rewards we're bound to develop conviction
When we feel conviction we become inspired to pull our minds even further  in the same way that a sail that isn't torn can take a boat to its destination without any trouble
This is one point I want to make
Another point is that discernment can also be compared to an airplane propeller
When we sit here stilling our minds it's as if we were flying an airplane up into the sky
If the pilot is sleepy lazy or in a blur we're not safe
No matter how fantastic the plane may be it can still crash us into a mountain or the forest wilds because the pilot doesn't have any mindfulness or alertness
So when we sit meditating it's like we're flying an airplane
If our mindfulness is weak and our mind keeps wandering off our airplane may end up crashing
So we have to keep observing the body to see where at the moment it feels painful or tense and keep check on the mind to see whether or not it's staying with the body in the present
If the mind isn't with the body it's as if the pilot isn't staying with his airplane
The Hindrances will have an opening to arise and destroy our stillness
So when we sit and meditate we have to make sure that we don't get absentminded
We have to be mindful and alert at all times and not let the mind slip away anywhere else
When we can do this we'll develop a sense of comfort and ease and will begin to see the benefits that come from mental stillness
This insight is the beginning of discernment
This discernment is like an airplane propeller
The more we practice the more benefits we'll see
We'll be able to take our plane as high as we want land it whenever we feel like it or try any stunts that occur to us
In other words when we develop discernment within ourselves we can have control over our mind
If we want it to think it'll think
If we don't want it to think it won't think
We know how to keep our own mind in line
If we can't keep ourselves in line there's no way we can expect to keep anyone else in line
So if we're intelligent it's like being a pilot who can keep a plane under his full control
We can keep the mind in line
For example if it thinks of something bad we can order it to stop and rest and the thought will disappear
This is called keeping the mind in line
Or if we want it to think it will be able to think and to know
Once it knows that's the end of the matter and so it will then stop thinking
Whatever we want it to do it can do for us
According to the Buddha people like this are called sages because they have discernment Whatever they do they really do
They know what is harmful and what isn't
They know how to put a stop to their thinking and as a result they very rarely meet with suffering
As for stupid people they simply fool around and drag their feet pulling themselves back when they should go forward and forward when they should go back spending their days and nights thinking about all kinds of nonsense without any substance
Even when they sleep they keep thinking
Their minds never have any chance to rest at all
And when their minds are forced to keep working like this they're bound to run down and wear out and won't give any good results when they're put to use
When this happens they suffer
But if we have the discernment to be alert to events we can let go of what should be let go stop what should be stopped and think about what needs to be thought about
We can speak when we should speak act when we should act  or simply stay still if that's what's called for
People who work day and night without sleeping without giving their bodies a chance to rest are killing themselves
In the same way thoughts and concepts are things that bring on the end of our life and destroy our mind  because they keep the mind working whether we're sitting standing walking or lying down
Sometimes even when we're just sitting alone we keep thinking  which means we're killing ourselves because the mind never gets a chance to rest
Its strength keeps eroding away and eventually when its strength is all gone its good qualities will have to die
So when we sit here centering our minds it's like eating our fill bathing ourselves till we're thoroughly clean and then taking a good nap
When we wake up we feel bright refreshed and strong enough to take on any job at all
This is why the Buddha was able to develop such strength of mind that he was able to do without food for example for seven full days and yet not feel tired or weak
This was because his mind was able to rest and be still in the four levels of absorption
His concentration was strong and gave great strength to his body his speech and his mind
The strength it gave to his body is what enabled him to wander about teaching people in every city and town throughout Northern India
Sometimes he had to walk over rough roads through desolate places but he was never tired in any way
As for the strength of his speech he was able to keep teaching without respite from the day of his Awakening to the day of his final passing away  a total of years
And as for the strength of his mind he was very astute capable of teaching his disciples so that thousands of them were able to become arahants
He was able to convince large numbers of people who were stubborn proud and entrenched in wrong views to abandon their views and become his disciples
His heart was full of kindness compassion and sincerity with no feelings of anger hatred or malice toward anyone at all
It was a pure heart without blemish
All of these qualities came from the Dhamma he had practiced  not from anything strange or mysterious  the same Dhamma we're practicing right now
The important thing is that we have to be intent on really doing it if we want to get results
If when we center the mind we really do it we'll get real results
If we don't really do it we'll get nothing but playthings and dolls
That's how it is with the practice
The four properties of the body  the way it feels from the inside ie earth water wind and fire  are like four people
If you keep trying to acquaint yourself with them after a while they'll become your friends
At first they aren't too familiar with you so they don't trust you and will probably want to test your mettle
For instance when you start sitting in meditation they'll take a stick and poke you in your legs so that your legs hurt or grow numb
If you lie down they'll poke you in the back
If you lie on your side they'll poke you in the waist
If you get up and sit again they'll test you again
Or they may whisper to you to give up
If you give in to them the King of Death will grin until his cheeks hurt
What you have to do is smile against the odds and see things through
Keep talking with all four properties
Even though they don't respond at first you have to keep talking with them asking them this and that
After a while they'll give you a oneword answer
So you keep talking and then their answers will start getting longer until you eventually become acquaintances and can have real conversations
From that point they become your friends
They'll love you and help you and tell you their secrets
You'll be a person with friends and won't have to be lonely
You'll eat together sleep together and wherever you go you'll go together
You'll feel secure
No matter how long you sit you won't ache
No matter how long you walk you won't feel tired  because you have friends to talk with as you walk along so that you enjoy yourself and reach your destination before you realize it
This is why we're taught to practice meditation by keeping mindfulness immersed firmly in the body
Contemplate your meditation themes  body feelings mind and mental qualities  without letting your mind wander astray in outside thoughts and preoccupations
Contemplate the body so as to know how its properties are getting along where it feels pleasant painful or neutral
Notice how the mind moves around in the various things you know until you reach the mental quality that is still solid and true
This way it's like having friends go with you wherever you go and whatever you do
In other words when the body walks the mind walks with it
When the body lies down the mind lies down with it
When the body sits the mind sits with it
Wherever the body stops the mind stops too
But most of us aren't like this
The body takes two steps but the mind takes four or five  so how can it not get tired
The body lies in a mosquito net surrounded by a railing and seven thick walls but the mind can still go running outside
When this is the case where will it get any happiness
It'll have to wander around exposed to the sun wind rain and all sorts of dangers because it has no protection
If there's no concentration to act as a shelter for the heart it'll always have to meet with misery and pain
For this reason you should train your heart to stay firm in concentration and to develop full strength within yourself so that you can be your own person
This way you'll be bound to meet with all things pure and good
Insight isn't something that can be taught
It's something you have to give rise to within yourself
It's not something you simply memorize and talk about
If we were to teach it just so we could memorize it I can guarantee that it wouldn't take five hours
But if you wanted to understand one word of it three years might not even be enough
Memorizing gives rise simply to memories
Acting is what gives rise to the truth
This is why it takes effort and persistence for you to understand and master this skill on your own
When insight arises you'll know what's what where it's come from and where it's going  as when we see a lantern burning brightly We know that That's the flame That's the smoke That's the light We know how these things arise from mixing what with what and where the flame goes when we put out the lantern
All of this is the skill of insight
Some people say that tranquillity meditation and insight meditation are two separate things  but how can that be true
Tranquillity meditation is stopping insight meditation is thinking that leads to clear knowledge
When there's clear knowledge the mind stops still and stays put
They're all part of the same thing
Knowing has to come from stopping
If you don't stop how can you know
For instance if you're sitting in a car or a boat that is traveling fast and you try to look at the people or things passing by right next to you along the way you can't see clearly who's who or what's what
But if you stop still in one place you'll be able to see things clearly
Or even closer to home When we speak there has to be a pause between each phrase
If you tried to talk without any pauses at all would anyone be able to understand what you said
This is why we first have to make the mind stop to be quiet and still
When the mind stays still in a state of normalcy concentration arises and discernment follows
This is something you have to work at and do for yourself
Don't simply believe what others say
Get so that you know Oh
Oh
Oh from within and not just Oh
Oh
Oh from what people say
Don't take the good things they say and stick them in your heart
You have to make these things your own by getting them to arise from within you
Spending one dollar of your own money is better than spending dollars you've borrowed from someone else
If you use borrowed money you have to worry because you're in debt
If you use your own money there's nothing to worry about
Stopping is what gives rise to strength
If a man is walking or running he can't put up a good fight with anyone because the advantage lies with the person standing still not with the person walking or running
This is why we're taught to make the mind stop still so that it can gain strength
Then it will be able to start walking again with strength and agility
It's true that we have two feet but when we walk we have to step with one foot at a time
If you try to step with both feet at once you won't get anywhere
Or if you try to walk with just one foot you can't do that either
When the right foot stops the left foot has to take a step
When the left foot stops the right foot has to take a step
You have to stop with one foot and step with the other if you're going to walk with any strength because the strength comes from the foot that has stopped not from the foot taking a step
One side has to stop while the other side takes a step
Otherwise you'll have no support and are sure to fall down
If you don't believe me try stepping with both feet at once and see how far you get
In the same way tranquillity and insight have to go together
You first have to make the mind stop in tranquillity and then take a step in your investigation This is insight meditation
The understanding that arises is discernment
To let go of your attachment to that understanding is release
So stopping is the factor that gives rise to strength knowledge and discernment  the fixed mind that knows both the world and the Dhamma in a state of heightened virtue heightened consciousness and heightened discernment leading on to the transcendent
The Buddha taught The pursuit of heightened consciousness is the heart of the Buddhas' teaching Heightened consciousness is a state of mind that lies above and beyond mental defilement
There are two ways it can be reached
The mind doesn't yet have any heightened inner quality but we heighten it through our efforts
The mind has developed the proper inner quality and uses it to keep itself safe above and beyond defilement
The first case refers to the state of ordinary people's minds
When they aren't sitting in meditation their minds aren't in any special state of concentration so if defilement arises within them they have to be determined and perceptive  to be aware of the defilement and to make up their minds that they won't let it push them around
This is called Right Attitude
Even though the mind isn't in concentration this technique can give results
What this means is that we're alert to what's going on
For example when we're angry when we meet with something undesirable we should be alert to the fact and make ourselves determined that no matter what we're going to keep the defilement of anger under control by resisting it and putting our better side into play
In other words when we're angry we act as if we weren't
Instead of letting the anger overpower the mind we use our inner goodness to overpower the mind
This is called heightened consciousness
When you meet with something you don't like don't let the fact that you don't like it show
Instead act as if you were happy and calm
Ie put your good side to use
Don't let your bad side show under any circumstances
If you're circumspect and composed enough to hold the mind in check before it can let its defilements come out in word or deed if you can force the defilements to stop and can let only your best manners show you count as having heightened consciousness
You are also a good member of any social group for you can work toward your own progress and that of the group as a whole
In the texts this quality is called composure  a state of mind that lies above the defilements
This is one form of heightened consciousness and is something we should all try to develop within ourselves as we are able
The second form of heightened consciousness refers to a mind freed from the Hindrances and trained to a state of Right Concentration
The mind is firmly established in its inner quality
When defilements arise they can't overpower the mind because they can't reach in to touch it for the mind is protected by its own full measure of inner quality
I ask that we all aim at making this form of heightened consciousness arise within ourselves by being persistent and persevering in cherishing our own inner goodness  in the same way that when we have good food we make sure to chase away the flies so that we can enjoy it in good health
To do this you have to be observant and make two kinds of effort the effort to abandon your defilements and the effort to develop your meditation theme which is the means for wiping out the mental Hindrances
There are five types of Hindrances sensual desire ill will torpor  lethargy restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty
As for meditation there are two ways of practicing it  in series and in isolation  as I'll explain to you now
To practice in series is to practice by the book contemplating the unattractiveness of the body for instance by following the lists of its parts without skipping over any of them or mixing them up
Whichever theme you choose you have to understand how the topics are grouped and in what order so as to deal with them properly
This kind of meditation can give great benefits but at the same time can cause great harm
For example if you contemplate the unattractiveness of the body it can lead to a sense of dispassion detachment and calm but there are times it can also get you into a state where you can't eat or sleep because everything starts seeming filthy and disgusting
This is one way it can be harmful
Or sometimes you may contemplate the body until a mental image arises but you get frightened and unnerved
In cases like this you have to try to be up on what's happening so that your theme will help you instead of harming you
To practice in isolation is to focus on a single refined theme that doesn't have a lot of different features
Ie you focus on being mindful of the inandout breath without letting your attention slip away
Focus on whatever kind of breathing feels soothing and the mind will settle down
Try to make the breath more and more refined all the while keeping the mind gently with the breath in the same way that you'd cup a bit of fluff in the palm of your hand
Do this until you feel that there's no in or out to the breath at all
The mind doesn't wander around
It's quiet and still able to cut away thoughts of past and future
At this point it becomes even more refined with no restlessness at all
The mind is stable and doesn't change along with its objects
It's firmly set and unwavering to the point where it becomes fixed and strong
When you can develop your meditation to this point it will make the mind let go of its attachments and gain conviction and understanding into the truths of inconstancy stress and notself
Your doubts will fall away and you will know the way of the world and the way of Liberation without having to ask for confirmation from anyone else
When your knowledge is clear and free from uncertainty the mind is firm in its own strength
This is when you become your own refuge  when your mind isn't affected by other people or objects and reaches the happiness and ease of heightened consciousness
There are four kinds of truth in the body of every human being stress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbanding
These truths are like gold No matter whether you try to make gold into a bracelet a ring an earring or whatever it stays gold in line with its nature
Go ahead and try to change it but it'll stay as it is
The same holds true with the nature of the body
No matter how wonderful you try to make it it'll have to return to its normal nature
It'll have to have stress and pain their cause their disbanding and the path to their disbanding
People who don't admit the normal nature of the body are said to be deluded those who realize its normal nature are said to know
Wise people realize the principles of nature which is why they don't get caught up in a lot of fuss and confusion
In other words the body is like an object that originally weighs four kilograms
Even though we may find things to plaster onto it to make it heavier the plaster will eventually have to fall off and leave us with the original four kilograms
You simply can't escape its original nature
The stress and pain that occur in line with the principles of nature aren't actually all that troublesome
For example pain and disease If we try to fight nature and not let there be disease or if we want it to disappear right away sometimes we make the disease even worse
But if we treat the disease without worrying about whether or not it'll go away it will follow its natural course and go away at its own pace without too much trouble or suffering on our part
This is because the mind isn't struggling to fight nature and so the body is strong enough to contend with the disease
Sometimes if we have this attitude we can survive diseases that otherwise would kill us
But if the mind gets all upset and thrashes around wanting the disease to go away then sometimes a small disease can get so bad it'll kill us  like a person with a scorpion sting he thinks is a cobra bite who gets so frightened and upset that the whole thing gets out of hand
Sometimes we may come down with a disease that ought to finish us off but the power of the mind is so great that it fights off the pain and the disease goes away
This is one of the principles of nature  but we shouldn't be complacent about it
If we get complacent then when the disease comes back it'll be worse than before because the truth when you get right down to it is that no matter what you do these things can't escape their true nature
When the body's normal nature is to have pain and stress then try as you may to make the pain go away it'll have to return to its true nature
Whether or not you can cure it the truth is still the truth
In other words even when you cure the disease it comes back
Suppose for instance that we feel ill take some medicine and feel better
We think the disease has gone away
People of discernment though realize that it hasn't gone anywhere
It's simply been suppressed for a while and then it'll have to come back out again
We may think that we've made the disease go away but the disease is smarter than we are
When it comes back again it wears a new costume like actors in a theater troupe If the public gets tired of one play they put on another
Otherwise no one will spend money to watch them perform
In other words the disease is smart enough to come from a new direction
If it put on the old play it wouldn't get any reward
At first it came in your stomach so this time it comes in your leg
You treat it until it goes away but then it comes back in a new play  in your eye
You treat it in your eye until it goes away and then it comes back in your ear
So you treat your ear
Wherever it comes you keep treating it and your money keeps getting spent
As for the disease it's glad you're fooled
There's only one of it but it comes in all sorts of disguises
Aging illness and death are very smart
They can keep us tied on a short leash so that we can never get away from them
People who don't train their minds to enter the Dhamma are sure to miss this point but those who train themselves to know the truth of the Dhamma will understand this principle of nature for what it is
If we don't realize the truth we lose in two ways
On the one side we lose in terms of the world We waste our money because we don't realize what's necessary and what isn't so we get worked up and upset all out of proportion to reality
On the other side we lose in terms of the Dhamma because our virtue concentration and meditation all suffer
Illness makes us lose in these ways because we lack discernment
This is why the Buddha taught us to use our eyes
We live in the world so we have to look out for our wellbeing in the world we live in the Dhamma so we have to look out for our wellbeing in the Dhamma
The results will then develop of their own accord
If we use discernment to evaluate things until we know what's necessary and what's not the time won't be long before we prosper in terms both of the world and of the Dhamma
We won't have to waste money and time and there won't be any obstacles to our practice
In other words when you see that something is true don't try to get in its way
Let it follow its own course
Even though the mind doesn't age grow ill or die still the body has to age grow ill and die
This is a part of its nature that you can't fight
When it gets ill you take care of it enough to keep it going
You won't be put to difficulties in terms of the world and your Dhamma practice won't suffer
The suffering we feel because of these things comes from the cause of stress delusion ignorance of the truth
When the mind is deluded it doesn't know the cause of stress or the path to the disbanding of stress
When it knows it doesn't get caught up in the natural pain and stress of the body
Mental suffering comes from the accumulation of defilement not from aging illness and death
Once the stillness of the path arises within us then aging illness and death won't unsettle the mind
Sorrow despair distress and lamentation won't exist
The mind will be separate
We can compare this to the water in the sea when it's full of waves If we take a dipperful of sea water and set it down on the beach there won't be any waves in the dipper at all
The waves come from wavering
If we don't stir it up there won't be any waves
For this reason we have to fix the mind so that it's steady in its meditation without letting anything else seep in
It will then gain clarity the discernment that sees the truth
The mental state of the cause of stress leads us to pain the mental state of the path leads us to happiness
If you don't want stress or pain don't stay with the flow of their cause
Mental suffering is something unnatural to the mind
It comes from letting defilement seep in
Diseases arise in the body but we let their effects spread into the mind
We have to learn which phenomena die and which don't
If our defilements are thick and tenacious there'll be a lot of aging illness and death
If our defilements are thin there won't be much aging illness and death
For this reason we should build inner quality  awareness of the truth  within ourselves
However far the body is going to develop that's how far it's going to have to deteriorate so don't be complacent
The important point is that you develop the mind
If the mind gets developed to a point of true maturity it won t regress
In other words if your concentration is strong and your discernment developed the defilements enwrapping your mind will fall away in the same way as when the flowers of a fruit tree reach full bloom the petals fall away leaving the fruit
When the fruit develops till it's fully ripe the skin and flesh fall away leaving just the seeds that contain all the makings for a new tree
When the mind is fully developed then aging illness and death fall away
Mental stress and suffering fall away leaving the mind in Right Concentration
When Right Concentration is ripe you'll know the location of what dies and what doesn't
If you want to die then stay with what dies
If you don't want birth don't stay with what takes birth
If you don't want aging don't stay with what ages
If you don't want illness don't stay with what grows ill
If you don't leave these things you have to live with them
If you leave them your mind won't age  it won't be able to age it won't grow ill  it won't be able to grow ill it won't die it won't be able to die
If you can reach this point you're said to have respect for the truth  for the teachings of the Buddha
Respect for the truth isn't a matter of bowing down or paying homage
It means having a sense of time and place If something is possible you do it
If it's not you don't  and you don't try to straighten it out either
The defilements of unawareness craving and attachment are things that connect us with suffering so don't let them entangle the mind
Unawareness is the mental state that is deluded about the past present and future
True awareness knows what's past and lets it go knows what's future and lets it go knows what's present and doesn't fall for it
It can remove all attachments
Unawareness knows but it falls for these things which is why it forms the fuel for suffering
True awareness knows what things are past present and future but it doesn't run out after them
It knows but it stays put  quiet and calm
It doesn't waver up or down
It doesn't seep out and nothing seeps in
The past the present and the future it knows in terms of the principles of its nature without having to reason or think
People who have to reason and think are the ones who don't know
With knowledge there's no thinking or reasoning and yet the mind knows thoroughly
This is true awareness
Aging illness and death all become an affair of release
In other words nothing is fashioned in the mind and when nothing is fashioned there's no aging illness or death
As for attachment it catches us and ties us to a stake like a person being led to his execution with no chance to wiggle free
We're tied with a wire stretching out to the past and future
Craving inches along the wire toward us rolling his eyes and making horrible faces so that we worry about the past and future
Behind us he splits into three craving for sensuality craving for possibilities and craving for impossibilities
In front of us he splits into three  the same three sorts of craving  and in the present he splits into the same three
With nine of them and only one of us how can we expect to be a match for them
In the end we're no match at all
If we practice concentration and develop discernment though we'll be able to cut the wire of Death
When the mental state that forms the path arises our thoughts of past and future will all disband
This is the disbanding of stress
Attachment and craving won't exist  so where will stress and suffering have a chance to arise
People who have defilements  even if they earn  a day  can't keep themselves from falling into hell
But people with no defilements even if they don't have anything at all are happy nonetheless  because the mind has enough to eat enough to drink enough of everything
It's not poor
When we can think correctly in this way it's called respect for the Dhamma  and it can make us happy
Respect for the Dhamma means taking seriously all the things coming in and out the house of your mind
The door of the body You have to be careful to make sure that none of your actions stray into ways that are harmful
The door of speech  the door of the mouth  is very large
The tongue may be only a tiny piece of flesh but it's very important because what we say today can keep echoing for an aeon after we die
When the body dies the time isn't long before there's nothing left of it and so it's not as important as our speech for the stone engravings we make with our tongue last a long long time
For this reason we should show a great deal of respect for our mouths by saying only things that are worthwhile
The door of the intellect We have to be careful with our thoughts
If something is harmful to us when we think about it then we shouldn't think about it
We should think only about things that are beneficial and good
These three doors are always receiving guests into the mind so we have to pay attention to see who is coming with good intentions and who is coming with bad
Don't let down your guard
Whoever comes with good intentions will bring you happiness and prosperity
As for troublemakers and thieves they'll rob you and kill you and cause you all sorts of trouble
As for your eyes ears and nose these are like three windows that you have to be careful about as well
You have to know when to open and when to close them
If you aren't discerning you may invite thieves into your house to rob and kill you plundering all the wealth your parents and teachers gave you
This is called being an ingrate  not knowing enough to care for the legacies that others have passed down to you
The legacies of your parents are your life health and strength
The legacies of your teachers are all the things they taught to make you a good person
If you leave your thoughts words and deeds wide open so that evil can flow into you evil will keep pouring in wearing down the health and strength of your body and mind
This is called having no appreciation for the kindness of your parents and teachers
Sometimes we don't leave just the doors open  we leave the windows open as well
Lizards snakes scorpions birds and bats will come in through the windows and take up residence in our house
After a while they'll lay claim to it as theirs  and we give in to them
So they leave their droppings all over and make a mess of the place
If we don't exercise selfrestraint our body and mind are going to be ruined and this will destroy the wealth our parents and teachers went to such great trouble to give us
So if anyone tries to come into your house you have to grill them thoroughly to see what they're up to and what they're coming for  for good or for bad
Look them straight in the eye
In other words you have to be mindful and reflecting in all your actions
Anything that isn't good you have to drive out of your activities
Even if it would help you financially or make you popular and wellknown don't have anything to do with it
The same holds true with your speech
If something you're about to say will serve a good purpose then open your mouth and say it
Say what should be said and don't say what shouldn't
If something serves no real purpose then no matter how fantastic it may be don't say it
You have to know how to respond to all the activities that present themselves for you to do
Let in the good ones and drive out the bad
As for the mind you have to show restraint with that too
If a thought will lead to good and happy results you should let yourself think it
But as for thoughts that will cause harm don't pull them in
If you go gobbling down everything you like you're going to die
Ie your inner quality will deteriorate
The wealth your parents and teachers gave you will disappear
As for your senses  sight hearing smell taste feeling  you should show an interest in everything that will benefit you
Drive out what's bad and bring in what's good
When you can do this it's called showing respect for your parents your teachers and yourself as well
Your house will be clean and you can lounge around in comfort without having to worry about sitting on bird or batdroppings
But if you don't exercise selfrestraint your actions will be defiled your words will be defiled so how can your mind live in comfort
Like a filthy house No guests will want to go into it and even the owner isn't comfortable there
If you keep your home clean and wellswept though it'll be nice to live in and good people will be happy to come and visit
When good people come and visit they won't cause you any harm
In other words the things that come in through the senses are like guests and they won't cause any harm to the mind
The mind will be good and obedient and will stay put where you tell it to
But even if your couches and chairs are made of marble If they're dusty and dirty no guests will want to sit there and you yourself won't want to either
So if you keep your virtue bright and clear with regard to your senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation your mind will find it easy to attain concentration
Then even when defilements come to visit you from time to time they won't be able to do you any harm  because you have more than enough wealth to share with them
If thieves come you can throw them a hunk of diamond ore and they'll disappear
If aging illness and death come begging you can throw them another hunk and they'll stop pestering you
If your old kamma debts come at you when you're poor they won't get enough to satisfy them so they'll end up taking your life
But if they come at you when you're rich you simply share your merit  all the inner wealth you've accumulated  and they'll leave you alone
If your goodness isn't yet full then evil will have an opening to flow in but if your hands feet eyes ears nose tongue body and mind are filled with goodness evil can't get into you so you can come out unscathed
Ultimately you'll get so rich in inner quality that you can go beyond both good and evil
That's when you can be truly happy and free from danger
So I ask that you all remember this and treat your thoughts words and deeds in a way that shows respect for the Dhamma as I've explained it
You'll then meet with the happiness you hope for
My own motto is Make yourself as good as possible and everything else will have to follow along in being good If you don't neglect yourself for the sake of external things you'll have to be good
So you shouldn't neglect yourself
Develop your inner worth to your own satisfaction
The world says Don't worry about whether you're good or bad as long as you have money This is just the opposite of the Dhamma which says Don't worry about whether you're rich or poor as long as you're a good person
Your good qualities if you don't know how to use them can hurt you  like money which is something good but if you don't know how to spend it wisely can lead to your ruin or like a good sharp knife that if you don't know how to use it properly can do you harm
Say for instance that you use the knife to kill someone
When you're caught you'll have to be thrown in jail or executed which means that you used the knife to kill yourself
Each of us has four kinds of valuables the goodness of our deeds the goodness of our words the goodness of our manners and the goodness of our thoughts
For this reason we have to care for these valuables as best we can
Most of us have good things to our name but we hardly ever bring them out to put them to use
Instead we like to bring out only our worst things to use
In other words we keep our goodness to ourselves and show only our worst side  like the plates cups and saucers in our homes The good ones we keep in the cupboard and only the chipped cracked and broken ones get put on the table because we're afraid the good ones will break
As for our best clothes we don't dare use them because we're afraid they'll get old stained or torn
So we end up keeping them packed away until they get so moldy or motheaten that they can't be worn and have to become rags
As a result we don't get any good out of our valuables in line with their worth
In the same way if we have any goodness within ourselves but don't put it to use it serves no purpose at all either for ourselves or for others  like a knife you keep packed away until it gets rusty If you finally bring it out to slice some food the rust will poison you
If you happen to cut your hand or foot with it you may come down with tetanus and die
An intelligent person knows how to use both good and evil without causing harm
Arahants even know how to use their defilements so as to be of benefit
When sages use common language it can serve a good purpose
But when fools use fine language it can be bad
If they use bad language it's even worse
An example of a person who used common language to serve a good purpose is Chao Khun Upali
One time he was invited to give a sermon in the palace during the weekly funeral observances for a young prince whose death had caused a great deal of sorrow to the royal relatives
On the previous weeks some very highranking monks from Wat Debsirin had been invited to give sermons and they had all gone on about what a good man the prince had been and how sad it was that he had come to such an untimely end that prevented him from living on to do more good for the world
This had caused the relatives to cry all the more
When it came Chao Khun Upali's turn to give a sermon though he didn't carry on in the same vein at all
Instead he started out with the theme of mindfulness of the body describing the ugliness and foulness of the body which is full of repulsive and disgusting things snot spit dandruff sweat etc etc
When the body dies there's not one good thing about it he said but people sit around weeping and wailing with tears streaming in tracks down their cheeks and mucus running out their noses and dribbling down to their chins
With their faces all in a mess like this they don't look the least bit attractive
This made the relatives who had been crying so embarrassed that they stopped crying immediately after which they expressed a great deal of admiration for Chao Khun Upali and his sermon
This is why it's said that a person who uses a sharp tongue with skill is a great sage
If people are wise then no matter what they say it serves a good purpose because they have a sense of time place and the people they're talking to
If something will serve a purpose even if it sounds unpleasant it should be said
If it won't serve a purpose even if it sounds pleasant don't say it
The affairs of the religion are an affair of the heart Don't go looking for them in the dirt or the grass in temples or in monastery buildings
Although people may do good with their words and deeds it's still an affair of the world
The affairs of the religion are quiet and still without any fuss or bother
They're aimed at a mind that's pure undefiled and bright
With goodness there's no need to do anything much at all
Simply sit still and there's purity
Take the example of the little novice with quiet and composed manners who as he was going out for alms one morning happened to enter the compound of a stingy moneylender and his wife
Whether or not they would put any food in his bowl he didn't show the least concern and he didn't open his mouth to say a word
When he left  his bowl still empty  he went calmly and unhurriedly along his way
The moneylender's wife seeing him became curious and trailed him from a distance until he reached a point where he suddenly had to go to the bathroom
Carefully he put down his bowl and using his foot cleared away the leaves to make a little depression in the dirt so that the urine wouldn't flow off anywhere
Then after looking right left and all around him to make sure that there wouldn't be anyone walking past he squatted down to urinate unobtrusively in the proper way
When he had finished he used his foot to cover the spot with dirt and leaves as it had been before picked up his bowl and went calmly on his way
As for the moneylender's wife who had been watching from a distance when she saw the manner in which the little novice was acting the thought occurred to her that he had probably buried something of value
So she stealthily crept to the spot and using her hand dug the earth out of the hole buried by the novice and sniffed it to see what it was  and that was when she realized that it was urine
The little novice had taken care of his urine as if it were gold
If it were something more valuable than this she thought there's no doubt how well he'd care for it
With manners like this we should adopt him as our foster son
He'd be sure to look after our fortune to make sure that it wouldn't get wasted away
She went home to tell her husband who impressed with her story had a servant go and invite the novice into their home so that they could inform him of their intentions
The novice however declined their offer to make him their heir and taught them the Dhamma making them see the rewards of practicing generosity virtue and meditation
The moneylender and his wife were deeply moved overcame their stinginess and asked to take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha from that day onward
Eventually they progressed in virtue meditation and right practice to the point where they both gained a glimpse of Liberation
Afterwards they made a large donation to build a memorial over the spot where the novice had urinated as a reminder of the goodness that had grown within them from the puddle of urine the little novice had bestowed on them that day
The affairs of the religion come down to sacittapariyodapanam  making the heart entirely clean clear and pure
Etam buddhanasasanam  this is the heart of the Buddhas' teachings
When the heart is a slave to its moods and defilements  greed aversion and delusion  it's like being a slave to poor people troublemakers and crooks all of whom are people we shouldn't be enslaved to
The poor people here are greed hunger desire never having enough
This feeling of not enough is what it means to be poor
As for aversion this doesn't necessarily mean outandout anger
It also means being grumpy or in a bad mood
If anyone annoys us or does something displeasing we get irritated and resentful
This is called being a slave to troublemakers
Delusion means seeing good as evil or evil as good right as wrong or wrong as right thinking you're good when you're evil or evil when you're good
This is called being a slave to crooks
But if the mind becomes a slave to goodness this is called being a slave to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in which case we're welloff because the Buddha is a kind person
He won't make us work all hours of the day and instead will allow us time to rest and find peace of mind
But still as long as we're slaves we can't say that it's really good because slaves have no freedom
They still have a price on their heads
Only when we gain release from slavery can we be fully free and happy
So for this reason be diligent in your work Meditate a lot every day
You'll profit from it get to buy yourself out of slavery to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and gain Liberation
Don't let there be anyone at all over you giving you orders
That's when it's really ideal
Actually the Buddha never meant for us to take as our mainstay anything or anyone else aside from ourselves
Even when we take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha he never praised it as being really ideal
He wanted us to take ourselves as our refuge
The self is its own mainstay We don't have to take our authority from anyone else
We can depend on ourselves and govern ourselves
We're free and don't have to fall back on anyone else
When we can reach this state that's when we'll be released from slavery  and truly happy
When we're slaves to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha we're told to be generous to observe the precepts and to practice meditation  all of which are things that will give rise to inner worth within us
In being generous we have to suffer and work because of the effort involved in finding wealth and material goods that we then give away as donations
In observing the precepts we have to forgo the words and deeds we would ordinarily feel like saying or doing
Both of these activities are ways in which we benefit others more than ourselves
But when we practice meditation we sacrifice inner objects  unskillful thoughts and mental states  and make our minds solid sovereign and pure
This is called paying homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha through the practice  which the Buddha praised as better than paying homage with material objects
Even though the Buddha would have benefited personally from the homage shown with material objects he never praised it as being better than homage shown through the practice which gives all its benefits to the person who pays the homage
This was the sort of homage that pleased the Buddha because the practice of training the heart to reach purity is the way by which a person can gain release from all suffering and stress
The Buddha had the kindness and compassion to want to help living beings gain freedom from all forms of suffering which is why he taught us to meditate so that we can free our hearts from their slavery to the defilements of the world
When we become slaves to the religion  to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  we're still not released from suffering as long as our minds still have worries and concerns
Being a slave to our concerns is like being in debt to them
When we're in debt we have no real freedom in our hearts
Only when we can find the money to pay off our debts can we be happy free and at ease
The more we pay off our debts the more lighthearted we'll feel
In the same way if we can let go of our various worries and cares peace will arise in our hearts
We'll be released from our slavery to craving and defilement and will find happiness because peace is what brings release from suffering
This is why the Buddha taught us to center our hearts in concentration so as to give rise to stillness peace and the inner wealth with which we'll be able to pay off all of our debts
That's when we'll attain happiness and ease
All our burdens and sufferings will fall away from our hearts and we'll enter full freedom
The mind has two kinds of thoughts skillful and unskillful
Unskillful thoughts are when the mind thinks in ways that are bad  with greed anger or delusion  about things either past or future
When this happens the mind is said to be a slave to defilement
As for skillful thoughts they deal in good and worthwhile ways with things future or past
We have to try to let go of both these kinds of thoughts so that they don't exist in the mind if we want to gain release from our slavery
If we want to buy ourselves completely out of slavery we have to farm our four acres so that they bear abundant fruit
In other words we have to develop the body's four properties  earth water fire and wind  to a point of fullness by practicing meditation and using pure breath sensations to soothe and nourish every part of the body
When the mind is pure and the body soothed it's like our farm's having plenty of rain and ground water to nourish our crops
In other words our concentration is solid and enters the first stage of absorption with its five factors directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure and singlenessofpreoccupation
Directed thought is like harrowing our soil
Evaluation is like plowing and scattering the seed
Rapture is when our crops begin to bud pleasure is when their flowers bloom and singlenessofpreoccupation is when the fruits develop until they're ripened and sweet  and at the same time their seeds contain all their ancestry
What this means is that in each seed is another plant complete with branches flowers and leaves
If anyone plants the seed it'll break out into another plant just like the one it came from
In the same way when we center the mind to the point of absorption we can gain insight into our past  maybe even back through many lifetimes  good and bad happy and sad
This insight will cause us to feel dismay and dispassion and to lose taste for all states of being and birth
The mind will let go of its attachments to self to mental and physical phenomena and to all thoughts and concepts  past and future good and bad
It'll enter a state of neutral equanimity
If we then work at developing it further we'll be able to cut away more and more of our states of being and birth
When the mind gains changeoflineage knowledge which passes from the mundane over into the transcendent it will see what dies and what doesn't
It will blossom as buddho  the awareness that knows no cessation  bright in its seclusion from thoughts and burdens from mental fermentations and preoccupations
When we practice in this way we'll come to the reality of birthlessness and deathlessness  the highest happiness  and on into Liberation
This is how we repay all our debts without the least bit remaining
As the texts say In release there is the knowledge 'Released
Birth is no more the holy life is fulfilled the task done' For this reason we should be intent on cleansing and polishing our hearts so that they can gain release from their worries and preoccupations which are the source of pain and discontent
Peace coolness and a bright happiness will arise within us in the same way as when we unshackle ourselves from our encumbering burdens and debts
We'll be free  beyond the reach of all suffering and stress
This answer key will be an invaluable aid to the beginning student who is teaching him or herself Pali from AK
Warder's Introduction to Pali
In addition to giving detailed answers to the exercises Kelly includes the references to the sutta passages in the Digha Nikaya from which the exercises were drawn
He has also corrected a number of errors in Warder's own references
Sutta references follow the PTS numbering convention
For example Drefers to volume page of the PTS Pali edition of the Digha Nikaya
The numbers that follow refer to the sutta paragraph and subparagraph numbers
This numbering scheme is used both in the PTS Pali edition and in Maurice Walshe's The Long Discourses of the Buddha
Comparisons between the two editions are thus easily made
Each line in the answers below has three parts the original text to be translated followed by a literal translation and concluding with a more idiomatic and fluent translation
Pali text is represented here using the Velthuis convention
To wit long vowels are doubled and punctuation preceding a consonant is used to indicate a diacritic mark
For example the cerebral t is written as t the palatal n is written as n and so on

We discuss the practice for the sake of reminding ourselves to keep getting better and better results
Otherwise if we don't discuss these matters we tend to weaken in the face of thought fabrications as we're so accustomed to doing
Training the mind to be quiet and still is something that requires a lot of circumspection because the mind is so unruly and wayward by its basic nature
It won't easily stay under the supervision of mindfulness and discernment
This is why we have to develop the knowledge that will keep it under control in an appropriate way
To get the mind to stay under the control of mindfulness and discernment we have to stop and watch it stop and know it
The ways it gets fashioned the ways it can be sensed in and of itself these things aren't easy to know because it likes to travel around to know other things in line with whatever its thoughts may fabricate
If we want to sense it in and of itself we have to subject it to a lot of training
To be able to supervise it or to have it stay more and more under the control of mindfulness and discernment all of this takes time
And it requires that you use your powers of observation and evaluation
If you don't keep on observing and evaluating as part of your practice the mind will slip off quickly and easily to travel along with its preoccupations
The way it keeps traveling brings you nothing but suffering and stress
You don't gain anything good out of it at all
The mind simply goes out looking for all kinds of trouble
Regardless of whether you like things or dislike them you grasp onto them and turn them into suffering
The eyes ears and so forth are the bridges out which the mind goes traveling the moment you see sights or hear sounds
How can you exercise care and restraint over the sensory doors so that they lie under the power of your mindfulness
This is something you have to watch and observe to see the results that come from looking and listening in a mindful way
If you don't use your powers of observation and evaluation you tend to latch onto the sensations of what you've seen or heard
Then you label them fabricate things out of them and keep on latching onto things every step of the way until you have the mind all in a turmoil through the power of its loves and hatreds
Observe the sensations that arise at each of the sense doors to see that they're just sensations happening pure and simple
It's not the case that we're sensing these things
For instance the eye sees forms
It's not us that's seeing them
There's simply the seeing of forms by means of eyeconsciousness pure and simple
At that point there's not yet any labeling of the sight as good or bad
There's not yet any thought fabrication following on the sensation of contact
We simply watch the simple sensation and the stop right there to see the characteristics of the sensation as it passes away or as it's replaced by a new sensation
We keep watching the passing away of sensations keep watching until we see that this is simply the nature of the eyes and ears to register sensations
That way we don't latch onto them to the point where we give rise to suffering and stress the way we used to
If we don't watch carefully to see this natural arising and passing away we tend to mix everything up
For instance when the eye sees we assume that we see
The things we see either please us or don't they give pleasure or pain and we latch onto them to the point where they defile the mind
If you're not careful and observant everything coming in through the sense doors develops into mental fabrication and has an affect on the mind
This gives rise to suffering as you're not aware of how these things arise stay and pass away every time that the eye sees sights the ear hears sounds and so forth under the power of your attachments
How can we begin to unravel ourselves from these things so that we don't stay attached
How should we be mindful in our looking and listening
We have to keep observing the mind to see that when there's mindfulness at the moment of seeing a sight the mind can stay neutral
It doesn't have to be pleased or displeased
If we're mindful when the ear hears sounds we can make sure that the mind isn't pleased or displeased with the sounds
The same holds true with smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas
We have to focus on the mind which is the factor in charge the stem point
If we exercise restraint over the mind then that in and of itself keeps all the sense doors restrained
The eye will be restrained in seeing sights involvement in seeing will get shorter
When the ear hears sounds the mind can stay neutral as it focuses on being alert to the arising and passing away of sounds or on the sensation of sound as it constantly comes and goes
This all depends on which approach helps you stay observant of sensory contact
Otherwise if you don't develop these approaches everything gets thrown into confusion
The mind has nothing but attachments and feelings of self giving rise to all sorts of suffering simply from its lack of restraint
This is something we've all experienced
The virtue of restraining the senses is a very refined level of virtue  and a very useful one too
If you develop this level of virtue the other levels become more and more pure
If you don't exercise restraint over the eyes ears nose etc then your five eight or ten precepts can't stay firm
They're sure to become easily soiled
If the eye which is the bridge isn't restrained then it focuses its attention outside
And when this happens overstepping your precepts becomes the easiest thing in the world
If you allow the mind to get accustomed to running out after outside preoccupations everything gets thrown into a turmoil
The turmoil starts there in the mind and then it spreads out to your words and deeds so that you speak and act in wrong ways
If we try to observe the precepts without restraining the senses our precepts can't become pure
This is because we aren't careful about how we look and listen so we aren't able to see how desire craving and defilement arise at the moment the eye sees sights or the ear hears sounds
This lack of restraint is what puts holes in our precepts
We create issues outside and this soils our words and deeds
For this reason the virtue of restraining the senses is a level of virtue that closes off the leaks in the mind
If you develop this level of virtue your words and deeds will be beautiful and admirable  just like monks who are strict in their restraint of the senses who don't gaze far away who don't look at things that are enemies to the mind who aren't addicted to the flavors of contact by means of the eye ear nose tongue body and mind who are observant to see the passing away of physical and mental phenomena so that their minds aren't thrown into a turmoil because of their likes and dislikes
For the most part we aren't interested in exercising restraint and so we fall victim to sensual pleasures
We let ourselves get pleased and displeased with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations and so the mind gets defiled as it deludedly falls for the savor of these things
No matter how deluded we get we don't realize what's happening because the savor of these pleasures makes us keep on wanting more
Our discernment hasn't yet seen the drawbacks of these things
To let go of anything you first have to see its drawbacks
If you simply tell yourself to let go let go let go you can't really let go
You have to see the drawbacks of the things you're holding onto and then you'll let go automatically  as when you grab hold of fire and realize how hot it is you'll automatically let go and never dare touch it again
We haven't yet realized the heat of sensual passions which is why we still like them so much
Even though every attachment is stressful by its very nature we see it as good
No matter what comes our way we keep latching on
This has become our second nature
We're not aware that we're grabbing hold of fire and so we keep wanting more of it
This is why the mind never wearies of its clinging attachments
When we can't see the drawbacks of sensual passions there's no way we can see the drawbacks of more subtle things that lie deeper still like our sense of self
We're still lured by external baits by way of the eye and ear and yet we're not aware of what's happening
These things are like sugar coating a pill of poison and so we still find them delicious
We swallow the poison so that it nourishes cravings and defilements that are so painful and seering and yet we don't see them as painful
We're still relishing the sugar
We want more
This is because the mind has never grown weary of sensuality hasn't developed any sense of renunciation any desire to be free from sensuality
It still likes to lie soaking in sensuality
If it gains sensual pleasure it's satisfied
If it doesn't it gets angry and resentful
Even these external lures still delude us
If we get what we want we're happy
If we don't we're thrown into a turmoil
If we don't get enough of these lures we go around complaining that other people don't sympathize with us don't care about us
We keep on wanting to get these things with no sense of enough  like worms that feel such relish for foul and smelly things and have no sense of disgust
The savor of sensual passion excites the hearts of all beings so that they want more
The noble ones feel disgust for it
They don't want to go near it
But ordinary beings want to go right for it and eat their fill
The Buddha compared people like this to worms that relish filth or to a snake that's fallen into a cesspool so covered with excrement that you can't find any part to grab hold of to get it out without soiling yourself
The Buddha liked to make comparisons like this so that we'll come to our senses
The Buddha had a whole long list of comparisons for the drawbacks of sensual pleasures
If you want to know them go look in a good anthology from the suttas
Some of the Buddha's teachings are attractive and appealing but others are really castigating
We meditators should take an interest in reading his teachings and reflecting on them so that we don't misunderstand things
The type of Dhamma that pokes at our sore points is something that goes against the grain with all of us
This is because we don't like criticism
We don't like being reprimanded
We want nothing but praise and admiration to the point where we swell up with air
But people with real mindfulness and discernment don't want any of that
They want to hear helpful criticism helpful reprimands
This is what it means to have discernment and intelligence
You know how to take criticism in an intelligent way
When you read the Buddha's teachings you should reflect on them
The Buddha castigates his disciples more than he praises them
Is our attitude in line with his
We like to hear praise
If people criticize us we get angry and accuse them of having bad motives
This is really stupid and sad
We get teachings that are meant to help us but we don't use them to reflect on ourselves
Instead we criticize the criticism as being too harsh
As a result we don't get any use out of wellmeaning criticisms
As for people with mindfulness and discernment they feel just the other way around
They realize that they benefit from their teachers' criticisms more than from anything else
Children have no appreciation for the teachers who have been strict with them because they hate strict treatment
But as they become more intelligent and mature they begin to realize that strict treatment can be an excellent way of building character of making them come to their senses
The old saying If you love your ox you can't let it roam wild if you love your child you have to spank it reminds us not to cater to our children's whims or else they'll become careless and irresponsible
If we're strict with them and scold them when they do wrong they'll develop a greater and greater sense of responsibility
This is why people who are intelligent and discerning prefer criticism to praise
Stupid people prefer praise to criticism
As soon as you criticize them they get so angry
They don't realize the great value of criticism
Suppose someone criticizes us when we do wrong the wrong we're doing is unskillful and causes suffering
If we're warned against doing something unskillful that's greatly to our benefit
It's as if that person has pulled us out of suffering out of a fire out of hell
But stupid people will attack the person who gives them the wellintentioned warning
If they were intelligent they'd have to thank the person who gave them the warning for that person has helped them come to their senses
They'd have to take that warning to heart to the point where they couldn't forget it
If you don't feel this way about criticism you'll never be able to outgrow your old habits
You'll have to stick stubbornly to your old ways more concerned with winning out over others than with taming your own rebelliousness
If you're the sort of person who can't tame your own rebelliousness then the more you're taught the more you go out of control  and the more you simply end up burning yourself
You take valuable teachings and use them to harm yourself
This is why we have to listen well to criticism so that we can get the most benefit from it
Think of how harmful defilement craving and attachment can be
We're so full of our sense of self
What can we do to weaken it
We have to focus on our own minds in a way that gives results that doesn't defile it that doesn't stir it up into a turmoil
We have to use our own intelligence  our own mindfulness and discernment  to keep looking inward at all times
No one else can do our looking for us
We're the ones who have to know ourselves in an allaround way
This practice of ridding ourselves of defilements think of it as digging into a tall termites' nest to get at a vicious animal  like a snake  hiding inside
You have to use the sharpest possible picks and shovels to reach the snake
In the same way our sense of self lies deep
We have to use mindfulness and discernment which are like the sharpest picks and shovels to penetrate into it
Wherever there's a sense of self try digging on in to catch it
Turn it over and look at its face to see where exactly it's your self
Try examining your body or feeling perception thought fabrications and consciousness  all the things you're so attached to that you're not willing to let them go
How can you examine them so that you'll know them
Only through seeing the inconstancy of form feeling perception thought fabrications and consciousness
If you don't know in this way there's no way you can let go of these things for you'll keep on seeing them in the wrong way thinking that they're constant easeful and self
This is an important point
Don't pass over it casually
The affairs of inconstancy stress and notselfness are deep and refined
As we start from the outer levels and work into the inner levels we have to contemplate in a way that grows continually deeper and deeper more and more refined
Don't get by with knowing inconstancy stress and notselfness only on a superficial level for that'll have no impact on the roots of your delusion and foolishness
Observe to see which ways of contemplating get results in producing knowledge of inconstancy stress and notselfness with genuine mindfulness and discernment
If you really know with mindfulness and discernment the mind has to develop a sense of samvega of dismay and dispassion for the inconstancy stressfulness and notselfness of physical and mental phenomena of the five aggregates  in other words of our body and mind
It'll then unravel its attachments
But if our knowledge isn't yet true we'll keep on holding on blindly trying to make these things constant easeful and self
I ask that all of you contemplate so you can come to really know and clearly see these matters for what they are
The whole reason we're trying to quiet our minds or practice meditation is nothing other than this to see the inconstancy stress and notselfness of the aggregates the properties the sense media
We're not practicing simply for the ease and pleasure that come when the mind is still
We have to observe and evaluate things so as to see them clearly in a way that allows us to let them go
The mind will then be empty of any sense of self
Even if you can experience this emptiness only momentarily it's still very worthwhile
Keep your awareness of that experience in mind as capital for giving you continued strength in the practice  better than wandering off to be aware of other things
When we keep on training the mind day after day as we're doing here we find that when we go to sleep and then wake up in the morning our awareness has become continuous  more and more continuous to the point where the mind doesn't go wandering off the way it used to
It stays more and more with the body in the present
Whatever arises we can investigate it to see if any part of it is constant or stable
Regardless of whether it's a physical phenomenon or a mental phenomenon is there any part of it that's constant or stable
When we see that there's nothing constant or stable to these things that they keep on changing relentlessly we'll realize that this inconstancy is inherently stressful in and of itself  and that within this inconstancy that's inherently stressful there's no self anywhere at all
You have to investigate to see things clearly in this way
It's not the case that inconstancy is one thing stress another and notself still another
That's not the case at all
You have to investigate to see clearly that they're all aspects of the same thing
If you don't see clearly in this way with your own mindfulness and discernment your knowledge isn't true
Even though you may be able to explain things correctly the mind still doesn't know
It keeps its eyes closed and stays in the dark
When your knowledge is true there has to be a sense of dispassion of letting go
The mind will be able to abandon its attachments
Then watch the mind at that moment
You'll see that it's empty
Look at your mind right now
When it's at a state of normalcy free from any turmoil it's empty on one level
When you turn to observe the mind at a state of normalcy when it's not latching onto anything it's free from any sense of self
There's simply awareness pure and simple without any labels of me or mine Notice how the mind is empty right now because it doesn't have any attachments for me or mine
If you don't understand this point you won't be able to find the deeper levels of emptiness  or you may go and make it empty in other ways all of which are off the mark
The emptiness we're looking for comes from letting things go through seeing their inconstancy stressfulness and notselfness
And then you have to keep hammering away at this point over and over again
There's no need to pay attention to any other matters for the more things you take on the more the mind is thrown into a turmoil
Focus on one matter one thing and keep observing it until it's clear to the mind
The moment it's clear to the mind is when the mind will be able to loosen its grip
It'll be able to let go
To be empty
Even just this is enough for extinguishing the suffering and stress of your daytoday life
You don't have to go reading or studying a lot of things
Simply study the mind from this angle  its arising remaining and passing away
Observe this until it's clear and the mind will become firmly centered in this awareness
When it's aware it lets go
It'll then be empty
So this all boils down to one point Try to be intent on observing and evaluating the mind carefully and it will become empty in the easiest possible way
I hope that this simple point will help you see the truths within your own mind and that you'll reap benefits fully correct with each and every moment
It's important that we discuss the steps of the practice in training the mind for the mind has all sorts of deceptions by which it fools itself
If you aren't skillful in investigating and seeing through them they are very difficult to overcome even if you're continually mindful to keep watch over the mind
You have to make an effort to focus on contemplating these things at all times
Mindfulness on its own won't be able to give rise to any real knowledge
At best it can give you only a little protection against the effects of sensory contact
If you don't make a focused contemplation the mind won't be able to give rise to any knowledge within itself at all
This is why you have to train yourself to be constantly aware all around
When you come to know anything for what it really is there's nothing but letting go letting go
On the beginning level this means the mind won't give rise to any unwise or unprofitable thoughts
It will simply stop to watch stop to know within itself at all times
If there's anything you have to think about keep your thoughts on the themes of inconstancy stress and notself
You have to keep the mind thinking and labeling solely in reference to these sorts of themes for if your thinking and labeling are right you'll come to see things rightly
If you go the opposite way you'll have to think wrongly and label things wrongly and that means you'll have to see things wrongly as well
This is what keeps the mind completely hidden from itself
Now when thoughts or labels arise in the mind then if you focus on watching them closely you'll see that they're sensations  sensations of arising and disbanding changeable unreliable and illusory
If you don't make an effort to keep a focused watch on them you'll fall for the deceptions of thoughtformation
In other words the mind gives rise to memories of the past and fashions issues dealing with the past but if you're aware of what's going on in time you'll see that they're all illusory
There's no real truth to them at all
Even the meanings the mind gives to good and bad sensory contacts at the moment they occur If you carefully observe and contemplate you'll see that they're all deceptive
There's no real truth to them
But ignorance and delusion latch onto them all and this drives the mind around in circles
In other words it doesn't know what's what  how these things arise persist and disband  so it latches onto them and gets itself deceived on many many levels
If you don't stop to focus and watch there's no way you can see through these things at all
But if the mind keeps its balance or stops to watch and know within itself it can come to realize these things for what they are
When it realizes them it can let them go automatically without being attached to anything
This is the knowledge that comes with true mindfulness and discernment It knows and lets go
It doesn't cling
No matter what appears  good or bad pleasure or pain  when the mind knows it doesn't cling
When it doesn't cling there's no stress or suffering
You have to keep hammering away at this point When it doesn't cling the mind can stay at normalcy
Empty
Undisturbed
Quiet and still
But if it doesn't read itself in this way doesn't know itself in this way it will fall for the deceits of defilement and craving
It will fashion up all sorts of complex and complicated things that it itself will have a hard time seeing through for they'll have their ways of playing up to the mind to keep it attached to them all of which is simply a matter of the mind's falling for the deceits of the defilements and cravings within itself
The fact that it isn't acquainted with itself  doesn't know how mental states arise and disband and take on objects  means that it loses itself in its many many attachments
There's nothing as hard to keep watch of as the mind because it's so accustomed to wrong views and wrong opinions
This is what keeps it hidden from itself
But thanks to the teachings of the Buddha we can gain knowledge into the mind or into consciousness with its many layers and intricacies that when you look into it deeply you'll find to be empty  empty of any meaning in and of itself
This is an emptiness that can appear clearly within consciousness
Even though it's hidden and profound we can see into it by looking inward in a way that's quiet and still
The mind stops to watch to know within itself
As for sensory contacts  sights sounds smells tastes and that sort of thing  it isn't interested because it's intent on looking into consciousness pure and simple to see what arises in there and how it generates issues
Sensations thoughts labels for pleasure and pain and so forth are all natural phenomena that change as soon as they're sensed  and they're very refined
If you view them as being about this or that matter you won't be able to know them for what they are
The more intricate the meanings you give them the more lost you become  lost in the whorls of the cycle of rebirth
The cycle of rebirth and the processes of thoughtformation are one and the same thing
As a result we whirl around and around lost in many many levels of thoughtformation not just one
The knowledge that would read the heart can't break through to know for it whirls around and around in these very same thoughtformations giving them meanings in terms of this or that and then latching onto them
If it labels them as good it latches onto them as good
If it labels them as bad it latches onto them as bad
This is why the mind stays entirely in the whorls of the cycle of rebirth the cycle of thoughtformation
For this reason to see these things clearly requires the effort to stop and watch to stop and know in an appropriate way in a way that's just right
At the same time you have to use your powers of observation
That's what will enable you to read your own consciousness in a special way
Otherwise if you latch onto the issues of thoughts and labels they'll keep you spinning around
So you have to stop and watch stop and know clearly by focusing down  focusing down on the consciousness in charge
That way your knowledge will become skillful
Ultimately you'll see that there's nothing at all  just the arising and disbanding occurring every moment in emptiness
If there's no attachment there are no issues
There's simply the natural phenomenon of arising and disbanding
But because we don't see things simply as natural phenomena we see them as being true and latch onto them as our self good bad and all sorts of other complicated things
This keeps us spinning around without knowing how to find a way out what to let go of  we don't know
When we don't know we're like a person who wanders into a jungle and doesn't know the way out doesn't know what to do
Actually what we have to let go of lies right smack in front of us where the mind fashions things and gives them meanings so that it doesn't know the characteristics of arising and disbanding pure and simple
If you can simply keep watching and knowing without any need for meanings thoughts imaginings  simply watching the process of these things in and of itself  there won't be any issues
There's just the phenomenon of the present arising persisting disbanding arising persisting disbanding There's no special trick to this but you have to stop and watch stop and know within yourself every moment
Don't let your awareness stream away from awareness to outside preoccupations
Gather it in so it can know itself clearly  that there's nothing in there worth latching onto
It's all a bunch of deceits
To know just this much is very useful for seeing the truth inside yourself
You'll see that consciousness is empty of any self
When you look at physical phenomena you'll see them as elements as empty of any self
You'll see mental phenomena as empty of any self as elements of consciousness  and that if there's no attachment no latching on there's no suffering or stress
So even if there's thinking going on in the mind simply watch it simply let it go and its cycling will slow down
Fewer and fewer thoughtformations will occur
Even if the mind doesn't stop completely it will form fewer and fewer thoughts
You'll be able to stop to watch stop to know more and more
And this way you'll come to see the tricks and deceits of thoughtformation mental labels pleasure and pain and so on
You'll be able to know that there's really nothing inside  that the reason you were deluded into latching onto things was because of ignorance and that you made yourself suffer right there in that very ignorance
So you have to focus down on one point one thing
Focusing on many things won't do
Keep mindfulness in place stopping knowing seeing
Don't let it run out after thoughts and labels
But knowing in this way requires that you make the effort to stay focused  focused on seeing clearly not just on making the mind still
Focus on seeing clearly
Look on in for the sake of seeing clearly and contemplate how to let go
The mind will become empty in line with its nature in a way that you'll know exclusively within
What can we do to see the aggregates  this mass of suffering and stress  clearly in a way that we can cut attachment for them out of the mind
Why is it that people studying to be doctors can know everything in the body  intestines liver kidneys and all  down to the details and yet don't develop any dispassion or disenchantment for it  why
Why is it that undertakers can spend their time with countless corpses and yet not gain any insight at all
This shows that this sort of insight is hard to attain
If there's no mindfulness and discernment to see things clearly for what they are knowledge is simply a passing fancy
It doesn't sink in
The mind keeps latching onto its attachments
But if the mind can gain true insight to the point where it can relinquish its attachments it can gain the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
This shows that there's a difference in the knowing
It's not that we have to know all the details like modernday surgeons
All we have to know is that the body is composed of the four physical elements plus the elements of space and consciousness
If we really know just this much we've reached the paths and their fruitions while those who know all the details to the point where they can perform surgery don't reach any transcendent attainments at all
So let's analyze the body into its elements so as to know them thoroughly
If we do then when there are changes in the body and mind there won't be too much clinging
If we don't our attachments will be fixed and strong and will lead to further states of being and birth in the future
Now that we have the opportunity we should contemplate the body and take it apart for a good look so as to get down to the details
Take the five basic meditation objects  hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin  and look at them carefully one at a time
You don't have to take on all five you know
Focus on the hair of the head to see that it belongs to the earth element to see that its roots are soaked in blood and lymph under the skin
It's unattractive in terms of its color its smell and where it dwells
If you analyze and contemplate these things you won't be deluded into regarding them as your hair your nails your teeth your skin
All of these parts are composed of the earth element mixed in with water wind and fire
If they were purely earth they wouldn't last because every part of the body has to be composed of all four elements for it to be a body
And then there's a mental phenomenon the mind in charge
These are things that follow in line with nature in every way  the arising changing and disbanding of physical and mental phenomena  but we latch onto them seeing the body as ours the mental phenomena as us It's all us and ours
If we don't contemplate to see these things for what they are we'll do nothing but cling to them
This is what meditation is seeing things clearly for what they are
It's not a matter of switching from topic to topic for that would simply ensure that you wouldn't know a thing
But our inner character under the sway of ignorance and delusion doesn't like examining itself repeatedly
It keeps finding other issues to get in the way so that we think constantly about other things
This is why we stay so ignorant and foolish
Then why is it that we can know other things
Because they fall in line with what craving wants
To see things clearly for what they are would be to abandon craving so it finds ways of keeping things hidden
It keeps changing bringing in new things all the time keeping us fooled all the time so that we study and think about nothing but matters that add to the mind's suffering and stress
That's all that craving wants
As for the kind of study that would end the stress and suffering in the mind it's always getting in the way
This is why the mind is always wanting to shift to new things to know new things to fall for
And this is why it's always becoming attached
So when it doesn't really know itself you have to make a real effort to see the truth that the things within it aren't you or yours
Don't let the mind stop short of this knowledge Make this a law within yourself
If the mind doesn't know the truths of inconstancy stress and notself within itself it won't gain release from suffering
Its knowledge will simply be worldly knowledge it will follow a worldly path
It won't reach the paths and fruition leading to nibbana
So this is where the worldly and the transcendent part ways
If you comprehend inconstancy stress and notself to the ultimate degree that's the transcendent
If you don't get down to their details you're still on the worldly level
The Buddha has many teachings but this is what they all come down to
The important principles of the practice  the four foundations of mindfulness the four Noble Truths  all come down to these characteristics of inconstancy stress and notselfness
If you try to learn too many principles you'll end up not getting any clear knowledge of the truth as it is
If you focus on knowing just a little you'll end up with more true insight than if you try knowing a lot of things
It's through wanting to know a lot of things that we end up deluded
We wander around in our deluded knowledge thinking and labeling things but knowledge that's focused and specific when it really knows is absolute
It keeps hammering away at one point
There's no need to know a lot of things for when you really know one thing everything converges right there
In practicing the Dhamma if you don't foster a balance between concentration and discernment you'll end up going wild in your thinking
If there's too much work at discernment you'll go wild in your thinking
If there's too much concentration it just stays still and undisturbed without coming to any knowledge either
So you have to keep them in balance
Stillness has to be paired with discernment
Don't let there be too much of one or the other
Try to get them just right
That's when you'll be able to see things clearly all the way through
Otherwise you'll stay as deluded as ever
You may want to gain discernment into too many things  and as a result your thinking goes wild
The mind goes out of control
Some people keep wondering why discernment never arises in their practice but when it does arise they really go off on a tangent
Their thinking goes wild all out of bounds
So when you practice you have to observe in your meditation how you can make the mind still
Once it does grow still it tends to get stuck there
Or it may grow empty without any knowledge of anything quiet disengaged at ease for a while but without any discernment to accompany it
But if you can get discernment to accompany your concentration that's when you'll really benefit
You'll see things all the way through and be able to let them go
If you're too heavy on the side of either discernment or stillness you can't let go
The mind may come to know this or that but it latches onto its knowledge
Then it knows still other things and latches onto them too
Or else it simply stays perfectly quiet and latches onto that
It's not easy to keep your practice on the Middle Way
If you don't use your powers of observation it's especially hard
The mind will keep falling for things sometimes right sometimes wrong because it doesn't observe what's going on
This isn't the path to letting go
It's a path that's stuck caught up on things
If you don't know what it's stuck and caught up on you'll remain foolish and deluded
So you have to make an effort at focused contemplation until you see clearly into inconstancy stress and notself
This without a doubt is what will stop every moment of suffering and stress
The sensations of the mind are subtle and very volatile
Sometimes passion or irritation can arise completely independent of sensory contact simply in line with the force of our character
For instance there are times when the mind is perfectly normal and all of a sudden there's irritation  or the desire to form thoughts and get engrossed in feelings of pain pleasure or equanimity
We have to contemplate these three kinds of feeling to see that they're inconstant and always changing and to see that they are all stressful so that the mind won't go and get engrossed in them
This business of getting engrossed is very subtle and hard to detect
It keeps us from knowing what's what because it's delusion pure and simple
Being engrossed in feelings of pleasure is something relatively easy to detect but being engrossed in feelings of equanimity That's hard to notice because the mind is at equanimity in an oblivious way
This oblivious equanimity keeps us from seeing anything clearly
So you have to focus on seeing feelings simply as feelings and pull the mind out of its state of being engrossed with equanimity
When there's a feeling of equanimity as the mind gathers and settles down when it's not scattered around use that feeling of equanimity in concentration as the basis for probing in to see inconstancy stress and notself  for this equanimity in concentration at the fourth level of absorption is the basis for liberating insight
Simply make sure that you don't get attached to the absorption
If you get the mind to grow still in equanimity without focusing on gaining insight it's simply a temporary state of concentration
So you have to focus on gaining clear insight either into inconstancy into stress or into notselfness
That's when you'll be able to uproot your attachments
If the mind gets into a state of oblivious equanimity it's still carrying fuel inside it
Then as soon as there's sensory contact it flares up into attachment
So we have to follow the principles the Buddha laid down Focus the mind into a state of absorption and then focus on gaining clear insight into the three characteristics
The proper way to practice is not to let yourself get stuck on this level or that  and no matter what insights you may gain don't go thinking that you've gained Awakening
Keep looking
Keep focusing in to see if there are any further changes in the mind and when there are see the stress in those changes the notselfness of those changes
If you can know in this way the mind will rise above feeling no longer entangled in this level or that level  all of which are simply matters of speculation
The important thing is that you try to see clearly
Even when the mind is concocting all sorts of objects in a real turmoil focus on seeing all of its objects as illusory
Then stay still to watch their disbanding
Get so that it's clear to you that there's really nothing to them
They all disband
All that remains is the empty mind  the mind maintaining its balance in normalcy  and then focus in on examining that
There are many levels to this process of examining the diseases in the mind not just one
Even though you may come up with genuine insights every now and then don't just stop there  and don't get excited about the fact that you've come to see things you never saw before
Just keep contemplating the theme of inconstancy in everything without latching on and then you'll come to even more penetrating insights
So focus on in until the mind stops until it reaches the stage of absorption called purity of mindfulness and equanimity
See what pure mindfulness is like
As for the feeling of equanimity that's an affair of concentration
It's what the mindfulness depends on so that it too can reach equanimity
This is the stage where we gather the strength of our awareness in order to come in and know the mind
Get the mind centered at equanimity and then probe in to contemplate
That's when you'll be able to see
An important but subtle point is that even though we practice we continue to fall for pleasant feelings because feelings are illusory on many levels
We don't realize that they're changeable and unreliable
Instead of offering pleasure they offer us nothing but stress  yet we're still addicted to them
This business of feeling is thus a very subtle matter
Please try to contemplate it carefully  this business of latching onto feelings of pleasure pain or equanimity
You have to contemplate so as to see it clearly
And you have to experiment more than you may want to with pain
When there are feelings of physical pain or mental distress the mind will struggle because it doesn't like pain
But when pain turns to pleasure the mind likes it and is content with it so it keeps on playing with feeling even though as we've already said feeling is inconstant stressful and not really ours
But the mind doesn't see this
All it sees are feelings of pleasure and it wants them
Try looking into how feeling gives rise to craving
It's because we want pleasant feeling that craving whispers  whispers right there at the feeling
If you observe carefully you'll see that this is very important for this is where the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana are attained right here at feeling and craving
If we can extinguish the craving in feeling that's nibbana
In the Solasa Pañha the Buddha said that defilement is like a wide and deep flood but he then went on to summarize the practice to cross it simply as abandoning craving in every action
Now right here at feeling is where we can practice to abandon craving for the way we relish the flavor of feeling has many ramifications
This is where many of us get deceived because we don't see feeling as inconstant
We want it to be constant
We want pleasant feelings to be constant
As for pain we don't want it to be constant but no matter how much we try to push it away we still latch onto it
This is why we have to focus on feeling so that we can abandon craving right there in the feeling
If you don't focus here the other paths you may follow will simply proliferate
So bring the practice close to home
When the mind changes or when it gains a sense of stillness or calm that would rank as a feeling of pleasure or equanimity try to see in what ways the pleasure or equanimity is inconstant that it's not you or yours
When you can do this you'll stop relishing that particular feeling
You can stop right there right where the mind relishes the flavor of feeling and gives rise to craving
This is why the mind has to be fully aware of itself  all around at all times  in its focused contemplation to see feeling as empty of self
This business of liking and disliking feelings is a disease hard to detect because our intoxication with feelings is so very strong
Even with the sensations of peace and emptiness in the mind we're still infatuated with feeling
Feelings on the crude level  the violent and stressful ones that come with defilement  are easy to detect
But when the mind grows still  steady cool bright and so on  we're still addicted to feeling
We want these feelings of pleasure or equanimity
We enjoy them
Even on the level of firm concentration or meditative absorption there's attachment to the feeling
This is the subtle magnetic pull of craving which paints and plasters things over
This painting and plastering is hard to detect because craving is always whispering inside us I want nothing but pleasant feelings This is very important for this virus of craving is what makes us continue to be reborn
So explore to see how craving paints and plasters things how it causes desires to form  the desires to get this or take that  and what sort of flavor it has that makes you so addicted to it that makes it hard for you to pull away
You have to contemplate to see how craving fastens the mind so firmly to feelings that you never weary of sensuality or of pleasant feelings no matter what the level
If you don't contemplate so as to see clearly that the mind is stuck right here at feeling and craving it will keep you from gaining release
We're stuck on feeling like a monkey stuck in a tar trap
They take a glob of tar and put it where a monkey will get its hand stuck in it and in trying to pull free the monkey gets its other hand both feet and finally its mouth stuck too
Consider this Whatever we do we end up stuck right here at feeling and craving
We can't separate them out
We can't wash them off
If we don't grow weary of craving we're like the monkey stuck in the glob of tar getting ourselves more and more trapped all the time
So if we're intent on freeing ourselves in the footsteps of the arahants we have to focus specifically on feeling until we can succeed at freeing ourselves from it
Even with painful feelings we have to practice  for if we're afraid of pain and always try to change it to pleasure we'll end up even more ignorant than before
This is why we have to be brave in experimenting with pain  both physical pain and mental distress
When it arises in full measure like a house afire can we let go of it
We have to know both sides of feeling
When it's hot and burning how can we deal with it
When it's cool and refreshing how can we see through it
We have to make an effort to focus on both sides contemplating until we know how to let go
Otherwise we won't know anything for all we want is the cool side the cooler the better and when this is the case how can we expect to gain release from the cycle of rebirth
Nibbana is the extinguishing of craving and yet we like to stay with craving  so how can we expect to get anywhere at all
We'll stay right here in the world right here with stress and suffering for craving is a sticky sap
If there's no craving there's nothing no stress no rebirth
But we have to watch out for it
It's a sticky sap a glob of tar a dye that's hard to wash out
So don't let yourself get carried away with feeling
The crucial part of the practice lies here
In making yourself quiet you have to be quiet on all fronts  quiet in your deeds quiet in your words quiet in your mind
Only then will you be able to contemplate what's going on inside yourself
If you aren't quiet you'll become involved in external affairs and end up having too much to do and too much to say
This will keep your awareness or mindfulness from holding steady and firm
You have to stop doing saying or thinking anything that isn't necessary
That way your mindfulness will be able to develop continuously
Don't let yourself get involved in too many outside things
In training your mindfulness to be continuous so that it will enable you to contemplate yourself you have to be observant When there's sensory contact can the mind stay continuously undisturbed and at normalcy
Or does it still run out into liking and disliking
Being observant in this way will enable you to read yourself to know yourself
If mindfulness is firmly established the mind won't waver
If it's not yet firm the mind will waver in the form of liking and disliking
You have to be wary of even the slightest wavering
Don't let yourself think that the slight waverings are unimportant or else they'll become habitual
Being uncomplacent means that you have to watch out for the details the little things the tiny flaws that arise in the mind
If you can do this you'll be able to keep your mind protected  better than giving all your attention to the worthless affairs of the outside world
So really try to be careful
Don't get entangled in sensory contact
This is something you have to work at mastering
If you focus yourself exclusively in the area of the mind like this you'll be able to contemplate feelings in all their details
You'll be able to see them clearly to let them go
So focus your practice right at feelings of pleasure pain and neitherpleasurenorpain
Contemplate how to leave them alone simply as feelings without relishing them  for if you relish feelings that's craving
Desires for this and that will seep in and influence the mind so that it gets carried away with inner and outer feelings
This is why you have to be quiet  quiet in a way that doesn't let the mind become attached to the flavors of feelings quiet in a way that uproots their influence
The desire for pleasure is like a virus deep in our character
What we're doing here is to make the mind stop taking pleasant feelings into itself and stop pushing painful feelings away
Our addiction to taking in pleasant feelings is what makes us dislike painful feelings and push them away so don't let the mind love pleasure and resist pain
Let it be undisturbed by both
Give it a try
If the mind can let go of feelings so that it's above pleasure pain and neitherpleasurenorpain that means it's not stuck on feeling
And then try to observe How can it stay unaffected by feelings
This is something you have to work at mastering in order to release your grasp on feelings once and for all so that you won't latch onto physical pain or mental distress as being you or yours
If you don't release your grasp on feeling you'll stay attached to it both in its physical and in its mental forms
If there's the pleasure of physical ease you'll be attracted to it
As for the purely mental feeling of pleasure that's something you'll really want you'll really love
And then you'll be attracted to the mental perceptions and labels that accompany the pleasure the thoughtformations and even the consciousness that accompany the pleasure
You'll latch onto all of these things as you or yours
So analyze physical and mental pleasure
Take them apart to contemplate how to let them go
Don't fool yourself into relishing them
As for pain don't push it away
Let pain simply be pain let pleasure simply be pleasure
Let them simply fall into the category of feelings
Don't go thinking that you feel pleasure that you feel pain
If you can let go of feeling in this way you'll be able to gain release from suffering and stress because you'll be above and beyond feeling
This way when aging illness and death come you won't latch onto them thinking that you are aging that you are ill that you are dying
You'll be able to release these things from your grasp
If you can contemplate purely in these terms  that the five aggregates are inconstant stressful and notself  you won't enter into them and latch onto them as me or mine If you don't analyze them in this way you'll be trapped in dying
Even your bones skin flesh and so forth will become mine This is why we're taught to contemplate death  so that we can make ourselves aware that death doesn't mean that we die
You have to contemplate until you really know this
Otherwise you'll stay trapped right there
You must make yourself sensitive in a way that sees clearly how your bones flesh and skin are empty of any self
That way you won't latch onto them
The fact that you still latch onto them shows that you haven't really seen into their inconstancy stress and notselfness
When you see the bones of animals they don't have much meaning but when you see the bones of people your perception labels them That's a person's skeleton
That's a person's skull If there are a lot of them they can really scare you
When you see the picture of a skeleton or of anything that shows the inconstancy and notselfness of the body and you don't see clear through it you'll get stuck at the level of skeleton and bones
Actually there are no bones at all
They're empty nothing but elements
You have to penetrate into the bones so that they're elements
Otherwise you'll get stuck at the level of skeleton
And since you haven't seen through it it can make you distressed and upset
This shows that you haven't penetrated into the Dhamma
You're stuck at the outer shell because you haven't analyzed things into their elements
When days and nights pass by they're not the only things that pass by
The body constantly decays and falls apart too
The body decays bit by bit but we don't realize it
Only after it's decayed a lot  when the hair has gone gray and the teeth fall out  do we realize that it's old
This is knowledge on a crude and really blatant level
But as for the gradual decaying that goes on quietly inside we aren't aware of it
As a result we cling to the body as being us  every single part of it
Its eyes are our eyes the sights they see are the things we see the sensation of seeing is something we sense
We don't see these things as elements
Actually the element of vision and the element of form make contact
The awareness of the contact is the element of consciousness the mental phenomenon that senses sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and all
This we don't realize which is why we latch onto everything  eyes ears nose tongue body intellect  as being us or ours
Then when the body decays we feel that we are growing old when it dies and mental phenomena stop we feel that we die
Once you've taken the elements apart though there's nothing
These things lose their meaning on their own
They're simply physical and mental elements without any illness or death
If you don't penetrate into things this way you stay deluded and blind
For instance when we chant jaradhammamhi  I am subject to death  that's simply to make us mindful and uncomplacent in the beginning stages of the practice
When you reach the stage of insight meditation though there's none of that
All assumptions all conventional truths get ripped away
They all collapse
When the body is empty of self what is there to latch onto
Physical elements mental elements they're already empty of any self
You have to see this clearly all the way through
Otherwise they gather together and form a being both physical and mental and then you latch onto them as being your self
Once we see the world as elements however there's no death
And once we can see that there's no death that's when we'll really know
If we still see that we die that shows that we haven't yet seen the Dhamma
We're still stuck on the outer shell
And when this is the case what sort of Dhamma can we expect to know
You have to penetrate deeper in to contemplate taking things apart
You're almost at the end of your lease in this burning house and yet you continue latching onto it as your self
It tricks you into feeling fear and love and when you fall for it what path will you practice
The mind latches onto these things to fool itself on many many levels
You can't see through even these conventions so you grasp hold of them as your self as a woman a man  and you really turn yourself into these things
If you can't contemplate so as to empty yourself of these conventions and assumptions your practice simply circles around in the same old place and as a result you can't find any way out
So you have to contemplate down through many levels
It's like using a cloth to filter things
If you use a coarse weave you won't catch much of anything
You have to use a fine weave to filter down to the deeper levels and penetrate into the deeper levels by contemplating over and over again through level after level
That's why there are many levels to being mindful and discerning filtering on in to the details
And this is why examining and becoming fully aware of your own inner character is so important
The practice of meditation is nothing but catching sight of selfdeceptions to see how they infiltrate into the deepest levels and how even the most blatant levels fool us right before our very eyes
If you can't catch sight of the deceits and deceptions of the self your practice won't lead to release from suffering
It will simply keep you deluded into thinking that everything is you and yours
To practice in line with the Buddha's teachings is to go against the flow
Every living being deep down inside wants pleasure on the physical level and then on the higher and more subtle levels of feeling such as the types of concentration that are addicted to feelings of peace and respite
This is why you have to investigate into feeling so that you can let go of it and thus snuff out craving through being fully aware of feeling as it actually is  free from any self  in line with its nature unentangled uninvolved
This is what snuffs out the virus of craving so that ultimately it vanishes without a trace
There are many layers to selfdeception
The more you practice and investigate things the less you feel like claiming to know
Instead you'll simply see the harm of your own manyfaceted ignorance and foolishness
Your examination of the viruses in the mind gets more and more subtle
Before you didn't know so you took your views to be knowledge  because you thought you knew
But actually these things aren't real knowledge
They're the type of understanding that comes from labels
Still we think they're knowledge and we think we know
This in itself is a very intricate selfdeception
So you have to keep watch on these things to keep contemplating them
Sometimes they fool us right before our eyes That's when it really gets bad because we don't know that we've got ourselves fooled and instead think we're people who know
We can deal thoroughly with this or that topic but our knowledge is simply the memory of labels
We think that labels are discernment or thoughtformations are discernment or the awareness of sensory consciousness is discernment and so we get these things all mixed up
As a result we become enamored with all the bits of knowledge that slip in and fashion the mind  which are simply the illusions within awareness
As for genuine awareness there's very little of it while deceptive awareness has us surrounded on all sides
We thus have to contemplate and investigate so as to see through these illusions in awareness
This is what will enable us to read the mind
If your awareness goes out don't follow it out
Stop and turn inward instead
Whatever slips in to fashion the mind you have to be wise to it
You can't forbid it for it's something natural and you shouldn't try to close off the mind too much
Simply keep watch on awareness to see how far it will go how true or false it is how it disbands and then arises again
You have to watch it over and over again
Simply watching in this way will enable you to read yourself to know cause and effect within yourself and to contemplate yourself
This is what will make your mindfulness and discernment more and more skillful
If you don't practice in this way the mind will be dark
It may get a little empty a little still and you'll decide that's plenty good enough
But if you look at the Buddha's teachings you'll find that no matter what sort of correct knowledge he gained he was never willing to stop there
He always said There's more To begin with he developed mindfulness and clear comprehension in every activity but then he said There's more to do further to go As for us we're always ready to brag
We work at developing this or that factor for a while and then say we already know all about it and don't have to develop it any further
As a result the principles in our awareness go soft because of our boastfulness and pride
To open the door so that you can really see inside yourself isn't easy but it's something you can train yourself to do
If you have the mindfulness enabling you to read yourself and understand yourself that cuts through a lot of the issues right there
Craving will have a hard time forming
In whatever guise it arises you'll get to read it to know it to extinguish it to let it go
When you get to do these things it doesn't mean that you get anything for actually once the mind is empty that means it doesn't gain anything at all
But to put it into words for those who haven't experienced it In what ways is emptiness empty
Does it mean that everything disappears or is annihilated
Actually you should know that emptiness doesn't mean that the mind is annihilated
All that's annihilated is clinging and attachment
What you have to do is to see what emptiness is like as it actually appears and then not latch onto it
The nature of this emptiness is that it's deathless within you  this emptiness of self  and yet the mind can still function know and read itself
Just don't label it or latch onto it that's all
There are many levels to emptiness many types but if it's this or that type then it's not genuine emptiness for it contains the intention trying to know what type of emptiness it is what features it has
This is something you have to look into deeply if you really want to know
If it's superficial emptiness  the emptiness of the still mind free from thoughtformations about its objects or free from the external sense of self  that's not genuine emptiness
Genuine emptiness lies deep not on the level of mere stillness or concentration
The emptiness of the void is something very profound
But because of the things we've studied and heard we tend to label the emptiness of the still mind as the void  and so we label things wrongly in that emptiness Actually it's just ordinary stillness
We have to look more deeply in
No matter what you've encountered that you've heard about before don't get excited
Don't label it as this or that level of attainment
Otherwise you'll spoil everything
You reach the level where you should be able to keep your awareness steady but once you label things it stops right there  or else goes all out of control
This labeling is attachment in action
It's something very subtle very refined
Whatever appears it latches on
So you simply have to let the mind be empty without labeling it as anything for the emptiness that lets go of preoccupations or is free from the influence of thoughtformations is something you have to look further into
Don't label it as this or that level for to measure and compare things in this way blocks everything  and in particular knowledge of how the mind changes
So to start out simply watch these things simply be aware
If you get excited it ruins everything
Instead of seeing things clear through you don't
You stop there and don't go any further
For this reason when you train the mind or contemplate the mind to the point of gaining clear realizations every now and then regard them as simply things to observe
Once you can read your mind correctly you can catch hold of defilements and kill them off That's insight meditation
The mind becomes razor sharp just as if you have a sharp knife that can cut anything clear through
Even if defilements arise again you can dig them up again cut them off again
It's actually a lot of fun this job of uprooting the defilements in the mind
There's no other work nearly as much fun as getting this sense of I or self under your thumb because you get to see all of its tricks
It's really fun
Whenever it shows its face in order to get anything you just watch it  to see what it wants and why it wants it to see what inflated claims it makes for itself
This way you can crossexamine it and get to the facts
Once you know there's nothing to do but let go to become unentangled and free
Just think of how good that can be
This practice of ours is a way of stopping and preventing all kinds of things inside ourselves
Whenever defilement rises up to get anything to grab hold of anything we don't play along
We let go
Just this is enough to do away with a lot of stress and suffering even though the defilements feel the heat
When we oppress the defilements a lot in this way it gets them hot and feverish you know
But remember it's the defilements that get hot and feverish
And remember that the Buddha told us to put the heat on the defilements because if we don't put the heat on them they put the heat on us all the time
So we must be intent on burning the defilements away even though they may complain that we're mistreating them
We close the door and imprison them
When they can't go anywhere they're sure to complain I can't take it
I'm not free to go anywhere at all So simply watch them Where do they want to go
What do they want to grab hold of
Where
Watch them carefully and they'll stop  stop going stop running
It's easy to say no to other things but saying no to yourself saying no to your defilements isn't easy at all  and yet it doesn't lie beyond your discernment or capabilities to do it
If you have the mindfulness and discernment to say no to defilement it'll stop
Don't think that you can't make it stop
You can make it stop  simply that you've been foolish enough to give in to it so quickly that it's become second nature
So we have to stop
Once we stop the defilements can stop too
Wherever they turn up we can extinguish them
And when this is the case how can we not want to practice
No matter how stubbornly they want anything simply watch them
Get acquainted with them and they won't stay
They'll disband
As soon as they disband you realize exactly how deceptive they are
Before you didn't know
As soon as they urged you to do anything you went along with them
But once you're wise to them they stop
They disband
Even though you don't disband them they disband on their own
And as soon as you see their disbanding the path opens wide before you
Everything opens wide in the heart
You can see that there's a way you can overcome defilement you can put an end to defilement no matter how much it arises
But you've got to remember to keep on watching out for it keep on letting it go
Thus I ask that you all make the effort to keep sharpening your tools at all times
Once your discernment is sharp on any point it can let go of that point and uproot it
If you look after that state of mind and contemplate how to keep it going you'll be able to keep your tools from growing too easily dull
And now that you know the basic principles I ask that you make the effort to the utmost of your strength and mindfulness
May you be brave and resilient so that your practice for gaining release from all your sufferings and stress can reap good results in every way
Those who attended the meditation retreat in November at Pelmadulla Bhikkhu Training Centre Ratnapura District Sri Lanka Have made it possible to print these Dhamma talks given during the retreat
They felt that others too could benefit from them and supported and encouraged this project so that it has now come to fruit
Not only am I thankful for their help with this book but also most appreciative of their presence at the retreat which enabled me to give these talks
Special gratitude is offered to Lasanda Kurukulasuriya who selflessly and lovingly typed and retyped the manuscript
The Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement through their President Dr
Ariyaratne kindly provided us with transport and offered the use of the Centre premises which was another meritorious service in the long list of their humanitarian efforts
As always my friend and Dhamma sister Ayya Nyanasiri has given the last polish and much invaluable advice without which I would probably never have published any books at all
May the merits of this Gift of Dhamma bring much benefit to all
Meditation retreats are a time for introspection
Because they are held in silence except for Dhamma talks and questions the mind becomes more and more used to mindfulness and concentration
This gives added impetus to the hearing of Dhamma so that the truth of the Buddha's teaching can leave a lasting impression
When you open this book dear reader may be you could imagine being in a meditation retreat where nothing else matters except the clarity and wholesomeness of your own mind
This means leaving all daily preoccupations aside and focusing strictly on the wonderful freedom the Buddha's teaching and practice can provide
May you enjoy the following pages and find something useful in them

People are often surprised to find it is difficult to meditate
Outwardly it seems to be such a simple matter to just sit down on a little pillow and watch one's breath
What could be hard about that
The difficulty lies in the fact that one's whole being is totally unprepared
Our mind senses and feelings are used to trade in the market place namely the world we live in
But meditation cannot be done in a market place
That's impossible
There's nothing to buy or trade or arrange in meditation but most people's attitude remains the same as usual and that just doesn't work
We need patience with ourselves
It takes time to change to the point where meditation is actually a state of mind available at any time because the market place is no longer important
The market place doesn't just mean going shopping
It means everything that is done in the world all the connections ideas hopes and memories all the rejections and resistances all our reactions
In meditation there are may be momentary glimpses of seeing that concentration is feasible but it can't be sustained
It constantly slips again and the mind goes right back to where it came from
In order to counteract that one has to have determination to make one's life a meditative one it doesn't mean one has to meditate from morning to night
I don't know anyone who does
And it doesn't mean we cannot fulfill our duties and obligations because they are necessary and primary as long as we have them
But it means that we watch ourselves carefully in all our actions and reactions to make sure that everything happens in the light of the Dhamma  the truth
This applies to the smallest detail such as our food what we listen to or talk about
Only then can the mind be ready with a meditative quality when we sit down on the pillow
It means that no matter where we find ourselves we remain introspective
That doesn't mean we can't talk to others but we watch the content of the discussion
That is not easy to do and the mind often slips off
But we can become aware of the slip
If we aren't even aware that we have digressed from mindfulness and inner watchfulness we aren't on the meditative path yet
If our mind has the Dhamma quality established within then meditation has a good chance
The more we know of the Dhamma the more we can watch whether we comply with its guidelines
There is no blame attached to our inability to do so
But the least we can do is to know the guidelines and know where we're making mistakes
Then we practice to get nearer and nearer to absolute reality until one day we will actually be the Dhamma
There is this difference between one who know and one who practices
The one who knows may understand the words and concepts but the one who practices knows only one thing namely to become that truth
Words are an utilitarian means not only for communication but also to solidify ideas
That's why words can never reveal the truth only personal experience can
We attain our experiences through realizing what's happening within and why it is as it is
This means that we combine watchfulness with inquiry as to why we're thinking saying and reacting the way we do
Unless we use our mind in this way meditation will be an onagain offagain affair and will remain difficult
When meditation doesn't bring joy most people are quite happy to forget about it
Without the meditative mind and experience the Dhamma cannot arise in the heart because the Dhamma is not in words
The Buddha was able to verbalize his inner experience for our benefit to give us a guideline
That means we can find a direction but we have to do the traveling ourselves
To have a meditative mind we need to develop some important inner qualities
We already have their seed within otherwise we couldn't cultivate them
If we want flowers in our garden and there are no seeds we can water and fertilize yet nothing will grow
The watering and fertilizing of the mind is done in meditation
Weeding has to be done in daily living
Weeds always seem to grow better in any garden than the flowers do
It takes a lot of strength to uproot those weeds but it is not so difficult to cut them down
As they get cut down again and again they eventually become feeble and their uprooting is made easy
Cutting down and uprooting the weeds needs sufficient introspection into ourselves to know what is a weed and what is a flower
We have to be very sure because we don't want to pull out all the flowers and leave all the weeds
A garden with many weeds isn't much of an ornament
People's hearts and minds usually contain equal amounts of flowers and weeds
We're born with the three roots of evil greed hate and delusion and the three roots of good generosity lovingkindness and wisdom
Doesn't it make sense to try and get rid of those three roots which are the generators of all problems all our unpleasant experiences and reactions
If we want to eliminate those three roots we have to look at their outcrops
They're the roots underneath the surface but obviously a root sprouts and shows itself above the surface
We can see that within ourselves
Caused by delusion we manifest greed and hate
There are different facets of greed and hate and the simplest and most common one is I like I want I don't like and I don't want Most people think such reactions are perfectly justified and yet that is greed and hate
Our roots have sprouted in so many different ways that we have all sorts of weeds growing
If we look at a garden we will find possibly thirty or forty different types of weeds
We might have that many or more unwholesome thoughts and emotions
They have different appearances and power but they're all coming from the same roots
As we can't get at the roots yet we have to deal with what is above the surface
When we cultivate the good roots they become so mighty and strong that the weeds do not find enough nourishment any more
As long as we allow room for the weeds in our garden we take the nutriment away from the beautiful plants instead of cultivating those more and more
This takes place as a development in daily living which then makes it possible to meditate as a natural outcome of our state of mind
At this point in time we are trying to change our mind from an ordinary one to a meditative one which is difficult if one hasn't practiced very much yet
We only have one mind and carry that around with us to every activity and also to the meditation
If we have an inkling that meditation can bring us peace and happiness then we need to make sure we have a meditative mind already when we sit down
To change it from busyness to quiet at that moment is too difficult
The state of mind which we need to develop for meditation is well described by the Buddha
Two aspects of importance are mindfulness and the calming of the senses
Internal mindfulness may sometimes be exchanged for external mindfulness because under some circumstances that is an essential part of practice
The world impinges upon us which we cannot deny
External mindfulness also means to see a tree for instance in a completely new way
Not with the usual thoughts of that's pretty or I like this one in may garden but rather noticing that there are live and dead leaves that there are growing plants mature ones and dying ones
We can witness the growth birth and decay all around us
We can understand craving very clearly by watching ants mosquitoes dogs
We need not look at them as a nuisance but as teachers
Ants mosquitoes and barking dogs are the kind of teachers who don't leave us alone until the lessons are fully learned
When we see all in the light of birth decay death greed hate and delusion we are looking in a mirror of all life around us then we have Dhamma on show
All of us are proclaiming the truth of Dhamma constantly only we don't pay enough attention
We can use mindfulness to observe that everything in existence consists of the four elements earth fire water air and then check out what is the difference between ourselves and all else
When we take practice seriously and look at all life in such a way then we find the truth all around as well as within us
Nothing else exists
This gives us the ability to leave the marketplace behind where the mind flits from one thing to the next never has a moment's peace is either dull and indifferent or hateful and greedy
But when we look at that which really is we're drawing nearer to what the Buddha taught out of his compassion for all the beings that are roaming around in samsara from one dukkha to the next
He taught so that people like us may awaken to the truth
We should neither believe nor disbelieve what we hear or read but try it out ourselves
If we give our wholehearted attention to this practice we will find that it changes our approach to living and dying
To be wholehearted is a necessity in anything we do
If we get married and are halfhearted about it that cannot be very successful
Halfhearted practice of Dhamma results in chaotic misunderstanding
Wholeheartedness may have at its core devotion and a mind which goes beyond everyday thoughts and activities
Another facet which goes together with mindfulness is clear comprehension
Mindfulness is knowing only without any discriminating faculty
Mindfulness does not evaluate of judge but pays full attention
Clear comprehension has four aspects to it
First What is my purpose in thinking talking or doing Thought speech and action are our three doors
Second Am I using the most skillful means for my purpose That needs wisdom and discrimination
Third Are these means within the Dhamma Knowing the distinction between wholesome and unwholesome
The thought process needs our primary attention because speech and action will follow from it
Sometimes people think that the end justifies the means
It doesn't
Both means and end have to be within the Dhamma
The fourth step is to check whether our purpose has been accomplished and if not why not
If we live with these steps in mind we will slow down which is helpful for our reactions
No inactivity that is not the answer but the meditative quality of the mind which watches over what we are doing
When we use mindfulness and clear comprehension we have to give time to investigate
Checking prevents mistakes
Our wrong thinking creates the danger of making bad kamma and takes us away from the truth into nebulous mindstates
The Dhamma is straight forward simple and pure
It needs a pure mind to stay with it
Otherwise we find ourselves outside of it again and again
External mindfulness can also extend to other people but here we need to be very careful
Seeing and knowing others engenders negative judgment
If we practice external mindfulness towards other people we have to realize that judging others is making bad kamma
We can pay attention with compassion
Peoplewatching is one of the most popular pastimes but usually done with the intention of finding fault
Everyone who's not enlightened has faults even the highly developed nonreturner has yet five fetters to lose
What to say about ordinary worldlings
To use other people as our mirror is very helpful because they reflect our own being
We can only see in others what we already know about ourselves
The rest is lost to us
If we add clear comprehension to our mindfulness and check our purpose and skillful means we will eliminate much grief and worry
We will develop an awareness which will make every day every moment an adventure
Most people feel bogged down and burdened
Either they have too much or too little to do not enough money to do what they like or they frantically move about trying to occupy themselves
Everybody wants to escape from unsatisfactory conditions but the escape mechanism that each one chooses does not provide real inner joy
However with mindfulness and clear comprehension just watching a tree is fascinating
It brings a new dimension to our life a buoyancy of mind enabling us to grasp wholeness instead of the limitations of our family job hopes and dreams
That way we can expand because we're fascinated with what we see around and within us and want to explore further
No my mind my body my tree but just phenomena all around us to provide us with the most fascinating challenging schoolroom that anybody could ever find
Our interest in the schoolroom increases as mindfulness increases
To develop a meditative mind we also need to calm our senses
We don't have to deny our senses that would be foolishness but see them for what they are
Mara the tempter is not a fellow with a long tail and a flaming red tongue but rather our senses
We hardly ever pay attention to what they do to us when they pull us from an interesting sight to a beautiful sound and back to the sight the touch the idea
No Peace
Our constant endeavor is to catch a moment's pleasure
A sense contact has to be very fleeting because otherwise it becomes a great dukkha
Let's say we are offered a very nice meal which tastes extremely good
So we say to our host That's a very nice meal I like it very much The host replies I have lots of food here please stay around and eat for another two or three hours If we did we would not only get sick in body but also disgusted in our mind
A meal can last twenty or at the most thirty minutes
Each taste contact can only last a second then we have to chew and swallow
If we were to keep it in the mouth any longer it would become very unpleasant
Maybe we feel very hot and go to take a cold shower
We say to our friend waiting outside Now I feel good that cold water is very pleasant Our friend says We have plenty of cold water you can have a shower for the next five to six hours Nothing but absolute misery would result
We can enjoy a cold shower for ten or twenty minutes at the most
Anything that is prolonged will create dukkha
All contacts pass quickly because that is their nature
The same goes for sight our eyes are continually blinking
We can't even keep sight constant for the length of time we're looking at anything
We may be looking at a beautiful painting for a little while and really like it
Someone says You can stay here and look at the painting for the next five hours we're not closing the museum yet Nobody could do that
We can't look at the same thing a long time without feeling bored losing all awareness or even falling asleep
Sense contacts are not only limited because of their inability to give satisfaction
They are actually waves that come and go
If we are listening to some lovely music after a few hours the same music becomes unbearable
Our sense contacts are mirroring a reflection of satisfaction which has no real basis in fact
That's Mara constantly leading us astray
There's a pertinent story of a monk in the Buddha's time which relates the ultimate in sense discipline
A married couple had a big row and the woman decided to run away
She put on several of her best saris one over the other wore all her gold jewelry and left
After a while the husband was sorry that he had let her go and followed her
He ran here and there but couldn't find her
Finally he came across a monk who was walking along the street
He asked the monk if he'd seen a woman in a red sari with long black hair and lots of jewelry around her neck and arms
The monk said I saw a set of teeth going by
The monk was not paying attention to the concepts of a woman with long black hair a red sari and lots of jewelry but only to the fact that there was a human being with a set of teeth
He had calmed his senses to the point where the sight object was no longer tempting him into a reaction
An ordinary person at the sight of a beautiful woman with black hair a red sari and lots of jewelry running excitedly along the street might have been tempted to follow her
A set of teeth going by is highly unlikely to create desire
That is calming the senses
If we come upon a snake it's not an object of dislike or destruction but just a sentient being that happens to be around
That's all
There's nothing to be done nothing to react to
If we think of it as a snake that could kill us then of course the mind can go berserk just as the monk's mind could have done if he had thought Oh what a beautiful woman
If we watch our senses again and again this becomes a habit and is no longer difficult
Life will be much more peaceful
The world as we know it consists of so much proliferation
Everywhere are different colors shapes beings and nature's growth
Each species of tree has hundreds of subspecies
Nature proliferates
All of us look different
If we don't guard our senses this proliferation in the world will keep us attracted life after life
There's too much to see do know and react to
Since there is no end to all of that we might as well stop and delve inside of ourselves
A meditative mind is achieved through mindfulness clear comprehension and calming the senses
These three aspects of practice need to be done in everyday life
Peace and harmony will result and our meditation will flourish
The two aspects of our being are mind and body
We have to pay attention to both of them even though meditation is a mind exercise not a body exercise
Some of the most common questions are How am I going to learn to sit How am I not going to have any pain That is only possible through continued application doing it again and again
In the beginning the body just doesn't like sitting crosslegged on the floor
We can use this situation as skillful means
When discomfort arises in the body we learn to pay attention to the mind's reaction and do not move automatically
Everybody in the world is trying to get out of any kind of discomfort with an instinctive immediate reaction
It's not that we're not going to get out of discomfort but in order to make meditation pay off we have to learn to get out of instinctive immediate reactions
It's those that land us in dukkha over and over again
When there is an uncomfortable feeling it is essential to realize what is happening within
We notice that there is a sense contact in this case touch The body is making contact the knees with the pillow the legs with each other several contacts are happening
From all sense contacts feelings arise
There is no way out of that this is how human beings are made
The Buddha taught cause and effect that dependent upon any sense contact feeling results
There are three kinds of feelings pleasant unpleasant and neutral
We can forget about the neutral ones because we are hardly ever aware of them
Neutral is actually considered pleasant because at least it doesn't hurt
From this particular touch contact that is being made through the sitting posture there arises after a while an unpleasant feeling
The immediate reaction is to move
Don't
Investigate
By getting to know our own mind we get to know the world and the universe
All minds contain the seed of enlightenment
Unless we know our own mind we cannot develop and cultivate that seed
here the mind has been contacted with an unpleasant feeling our perception says this is painful Our next step are the mental formations which are also kamma formations because we make kamma through our thought processes
First came the sense contact secondly feeling arose
Then perception naming it followed by dislike
At the moment of dislike there is the running away through changing our position
That is the kamma making aspect
This is minor negative kamma yet it's negative because the mind is in a state of illwill by saying I don't like it
The mind may start all kinds of rationalizations I wish I'd brought my own little chair I can't sit At my age I shouldn't do things like this Meditation is too difficult None of these explanations have any intrinsic validity they are only a mind reacting to an unpleasant feeling
Unless we become acquainted with our mind's reactions we're not using meditation in the most beneficial manner
Knowing the unpleasant feeling we can now try to acquaint ourselves with its true nature
Our whole life is lived according to our feelings
Unless we become aware of our reactions to feelings we remain half asleep
There is a beautiful little book called The Miracle of Being Awake
This miracle is nothing but mindfulness knowing what's going on within
When we have realized we want to get rid of the unpleasant feeling then we can try to disown it for a moment
Only the arahant is fully capable of complete detachment but we can do so for a short time
The unpleasant feeling has arisen without our asking for it and we don't have to believe it to be ours
We can let it be just a feeling
If we do that for a moment we can get back to the meditation subject and have won a victory over our own negative reactions
Otherwise we are letting our unpleasant feelings rule us in whatever way they want
The whole of humanity runs after pleasant feelings and away from unpleasant ones
Unless we at least know that we have no reference point for inner change
It may not be possible to reverse that reaction yet but at least we know it is happening
After we have become aware of our mind's intention we're free to move and change our sitting position
There is nothing wrong with changing one's posture but there's something wrong with instinctive impetuous habits
Meditation means total awareness
Being awake is not the opposite of being asleep it is the opposite of being dull and foggy
Such mind states are mostly due to an unwillingness to look at our own dukkha
We'd rather hide in a fog
In meditation that won't do
The Buddha said that this body is a cancer the body as a whole is a disease and we can experience that when just sitting still it becomes uncomfortable
Meditation means samatha and vipassana calm and insight
Unless we know the limitations of each and also their possibilities we won't be able to make good use of the practice
We are generally applying both of them in every session but we must be able to distinguish between them
If there is no understanding of what's happening in the mind the fog settles down in it
Everybody would like bliss peace and happiness
That is a natural wish
They are available in meditation with a lot of practice and some good kamma
However they are not the goal of meditation
The goal of meditation is insight
Yet skillful means for gaining insight are needed and are found in tranquillity meditation
Making use of a meditation subject the mind after some training will be able to stay on it for a while
Presuming that the mind is able to focus on the breath for even a short time we realize afterwards that some peace arose because the mind was not thinking
The thinking process in everybody's mind is hardly ever profound
It's just thinking
Just as the body breathes so the mind keeps churning
And it keeps churning out mostly irrelevant unsubstantial and unimportant details without which we would be much happier
The mind in its original form is pure
It's clear and lucid luminous pliable and expandable
Our thinking is the impurity and the blockage
There's hardly a person who doesn't think all day long probably without even being aware of it
But when we start meditating we do become aware of our inner restlessness
We realize we can't keep the mind on the meditation subject because we are thinking instead of meditating
The moment we experience our thinking habit we accomplish two things
We become aware of our mind's activity and also the content of our thoughts
We will realize immediately that our thinking is irrelevant and makes little or no sense
Because of that we can let go of it fairly easily and return to the meditation subject
We have to be able to stand back and watch the thinking process and not get involved in it
Otherwise we'll just keep on thinking instead of meditating
The mind is the greatest and most delicate tool existing in the universe
All of us have it but few look after it properly
Practically everybody is interested in looking after their bodies
Eating sleeping washing exercising seeing the doctor when the body is sick cutting hair nails filling teeth doing everything that's necessary to keep the body functioning well
In reality the body is the servant and the mind is the master
So we are looking after the servant and forgetting the master
If we do that in our homes we create chaos
That's one of the reasons why the world looks as chaotic as it does
People kill each other steal from each other are unfaithful lie gossip and slander
Most have absolutely no ideas that the mind is our most precious asset
It gives us wealth beyond compare and yet we don't know how to look after it
We have to do exactly the same thing for the mind as we do for the body
We need to give it a rest
Imagine if we didn't go to sleep for three or four days how would we feel
Without energy without strength pretty terrible
The body needs a rest but the mind does too
During the day it thinks at night it dreams
It's always busy
The only real rest it can ever get which energizes and gives the needed boost to become clear and lucid is to stay on the meditation subject
The mind needs a cleanup which means purification
This happens when all thinking is stopped for a while because of onepointed concentration
One moment of concentration is one moment of purification
At that time the mind cannot contain illwill or sensual desire or any other negativity
When the concentration ceases the mind reverts to its usual behavior again
In meditation we can experience that a purified mind gives us happiness and quite naturally we will try to keep that purification process going also in daily living
The mind needs the kind of exercise that is not geared towards winning or achieving anything but just to obey
When we ask the mind to stay on the meditation subject yet it runs away from it we know immediately that we are not the master of our mind but that the mind does what it pleases
When we have realized that we will be less likely to believe our own views and opinions particularly when they are unwholesome because we understand that the mind is simply thinking habitually
Only through the meditation process can we become aware of that
The mind also requires the right kind of food
Because in meditation we can reach states of higher consciousness we are thereby able to nourish the mind in a way which cannot happen in the ordinary thinking process
Tranquillity meditation leads the mind into realms which are totally unavailable to us otherwise
Happiness and peacefulness arise without dependence on outer conditions which give us a new freedom
The mind of every human being contains the seed of Nibbana
We need training in order to realize what is obscuring our vision
Then the seed can be cultivated and nurtured to full growth
Because our minds contain such a potential they also contain the peace and happiness which everybody wants
Most people try to find fulfillment through acquiring material objects seeing or touching eating or knowing them
Particularly having more and keeping it all safe
This dependency is a guarantee for dukkha
As long as we depend on outer conditions whether people experiences countries religions wealth or fame we are in constant fear of losing our footing because everything changes and vanishes
The only way we can have real peace and happiness is by being independent of all around us
That means gaining access to the purity of our mind without thinking which involves staying on our meditation subject long enough for our consciousness to change
The thinking consciousness is the consciousness we all know
It contains constant ups and downs either liking or disliking wanting something in the future or regretting something about the past hoping for better days or remembering worse ones
It is always anxious and cannot be expected to be totally peaceful
We are familiar with a different consciousness also for instance when we love someone very much
That emotion changes our consciousness to where we are only giving from the heart
We know a different consciousness when we are involved with religious activities with faith and confidence aroused
We are giving ourselves to an ideal
None of that lasts through and all depends upon outer conditions
Through meditation we can change our consciousness to an awareness of purity within which all of us have only obscured through thinking
At that time we realize that such an independent peace and happiness are only possible when the me and mine are forgotten for a moment when I want to be happy is eliminated
It is impossible to have peace when thinking about self This will be our first inkling of what the Buddha meant when he said nonself is the way out of dukkha
Because it is difficult for the mind to stay on the meditation subject we have to use everything that arises for insight
Eventually the mind becomes clear and sharp and is no longer bothered by the outer manifestations that touch upon it such as sound and thought which are the most common ones
Finally a depth of concentration is reached
When unpleasant feelings arise let us use them for insight
We didn't ask for the feelings why are they ours
They are certainly changeable they get worse or better they move their position and they give us a very good indication that the body is dukkha
The body isn't doing anything except sitting and yet we have dukkha for the simple reason of not liking the feeling as it is
When we use the unpleasant feeling to actually realize the first and second noble truths we've come nearer to the Dhamma in our hearts
The first noble truth being the noble truth of dukkha the second being the reason for dukkha namely craving
In this case we're craving to get rid of the unpleasant feelings
If we were totally accepting of the feeling not making any value judgments there would be no dukkha
We can try letting go of this craving for a moment anyone with some strength of mind can do that
Just accepting the feeling as it is not disliking it
Then there's no dukkha for just that moment
That will be a profound insight experience because it will show without the shadow of a doubt that if we drop our desires dukkha disappears
Naturally when the body feels uncomfortable it's difficult to drop the craving to get rid of that discomfort
But anybody can do it for just one moment and it's an essential and indepth experience of the Dhamma
When we are able to step back to observe our thought processes we realize that the mind is continually thinking
It may take from  minutes to become aware of that for someone who hasn't practiced meditation previously
For an experienced meditator it may only take a second or two
Next we can see what kind of thinking we are indulging in and the more often we see it the less enraptured we'll be with it
We become aware of the fact that this is the way the human mind acts not just ours but everybody's and we'll know the truth about the mind
There is nothing else to be seen except that
When we observe that the thinking goes on and that it is insignificant it will be so much easier to let go
We also see how very fleeting thoughts are how they come and go all the time
We'll know from experience then that no real happiness is to be found in something so shortlived yet the whole world is trying to achieve happiness that way
We can't even remember what we thought a moment ago how can that bring happiness
Such insights make it possible to drop the distractions and get back to the meditation subject
We are using the two approaches of calm and insight in conjunction with each other
When calm is firmly established insight arises spontaneously
It's important to realize that calm meditation is essential
If isn't as if some people like it and others don't
If the ocean has high waves and we want to look beneath the surface to see what can be found there we can't recognize anything at all while the waves are rising
There is too much movement all is stirred up and nothing is to be seen
When the waves subside and the ocean surface becomes calm and transparent then we can look underneath the surface of the water and see sand coral and multicolored fish
It's the same in the mind
When the mind has all the waves and motions of thinking that churning in the mind makes it impossible to see absolute reality
On the contrary the mind refuses to look beyond ordinary knowing
But when the mind becomes totally calm then there is no value judgment and we can see easily what lies underneath the surface
In order to understand the Buddha's teaching we have to get below the surface otherwise our insights will be superficial
The calm mind is the means for delving below relative reality
While we are trying to become calm at the same time we're objectively examining all that arises so that there is more and more support for letting go of the thinking
The less we believe in our thoughts the less we expect of them and the happier we will be to let them go
Then we get an inkling of what inner peace and happiness mean
These inner feelings are most pronounced in meditation but can be carried into daily living in a milder form primarily because the mind knows it can always return to peace and happiness in meditation without having to depend on any situation or any person
Worldly affairs no longer have the former sting in them they are just happening that's all the same as thinking and feeling are arising and ceasing without an owner or a maker
It is important to experience and not to believe
In order to do that we have to pay attention
In the famous and often quoted Kalama Sutta the Buddha gives ten points which are not suitable as criteria to follow a teacher or a spiritual path
All of them have to do with a belief system because of traditional lineage or because of sacred books
Not to believe but to find out for ourselves is the often repeated injunction of the Buddha
Unless we do that we cannot have an inner vision which is the first step that takes us on to the noble path
An inner vision is an understood experience
Without that insight cannot arise
That holds true for small matters in daily life just as it holds true for the deepest and most profound understanding of the Buddha's teaching
If for instance somebody is not pleased with us and we don't understand why we shall have that same disharmony happen to us over and over again
We need to realize that we may have said or done something to cause that displeasure
This is a small matter showing the need for understanding an experience
If we think these happenings are something outside of ourselves we can't change our attitudes
Practicing Dhamma means constantly changing ourselves to reach out towards the sublime
If change were not possible the Buddha would have given a lifetime of teaching in vain
Unless we pay total attention to every detail we'll never change towards the sublime
Attention to detail is the core of mindfulness
Most people lack the practice and also the instructions to be truly mindful
It's one thing to read about it but an entirely different matter to do it
Mindfulness is the essence of understanding because without it there is no seeing into the heart of any phenomena
Watching the breath means knowing exactly Mindfulness is not judgmental nor discriminating nor telling stories
Mindfulness knows when there is concentration and when there isn't when the mind wanders off and when the mind becomes peaceful
Perfect mindfulness knows every moment that is occurring
When we pay attention to our feelings and do not react to them but only observe then we're using the second foundation of mindfulness vedananupassana
When we know we're thinking it's cittanupassana and when we know what the content of the thought is it's dhammanupassana
If we're not paying attention we're not really awake
We need to practice clear attention to any one of these at all times
It is possible that in meditation the mind becomes concentrated
If there is a feeling of peacefulness one has to know that quite clearly
Without realizing what is happening one cannot go further because one doesn't know where one is at
This is an important detail of meditation knowing exactly what's happening and being able to verbalize it after the occurrence
The verbalization is the understood experience and occurs naturally after the experience
This holds true for any mindstate and for any feeling
The Dhamma is the Buddha's verbalized experience
Unless we can do that with our own experiences we are left with a belief system which can dull the mind
But meditation is to sharpen the mind
The mindful mind is a sharpened axe with a sharp and finely honed blade which can cut through all our illusions
When we sit in meditation we can get to know the disturbances of our own mind such as the dull mind that doesn't know what's going on or the sleepy mind the distracted or the resisting mind that doesn't want to obey
That is mindfulness of mind objects
Like most human beings we have a distracted mind geared so much towards trying to resist the unpleasant and crave the pleasant that this pattern is very difficult to change
If we find ourselves resisting the unpleasant seeking the pleasant we just know that this is a normal habit pattern
This is how this little spaceship earth operates and how our economy works
Do you know anybody who's blissfully happy because of it
It is an impossible venture it is a guaranteed failure yet everybody is still trying
We have all been trying long enough we can give it up at least for the time we're meditation
However it is possible to get rid of dukkha but not by eliminating the unpleasant sensations only by getting rid of our reaction to them
This is the most important primary entrance into the spiritual path
Unless this is perfectly understood the rest will not fall into place
We won't get rid of the unpleasantness of sitting or of mosquitoes or of anything unpleasant we may encounter
All is mindmade and therefore mindreacted
Dukkha disappears when our reactions disappear
Unless we know that we are the creators of our own dukkha Dhamma remains a mystery
We start practicing when we no longer blame our surroundings other people the political situation the economy or the weather
We see only our own reactions
Naturally our reactions aren't immediately going to be all favorable and wholesome
That will take a while
But at least we can start doing something about ourselves
Mindfulness needs to be used not only in our meditation practice but also every time we move feel or think in our daily life
While awake mindfulness has to be our primary objective
One has to come to terms with oneself
Only then will the world make sense one day
The universe is this mind and body
We find out what this mind and body are all about and we will know the universe and its underlying truth
All is distinctively the same but we have to know what it is
When we come out of meditation we should be aware of opening our eyes moving our body of everything we are doing
Why
First of all it will keep us from thinking unwholesome negative thoughts
It facilitates meditation
The mind needs to be kept in check and not allowed to run wild
The ordinary unpracticed mind is like a wild bull running around in a garden
It can make a mess of the garden in no time
That's what our minds are doing
They're making an awful mess of this world we live in
We don't even have to read the newspapers to know about it
It's to be seen everywhere and comes from our own minds
All of us are included except the enlightened ones
A wild mind can't meditate
It has to be caught kept in check and a halter put on
Every time it runs away we bring it back with mindfulness like training a wild horse which in its wild state cannot benefit anyone
If the horse is tamed and trained it can be extremely useful
How much more this is true of the mind
Mindfulness of the body means that we know the movements of all parts
As we watch ourselves we will see that there is mind and body
The mind giving the orders the body following suit
We can recognize too that sometimes the body can't obey because it is weak
This is our first entrance into insight realizing there are mind and body and the mind being the more important one
The difference between a trained and an untrained person is the understood experience
Mindfulness which extends to the body movements extends to the other aspects of mindfulness as well
If for instance we are thinking about the future we are no longer paying attention to the body instead we can pay attention to the thought process
We know that we are thinking and are making kamma
The thoughts are the mental formations as well as the kamma formations
We are the owners of our kamma
Whatever we think that we will be
It's an impersonal process which has nothing to do with any particular entity
Then we can become aware of the content of our thoughts which means knowing whether it is wholesome or not
We can learn to drop any negative thinking and replace it
This is where our meditation training comes in which is not divorced from outer activities
When we pay attention to the breath in meditation and a thought intervenes we learn to let go of the thought and come back to the breath
The same procedure is used in daily life to let go of unwholesome thoughts
We substitute at that time with a wholesome thought just as we substitute with the breath in meditation
Mindfulness of the thinking process is what the Buddha Named the four supreme efforts They constitute the heart of the purification process
The spiritual path is the path of purification and hinges on mindfulness
There's only one way for the purification of beings for the overcoming of dukkha for the final elimination of pain grief and lamentation for entering the noble path for realizing Nibbana that's mindfulness
To practice the purification process is necessary not only for one's own peace of mind for adding to the peace in the world but also in order to be able to meditate
The hope that one might sit down on a pillow watch the breath and become concentrated is a myth
One has to have the mind in proper shape for it
Therefore we must practice these four supreme efforts not only while we are meditating but in everyday life
We will gain inner peace which everybody is looking for and very few people ever find
The first effort is not to let an unwholesome thought arise which has not yet arisen
The requires sharp mindfulness
A thought which has not yet arisen creates waves ahead of it
To realize that these waves are boding no good needs much attention and practice
The second effort not to continue an unwholesome thought which has already arisen can be done by anyone of good will if it is understood that there is nobody else to blame
Unwholesome thinking is not due to outer triggers but results strictly from our own defilements
The third step is to make a wholesome thought arise which has not yet arisen
This means that we continually watch over our mind and encourage positive wholesome thoughts where none are present even under the most trying circumstances
Finally to make a wholesome thought which has already arisen continue
In the meditation practice this concerns our meditation subject
But in daily life it means our mind's reaction
If we have some sensitivity towards ourselves we can feel that there is a disturbance within when unwholesome thinking arises a feeling of resistance
Unwholesome thoughts have been thought of so often for so many years that they have become part and parcel of our thinking process
It takes mindfulness and determination to let go
In meditation we become aware that our unwholesome thoughts are not caused by someone or something external
Then we gain the power of mind to drop what we don't want to keep and substitute with what is useful for us
These four supreme efforts are the fourth foundation of mindfulness concerned with the contents of our thoughts
If everybody in the world were practicing this it would be a better world to live in
Our inner being manifests in feeling which arises through our sense contacts
Thinking is also a sense contact
Unwholesome thinking produces unpleasant feelings such as being ill at ease or unhappy
Seeing hearing tasting touching smelling are the five outer senses
Thinking is the inner one
All of them make contact and produce a feeling
There is the eye and the eye object
When both are in good condition the eye consciousness arises and seeing results
The sense base the sense object and the sense consciousness meet
When we know how this being which we call me operates we can stop the preprogrammed printout that's always answering the same way
It is quite possible to predict how a person will react to any given stimulus because we have a program which has never been interrupted yet
To discontinue it we first have to know that there is a program and what it consists of
For instance we have the hearing base which is the ear drum then there is sound
When the hearing consciousness arises because both base and object are present hearing results and from that a feeling arises
The ear can only hear sound the eye can only see form and color
The mind does all the explaining
Everybody has a slightly different explanation so that nobody sees or hears anything alike
When one man sees a woman and sees her form and color the mind says isn't she beautiful I must marry her When I see that same woman I don't think anything like that
Yet everyone tries to convince the people around them that what they themselves are seeing and hearing is correct
Because they often can't convince others they start shooting or persecuting them
Thinking is also a sense contact
There is the brain base and there are ideas
The mind consciousness arises contacting the idea and thinking starts
From that a feeling results
If we think we love every being whether we actually can do it or not we certainly get a warm pleasant feeling from the thought
By the same token if we think we hate a person we get a cold and distant feeling
Now comes the reaction to the feeling which is either wantingcraving or not wantingrejecting
By being attentive to ourselves we can experience that quite clearly
The reaction to the feeling is our renewed entry into duality and dukkha
At the same time it provides us with the doorway out of all difficulties
If for once we don't react but know a feeling just as a feeling if we can do that mindfulness has been established
We also gain the confidence that we can do it again and are actually practicing spiritual purification
That is an important inner conviction
The Buddha said we need both study and practice
It helps us to know something of what the Buddha taught
But if we don't practice then we are only parrots or hypocrites proclaiming something we have no personal experience with
Through our practice of mindfulness we become aware of the feelings which arise when we make sense contacts
Feelings happen all the time and need to be recognized so that we can change our instinctive way of living to a deliberate way of being alive
Instinctively we are a constant reactor
Deliberately we become an actor
Probably the most important lesson we can learn is to keep our mindfulness going in our everyday activities
We can practice wherever we are at home marketing in the office writing letters telephoning any time at all
The meditation itself gives us the impetus showing how awareness removes the obstacles inherent in our viewpoints
We cannot see the whole only parts
We see what is around us but we never see beyond that
With mindfulness comes an opening where everything seems to fall into place and has an interconnection
We lose our exaggerated sense of selfimportance and can unite more with all manifestations
All these are still side issues
Mindfulness means knowing
As we know and really experience we can prove eventually the four noble truths to ourselves
Then our work is completed
Mindfulness has as one of its factors the ability to be one pointed
We do not become foggy or distracted but can keep the mind in its place
We have to realize that mind obstructions are a human calamity and not a personal one
This understanding helps us to patiently endure and gradually change
We can notice fairly easily what our mind does
It reflects and reacts and it often has fantasies and also moods
Anyone who doesn't meditate will believe in all of that
Even those who do meditate might still believe in the reactions of their own mind to the outer stimuli or might believe the moods which come into the mind are to be taken seriously that whatever the mind is doing is due to an outside occurrence and not to an inner reaction
This is easily seen if we watch our thinking process not only in meditation but in daily living
The Buddha gave very exact instructions how to counteract any unskillful mind states and produce skillful ones
They can briefly be expressed as avoiding overcoming developing and maintaining and are called the four supreme efforts which have been briefly mentioned before
They are part of the factors of enlightenment so must be part of our practice
When perfected they are part of the enlightenment process
You may have heard the expression Nibbana and Samsara are both in the same place It is not a true saying because there is no such place But Nibbana liberation emancipation enlightenment and Samsara the round of birth and death how can they be together
In a way they can because they are both in the mind in everybody's mind
Except that everyone is only aware of one of them namely that which makes us continue in the round of birth and death not only when this body disappears and it is called death or when a body reappears and it is called birth
But there is constant birth and death in our every moment of existence
There is the birth of skillful and unskillful thoughts and the dying away of them
There is the birth of feelings pleasant unpleasant or neutral and the dying away of them
There is the birth of the arising of this body and its dying away moment after moment except that we are not mindful enough to become aware of that
We can see this quite clearly when we look at a photo of ourselves taken or years ago
We look entirely different from what we see in the mirror now
But it doesn't follow that a body takes a leap of years and then changes itself suddenly
It has changed moment by moment until after a longer timespan it is finally noticeable to us
With more mindfulness we could have known it all along because there is constant birth and death in the body the same as with thoughts and feelings
This is Samsara the round of birth and death within us due to our craving to keep or renew what we think is me When there is liberation that craving ceases whatever dies is left to die
Although we have the potential for liberation our awareness is not able to reach it because we are concerned with what we already know
We are habitformed and habitprone and every meditator becomes aware of the mind habits with their old and tried reactions to outside triggers
They have not necessarily been useful in the past but they are still repeated out of habit
The same applies to our moods which are arising and passing away and have no other significance than a cloud has in the sky which only denotes the kind of weather there is without any universal truth to that
Our moods only denote the kind of weather our mind is fabricating if it believes the mood
The four supreme efforts are in the first place the avoiding of unwholesome unskillful thought processes
If we look at them as unskillful we can accept the fact of learning a new skill more easily
Avoiding means we do not let certain thoughts arise neither reactions to moods nor to outside triggers
If we find ourselves habitually reacting in the same way to the same kind of situation we may be forced to avoid such situations so that we can finally gain the insight which needs to be culled from it
While we are reacting to a situation or mood we can't assess it dispassionately because our reactions overpowers the mind
Avoiding in a Dhamma sense means to avoid the unskillful thought in a practical sense we may have to avoid whatever arouses such mind states in us
That however must not go to the length of running away as the slightest provocation which is a well known yet unsuccessful method of getting out of unpleasant reactions
Habitually running away from situations which create unwholesome reactions in us will not bring about a peaceful mind
Only if there is one particular trigger which arouses unskillful responses in us over and over again we may have to move away from it without blaming anyone
We just realize that we have not yet been able to master ourselves under certain circumstances
Just as we don't blame the unpleasant feeling anywhere in the body but realize that we haven't mastered our nonreaction to dukkha yet and therefore must change our posture
It amounts to exactly the same thing
One is a physical move the other is a mental one
All it means is that we haven't quite mastered a particular situation yet
It brings us to the realization that there is still more to be learned about ourselves
Blaming anything in our outside of ourselves is useless it only aggravates the situation and adds more unwholesome thinking to it
In order to avoid unskillful reactions in the mind we have to be attentive and know the way our mind works before we verbalize
We can learn about that in meditation
Awareness is the prime mover in meditation
It isn't viable or useful to have calm and peaceful mind states without being completely aware of how we attained them remained in them and came out of them
Having learned this through our meditative practice enables us to realize how our mind works in daily life before it says anything such as possibly I can't stand this situation or I hate this person When that happens an unwholesome state has already been established
Before the mind is allowed to fall into this trap a dense and unpleasant feeling can be noticed which acts as a warning that an unwholesome mind state is approaching which can be dropped before it has even established itself
It is much easier to let go before the negativity has taken hold but it is harder to recognize
When we notice that a mind state is approaching which does not seem to be accompanied by peace and happiness we can be sure it will be unwholesome
The more we train ourselves to be mindful of our mind states the more we realize the unhappiness we cause ourselves and others through unskillful thinking
When we have not been able to avoid an unwholesome mind we have to practice to overcome it
Because of the difficulty of becoming aware in time to avoid negativities we have to be very clear on how to overcome them
Dropping a thought is an action and not a passive reaction yet it is difficult to do because the mind needs something to grasp
In meditation we need a subject such as the breath or the feelingssensations to hold onto before the mind can become calm and peaceful
When we want to overcome unskillful mind states it is easier to substitute with wholesome thinking than just trying to let go of unwholesomeness
If we entertain the negative mind states for any length of time they become more and more at home
As they make themselves comfortable we are more and more inclined to believe them and finally come out with thoughts such as I always hate people who don't agree with me or I always get nervous about thunder These statements are designed to show one's own unchanging character giving our ego an extra boost
The only reason these states might have become ingrained in our character is that having entertained negativities for so long one can no longer imagine to be without them
Yet these are nothing but unskillful mind states which can and need to be changed
The quicker we substitute the better it is for our own peace of mind
If we have dislike or rejection concerning a person we may remember something good about that person and be able to substitute the negative thought with something concretely positive
Everyone is endowed with both qualities good and evil and if we pick on the negative then we will constantly be confronted with that aspect rather than the opposite
With some people this will be more difficult that with others
They are our tests so to say
Nobody gets away in this life without such tests
Life is an adult education class with frequent examinations which are being thrown at us at any time
We are not told in advance what is in store for us so we should be prepared all the time
As we learn the skill of substitution and do it successfully once we gain confidence in our own ability
There is no reason when why we cannot repeat this whenever needed
The relief we feel is all the incentive we need for practice
When we are confronted with situations which we find difficult to handle we can remember that we are faced with a learning experience
Overcoming unwholesome mind states needs mind power which we develop through our meditation practice
If we are not yet able to keep our attention in meditation where we want it to be we will not be able yet to change our mind when we want to do so
The more skill we develop in meditation the easier it will be for us to either avoid or overcome By the same token as we practice substitution in daily living we assist our meditation
When we realize that our mind is not a solid entity which has to react in certain ways but is a movable changeable phenomenon which can be clear and illuminated then we will more and more try to protect it from unwholesomeness
It is often a revelation to a new meditator to find out that the mind is not a fixed and believable reactor but can be influenced and changed at will
To develop wholesome states of mind means that we try to cultivate these when they have not arisen yet
If the mind is neutrally engaged or has a tendency to weigh judge and criticize feel hurt or be egocentered we deliberately counteract these tendencies to develop skillful mind states
We acknowledge that all negative states are not conducive to our own happiness peace and harmony
When we develop lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity we experience that these states are conducive to our own inner wellbeing
Obviously we will then try again and again to cultivate the mind states which result in personal contentment
Developing them from that understanding alone that the wholesome states are good for us is a powerful insight
When our mind is at peace we realize that while there are innumerable unwholesome situations in the world if we have an unwholesome reaction to them that only doubles the dukkha
It will neither relieve the situation nor be helpful to anyone
If we develop a capacity for seeing the positive and using whatever arises as a learning situation trying to keep the four supreme emotions mentioned above in mind then there remains only the last effort namely to maintain skillful mind states
Anyone who has not reached full liberation from all underlying tendencies will not be able to maintain positive states at all times but our mindfulness can be sharp enough to tell us when we are not succeeding
That is the awareness we need to effect changes
When we are not able to maintain wholesomeness we can always try again
Should we start blaming ourselves or others however we are adding a second negative state of mind and are blocking our progress
A skill can be learned
We have all learned many skills in this life
This is the sort of ability well worth cultivating more important than proficiencies
This is not a character trait we either possess or lack
Everybody's mind is capable of developing the wholesome and letting go of the unwholesome
But that also doesn't mean that we find everything wonderful and beautiful from now on
That too is not realistic
That which can be practiced is that although there is unwholesomeness within and without dislike is not an effective reaction to bring peace and happiness
The pinnacle of all emotional states is equanimity evenmindedness which is developed through our meditation practice and based on insight
It is our tool in daily living to develop and maintain wholesome mind states
It is neither useful to suppress nor to pretend by thinking I ought to be or I should be Only awareness of what is happening in our mind and learning the skill of changing our mind is called for
Eventually our mind will be a finely tuned instrument the only one in the whole of the universe that can liberate us from all dukkha
All of us have that instrument and the guidelines of the Buddha teach us the skill to use this instrument to the best advantage not to believe its moods and reactions to outer stimuli but to watch and protect it and realize its potential for complete liberation
If we want a good tool we need to look after it in the best possible manner
This means not letting any dirt particles accumulate but to clean it up as quickly as possible
The same criterion applies to our mind
This is probably the hardest skill to learn which is the reason so few people do it
but a meditator is on the right path towards just that by realizing that the mind cannot be believed implicitly being much too fanciful and fleeting
The four supreme efforts are called supreme not only because they are supremely difficult but also supremely beneficial
A serious meditator wants to transcend the human realm while still in human form and these efforts are our challenge
They are so well explained by the Buddha that we can clearly see the difficulties we are faced with and the reasons why we are still roaming about in Samsara
But we don't have to continue that unendingly
Knowing the path and the way to tread upon it we have the opportunity to become free of all fetters
Just as we're capable of changing the body at will the same applies to the mind
Changing the body can occur when we eat less and get thin eat more and get fat drink too much alcohol and spoil our liver smoke too much and sicken our lungs
We can exercise to get muscles or train to run fast or jump high or to become very efficient at tennis or cricket
The body is able to do many things which ordinary people usually cannot do because they haven't trained for that
We know for example of people who can jump two or three times further than is common or run ten times faster than anyone else
We may have seen people doing stunts with their bodies which look miraculous
There are also people who can use their minds in seemingly miraculous ways which are really just due to training
Meditation is the only training there is for the mind
Physical training is usually connected with physical discipline
The mind needs mental discipline practice in meditation
First we can change our mind from unwholesome to wholesome thinking
Just like a person who wants to be an athlete has to start at the beginning of body training the same needs to be done for mind training
First we cope with the ordinary later with the extraordinary
The recollection of our own death brings us the realization that all that is happening will be finished very soon because all of us are going to die
Even though we may not know the exact date it is guaranteed to happen
With the death contemplation in mind it doesn't matter so much any more what goes on around us since all is only important for a very limited time
We may be able to see that only our kammamaking matters doing the best we can every single day every single moment
Helping others takes pride of place
There is no substitute for that
Someone else can benefit from our skills and possessions since we cannot keep them and cannot take them with us
We might as well give all away as quickly as possible
One of the laws of the universe is the more one gives away the more one gets
Nobody believes it that's why everyone is trying to make more money and own more things yet it is a law of cause and effect
If we would believe it and act accordingly we would soon find out
However it will only be effective if the giving is done in purity
We can give our time our caring our concern for others' wellbeing
We have the immediate benefit of happiness in our own heart when we see the joy we have given to someone else
This is about the only satisfaction we can expect in this life which is of a nature that does not disappear quickly because we can recollect the deed and our own happiness
If we really believe in our impending death not just use the words our attitude towards people and situations changes completely
We are no longer the same person then
The one we have been until now hasn't brought us complete satisfaction contentment and peacefulness
We might as well become a different person with a new outlook
We no longer try to make anything last because we know the temporary nature of our involvement
Consequently nothing has the same significance anymore
It could be compared to inviting people to our home for a meal
We are worried and anxious whether the food will taste just right whether all the comforts are there and nothing missing
The house should be immaculate for the guests
While they're visiting we are extremely concerned that they're getting everything they could possibly want
Afterwards we are concerned whether they like it at our house were happy there are going to tell other friends that it was a pleasant visit
These are our attitudes because we own the place
If we are a guest we don't care what food is being served because that's up to the hostess
We don't worry whether everything is in applepie order because it's not our house
This body is not our house no matter how long we live
It's a temporary arrangement of no significance
Nothing belongs to us we're guests here
Maybe we'll be present for another week or year or ten or twenty years
But being a guest what can it matter how everything works
The only thing we can do when we are guest in someone's house is trying to be pleasant and helpful to the people we're with
All else is totally insignificant otherwise our consciousness will remain in the marketplace
Doesn't it only matter to elevate our consciousness and awareness to where we can see beyond our immediate concerns
There is always the same thing going on getting up eating breakfast washing dressing thinking and planning cooking buying things talking to people going to work going to bed getting up over and over again
Is that enough for a lifetime
All of us are trying to find something within that daily grind which will give us joy
But nothing lasts and moreover all are connected with reaching out to get something
If we were to remember each morning that death is certain but now have another day to live gratitude and determination can arise to do something useful with that day
Our second recollection may concern how to change our mind from enmity hurtfulness and unhappiness to their opposites
Repeated remembering makes it possible to change the mind gradually
The body doesn't change overnight to become athletic and neither does the mind change instantly
But if we don't continually train it it's just going to stay the same it has always been which is not conductive to a harmonious and peaceful life
Most people find a lot of unpleasantness anxiety and fear in their lives
Fear is a human condition based on our ego delusion
We are afraid that our ego will be destroyed and annihilated
This willingness to change our mind should make it possible to live each day meaningfully which is the difference between just being alive and living
We would do at least one thing each day which either entails spiritual growth for ourselves or helpfulness and consideration for others preferably both
If we add one meaningful day to the next we wind up with a meaningful life
Otherwise we have an egocentric life which can never be satisfying
If we forget about our own desires and rejections and are just concerned with spiritual growth and eventual emancipation and being helpful to other people then our dukkha is greatly reduced
It reaches a point where it is only the underlying movement in all of existence and no longer personal suffering and unhappiness
As long as we suffer and are unhappy our lives are not very useful
Having grief pain and lamentation does not mean we are very sensitive but rather that we haven't been able to find a solution
We spend hours and hours buying food preparing it eating it washing up afterwards and thinking about the next meal
Twenty minutes of recollection on how we should live should not be taxing our time
Naturally we can also spend much more time on such contemplations which are a way to give the mind a new direction
Without training the mind is heavy and not very skillful but when we give the mind a new direction then we learn to protect our own happiness
This is not connected with getting what we want and getting rid of what we don't want
It's a skill in the mind to realize what is helpful and happiness producing
This new direction which arises from contemplation can be put into action
What can we actually do
We have all heard far too many words which sound right but words alone won't accomplish anything
There has to be an underlying realization that these words require mental or physical action
The Buddha mentioned that if we hear a Dhamma discourse and have confidence in its truth first we must remember the words
Then we can see whether we are able to do what is required of us
If we contemplate to be free of enmity we can recollect such a determination again and again
Now comes the next step How can we actualize that
When going about our daily life we have to be very attentive whether any enmity is arising and if so to substitute with love and compassion
That is the training of the mind
The mind doesn't feel so burdened then so bogged down in its own predetermined course because we realize change is possible
When the mind feels lighter and clearer it can expand
Activating the teachings of the Buddha changes the awareness of the mind so that the everyday ordinary activities are no longer so significant
They are seen to be necessary to keep the body alive and the mind interested in the manifold proliferations that exist in the world
The realization arises that if we have been able to change our mind even that much there may be more to the universe than we have ever been able to touch upon with the ordinary mind
The determination may come to make the mind extraordinary
Just as in an athlete enormous feats of balance discipline and strength of the body are possible just so it is feasible for the mind
The Buddha talked about expanded awareness as a result of proper concentration time and time again
Right concentration means a change of consciousness because we are then not connected to the usual relative knowing
Being able to change our mind's direction we are no longer so enmeshed in the ordinary affairs but know that there must be more
Through having been disciplined strengthened and balanced a mind can perform feats of mental awareness which seem quite extraordinary but are just a result of training
It means getting out of the mental rut
If we have a wet driveway and drive a truck over it time and time again the ruts get deeper and deeper and in the end the truck may be stuck fast
Such are our habitual responses that we have in our everyday affairs
Practicing meditation lifts us out of those ruts because the mind gets a new dimension
Contemplation and resulting action make a new pathway in our lives where the old ruts are left behind Those were a constant reaction to our sense stimuli of hearing seeing smelling tasting touching and thinking
It's a great pity to use a good human life just to be a reactor
It is much more useful and helpful to become an actor which means deliberate thinking saying and doing
It is possible to eventually have the kind of concentration where the meditation subject is no longer needed
The meditation subject is nothing but a key or we can also call it a hook to hang the mind on so that it will not attend to worldly affairs
When concentration has arisen it can be likened to the key having finally found the keyhole and the door being unlocked
When we unlock the door of true samadhi we find a house with eight rooms which are the eight meditative absorptions
Having been able to enter the first room there is no reason why with practice determination and diligence we cannot gradually enter into all of them
Here the mind actually lets go of the thinking process as we know it and reverts to a state of experiencing
The first thing that happens when concentration has come together is a sense of well being
Unfortunately there is a mistaken view prevalent that the meditative absorptions are neither possible nor necessary
This view is contrary to the Buddha's teaching
Any instructions he has ever given for the pathway to liberation always included the meditative absorptions
They are the eight steps on the noble eightfold path
It is also incorrect to believe that it is no longer possible to attain true concentration many people do so without even realizing it and need support and direction to further their efforts
Meditation needs to include the meditative absorptions because they are the expansion of consciousness providing access to a totally different universe than we have ever realized
The mental states that arise through the meditative absorptions make it possible to live one's daily life with a sense of what is significant and what is not
Having seen for instance that it is possible to grow large trees one no longer believes that trees are always small even though the trees in one's own backyard may be tiny because the soil is poor
If one has seen large trees one knows they exist and one may even try to find a place where they grow
The same applies to our mental states
Having seen the possibility of expanded consciousness one no longer believes that ordinary consciousness is all there is or that the breath is all there is to meditation
The breathe is the hook that we hang the mind on so that we can open the door to true meditation
Having opened the door we experience physical wellbeing manifesting in many different ways
It may be a strong or a mild sensation but it is always connected with a pleasant feeling
Of that pleasure the Buddha said This is a pleasure I will allow myself Unless one experiences the joy of the meditative state which is independent of the world one will never resign from the world but will continue to see the world as one's home
Only when one realizes that the joy in the meditative state is independent of all worldly conditions will one finally be able to say The world and its manifold attractions are not interesting any more so that dispassion will set in
Otherwise why should one resign from that which occasionally does give pleasure and joy if one has nothing else
How can one do that
It is impossible to let go of all the joys and pleasures which the world offers if one has nothing to replace them
This is the first reason why in the Buddha's teaching the meditative absorptions are of the essence
We can't let go when we are still under the impression that with this body and these senses we can get what we're looking for namely happiness
The Buddha encourages us to look for happiness but we need to look in the right place
He said we would be able to protect our own happiness
Even the very first instance of gaining physical pleasure in meditation already illuminates the fact that something inside ourselves gives joy and happiness
The physical wellbeing also arouses pleasurable interest which helps to keep us on the meditation pillow
Although it is a physical sensation it is not the same sort of feeling that we are familiar with
It is different because it has arisen from a different source
Ordinary pleasant physical feelings come from touch contact
This one comes from concentration
Obviously having different causes they must also be different in their results
Touch is gross concentration is subtle
Therefore the meditative feeling has a more subtle spiritual quality than the pleasant feeling one can get through touch
Knowing clearly that the only condition necessary for happiness is concentration we will refrain from our usual pursuits of seeking pleasant people tasty food better weather more wealth and not squander our mental energy on those
This is therefore a necessary first step towards emancipation
We are now entering mind states that go beyond the everyday worldly affairs We all know the mind that is connected with ordinary matters
Such a mind worries about all sorts of things is anxious has plans memories hopes dreams likes dislikes and reactions
It's a very busy mind
For the first time we may become acquainted with a mind which doesn't contain all these aspects
Pleasurable wellbeing has no thinking attached to it it's an experience
Here we finally realize that the kind of thinking we're aware of will not give us the results we had hoped for
It is just good enough to project a willingness to meditate
We learn even from that very first step that the world cannot do for us what concentration can do
Happiness independent of outer conditions is far more satisfying than anything to be found in the world
We are also shown that the mind has the ability to expand into a different consciousness with which we had no previous contact so that we gain firsthand experience of the fact that meditation is the means for spiritual emancipation
Because of having had this pleasurable feeling an inner joy arises
This gives the meditator the assurance that the pathway towards nonself is a pathway of joy and not of dukkha
Thereby the natural resistance to nonself is greatly lessened
Most people resist the idea that they are nobody even after they have understood it intellectually
But being able to experience these first two aspects of meditation gives a clear indication that this is only possible when the self which is always thinking is temporarily buried
Because when the self is active it immediately says Oh isn't that nice and the concentration is finished
It has to be and experience where nothing says I am experiencing The explanation and understanding of what one has experienced comes later
This is a clear realization that without self the inner joy is a much greater and more profound nature than any happiness one has known in this life
Therefore the determination to really come to grips with the Buddha's teachings will come to fruition
Until then most people pick out a few aspects of the Dhamma which they've heard about and think that is sufficient
It may devotion chanting festivals doing good works moral behavior all of which is fine but the reality of the teaching is a great mosaic in which all these different pieces fall together into one huge all encompassing whole
And the central core is nonself
If we use only a few of these mosaic pieces we will never get the whole picture
But being able to meditate makes a great deal of difference in one's approach to that whole conglomerate of teaching which encompasses body and mind and completely changes the person who practices like that
We have to base our meditative ability on our daily practice
We cannot hope to sit down and meditate successfully if all we can think about are worldly affairs and if we do not try to reduce anger envy jealousy pride greed hate rejection in daily life
If we use mindfulness clear comprehension and a calming of sensual desires we have a foundation for meditation
As we practice in everyday affairs in conjunction with meditation we see a slow and gradual change as if an athlete has been training
The mind becomes strong and attends to the important issues in life
It doesn't get thrown about by everything that happens
If we can give some time for contemplation and meditation each day and not forget mindfulness we have a very good beginning for an expansion of consciousness
Eventually the universe and we ourselves look quite different based on our changed viewpoint
There is a Zen saying First the mountain is a mountain then the mountain is no longer a mountain and in the end the mountain is a mountain again First we see everything in its relative reality every person is a different individual every tree is a particular kind everything has some significance to our own lives
Then we start practicing and suddenly we see everything in its relative reality every person is a different individual every tree is a particular kind everything has some significance to our own lives
Then we start practicing and suddenly we see a different reality which is universal and expansive
We become very involved with our own meditation and do not pay much attention to what is going on around us
We see an expansion and elevation of our consciousness know that our everyday reactions are not important
For a while we may pay attention to just that and to living in a different reality
In the end we come right back to where we were doing all the same things as before but no longer being touched by them
A mountain is just a mountain again
Everything returns to the same ordinary aspect it used to have except it's no longer significant or separate
A description of an arahant in the Discourse on Blessings is although touched by worldly circumstance never the mind is wavering The Enlightened One is touched by worldly circumstances he acts like everybody else he eats sleeps washes and talks to people but the mind does not waver
The mind stays cool and peaceful at all times
If we want to understand kamma and rebirth correctly we have to see them in the light of nonself
They proclaim nonself quite vividly and yet most people usually don't take that into consideration at all but talk about my kamma and my rebirth
Especially my rebirth which is absurd
Do they mean the last one or future one
Do we think it will be me again
However in ordinary language we have little choice yet the spoken word has evolved out of our thinking processes
People often ask what is reborn if it isn't me
Kamma as a residual effect in the rebirth consciousness is reborn but it certainly doesn't look or act like the one we know doesn't have the same name may not have the same form or sex may not even be human
It has no other connection than kamma
Since we can see quite clearly that the one who is reborn only connects through kamma in the rebirth consciousness with a previous life we can see just as clearly that kamma is impersonal without identity
While we talk about my kamma it's really an impersonal process
It is not crime and punishment although it may appear like that and is one of the most commonly held views
Many of our entrenched views are so deeply ingrained that it becomes extremely difficult to understand anything radically different
Kamma actually just means action
In the India of the Buddha that's how it was understood
In order to make people aware of what it really implies the Buddha said Kamma oh monks I declare is intention which arises first in our thoughts then generates speech and action
This was the new interpretation that the Buddha gave to kamma because it was largely misunderstood and used as predetermined destiny
There were teachers in his day that taught it that way which was denounced by the Buddha as wrong view misleading and liable to have unwholesome results
This view of predetermined destiny is just as rampant today as it was at the Buddha's time
It is often voiced like this There's nothing I can do about it it's my kamma This is the greatest folly one can adhere to because it puts the onus of one's own intentions on some nebulous previous person whom one doesn't even know
In other words one doesn't take responsibility for one's own actions which is a very common failing
It is harder to find a person who does take responsibility than to find one who doesn't
Most people don't want to take responsibility for themselves if they can just manage to stay alive
From that difficulty arises the idea of predetermined destiny
What can I do it's not my fault it's my kamma That takes away all possibility for practicing the Dhamma
The Buddha said If that were so the holy life would not be possible nor would it be feasible to become enlightened This is the first wrong view that one has to quickly eliminate from one's thinking process if one wants to practice a spiritual discipline
Kamma is intention and intention is now which means kamma is being made now in every waking moment
However when two people make the same kamma they do not get the same results
This is another point the Buddha emphasized
Since kamma is impersonal it is strictly concerned with a flow of events which are creating results by themselves
It's a matter of cause and effect
That's all there is and the Buddha's teaching is sometimes called the teaching of cause and effect
Sometimes we see people who are very nice they would not hurt a fly and yet a lot of misfortune befalls them
Or others who are difficult and unfriendly but everything always seems to go right for them
How is it possible
It depends entirely upon their accumulations of good or bad kamma that have resulted in their particular mind continuum
The Buddha gave the following simile If one puts a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water that cup becomes undrinkable
If one puts a teaspoon of salt in the Ganges River it doesn't make the slightest difference to the river the water remains exactly the same If one makes bad kamma and has only a cupful of good kamma the results will be disastrous
If one has a river full of good kamma to support one the results will be negligible
Therefore we can never compare the results that people have because we don't know their past histories
The residual mind continuum that we bring with us certainly has a bearing on this life particularly on where we are born under what circumstances and in what sort of family
The Buddha gave a simile for that If there is a herd of cows locked in a barn and the barn door is opened the cow that is the strongest will go out first
If there isn't one like that then the one who is the habitual leader will go out first if there is no habitual leader then the one nearest the door will go out first
If there is none like that they will all try to go out at the same time This depicts the mind moments at death
Since death is imminent for everyone no matter what their age it is skillful to be ready for it now
The last thought moment at death is the one that impels the rebirth consciousness to its next destination
We can compare that to going to sleep at night and our last thought moment is that we will wake up at four o'clock in the morning
Most people can easily do that
The last thought moment becomes the first one upon waking
Dying is exactly the same except that the body that wakes up is a new one and looks different now
It is likely that it will be a human being again unless one has behaved too badly for such a rebirth
Even though people often wish for rebirth in a deva realm most people probably return as human beings
The last thought moment is the one that connects with the strongest experience in this life time
If for instance one has murdered a person that would be a very strong memory and could be the last thought moment
If one has built a monastery or temple that may be a very strong though formation
Or if one has always kept one's moral conduct intact that may be the last thought moment
Whatever is the strongest in one's mind that is most likely to arise
Otherwise one's habitual thinking takes over
If one has usually been dissatisfied or angry then that will be in the mind
If one has had much livingkindness compassion and helpfulness toward others those thoughts will arise
If there is no particular thinking habit then that which comes nearest the sense doors at death takes precedence
The last sense to go is hearing
It is very common therefore in most religions that some devotional words are chanted by monks or priests which may help to have a good last thought moment
If these last mental formations are wholesome one's rebirth will be favorable
That doesn't mean that the rest of the kamma resultants disappear
It only means that the impulsion that arises at death takes a certain direction
Therefore the last thought moments are of crucial importance
If one has been a very generous person that can be a last thought
It is therefore considered extremely beneficial to remind a dying person of all the good things they have done in this life such as their generosity bringing up their children well their kindness because ordinary worldlings are apt to have regrets and selfblame
It has in recent years been recognized that dying is a very important part of living even though in the West many people do not believe in rebirth
Everyone pays a lot of attention to a baby being born because that baby is going to be around for a long time and will be an important member of the family
But few have paid sufficient attention to the death moment because after all that person is gone finished
but it is now understood that this is not a wholesome way of treating a human being and in the West there are many hospitals for terminally ill and dying people where great attention is paid to their mind states to reduce or eliminate fear and anxiety
Yet hardly anyone there believes in rebirth but even without that death is considered very important
Another factor has entered into our death experience
We are now technologically advanced enough so that in some instances people who were clinically dead could be brought back to life using new methods that are available in Western hospitals
A number of these people talked to their doctors about their death experiences
Some doctors particularly Dr
Moody wrote about these phenomena
An outstanding feature of the stories told is the fact that they were practically identical in their important aspects
This gives us another clue to nonself
All of them without fail were extremely pleased with their death and reluctant to come back
One woke up extremely angry at the doctor for being instrumental in reestablishing the life continuum
The experiences were all connected with a very bright light containing total awareness of the mind but lacking a body
Each person was able to see hisher own body in the hospital bed and wandered off towards the bright light quite aware of these occurrences including watching the doctor at work
Then removing themselves from the hospital and entering an area of bliss happiness and great peace some of them talked about beings they met
Most of them described one particular being which was light None of the descriptions had any religious symbolism in them but all of them were similar some identical
With such books becoming more widely known the death moment has gained its rightful importance
In the five daily recollections the Buddha asks us to remember that we are of the nature to die
At other times he talks about the fact that the last thought moment is extremely important and consequently it is essential to get one's thoughts in order now
On one's deathbed it's too late
The wholesome aspects of our thoughts are always connected with loving kindness compassion generosity and equanimity
If we arouse those in our minds now as a habitual way of thinking we can carry that with us to our deathbed
We are then assured not only of a favorable rebirth at the very least but also of harmony during our lifetime
This will make it possible for us to easily practice the Dhamma again
If we are born into a very poor family where nobody has enough to eat it will be very difficult to sit down in meditation because in a poor family everybody has to work to survive
If we are reborn in a society where meditation is unknown it will be very difficult to continue our practice
It is not wise therefore to wait till old age and death but rather get our thinking process in order now
This entails knowing our thoughtformation through mindfulness and attention
Our appearance here is very shortlived  even years is not very long  so we can think of ourselves as a guest performer always waiting for applause
Naturally that makes life pretty difficult
First one has stage fright
Is one going to perform properly
Having given the performance will the applause be following
If one doesn't get it one feels devastated
Being a guest performer on this planet is a skillful way of thinking but waiting for the applause is wrong view
If we know that we're being the best we can with all our faculties we don't have to wait for somebody else's approval
We can have right intention again and again
That's what matters most because intention towards goodness concerns both oneself and others
Less selfconcern frees us to embrace others
We must not decline in Dhamma and meditation practice of course because only if we have developed ourselves to some extent can we help others otherwise we act in ignorance which will not bring good results
If we are concerned with our next rebirth we are really living in a dream
The person who is making the kamma now is not the one who's going to reap the results
The only connection will be the kammic residue the result
Even this connection is very tenuous because we can break the chain
If a person has made a lot of bad kamma and in the next rebirth makes much good kamma the bad resultants may never fruit and vice versa
The case in point is Angulimala who killed people and yet became an arahant because he came to be in a monastery under the Buddha where his bad kamma didn't get a chance to fruit
However Mahamoggallana already an arahant was killed by robbers and his bones pulverized due to past kamma
We cannot establish a credit account of good kamma against all eventualities because we have no jurisdiction over the person who will inherit the kamma that we made in this life
But making good kamma now brings immediate results happiness and contentment in the mind and usually some happiness for others also
If one is able to give happiness to others there is again a cause for joy for oneself
It's useless to think about kamma made in a past life or to be made in a future life
None of us will know anything about the next life nor do we remember anything from our last life
Why worry about these then
Only this moment right now is important
The past is like a dream and the future is yet to come
When the future actually happens it's always the present
Tomorrow never comes when it does it's called today
One cannot live in the future nor in the past
One can only live this single moment
If we really paid attention to every single moment we would meditate well
We would also have no doubt about impermanence
In fact we would see it so clearly we could let go of our attachments our clinging
We could consider thus Have I used every moment to the best advantage If we have made some bad kamma in the past we can resolve to quickly perform some good action
That's the only value the past can provide
Otherwise the most effective and compelling aspect of impermanence is that we are moving away from thought speech and action so quickly that we cannot even remember them never mind hold on to them
Yet we're trying to hold on to other people to our ideas views and opinions we hang on to this body to physical manifestation and mental aberrations and try to make them solid
It's impossible and cannot be done there's only each moment
We can easily see in digital clocks how each moment comes and goes
Just watch a clock for five minutes and realize five precious moments of your live are gone
The past is actually forgotten except some highlights but otherwise it has disappeared
That shows us with clarity that we are a flowing phenomenon without any substance
We're putting a substance into it out of an ignorant appraisal of totally untrue reality in which we are living
It is like a theater something we have made up ourselves where people wear costumes and say their lines and believe this to be real life
We want to keep the theater going but that is not possible and so everybody has dukkha which cannot be eliminated through nonknowing or indifference but only through a change of awareness and view
Kammamaking is initially in the mind
Our mental formations make our kamma
Unless we become master of our mind we cannot escape from making bad kamma
The mind is constantly in danger of thinking something unwholesome
The negativities in the mind are innumerable I don't like it can't stand it I'm afraid it's boring All are negativities concerned with anger
I want to get it keep it renew it are also bad kamma connected with greed
All arise in the mind
Very few people watch their mind
They believe it to be difficult and tiring
But it's much more tiring to make bad kamma because the results are heavy and unpleasant
Very few people have that inner buoyancy which denotes independent joy
Most people are bogged down by their mind's negativities not by outer circumstances
Watching one's own mind and making sure that one practices the four supreme efforts is the most beneficial thing one can do for oneself and secures good kamma
Out of our thoughts arise speech and action
We can't talk without having thought it first and we can't act without having made up our mind to do so
Although people speak and act so impulsively that they are not aware that a thought has gone ahead that doesn't mean there was none
It just means that mindfulness and clear comprehension were lacking
Our mind is the most precious asset we have
No jewel can compare with it because the mind contains the seed of enlightenment
Unless we use it properly we're foolishly burying a jewel in the dirt
People often do so primarily because they have had no training otherwise
When we recognize that we have this most precious jewel of a mind we will guard it from being scratched bumped and dirtied losing its luster and brilliance but rather make sure that it remains pure and luminous and thereby make good kamma
The action itself the Buddha said is not of the foremost importance it's the intention behind it
Even generosity can be extended from a wrong motivation
If the intention is to store up some merit for the future that's rather selfish
If it's done out of compassion for those who have less that is the ideal way
Yet even with wrong motivation it's still better to be generous than not
There's good kamma in it because one has let go of something that one owns
The guard we keep on our mind will assure that whatever we do is done with right intention the second step on the Noble Eightfold Path which is our guideline
Kamma making depends on the mind and the mind's purity depends on meditation
If we meditate diligently and regularly eventually we will see with clarity what goes on in our mind
Some people are satisfied with gaining a little peace but even that is already an advantage and growth aspect
If we watch the mind in meditation we will learn to watch the mind also in daily living
Then we have a very good chance of making good kamma
If we become tired of the everrecurring cycle of loss and gain praise and blame fame and illfame happiness and unhappiness we need to make a determined effort to shed clinging and craving
This effort has meditation as its base but that's not all
Meditation is a means for gaining access to the ability to rid oneself of the tendencies of greed and hate
The meditative process gives the mind the clarity to see these tendencies within oneself so that one can do something about them
Our duty in this life as human beings with senses and bodies intact and able to hear the true Dhamma is to guard our mind and experience its original nature which is purity luminosity pliability
Such a mind can reach the depth of the teaching where we find nobody that owns the mind
The Buddha spoke about five spiritual faculties which turn into spiritual powers if we cultivate and develop them
We all have these faculties within and developing them means making them powerful qualities which become factors of enlightenment
As long as they are only faculties they are potentials for enlightenment
The Buddha compared them to a team of horses with one lead horse and two pairs that are pulling a wagon
The lead horse can go as fast or as slow as it likes the others have to fall into step with it
The pairs have to be in balance with each other otherwise if one goes faster than the other the wagon will topple
The leading faculty is mindfulness
It is up to us how much of it we can find in any given moment
Mindfulness is a momenttomoment mental factor which can be compared to an observer
If we have an observer with us all the time it is more likely that we will stay on the path
The first pair that has to be balanced is faith and wisdom
There is an analogy that the Buddha gave for these two qualities he compared faith to a blind giant who meets up with a small very sharpeyed cripple called wisdom
The blind giant named faith says to the small sharpeyed cripple named wisdom I'm strong and can go very fast but I can't see where I'm going
You're small and weak but have sharp eyes
If you will ride on my shoulders together we could go very far This tells us that faith without wisdom while being a strong faculty is yet unable to find the right direction
We say faith can move mountains but being blind faith doesn't know which mountain needs moving
However coupled with wisdom there is enormous potential
The reason for such strength is that heart and mind are brought into harmony
The mind can have wisdom and the heart can have faith
When heart and mind are brought to a point of coexistence of no separation the power which develops is far greater than just  
It is more like to the power of
Faith as a quality in the heart has such great value because it is connected with love
We can only have faith in something or someone we love
Faith is also connected to devotion which is a giving of oneself and a lessening of pride
These are valuable and necessary spiritual qualities
If we are devoted to a high ideal such as BuddhaDhammaSangha then we have the understanding that there is something greater than ourselves
The devotion we can have for that ideal is manifested in giving our love and admiration respect and gratitude which are very important and helpful qualities to develop
But the Buddha taught that blind faith is useless
Blind faith means that one believes what one is told without personal investigation that one has faith in something that one's family adheres to or because it has been written down in special books because it has been transmitted from teacher to disciple because it is something that one likes anyway that promises some mystical revelation or because the teacher is a respected person
All these are no reasons to follow a spiritual path
Do not believe because somebody told you so
But if there is some wisdom in the mind and without it life would be quite unbearable we can quite easily investigate whether our faith and devotion are justified
We can for instance verify the first and second Noble Truths within ourselves many times in a day
If we do that we know what they mean only believing them is not very helpful because it will not make any difference in our hearts and minds
We can check out the impermanence and unsatisfactoriness of all worldly phenomena without much difficulty
Thereby we gradually gain more and more wisdom
The unwavering faith in the BuddhaDhammaSangha is one of the results that a streamenterer gains when she has the first path moment because until then the fetter of doubt still exists
If we have established unwavering faith within ourselves in the veracity and exactitude of the Buddha's teachings we have taken an important step
The heart quality within us will have opened up in a way which will be most helpful but understanding has to go along
In Pali the one word citta denotes feeling and thinking but in English we have to distinguish between heart and mind because we consider feeling a heart quality and thinking a mind quality otherwise we can't express what we really mean
Our thinking capacity is rationality and logic which is impaired by our emotionalism by the reactions to our feelings
The formula for growth is purification of emotions brings clarification of thought If our emotions are pure as they are for example in devotion gratitude respect and faith our thoughts have a much greater capacity for clarity
The impure emotions connected with passions of either wanting or not wanting are those which hinder our thinking capacity
We can't think straight when we are under the sway of strong emotions
Our education system doesn't take any notice of that nor do parents teach this to their children yet the Buddha taught it quite clearly
Each human being has a right and left hemisphere in the brain which we classify as male and female the right being female left being male
The left or male side is in charge of the right side of the body and vice versa
Just as the pairs of horses have to balance both sides male and female have to attain a harmonious whole
The male side is usually connected to our rationality logic linear thinking understanding
The female side is connected to feelings nurturing caring compassion love all the emotional qualities
Each of us has both sides the emotional and the mental capacity
Very few people develop both equally
Therefore their cart often topples
Emotionalism is just as much a danger as thinking without being in touch with one's feelings
That too can go very much astray
In school we were taught to debate
We were given a subject to debate with another child
When we finished we changed sides and were asked to hold the opposite view and debate giving all factors of the other side
Any child can do it any grownup can do it
It is just straightforward thinking
One can have the opposite opinion by the flip of a coin
There is no inherent truth in any opinion because it's simply linear thinking
However if these thoughts are connected to our feelings we can no longer debate the opposite side
This is the old story of having to bite into a mango to know its taste
We can be told many things about a mango
It's sweet delicious soft but we cannot imagine its taste unless we get the feeling of the mango on our tongue and have the personal experience
Then we can no longer debate whether the mango is sweet or not because we have experienced the truth
This is the difference between just thinking or thinking coupled with the experience of feeling
A person who goes too far on the side of rational thinking has to learn to balance with feelings the female side
Anyone who thinks to the extent where the experience of feelings is hardly known has to practice much mindfulness of feelings
On the other hand the female side is often emotionalism
This means we are carried away by our emotions and consequently our thinking is impaired
The quality of logical thinking of delving into a thought process and being able to analyze is not possible when the emotions are at the forefront
Of course in women this has a connection to the mores of the patriarchal society but primarily it is due to the fact of not having developed one's potential for both sides which is inherent in all of us
The person who is primarily analytical is often under the impression that this will actually bring about all the desired results
Such a person unless prodded and told often enough will not try to get in touch with feelings
The one who is always relating and reacting to emotions is so habituated that she can no longer do anything else until shown through the meditative process that there is an alternative
If one lives only in relation and in reaction to one's emotions life can become quite difficult
People who live like that often try to deaden their emotions as a way out of their dilemma
That's of course not the answer rather to purify them
Naturally the person who is a thinker also has to purify the emotions but before such a person can do that she first needs to get in touch with them
The one who lives with emotions and reacts to them all the time also has to be in touch with them but not to deaden them but to encourage wholesome reactions
As the purification of the emotions takes place thinking will no longer be overshadowed by diffuse uncertainties
Unless we do that we only use half of our potential
This is what faith and wisdom can mean to us the emotions and the thinking
When we cultivate both we develop our faculties into powers
Harmonizing our emotional with our thinking capacities is the essence of harmonizing faith with wisdom
A powerful mind is a great asset but only in conjunction with purified emotions
Faith is one such purified emotion
Faith is much easier for people whose primary defilement is greed rather than hate
Faith arouses pleasant feelings which is greed's direction
In this case greed is an asset although basically it is of course a negative characteristic
But if we use it in a positive way we are engaged in a purification process wanting that which is wholesome which leads us to the supermundane
First greed opens up into faith resulting in pleasant feelings
Then we can use greed to want successful meditation streamentry liberation
All are cravings but they're going in the right direction of using greed to get rid of greed
That is our best approach because greed is only truly eliminated by the nonreturner
If we use our craving in that manner we are at least searching for that which will give us the greatest benefit rather than pleasure through the senses
The Buddha's path is called the middle path which means a path of balance
We have to balance all extremes so that they become a useful basis for a harmonious person whose practice will flourish
This is one reason why the Buddha recommended the meditation on the loathsomeness of the body
People often say they don't want to think of their body as loathsome it is a good working machine and very useful
But we are actually enamored with our body we are hanging on to it loving it trying to preserve it keeping it young and beautifying it
We are attached to it and consider it me The loathsomeness of the body meditation is not designed to disgust us but only to create a balance to our identification with our body
We can compare this with walking on a tightrope if we balance too far to the right we fall down too far on the left we topple
Constant balancing is necessary which has to be done by everyone for themselves
If we know ourselves to be reacting to our emotions we need to start analyzing and inquiring into ourselves
It is difficult for someone who has always lived in reaction to their emotions to see beyond them
The meditation practice helps greatly because the tranquillity that is bound to arise to some extent is conducive to penetration into reality
We need some selfknowledge otherwise we can't make any changes
Introspection and attention to one's feelings and thoughts should provide enough insight into ourselves to lay the foundation for a meaningful change
The other pair is energy and concentration
It's not physical energy that's needed but rather mental energy which has little to do with the capacities of the body
We need unwavering determination for this practice which is transformed energy
The Buddha compared us with the man who's wearing a turban that is on fire
Obviously if a man is wearing a turban that is on fire he is most anxious to get rid of it
That same kind of determination is needed to practice diligently
Energy is also dependent upon onepointed direction
We realize what is most important and don't vacillate between social life social action practice entertainment and the many other options open to us
Everybody has more energy for those things they like
We have to be very careful that we don't use up our energy searching for pleasant sense contacts because we like them
We have to be attentive to the fact that pleasant sense contacts are so shortlived they will never give us complete satisfaction and that we're using up our energy without getting any real fulfillment
So it turns into a waste of our energy
If we see clearly through attention mindfulness and introspection that if we put our energy into meditation and practice of Dhamma our dukkha is greatly reduced thereby and that we actually have a mode of living which includes everything else then we will certainly turn in that direction
The rest of daily living happens anyway
Most people use up about  of their energy just to stay alive
Not that they have to work so hard to make a living but just to attend to their daily duties and responsibilities just to keep going
If our energy is used for meditation mindfulness and bare attention the mind faculties sharpen to the point where minor things and duties necessary to stay alive are done in an easy and harmonious flow
We can start using our energy for that which is most important
If energy is not coupled with concentration it becomes restlessness and we can notice that in meditation
Sometimes there is no concentration yet there is a lot of energy
Then mind and body become restless we would like to jump up and run away
If concentration is too strong and there is no energy then the third hindrance arises namely sloth and torpor
That is also easily noticeable in meditation
People who are used to concentrating and can do it well may occasionally lack energy and consequently concentration becomes conducive to sleepiness
That is a time when the meditation should be directed towards insight rather than calm
Calm meditation which is pure concentration may result in sleepiness when there is not enough energy
But insight meditation with attention on impermanence the constant arising and ceasing of thoughts and feelings may bring up the energy that is needed
As we only have a limited amount of vigor we have to use it in the best possible way
Most people do not realize that energy is a great asset and squander it on totally irrelevant activities
When we realize that it is essential for the spiritual path then we may become more careful with it
As the body gets older physical energy is reduced but that does not have to include mind energy
On the contrary
When the body is young and full of vigor a lot of physical activity may take place and the mind may be neglected
In an older person when body activity becomes less the mind may receive most of the attention and mental energy could be increased
Energy and concentration have to balance primarily in meditation
When these faculties become powers they result in the meditative absorptions
When wisdom becomes a power it means insight into the three characteristics of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and corelessness
When faith turns into a power then it also manifests as the four immeasurable emotions loving kindness compassion sympathetic joy equanimity
Mindfulness is a power when all four foundations are habitually attended to
To become a master of all of these aspects is an ideal but to practice them is a necessity
And since all of us have these faculties within there is every reason to cultivate them
One finds oneself a more harmonious and balanced person with less difficulties capable of helping others
To develop these five faculties should be a primary object in one's life
The balancing of them needs to be seen as connecting heart with mind
There are three ways to approach the Dhamma
One is by acquiring knowledge through study of the Buddha's discourses trying to remember them as faithfully as possible
That is very useful for the propagation of the teaching through lectures and books
Another way is through devotion offering flowers and incense reciting devotional verses giving gifts and making merit
Generosity and meritorious action were highly recommended by the Buddha but he didn't put any value on just being in the presence of monks and nuns
Once there was a monk who was so enraptured with the Buddha that he never wanted to be out of his sight
When this monk became sick one day and was unable to see the Buddha he became despondent
The other monks asked him why he was so unhappy
He explained that he was depressed because he could not see the Buddha who then came to visit the sick monk and said to him What do you see in this vile form
There is nothing to see in that
Whoever sees me sees the Dhamma whoever sees Dhamma sees me

The third approach to Dhamma namely practice has always been the one most highly recommended by the Buddha
He said a person with real reverence and devotion is one who lives according to the teaching
There are a number of steps to be taken when we approach the Dhamma through practice
The foundation would be moral conduct meritorious actions making good kamma
Without such a foundation we do not have enough security within to be peaceful and at ease with ourselves which are prerequisites for meditation
This has sometimes been misinterpreted to mean that we should not meditate unless we have already complete purity of precepts and gained perfect mindfulness
But that doesn't follow because it's meditation that helps us to gain mindfulness and gives us insight into the efficacy of the precepts
The next practice aspect is to guard our senses
This is frequently mentioned by the Buddha so that it bears repeating and remembering
Without guarding our senses we are always open to being tempted into wanting and craving resulting in turmoil in the mind
Our sense contacts are triggers for lust and hate
Our senses are so permanently engaged that we have lost sight of their impact are taking all that for granted and think that's just the way it is
We also believe that what we see hear taste touch smell and think is really exactly as we are interpreting it
That's a fundamental error
Everyone experiences their sense contacts in an individual manner
Here is an example The food Westerners eat is considered baby food in Asia food spiced in the Asian way appears like hellfire to the Western palate
Even such a basic necessity as food shows up as a completely opposite experience
We can infer from that that we all live in our own world
People argue vehemently because they believe their world must be the right one and even kill each other because of unresolved differences
The Buddha was often asked such a question as Is the world finite or infinite eternal or not His answer was What is the world
The world is our sense contacts When asked questions such as these the Buddha always brought the questioner back to practice
When we know that the world we live in consists of our sense contacts we have something to practice with
When we know that the world is eternal or not what is there to practice with
Our senses include thinking which is an almost constantly operating faculty
At this moment we have touch sound sight and thought contact
Four of our six senses are engaged
Because our senses have been at work all our lives we believe that is the only way life can be experienced which creates our deep craving to continue in this form
There is danger in this craving something most people are not aware of consciously
Subconsciously we all know about it because that's where our fears originate
If we examine ourselves for a moment we will realize that we harbor many fears all carrying different names
Some people are afraid of spiders or snakes some are afraid of the dark some are afraid of airplanes others that their loved ones may die or that they might lose all their money
All sorts of different names for exactly the same fear the fear of losing one's identifications the fear of unpleasant painful sense contacts ultimately the fear of annihilation
Yet losing this existence is a guaranteed outcome of being alive
It's just a matter of time
These fears are caused by our attachment to our pleasant sense contacts identifying with them and believing that apart from our senses there is no other reality
Naturally we want that to continue then
We take our unpleasant experiences in stride expecting them to cease and the pleasant ones to arise again
If our unpleasant sense contacts are in the majority then we say we are having a lot of dukkha
Or we might say I'm having a problem As a matter of fact we are all having the same problem namely that of not being enlightened
When we come to the realization that our sense contacts are very momentary and their inherent satisfaction a matter of opinion we will find it easier to let go of them during meditation
Meditation will only happen when the sense contacts particularly the thinking are suspended
If for instance the touch contact in the sitting position is recognized and attended to as unpleasant the mind starts working on that
Remembering what someone said yesterday last week or even ten years ago can start the mind churning
This is all due to our attachment to our senses and our identification with them
From all sense contacts feelings arise there is no way that can be altered but we can stop ourselves from reacting to such feelings and believing that they belong to us
To get our meditation to a concentrated state we must refuse to react to feelings arisen from sense contacts
The more we practice this in daily life the easier it will be to become concentrated in meditation
We don't have to go along with this natural reaction of human beings
Meditative absorptions are supermundane and therefore require supermundane qualities in us
Whenever the Buddha described the way to Nibbana he included the meditative absorptions as part of the practice to lead us to the inner realization of the Dhamma
Guarding our senses is not only important in meditation but equally valid in daily life
In a meditation course where there isn't as much input as in ordinary situation it is a little easier to protect our minds from liking or disliking what we see hear taste touch smell and think
In order to facilitate this we need to practice hearing only sounds without explaining to ourselves what it is we heard
When the mind starts telling its story about the sound at least we will know what we are doing namely investing sound with a reality which gives it importance
The same applies to eye contact
If for instance we are looking at a bush our mind will say Oh a cinnamon bush who planted it
I wonder if we can use it Or any number of other ideas
Instead of all this we can look at that which we call bush and be aware that our eyes are touching upon a form and thereby stopping the mind from making up stories
If we can manage to do this once or twice outside of meditation we can use the same method of handling sense input in meditation
When we guard ourselves against the mindmade details of sense contacts we are in less danger of falling into greed and hate
We will find this a great help in becoming concentrated in meditation
Our lives are governed by our senses but we do not have to continue with that
It is not compulsory
Within the operation of our six senses it is not possible to find continued and unadulterated happiness
If it were possible we would already be blissfully contented since we have been having sense input day after day life after life
The answer does not lie in improving our sense contacts even though most people do try that but rather in improving our reactions so that eventually equanimity becomes our mode of living
This is the promise the Buddha made to us namely that we can get out of all dukkha all problems but not by having only wonderful sense contacts and not a single moment of unpleasantness
Such a thing has never been possible not even when the Buddha himself was alive
But we can have moments when we are actually able to do just that
That one moment gives us the initial experience what it is like to be free which is the only kind of freedom to be found in human life
There is no other
Anyone who understands the Buddha's explicit instructions especially those who meditate can practice in this manner
The next step to be taken is mindfulness accompanied by clear comprehension
Mindfulness is the mental factor of just knowing clear comprehension the one of understanding
We need both
That too can and should be practiced in daily life
Mindfulness of the body was praised by the Buddha as leading to the deathless a synonym for Nibbana
When we watch our body's actions and realize that it can only follow the mind's instructions this is our first step into insight
Usually we take mind and body for granted
Most people are more interested in their body than in their mind and are looking after the body very well
Very few people are looking after their mind
Being aware of our body's movements gives us a chance to be alert without thinking just knowing
Clear comprehension is our fourpronged mode of discrimination described previously
We might think that such discrimination would slow us down unduly that we won't be able to get our work done
Actually it has the opposite effect because we will not do anything that is unnecessary
When we use mindfulness and clear comprehension again and again they will become a habit which will enhance our abilities to attain calm and insight
When we experience our mind ordering our body around this is different from just knowing about it
We become intimately acquainted with our dual aspect of mind and body and can begin to investigate where is me in that
We may eventually find that me is our wish to be eternal not to be annihilated
Most people would like to experience calm bliss and tranquillity in meditation
But those whose minds are very active need to gain insight first in order to become calm
Those whose minds are more peaceful in any case find it easier to become calm first and gain insight later
A little calm creates a little insight and vice versa
In practice we work on both these aspects to give ourselves the best chance to develop both simultaneously
When we watch the breath going in and out of the nostrils we try to achieve a calm and peaceful mind
When the mind strays to thinking we first realize I'm thinking and then see the impermanent nature of each thought and how it so often rolls along without any purpose
This is a valuable insight because we can infer that our thoughts are frequently not to be believed are unimportant have no solidity and do not provide a secure foothold for us
Without such an experience we might continue to believe all our thoughts and try using them as solid foundations for our life
but when we see in meditation that we can't remember what we were thinking from one second to the next that belief is shattered never to arise again
When we start doubting our thoughts that doesn't mean we start doubting ourselves
It refers to doubting our views and opinions which is a most valuable practice
In the discourse on livingkindness an arahant is described as being totally free from all views
What the Buddha expounded to us were his own experiences
Viewpoints are always based on our wrong assumption that there is a me and are therefore discolored by this underlying error
When we realize what our minds are up to we will eventually stop having so many viewpoints and thereby let go of some of the mind's clutter
Most minds are full of ideas hopes plans memories and opinions
Right and wrong are often based on culture or tradition and have no ultimate validity
They clutter up the mind and leave no space for a totally new outlook upon ourselves and the world
An important step in this sequence is selfconquest which the Buddha described as the way to Nibbana
As long as we react to our feelings created through sense contacts we must admit that we are reactors rather than actors victims rather than masters
We like to think of ourselves as more exalted than that yet when we observe reality that is all we can find
As soon as we have overcome this habitual reacting we have taken a step towards conquering ourselves
We do not force ourselves into unpleasant situations which we haven't learned to cope with yet because the mind will again react negatively which doesn't help us on the path
We need not sit in excruciating pain in meditation but we need to observe our mind and its activity
This will assist us also in daily living when unpleasant feelings and dislike arise because of words we hear or sights we see
When we learn to accept things the way they are selfconquest has taken place which releases us from views and opinions
Dukkha arises from the fact that we don't like the law of nature to which we are subject
We don't like our loved ones dying we don't like physical pain or lack of appreciation we don't like losing what we prize
If we could just accept the way it is it would go a long way towards looking at the world more realistically with less passion which is the way to freedom
Our passionate desires keep us in bounds
When we have the opportunity to sit quietly and watch ourselves new insights about ourselves may arise
We are the prototype of impermanence
But when our mind veers toward the past and starts rehashing old movies it's time to turn it off
The past cannot be changed
The person who experienced the past no longer exists is only a fantasy now
When the mind strolls to the future imagining how we would like it to be we can let go by remembering the future has no reality either
When it happens it can only be the present and the person planning the future is not the same one who will experience it
If we stay in this moment here and now during meditation we can use that same skill in daily life
When we handle each moment with mindfulness and clear comprehension everything functions well nothing goes amiss our mind is content and inner peace can arise
Keeping our attention focused on each step on the way will eventually bring us to the summit
The four pathways to power are according to the Buddha essential aspects of realizing liberation
He said If a monk or nun has missed the four pathways to power they have missed the way to liberation
If they have practiced the four pathways to power they are practicing the right way
These four pathways are initially mundane which means they are an endeavor which all of us are capable of pursuing
Only when they have become powers are they supermundane and constitute four of the factors of enlightenment
Because they are so essential to practice and cannot be disregarded we need to know about them in detail
We have to understand them in an analytical way so that we can check up on our own results
This is the criterion that eventually turns knowledge into wisdom
We can learn any of the Buddha's teachings by heart that's not so difficult but consequently we need to look at these teachings in the light of personal endeavor
We can check whether our practice has borne fruit or not
If so we will continue in the same way as before if not we need to alter our approach
By investigating within whether we are actually doing what the Buddha taught and whether it has become part of our own inner being we gain insight into our mind's capacity
When we see that through practice we have been able to enlarge the abilities of our mind we will not become complacent but resolve to increase them further
The four pathways to power start out with chandhasamadhi
Chandha is intention and can be wholesome unwholesome or neutral
It also means desire or direction
In order to make it a pathway to power we have to use it as the intention towards complete insight
Samadhi as part of the term means that the intention has to be fully concentrated and not dissipated
This would be the difference between living a worldly life or living a life wholly dedicated to spiritual endeavor
In a worldly life we are forced to dissipate our intentions into different directions
It is the nature of life in the world
The necessity for obtaining and looking after many different objects even though we can minimize that will take up some time
There are always people and material aspects who have a claim on us
We have to honor those claims
Our own ambitions and desires are being fostered in the world as being useful and commendable
In order to cultivate concentration of intention leading to total liberation we need to be in circumstances where no obstacles arise
All four of the pathways have willpower as an adjunct
Concentration of intention also includes onepointedness
It only becomes a true pathway when our intention is directed towards the greatest power of all namely the power arising from letting go of all craving
The second pathway is concentration of energy
Everyone has a certain amount of physical energy which sometimes becomes detrimental to our mental endeavor when there is too much restlessness
If we have too little physical energy that is also counterproductive
But mental energy can be increased namely by being onepointed using our energy in one direction only not having many irons in the fire
We need to be clear about what is of the utmost importance for us in this life
This needs checking up in the quiet introspection of our own contemplation
What is it that I want most Where do I want to expend my energy What is my main intention
The answer may not be to come to the end of dukkha
That is all right too
But we can benefit by concentrating our energy and intention no matter where we are heading as it will protect us from wasting our time with useless actions
The willpower we can arouse depends very much on our insight
If we have seen the urgency of our own spiritual growth we will find it easier to have the will for practice
All of us are subject to instinctual actions and reactions based on desire and craving
Willpower helps us to let go of these and direct our energy into different channels
Urgency is an essential part of successful practice
When our insights give rise to seeing the whole world on fire from craving and ourselves burning with it then urgency will become a natural part of our makeup and willpower a concomitant to it
Willpower arises in direct proportion to urgency which is connected to our insight into the world around us the world which does not stop at our front door because it lives in our own heart and mind
The next pathway to power is concentration of consciousness or onepointedness of concentration
When intention and energy come together in a powerful way coupled with willpower meditative concentration can result
The first two pathways are causes for the third one to arise leading to meditative absorptions
Deep tranquillity in one's meditation is the underlying factor needed for profound insights which can change an ordinary worldling to a noble one which is the goal of our practice
Most people today are not really aware of that but are interested in meditation to gain release from stress
That too is all right
Why not
The Buddha's purpose and teaching were relief and release from dukkha once and for all so that it can never arise again
If we translate dukkha as stress which we can well do then we might say yes it is relief from stress
But the kind of release the Buddha had in mind is based on the depth of insight where we realize and experience that is isn't really dukkha that disappears but the me who is experiencing it vanishes
Onepointed intention and onepointed effort lead to onepointed consciousness
The mind finds itself in a state of awareness where there are no obstructions or obstacles resulting from thinking
Insight does not arise from thoughts but is an inner intuitive knowing quite different from discursive and logical thinking rather an outcome of a clear and calm mind
This leads the awareness into the depths of truth which has always been there but which did not rise to the surface before so that the mind could not grasp it previously
What the Buddha experienced under the Bodhi Tree when he was able to formulate the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path was not a result of discursive thinking nor of logical or learned understanding
It was a deep inner experience which arose from a totally calm mind without obstructions
It is our saving grace that a mind can do only one thing at a time
When we are calm and concentrated all our hindrances are momentarily laid to rest
This is the boon of meditation
When there are no obstacles in the mind it has the ability to recognize an entirely different depth than it does under ordinary circumstances when we are always in danger of having greed hate or deluded mind states arise
When we arouse the pathways to power we create a different dimension in the mind
This is essential as otherwise we may believe in the Buddha and his teaching but may not be able to prove it ourselves
It is up to all of us to live the Dhamma in heart and mind
The fourth pathway is the concentration of investigation Subsequent to the experience of calm and tranquillity with their inherent expansion of consciousness comes investigation for insight
The meditative calm becomes a condition for insight through concentrated investigation when we realize the impermanence of even the best meditative states
None of the pathways however only apply to meditation
While they benefit us greatly in the context of meditation they are useful and practicable in all other moments of our lives
We certainly need concentrated intention in daily living
We cannot one day intend to be kind the next day selfish then kind again and expect to be peaceful and happy
We also need to know what we are aiming for in mundane living
If we want a university education we have to concentrate on that intention
We cannot go to university one day stay home the next day and expect to pass examinations
Concentration of energy is also a basic requirement of daily living
If we conserve our energy to use it where it bears the best fruit our mundane endeavors will flourish and be easily accomplished
If we develop and cultivate right intention energy willpower and concentration we can increase our potential manifold
Notwithstanding any results we may see in ourselves we should never expect to be either totally perfect or totally imperfect
We need to look upon ourselves as practitioners those who are learning
In the Buddha's time they were called savaka which means hearer If we consider ourselves in that way we need not search for perfection or imperfection but rather try to draw nearer to giving up all ideas of me and mine
Concentrated investigation of phenomena is an aspect of our moment to moment mindfulness which enables us to see anicca dukkha or anatta wherever we look
Everything that exits proclaims these three characteristics so that we need never be without Dhamma consciousness
Usually one of the three aspects becomes more pregnant with meaning for us and our mind veers in that direction to investigate the underlying truth behind the reality in which we live
We are never without an object for investigation
Our thoughts and feelings are full of these three characteristics
When there is a pleasant feeling can we keep it
Do we feel unhappy when it is gone
Are we beginning to see this whole person we are so concerned with as nothing but flux and flow with no solid core to be found anywhere
When we look at ourselves again and again we will eventually realize that we cannot find an unchanging substance within
Depth of insight arises through the meditative process
However we need to assist our practice by investigative thoughts and directions in daily living
If our mind is concerned with worldly affairs or sensual pleasures during the day it is asking too much of it to become calm and insightful in the evening
It is an unrealistic expectation which no mind can fulfill
We need to prepare our mind so that it is used to thinking in terms of Dhamma consciousness with mindfulness already established as a daily habit
Then we can proceed with meditation without first having to shed all mental burdens
We are already facing in the right direction and can easily achieve calm and peacefulness which are our resource for mental energy
When we are young we may be inclined to think that our body is our source of energy
But the body can fall sick at any time can be maimed or even die
Our real energy source lies in the fact that the mind can renew itself and become powerful through the arising of deep tranquillity
Then it doesn't matter whether the body is old and decrepit or young and healthy because mind is the master and body the servant
We need the meditative calm as our fuel supply
It is more important even than food
Although one does eventually have to have food again one can go without it for quite a long time much longer than usually thought possible and still have much energy to meditate
We have this natural resource within yet very few people take advantage of it
In order to make use of it the mind needs protection during daily living so that it is already in the right frame of consciousness when meditation begins
Insight into the futility of ambitions and desires helps to lessen discursive and distracting thinking
The four pathways to power are mundane when we are practicing and become supermundane when we have perfected them
They bring total liberation from dukkha if culmination of intention energy willpower calm and insight is achieved which they demand of us
Now the time has come to go home from this retreat
In order to take as much benefit as possible with us we need to be aware how to organize our daily lives
If we go back and do exactly as we've always done within a week everything will be forgotten
Coming to another meditation course in the future we would have to start all over again
Who knows whether there is much time in this life
This is the only life the we can take responsibility for
Here we have some control over how we spend our day
The future is nonexistent
I'm going to meditate 'tomorrow' is foolish
There is no tomorrow there is only now
When the next life comes it's this life actually this is our next life
Finding lots of reasons not to practice today is always possible the children the weather the husband the wife the business the economy the food anything will do
What kind of priorities we have is strictly of our own making
If the future does not exist and the past is completely gone what do we have left
A very fleeting moment indeed namely this one
It passes quicker than we can say it
But by using each moment skillfully we can eventually have momenttomoment awareness which results in deep insight
When getting up in the morning the first thing would be a determination to be mindful
Becoming aware of opening our eyes is the beginning of the day and the beginning of mindfulness
If we have opened our eyes before becoming aware of that we can close them and start all over again
And from that small incident we will gain an understanding of mindfulness and what it means then we can let the mind be flooded with gratitude that we have another whole day at our disposal for one purpose only
Not to cook a better meal not to buy new things but to draw nearer to Nibbana
One needs enough wisdom to know how this can be accomplished
The Buddha told us again and again but we are hard of hearing and not totally open to all the instructions
So we need to hear it many times
Being grateful brings the mind to a state of receptivity and joyful expectation of What am I going to do with this day The first thing would be to sit down to meditate maybe having to get up a little earlier
Most people die in bed it's a perfect place for dying and not such a perfect place for spending an unnecessarily long time
If one has passed the first flush of youth one doesn't need so much sleep any more
In most homes starting at o'clock there is noise
If that is so we need to get up early enough to avoid that
That alone gives a feeling of satisfaction of doing something special to get nearer to Nibbana
If we have a whole hour available for meditation that's fine at least let us not practice under half an hour because the mind needs time to become calm and collected
The morning hour is often the best for many people because during the night the mind is not bombarded with as many conscious impressions as it is during the day and is therefore comparatively calm
If we start meditating for half an hour and slowly increase it until we reach a whole hour that's a good program
Each week we could add ten minutes to the daily practice
After the meditation we can contemplate the five daily recollections
Now the mind is calm and collected and has more ability to reach an inner depth
All that is mine dear and delightful will change and vanish
The exact words do not matter that much
Words are concepts only the meaning counts the impermanence of our bodies of what we think we own such as people and belongings and being responsible for our own kamma
Another recollection is about having a loving and kind attitude towards oneself and others and to protect one's own happiness and wishing to same for all beings
Having reflected on these two aspects in a meaningful way we can keep three things in mind
First comes mindfulness bare attention to the prevailing mode of being
That can be a physical activity without the mind going astray or it may be a feeling or a thought which has arisen
Paying full attention not trying to bury it under discursive debris but knowing exactly what is happening in one's life
When physical activity does not demand our attention we can again direct thoughts to the fleeting aspects of our own lives and everyone else's and reflect what to do in the short time available
When we consider this correctly kindness lovingness and helpfulness arise as priorities
We need not help a lot of people all at once
Even helping one person maybe someone who lives in the same house is beneficial
It is the attitude and motivation that count not the results
Many people want to do some good but expect gratitude
That's spiritual materialism because they are aiming for a form of repayment for their goodness at least a very nice future life
That too is equivalent to getting pain not in the coin of the realm but through results
Both attitudes could be dropped and the realization reestablished that this is the only day I have let me use it to best advantage What is most important if I only have such a short time in this life Then we can act out of the understanding that in order to drew nearer to Nibbana we have to let go of selfconcern egocentricity selfaffirmation personal likes and dislikes because otherwise the ego will grow instead of diminish
As we affirm and confirm it more and more throughout this life it gets bigger and fatter instead of reducing itself
The more we think about our own importance our own cares and concerns the further away we get from Nibbana and the less chance for peace and happiness arises in our lives
If someone has a very fat body and tries to go through a narrow gate he might knock hisher body against either side and get hurt
If someone has an extremely fat ego she might knock against other people constantly and feel hurt other people's egos being the gate posts against which one knocks
If we have this kind of experience repeatedly we get to realize that it has nothing to do with other people but only concerns ourselves
If we start each day with these considerations and contemplations we will tend towards not being overly concerned with ourselves but trying to think of others
Naturally there is always the possibility of accidents
Accidents of nonmindfulness of not being attentive to what we are doing accidents of impetuous instinctive replies or in feeling sorry for ourselves
These occasions have to be seen for what they are namely accidents a lack of awareness
There's no blame to be attached to other people or to oneself
We can just see that at that particular moment we were not mindful and try to remedy it in the next moment
There's only the arahant who is fully enlightened who does not have accidents of that sort
The Buddha did not teach expression or suppression
But instead he taught that the only emotions which are worthwhile are the four supreme emotions and that everything else needs to be noticed and allowed to subside again
If anger arises it doesn't help to suppress or to express it
We have to know that the anger has arisen otherwise we'll never be able to change our reactions
We can watch it arising and ceasing
However this is difficult for most people anger doesn't subside fast enough
Instead we can immediately remember that to express anger means that particular day which really constitutes our whole life contains a very unfortunate occurrence and therefore we can try to substitute
It is much easier to substitute one emotion for another than to drop one altogether
Dropping means a deliberate action of letting go
As we have learned in meditation we can substitute discursive thinking with attention on the breath in daily living we substitute the unwholesome with the wholesome
Usually our anger arises towards other people
It's not so important to us what animals do nor what people do whom we don't know
Usually we are concerned with those whom we know and who are near to us
But since that is so we must also be familiar with some very good qualities of these people
Instead of dwelling upon any negative action of that person we can put our attention on something pleasant about them
Even though they may have just used words which we didn't like at other times they have said things which were fine
They have done good deeds and have shown love and compassion
It is a matter of changing one's focus of attention just as we learn to do in meditation
Until this becomes very habitual in meditation it will be difficult in daily life but diligent practice makes it happen
We practice in spite of any difficulty
If we remove our attention from one thing and put it somewhere else that's all we need to work with
We will be protecting ourselves from making bad kamma and spoiling our whole day
We may not have another day
The immediate resultants of all our thoughts speech and action are quite apparent
If we keep our attention focused we will know that wholesome emotions and thoughts bring peace and happiness whereas unwholesome ones bring the opposite
Only a fool makes himherself deliberately unhappy
Since we're not fools we'll try to eliminate all unwholesomeness in our thinking and emotions and try to substitute with the wholesome
All of us are looking for just one thing and that is happiness
Unhappiness can arise only through our own ideas and reactions
We are the makers of our own happiness and unhappiness and we can learn to have control over that
The better the meditation becomes the easier it will be because the mind needs muscle power to do this
A distracted mind has no strength no power
We cannot expect perfect results overnight but we can keep practicing
If we look back after having practiced for some time we will see a change
If we look back after only one or two days we may not find anything new within
It is like growing vegetables
If we put seeds in the ground and dig them up the next day all we will find is a seed
But if we tend the seeds and wait some time we will find a sprout or a plant
It's no use checking from moment to moment but it is helpful to check the past and see the changes taking place
At the end of each day it can be a good practice to make a balancesheet possibly even in writing
Any good shopkeeper will check out his merchandise at the end of the day and see which one was well accepted by the customers and which stayed on the shelves
He will not reorder the shelf items but only the merchandise that sold well
We can check our actions and reactions during the day and can see which ones were conductive to happiness for ourselves and others and which ones were rejected
We do not reorder the latter for the next day but just let them perish on the shelf
If we do that night after night we will always find the same actions accepted or rejected
Kindness warmth interest in others helpfulness concern and care are always accepted
Selfinterest dislike rejection arguments jealousy are always rejected
Just for one single day we can write down all our actions on the credit or debit side whether happinessproducing or not
As we do that we will find the same reactions to the same stimuli over and over again
This balance sheet will give a strong impetus to stop the preprogrammed unwholesome reactions
We have used them for years and lifetimes on end and they have always produced unhappiness
If we can check them out in writing or see them clearly in our minds we will surely try to change
Starting the day with the determination to be mindful contemplating the daily recollections realizing that this is the only day we have and using it most skillfully and then checking it out in the evening on the balance sheet will give us a whole lifetime in one day
If this is done carefully and habitually the next day which is our next life has the advantageous results
If we've had a day of arguments dislikes worries fears and anxiety the next day will be similar
But if we have had a day of lovingkindness helpfulness and concern for others we'll wake up with those same modes of being
Our last thought at night will become the first one in the morning
The kamma we inherit shows up the next day we don't need to wait for another lifetime
That's too nebulous
We do it now and see results the next day
Before going to sleep it's useful to practice lovingkindness meditation
Having done that as the very last thing at night it will be in one's mind first thing in the morning
The Buddha's words about lovingkindness were One goes to sleep happily one dreams no evil dreams and one wakes happily What more can one ask
Applying the same principles day after day there is no reason why our lives should not be harmonious
That way we're making the most of each day of our lives
If we don't do it nobody else will
No other person is interested in making the most of each day of our lives
Everyone is interested in making the most of their own lives
We cannot rely on anyone else for our own happiness
As far as our meditation practice is concerned we must not allow it to slide
Whenever that happens one has to start all over again
If one keeps doing it every day one can at least keep the standard attained in the retreat possibly improve on it
Just like an athlete who stops training has to start all over again in the same way the mind needs discipline and attention because it is the master of the inner household
There is nothing that can give us any direction except our own mind
We need to give it the possibility to relax to stop thinking for a little while to have a moment of peace and quiet so that it can renew itself
Without that renewal of energy it decays just the same as everything else does
If the mind is taken care of it will take care of us
This is a sketch of how to use one's day to day activity and practice
We must never think that Dhamma is for meditation courses or special days it is rather a way of life where we do not forget the impermanence and unsatisfactoriness of the world
We realize these truths within our own heart just thinking about them is useless
If we practice every day in this way we will find relief and release from our cares and worries because these are always connected with the world
The Dhamma transcends the world
Normally illness is something we all have but the type of illness where you can still do your work isn't recognized as illness
It's called the normal human state all over the world
Yet really when the body is in its normal state it's still ill in and of itself  simply that people in general are unaware of the fact that it's the deterioration of physical and mental phenomena continually from moment to moment
The way people get carried away with their thoughts and preoccupations while they're still strong enough to do this and do that That's really complacency
They're no match at all for people lying in bed ill
People lying in bed ill are lucky because they have the opportunity to do nothing but contemplate stress and pain
Their minds don't take up anything else don't go anywhere else
They can contemplate pain at all times  and let go of pain at all times as well
Don't you see the difference
The emptiness of the mind when you're involved in activities is play emptiness
Imitation emptiness
It's not the real thing
But to contemplate inconstancy stress and notselfness as it appears right inside you while you're lying right here is very beneficial for you
Just don't think that you're what's hurting
Simply see the natural phenomena of physical and mental events as they pass away pass away
They're not you
They're not really yours
You don't have any real control over them
Look at them
Exactly where do you have any control over them
This is true for everyone in the world
You're not the only one to whom it's happening
So whatever the disease there is in your body it isn't important
What's important is the disease in the mind
Normally we don't pay too much attention to the fact that we have diseases in our minds ie the diseases of defilement craving and attachment
We pay attention only to our physical diseases afraid of all the horrible things that can happen to the body
But no matter how much we try to stave things off with our fears when the time comes for things to happen no matter what medicines you have to treat the body they can give you only temporary respite
Even the people in the past who didn't suffer from heavy diseases are no longer with us
They've all had to part from their bodies in the end
So when you continually contemplate in this way it makes you see the truth of inconstancy stress and notselfness correctly within you
And you'll have to grow more and more disenchanted with things step by step
When you give it a try and let go who's there
Are you the one hurting or is it simply an affair of the Dhamma
You have to examine this very carefully to see that it's not really you that's hurting
The disease isn't your disease
It's a disease of the body a disease of physical form
In the end physical form and mental events have to change to be stressful in the change to be notself in the change and the stress
But you must focus on them watch them and contemplate them so that they're clear
Make this knowledge really clear and right there is where you'll gain release from all suffering and stress
Right there is where you'll put an end to all suffering and stress
As for the aggregates they'll continue to arise age grow ill and pass away in line with their own affairs
When their causes and conditions run out they die and go into their coffin
Some people when they're healthy and complacent die suddenly and unexpectedly without knowing what's happening to them
Their minds are completely oblivious to what's going on
This is much worse than the person lying ill in bed who has pain to contemplate as a means of developing disenchantment
So you don't have to be afraid of pain
If it's going to be there let it be there  but don't let the mind be in pain with it
And then look  right now  is the mind empty of me and mine
Keep looking on in
Keep looking on in so that things are really clear and that's enough
You don't have to go knowing anything anywhere else
When you can cure the disease or the pain lightens that's something normal
When it doesn't lighten that's normal too
But if the heart is simply empty of me and mine there will be no pain within it
As for the pain in the aggregates don't give it a second thought
So see yourself as lucky
Lying here dealing with the disease you have the opportunity to practice insight meditation with every moment
It doesn't matter whether you're here in the hospital or at home
Don't let there be any real sense in the mind that you're in the hospital or at home
Let the mind be in the emptiness empty of all labels and meanings
You don't have to label yourself as being anywhere at all
This is because the aggregates are not where you are
They're empty of any indwelling person
They're empty of any me or mine When the mind is like this it doesn't need anything at all
It doesn't have to be here or go there or anywhere at all
This is the absolute end of suffering and stress
The mind when it doesn't get engrossed with the taste of pleasure or pain is free in and of itself in line with its own nature
But I ask that you watch it carefully the behavior of this mind as it's empty in line with its own nature not concocting any desires for anything not wanting pleasure or trying to push away pain
When the mind is empty in line with its nature there's no sense of ownership in it there are no labels for itself
No matter what thoughts occur to it it sees them as insubstantial as empty of self
There's simply a sensation that then passes away
A sensation that then passes away and that's all
So you have to watch the phenomena that arise and pass away
In other words you have to watch the phenomenon of the present continuously  and the mind will be empty in that it gives no meanings or labels to the arising and passing away
As for the arising and passing away that's a characteristic of the aggregates that has to appear as part of their normal nature  simply that the mind isn't involved doesn't latch on
This is the point you can make use of
You can't go preventing pleasure and pain you can't keep the mind from labeling things and forming thoughts but you can put these things to a new use
If the mind labels a pain saying I hurt you have to read the label carefully contemplate it until you see that it's wrong
If the label were right it would have to say that the pain isn't me it's empty
Or if there's a thought that I'm in pain this type of thinking is also wrong
You have to take a new approach to your thinking to see that thinking is inconstant stressful and not yours
So whatever arises investigate and let go of what's right in front of you
Just make sure that you don't cling and the mind will keep on being empty in line with its nature
If no thoughts are bothering you there may be strong pain or the mind may be developing an abnormal mood but whatever is happening you have to look right in look all the way in to the sensation of the mind
Once you have a sense of the empty mind then if there's any disturbance any sense of irritation you'll know that the knowledge giving rise to it is wrong knowledge in and of itself
Right knowledge will immediately take over making the wrong knowledge disband
In order to hold continuously to this foundation of knowing you first have to start out by exercising restraint over the mind at the same time that you focus your attention and contemplate the phenomenon of stress and pain
Keep this up until the mind can maintain its stance in the clear emptiness of the heart
If you can do this all the way to the end the final disbanding of suffering will occur right there right where the mind is empty
But you have to keep practicing at this continuously
Whenever pain arises regardless of whether it's strong or not don't label it or give it any meaning
Even if pleasure arises don't label it as your pleasure
Just keep letting it go and the mind will gain release  empty of all clinging or attachment to selfness with each and every moment
You have to apply all your mindfulness and energy to this at all times
You should see yourself as fortunate that you're lying here ill contemplating pain for you have the opportunity to develop the Path in full measure gaining insight and letting things go
Nobody has a better opportunity than what you have right now
People running around engaged in their affairs Even if they say their minds are disengaged they're really no match for you
A person lying ill in bed has the opportunity to develop insight with every inandout breath
It's a sign that you haven't wasted your birth as a human being you know because you're practicing the teachings of the Lord Buddha to the point where you gain clear knowledge into the true nature of things in and of themselves
The true nature of things on the outside level refers to the phenomenon of the present the changing of the five aggregates
You can decipher their code decipher their code until you get disenchanted with them lose your taste for them and let them go
When the mind is in this state the next step is to contemplate it skillfully to see how it's empty all the way to the ultimate emptiness  the kind of emptiness that goes clearly into the true nature lying most deeply inside where there is no concocting of thoughts no arising no passing away no changing at all
When you correctly see the nature of things on the outer level until it is all clear to you the mind will let go let go
That's when you automatically see clearly the nature of what lies on the inner level  empty of all cycling through birth and death with nothing concocted at all The emptiest extreme of emptiness with no labels no meanings no clingings or attachments
All I ask is that you see this clearly within your own mind
The ordinary emptiness of the mind is useful on one level but that's not all there is
True emptiness is empty until it reaches the true nature of things on the inner level  something really worth ferreting out really worth coming to know
This is something you have to know for yourself There are really no words to describe it but we can talk about it by way of guidance because it may happen that ultimately you let go of everything in what's called disbanding without trace
The mind's point of disbanding without trace if you keep developing insight every day every moment like this will happen on its own
The mind will know on its own
So don't let the mind bother itself by getting preoccupied with pleasure or pain
Focus on penetrating into the mind in and of itself relentlessly
Do you see how different this is from when you're running around strong and healthy thinking about this that and the other thing This is why there's no harm in having lots of pain
The harm is in our stupidity in giving labels and meanings to things
People in general tend to reflect on the fleeting nature of life with reference to other people when someone else grows sick or dies but they rarely reflect on the fleeting nature of their own lives
Or else they reflect for just a moment and then forget all about it getting completely involved in their other preoccupations
They don't bring these truths inward to reflect on the inconstancy occurring within themselves with every moment
The fact that they can still do this and that think this and that say this and that makes them lose all perspective
When you practice insight meditation it's not something that you take a month or two off to do on a special retreat
That's not the real thing
It's no match for what you're doing right now for here you can do it all day every day and all night except when you sleep
Especially when the pain is strong it's really good for your meditation because it gives you the chance to know once and for all what inconstancy is like what stress and suffering are like what your inability to control things is like
You have to find out right here right in front of you so don't try to avoid the pain
Practice insight so as to see the true nature of pain its true nature as Dhamma and then keep letting it go
If you do this there's no way you can go wrong
This is the way to release from suffering
And it's something you have to do before you die you know not something you wait to do when you die or are just about to die
It's something you simply keep on doing keep on insighting When the disease lessens you insight it
When it grows heavy you insight it
If you keep on developing insight like this the mind will get over its stupidity and delusion
In other words things like craving and defilement won't dare hassle the mind the way they used to
So you have to give it your all  all your mindfulness all your energy  now that you have the opportunity to practice the Dhamma
Let this be your last lifetime
Don't let there be anything born again
If you're born again things will come back again just as they are now
The same old stuff over and over and over again
Once there's birth there has to be aging illness and death in line with your defilements experiencing the good and bad results they keep churning out
It's a cycle of suffering
So the best thing is to gain release from birth
Don't let yourself want anything any more
Don't let yourself want anything any more for all your wants fall in with what's inconstant stressful and notself
Wanting is simply a form of defilement and craving
You have to disband these things right at the instigator the wanting that's nothing but craving for sensuality craving for becoming or craving for no becoming  the germs of birth in the heart
So focus in and contemplate at the right spot seeing that even though craving may be giving rise to birth at sensory contact you can set your knowing right at the mind right at consciousness itself and let there just be the knowing that lets go of knowing
This is something to work at until you have it mastered
Setting your knowing at the mind letting go of knowing like this is something very beneficial
There's no getting stuck no grabbing hold of your knowledge or views
If the knowledge is right you let it go
If the knowledge is wrong you let it go
This is called knowing letting go of knowing without going and getting entangled
This kind of knowing keeps the mind from latching onto whatever arises
As soon as you know something you let it go
As soon as you know something you've let it go
The mind just keeps on staying empty  empty of mental formations and thoughts empty of every sort of illusion that could affect the mind
It quickly sees through them and lets them go knows and lets go without holding onto anything
All it has left is the emptiness
You've already seen results from your practice step by step from contemplating things and letting them go letting go even of the thought that you are the one in pain that you are the one who's dying
The pain and the dying are an affair of the aggregates pure and simple
When this knowledge is clear and sure  that it's not my affair there's no me in there  there's just an empty mind an empty mind empty of any label for itself
This is the nature of the mind free of the germs that used to make it assume this and that
They're dead now
Those germs are now dead because we've contemplated them
We've let go
We've set our knowing right at the mind and let go of whatever knowing has arisen all along to the point where the mind is empty
Clear
In and of itself
Consciousness when you're aware of it inwardly arises and passes away by its very own nature
There's no real essence to it  this is what you see when you look at the elemental property of consciousness pure and simple
When it's not involved with physical or mental phenomena it's simply aware of itself  aware pure and simple
That's called the mind pure and simple or the property of consciousness pure and simple in and of itself and it lets go of itself
When you're told to know and to let go of the knowing it means to know the consciousness that senses things and then lets go of itself
As for the aggregate of consciousness that's a troublemaking consciousness
The germs that keep piling things on lie in this kind of consciousness which wants to hang onto a sense of self
Even though it can let go of physical pain or of physical and mental events in general it still hangs onto a sense of self
So when you're told to know the letting go of knowing it means to let go of this kind of consciousness to the point where consciousness has no label for itself
That's when it's empty
If you understand this or can straighten out the heart and mind from this angle there won't be anything left
Pain suffering stress  all your preoccupations  will become entirely meaningless
There will be no sense of good or bad or anything at all
Dualities will no longer be able to have an effect
If you know in this way  the knowing that lets go of knowing consciousness pure and simple  it prevents any possible fashioning of the mind
The dualities that fashion good and bad There's really nothing to them
They arise and that's all there is to them they disband and that's all there is to them
So now we come to know the affairs of the dualities that fashion the mind into spirals that fashion the mind or consciousness into endless cycles
When you know the knowing that lets go of knowing right at consciousness in and of itself dualities have no more meaning
There's no more latching onto the labels of good and bad pleasure and pain true and false or whatever
You just keep on letting go
Even this knowing that lets go of knowing has no label for itself saying I know or I see But this is something that lies a little deep that you have to make an effort to see clearly and rightly
You have to keep looking in a shrewd way
The shrewdness of your looking That's something very important for only that can lead to Awakening
Your knowledge has to be shrewd
Skillful
Make sure that it's shrewd and skillful
Otherwise your knowledge of the true nature of things  on the inner or outer levels  won't really be clear
It'll get stuck on only the elementary levels of emptiness labeling and latching onto them in a way that just keeps piling things on
That kind of emptiness simply can't compare with this kind  the knowing that lets go of knowing right at consciousness pure and simple
Make sure that this kind of knowing keeps going continuously
If you slip for a moment just get right back to it
You'll see that when you don't latch onto labels and meanings thoughts of good and bad will just come to a stop
They'll disband
So when the Buddha tells us to see the world as empty this is the way we see
The emptiness lies in the fact that the mind doesn't give meaning to things doesn't fashion things doesn't cling
It's empty right at this kind of mind
Once you're correctly aware of this kind of empty mind you'll no longer get carried away by anything at all
But if you don't really focus down like this there will only be a little smattering of emptiness and then you'll find yourself getting distracted by this and that spoiling the emptiness
That kind of emptiness is emptiness in confusion
You're still caught up in confusion because you haven't contemplated down to the deeper levels
You simply play around with emptiness that's all
The deeper levels of emptiness require that you focus in and keep on looking until you're thoroughly clear about the true nature of things in the phenomenon of the present arising and disbanding right in front of you
This kind of mind doesn't get involved doesn't latch on to meanings or labels
If you see this kind of emptiness correctly there are no more issues no more labels for anything in this heap of physical and mental phenomena
When the time comes for it all to fall apart there's nothing to get excited about nothing to get upset about for that's the way it has to go by its nature
Only if we latch onto it will we suffer
The Dhamma is right here in our body and mind simply that we don't see it  or that we see it wrongly latching on and making ourselves suffer
If we look at things with the eyesight of mindfulness and discernment what is there to make us suffer
Why is there any need to fear pain and death
Even if we do fear them what do we accomplish
Physical and mental phenomena have to go their own way  inconstant in their own way stressful in their own way beyond our control in their own way
So what business do we have in reaching out and latching on and saying that their stress and pain is our stress and pain
If we understand that the latching on is what makes us suffer over and over again with each and every breath then all we have to do is let go and we'll see how there is release from suffering right before our very eyes
So keep on looking in to know in the way I've described right at the mind
But don't go labeling it as a mind or anything at all
Just let there be things as they are in and of themselves pure and simple
That's enough
You don't need to have any meanings or labels for anything at all
That will be the end of all suffering When things disband in the ultimate way they disband right at the point of the elemental property of consciousness free of the germs that will give rise to anything further
That's where everything comes to an end with no more rebirth or redeath of any kind at all
The practice is something you have to do for yourself
If you know things clearly and correctly with your own mindfulness and discernment that's your tool wellsharpened in hand
If the mind is trained to be sharp with mindfulness and discernment as its tool for contemplating itself then defilement craving and attachment will keep getting weeded out and cleared away
You can look and see from the amount you've already practiced Aren't they already cleared away to some extent
The mind doesn't have to worry about anything doesn't have to get involved with anything else
Let go of everything outside and then keep letting go until the mind lets go of itself
When you do this how can you not see the great worth of the Dhamma
So I ask that this mind empty of attachment empty of any sense of self whatsoever be clear to you until you see that it's nothing but Dhamma
Get so that it's nothing but Dhamma perfectly plain to your awareness
May this appear to you as it is on its own with each and every moment
Listening to the Dhamma when the mind has already reached a basic level of emptiness is very useful
It's like an energizing tonic for when we're sick there's bound to be pain disturbing us but if we don't pay it any attention it simply becomes an affair of the body without involving the mind at all
Notice this as you're listening The mind has let go of the pain to listen to the words leaving the pain to its own affairs
The mind is then empty
Once the mind honestly sees the truth that all compounded things are inconstant it will have to let go of its attachments
The problem here is that we haven't yet really seen this or haven't yet reflected on it in a skillful way
Once we do though the mind is always ready to grow radiant
Clear knowing makes the mind immediately radiant
So keep careful watch on things
Even if you don't know very much just be aware of the mind as it maintains a balance in its basic level of neutrality and emptiness
Then it won't be able to fashion the pains in the body into any great issues and you won't have to be attached to them
So keep your awareness of the pain right at the level where it's no more than a mere sensation in the body
It can be the body's pain but don't let the mind be in pain with it
If you do let the mind be in pain with it that will pile things on layer after layer
So the first step is to protect the mind to let things go then turn inward to look for the deepest most innermost part of your awareness and stay right there
You don't have to get involved with the pains outside
If you simply try to endure them they may be too much for you to endure
So look for the aspect of the mind that lies deep within and you'll be able to put everything else aside
Now if the pains are the sort that you can watch then make an effort to watch them
The mind will stay at its normal neutrality calm with its own inner emptiness watching the pain as it changes and passes away
But if the pain is too extreme then turn around and go back inside for if you can't handle it then craving is going to work its way into the picture wanting to push the pain away and to gain pleasure
This will keep piling on piling on putting the mind in a horrible turmoil
So start out by solving the problem right at hand
If the pain is sudden and sharp immediately turn around and focus all your attention on the mind
You don't want to have anything to do with the body anything to do with the pains in the body
You don't look at them you don't pay them any attention
Focus on staying with the innermost part of your awareness
Get to point where you can see the pure state of mind that isn't in pain with the body and keep it constantly clear
Once this is constantly clear then no matter how much pain there is in the body it's simply an affair of mental and physical events
The mind though isn't involved
It puts all these things aside
It lets go
When you're adept at this it's a very useful skill to have for the important things in life don't lie outside
They lie entirely within the mind
If we understand this properly we won't have to go out to grab this or that
We won't have to latch onto anything at all  because if we do latch on we simply cause ourselves needless suffering
The wellbeing of the mind lies at the point where it doesn't latch onto anything where it doesn't want anything
That's where our wellbeing lies  the point where all suffering and stress disband right at the mind
If we don't really understand things though the mind won't be willing to let things go
It will keep on holding tight for it finds so much flavor in things outside
Whatever involves pain and stress That's what it likes
We have to focus on contemplating and looking looking at the illusions in the mind the wrong knowledge and opinions that cover it up and keep us from seeing the aspect of the mind that's empty and still by its own internal nature
Focus on contemplating the opinions that give rise to the complicated attachments that bury the mind until it's in awful straits
See how mental events  feelings perceptions and thoughtformations  condition the mind condition the property of consciousness until it's in terrible shape
This is why it's so important to ferret out the type of knowing that lets go of knowing ie that knows the property of consciousness pure and simple when mental events haven't yet come in to condition it or when it hasn't gone out to condition mental events
Right here is where things get really interesting  in particular the thoughtformations that condition consciousness
They come from ignorance right
It's because of our not knowing or our wrong knowing that they're able to condition things
So I ask that you focus on this ignorance this notknowing
If you can know the characteristics of notknowing this same knowledge will know both the characteristics of thoughtformations as they go about their conditioning and how to disband them
This requires adroit contemplation because it's something subtle and deep
But no matter how subtle it may be the fact that we've developed our mindfulness and discernment to this point means that we have to take an interest in it
If we don't there's no way we can put an end to stress or gain release from it
Or if you want you can approach it like this Focus exclusively on the aspect of the mind that's constantly empty
If any preoccupations appear to it be aware of the characteristics of bare sensation when forms make contact with the eye or sounds with the ear and so forth
There's a bare sensation and then it disbands before it can have any such meaning as good or bad If there's just the bare sensation that then disbands there's no suffering
Be observant of the moment when forms make contact with the eye
With some things if you're not interested in them no feelings of liking or disliking arise
But if you get interested or feel that there's a meaning to the form sound smell taste or tactile sensation you'll notice that as soon as you give a meaning to these things attachment is already there
If you stop to look in this way you'll see that attachment is something subtle because it's there even in the simple act of giving meaning
If you look in a superficial way you won't see that it's attachment  even though that's what it is but in a subtle way
As soon as there's a meaning there's already attachment
This requires that you have to be good and observant  because in the contact at the eyes and ears that we take so much for granted many sleightsofhand happen all at once which means that we aren't aware of the characteristics of the consciousness that knows each individual sensation
We have to be very observant if we want to be able to know these things
If we aren't aware on this level everything will be tied up in attachment
These things will keep sending their reports into the mind conditioning and concocting all kinds of issues to leave the mind or consciousness in an utter turmoil
So if we want to look purely inside we have to be very very observant because things inside are subtle elusive and sensitive
When the mind seems empty and neutral That's when you really have to keep careful watch and control over it so as to see clearly the sensation of receiving contact
There's contact pure and simple then it disbands and the mind is empty
Neutral and empty
Once you know this you'll know what the mind is like when it isn't conditioned by the power of defilement craving and attachment
We can use this emptiness of the mind as our standard of comparison and it will do us a world of good
Ultimately you'll see the emptiness of all sensory contacts as in the Buddha's teaching that we should see the world as empty
What he meant is that we observe bare sensations simply arising and passing away knowing what consciousness is like when it does nothing more than receive contact
If you can see this the next step in the practice won't be difficult at all  because you've established neutrality right from the start
The act of receiving contact is no longer complicated The mind no longer grabs hold of things no longer feels any likes or dislikes
It's simply quiet and aware all around within itself at all times
Even if you can do this much you find that you benefit from not letting things get complex from not letting them concoct things through the power of defilement craving and attachment
Even just this much gets rid of lots of problems
Then when you focus further in to see the nature of all phenomena that are known through sensory contact you'll see that there's simply bare sensation with nothing at all worth getting attached to
If you look with the eyes of true mindfulness and discernment you'll have to see emptiness  even though the world is full of things
The eye sees lots of forms the ear hears lots of sounds you know but the mind no longer gives them meanings
At the same time things have no meanings in and of themselves
The only important thing is the mind
All issues come from the mind that goes out and gives things meanings and gives rise to attachment creating stress and suffering for itself
So you have to look until you see all the way through
Look outward until you see all the way out and inward until you see all the way in all the way until you penetrate inconstancy stress and notselfness
See things as they are in and of themselves in line with their own nature without any meanings or attachments
Then there won't be any issues
The mind will be empty  clean and bright  without your having to do anything to it
Now the fact that the mind has the viruses of ignorance or of the craving that gives rise to things easily means that we can't be careless
In the beginning you have to supervise things carefully so that you can see the craving that arises at the moment of contact  say when there's a feeling of pain
If you don't label it as meaning your pain craving won't get too much into the act
But if you do give it that meaning then there will be the desire to push the pain away or to have pleasure come in its place
All this even though we've never gotten anything true and dependable from desiring
The pleasure we get from our desires doesn't last
It fools us and then changes into something else
Pain fools us and then changes into something else
But these changes keep piling up and getting very complicated in the mind and this is what keeps the mind ignorant It's been conditioned in so many ways that it gets confused deluded dark and smoldering
All kinds of things are smoldering in here This is why the principle of the knowing that lets go of knowing is such an important tool
Whatever comes at you the knowing that lets go of knowing is enough to get you through
It takes care of everything
If you let it slip simply get back to the same sort of knowing
See for yourself how far it will take you how much it can keep the mind neutral and empty
You can come to see this bit by bit
In the moments when the mind isn't involved with very much when it's at a basic level of normalcy  empty quiet whatever  keep careful watch over it and analyze it as well
Don't let it just be in an oblivious state of indifference or else it will lose its balance
If you're in an oblivious state then as soon as there's contact at any of the sense doors there's sure to be attachment or craving giving rise to things the instant in which feeling appears
You have to focus on keeping watch of the changes the behavior of the mind at every moment
As soon as your mindfulness lapses get back immediately to your original knowing
We're all bound to have lapses  all of us  because the effluent of ignorance the most important of the effluents is still there in the mind
This is why we have to keep working at our watchfulness our investigation our focused awareness so that they keep getting clearer and clearer
Make your mind ripe in mindfulness and discernment continuously
Once they're ripe enough for you to know things in a skillful way you'll be able to disband the defilements the very minute they appear
As soon as you begin feeling likes and dislikes you can deal with them before they amount to anything
This makes things a lot easier
If you let them loose so that they condition the mind making it irritated murky and stirred up to the point where it shows in your words and actions then you're in terrible straits falling into hell in this very lifetime
The practice of the Dhamma requires that we be ingenious and circumspect right at the mind
The defilements are always ready to flatter us to work their way into our favor
If we aren't skillful in our awareness if we don't know how to keep the mind under careful supervision we'll be no match for them  for there are so many of them
But if we keep the mind well supervised the defilements will be afraid of us  afraid of our mindfulness and discernment afraid of our awareness
Notice when the mind is empty aware all around with no attachments to anything at all The defilements will hide out quiet as if they weren't there at all
But as soon as mindfulness slips even just a little they spring right up
They spring right up
If you recognize them for what they are the moment they spring up they'll disband right there
This is a very useful skill to have
But if we let them get to the point where they turn into issues they'll be hard to disband
That's when you have to bear with the fight and not give up
Whatever happens start out by bearing with it  not simply to endure it but so as to examine it to see what it's like how it changes how it passes away
We bear with things so that we can see through their deceits the way they arise persist and disband on their own
If they disband while we're examining them and clearly seeing their deceitfulness we can have done with them for good
This will leave the mind in a state of freedom and independence empty entirely within itself
If you can learn to see through things right away the moment they arise  what you might call your own little instantaneous awakenings  your aware ness will keep getting brighter and brighter stronger and more expansive all the time
So work at them  these little instantaneous understandings  and eventually when things come together in an appropriate way there will be the moment where there's the instantaneous cutting through of defilements and effluents once and for all
When that happens then  nibbana
No more taking birth
But if you haven't yet reached that point just keep sharpening your knives your mindfulness and discernment
If they're dull they won't be able to cut anything through but whatever shape they're in keep cutting through bit by bit whatever you can
I ask that you keep at this examining and understanding all around within the mind until you reach the point where everything is totally clear and you can let go of everything with the realization that nothing in the five aggregates or in physical and mental phenomena is me or mine
Keep trying to let go and that will be enough
Each moment as they're taking care of you here in the hospital do what has to be done for your illness but make sure that there's this separate special awareness exclusive to the mind  this knowing that simply lets go of itself
That will end all your problems right there
Those who practice the Dhamma should train themselves to understand in the following stages
The training that is easy to learn gives immediate results and is suitable for every time every place for people of every age and either sex is to study in the school of this body  a fathom long a cubit wide and a span thick  with its perceiving mind in charge
This body has many things ranging from the crude to the subtle that are well worth knowing
The steps of the training
To begin with know that the body is composed of various physical properties the major ones being the properties of earth water fire and wind the minor ones being the aspects that adhere to the major ones things like color smell shape etc
These properties are unstable stressful and unclean
If you look into them deeply you will see that there's no substance to them at all
They are simply impersonal conditions with nothing worth calling me or mine When you can clearly perceive the body in these terms you will be able to let go of any clinging or attachment to it as an entity your self someone else this or that
The second step is to deal with mental phenomena
Focus on keeping track of the truth that these are characterized by arising persisting and then disbanding
In other words their nature is to arise and disband arise and disband repeatedly
When you investigate to see this truth you will be able to let go of your attachments to mental phenomena as entities as your self someone else this or that
Training on the level of practice doesn't simply mean studying listening or reading
You have to practice so as to see clearly with your own mind in the following steps
a
Start out by brushing aside all external concerns and turn to look inside at your own mind until you can know in what ways it is clear or murky calm or unsettled
The way to do this is to have mindfulness and selfawareness in charge as you keep aware of the body and mind until you've trained the mind to stay firmly in a state of normalcy ie neutrality
b
Once the mind can stay in a state of normalcy you will see mental formations or preoccupations in their natural state of arising and disbanding
The mind will be empty neutral and still  neither pleased nor displeased  and will see physical and mental phenomena as they arise and disband naturally of their own accord
c
When the knowledge that there is no self to any of these things becomes thoroughly clear you will meet with something that lies further inside beyond all suffering and stress free from the cycles of change  deathless  free from birth as well as death since all things that take birth must by nature age grow ill and die
d
When you see this truth clearly the mind will be empty not holding onto anything
It won't even assume itself to be a mind or anything at all
In other words it won't latch onto itself as being anything of any sort
All that remains is a pure condition of Dhamma
e
Those who see this pure condition of Dhamma in full clarity are bound to grow disenchanted with the repeated sufferings of life
When they know the truth of the world and the Dhamma throughout they will see the results clearly right in the present that there exists that which lies beyond all suffering
They will know this without having to ask or take it on faith from anyone for the Dhamma is paccattam ie something really to be known for oneself
Those who have seen this truth within themselves will attest to it always
For those of you who have never sat in meditation here is how it's done Fold your legs one on top of the other but don't cut off the nerves or the blood flow or else the breath energy in your legs will stagnate and cause you pain
Sit straight and place your hands one on top of the other on your lap
Hold your head up straight and keep your back straight too  as if you had a yardstick sticking down your spine
You have to work at keeping it straight you know
Don't spend the time slouching down and then stretching up again or else the mind won't be able to settle down and be still
Keep the body straight and your mindfulness firm  firmly with the breath
However coarse or refined your breath may be simply breathe in naturally
You don't have to force the breath or tense your body
Simply breathe in and out in a relaxed way
Only then will the mind begin to settle down
As soon as the breath grows normally refined and the mind has begun to settle down focus your attention on the mind itself
If it slips off elsewhere or any thoughts come in to intrude simply know right there at the mind
Know the mind right at the mind with every inandout breath for the entire hour
When you focus on the breath using the breath as a leash to tie the mind in place so that it doesn't go wandering off you have to use your endurance
That is you have to endure pain
For example when you sit for a long time there's going to be pain because you've never sat for so long before
So first make sure that you keep the mind normal and neutral
When pain arises don't focus on the pain
Let go of it as much as you can
Let go of it and focus on your mind For those of you who've never done this before it may take a while
Whenever any pain or anything arises if the mind is affected by craving or defilement it'll struggle because it doesn't want the pain
All it wants is pleasure
This is where you have to be patient and endure the pain because pain is something that has to occur
If there's pleasure don't get enthralled with it
If there's pain don't push it away
Start out by keeping the mind neutral as your basic stance
Then whenever pleasure or pain arises don't get pleased or upset
Keep the mind continuously neutral and figure out how to let go
If there's a lot of pain you first have to endure it and then relax your attachments
Don't think of the pain as being your pain
Let it be the pain of the body the pain of nature
If the mind latches tight onto anything it really suffers
It struggles
So here we patiently endure and let go
You have to practice so that you're really good at handling pain
If you can let go of physical pain you'll be able to let go of all sorts of other sufferings and pains as well Keep watching the pain knowing the pain letting it go
Once you can let it go you don't have to use a lot of endurance
It takes a lot of endurance only at the beginning
Once the pain arises separate the mind from it
Let it be the pain of the body
Don't let the mind be pained too
This is something that requires equanimity
If you can maintain equanimity in the face of pleasure or pain it can make the mind peaceful  peaceful even though the pain is still pain
The mind keeps knowing enduring the pain so as to let it go
After you've worked at this a good while you'll come to see how important the ways of the mind are
The mind may be hard to train but if you keep training it  if you have the time you can practice at home at night or early in the morning keeping watch on your mind  you'll gain the understanding that comes from mindfulness and discernment
Those who don't train the mind like this go through life  birth aging illness and death  not knowing a thing about the mind at all
When you know your own mind then when any really heavy illness comes along the fact that you know your mind will make the pain less and less
But this is something you have to work at doing correctly
It's not easy yet once the mind is well trained there's no match for it
It can do away with pain and suffering and doesn't get restless and agitated
It grows still and cool  refreshed and blooming right there within itself
So try to experience this still quiet mind
This is a really important skill to develop because it will make craving defilement and attachment grow weaker and weaker
All of us have defilements you know
Greed anger and delusion cloud all of our hearts
If we haven't trained ourselves in meditation our hearts are constantly burning with suffering and stress
Even the pleasure we feel over external things is pleasure only in halfmeasures because there's suffering and stress in the delusion that thinks it's pleasure
As for the pleasure that comes from the practice it's a cool pleasure that lets go of everything really free from any sense of me or mine I ask that you reach the Dhamma that's the real meat inside this thing undisturbed by defilement undisturbed by pain or anything else
Even though there's pain in the body you have to figure out how to let it go
The body's simply the four elements  earth water wind and fire
It has to keep showing its inconstancy and stressfulness so keep your mindfulness neutral at equanimity
Let the mind be above its feelings  above pleasure above pain above everything
All it really takes is endurance  endurance and relinquishment letting things go seeing that they're not us not ours
This is a point you have to hammer at over and over again
When we say you have to endure you really have to endure
Don't be willing to surrender
Craving is going to keep coming up and whispering  telling you to change things to try for this or that kind of pleasure  but don't you listen to it
You have to listen to the Buddha  the Buddha who tells you to let go of craving
Otherwise craving will plaster and paint things over the mind will struggle and won't be able to settle down
So you have to give it your all
Look at this hour as a special hour  special in that you're using special endurance to keep watch on your own heart and mind
The most important thing in the daily life of a person who practices the Dhamma is to keep to the precepts and to care for them more than you care for your life  to maintain them in a way that the Noble Ones would praise
If you don't have this sort of regard for the precepts then the vices that run counter to them will become your everyday habits
Meditators who see that the breaking of a precept is something trifling and insignificant spoil their entire practice
If you can't practice even these basic beginning levels of the Dhamma it will ruin all the qualities you'll be trying to develop in the later stages of the practice
This is why you have to stick to the precepts as your basic foundation and to keep a lookout for anything in your behavior that falls short of them
Only then will you be able to benefit from your practice for the sake of eliminating your sufferings with greater and greater precision
If you simply act in line with the cravings and desires swelling out of the sense of self that has no fear of the fires of defilement you'll have to suffer both in this life and in lives to come
If you don't have a sense of conscience  a sense of shame at the thought of doing shoddy actions and a fear of their consequences  your practice can only deteriorate day by day
When people live without any order to their lives  without even the basic order that comes with the precepts  there's no way they can attain purity
We have to examine ourselves In what ways at present are we breaking our precepts in thought word or deed
If we simply let things pass and aren't intent on examining ourselves to see the harm that comes from breaking the precepts and following the defilements our practice can only sink lower and lower
Instead of extinguishing defilements and suffering it will simply succumb to the power of craving
If this is the case what damage is done
How much freedom does the mind lose
These are things we have to learn for ourselves
When we do our practice of selfinspection in higher matters will get solid results and won't go straying off into nonsense
For this reason whenever craving or defilement shows itself in any way in any of our actions we have to catch hold of it and examine what's going on inside the mind
Once we're aware with real mindfulness and discernment we'll see the poison and power of the defilements
We'll feel disgust for them and want to extinguish them as much as we can
But if we use our defilements to examine things they'll say everything is fine
The same as when we're predisposed to liking a certain person Even if he acts badly we say he's good
If he acts wrongly we say he's right
This is the way the defilements are
They say that everything we do is right and throw all the blame on other people other things
So we can't trust it  this sense of self in which craving and defilement lord it over the heart
We can't trust it at all
The violence of defilement or this sense of self is like that of a fire burning a forest or burning a house
It won't listen to anyone but simply keeps burning away burning away inside of you
And that's not all
It's always out to set fire to other people too
The fires of suffering the fires of defilement consume all those who don't contemplate themselves or who don't have any means of practice for putting them out
People of this sort can't withstand the power of the defilements can't help but follow along wherever their cravings lead them
The moment they're provoked they follow in line with these things
This is why the sensations in the mind when provoked by defilement are very important for they can lead you to do things with no sense of shame no fear for the consequences of doing evil at all  which means that you're sure to break your precepts
Once you've followed the defilements they feel really satisfied  like arsonists who feel gleeful when they've set other people's places on fire
As soon as you've called somebody something vile or spread some malicious gossip the defilements really like it
Your sense of self really likes it because acting in line with defilement like that gives it real satisfaction
As a consequence it keeps filling itself with the vices that run counter to the precepts falling into hell in this very lifetime without realizing it
So take a good look at the violence the defilements do to you to see whether you should keep socializing with them to see whether you should regard them as your friends or your enemies
As soon as any wrong views or ideas come out of the mind we have to analyze them and turn around so as to catch sight of the facts within us
No matter what issues the defilements raise focusing on the faults of others we have to turn around and look within
When we realize our own faults and can come to our senses That's where our study of the Dhamma our practice of the Dhamma shows its real rewards
The passage for reflection on the four requisites is a fine pattern for contemplation but we never actually get down to putting it to use
We're taught to memorize it in the beginning not simply to pass the time of day or so that we can talk about it every now and then but so that we can use it to contemplate the requisites until we really know them with our own mindfulness and discernment
If we actually get down to contemplating in line with the established pattern our minds will become much less influenced by unwise thoughts
But it's the rare person who genuinely makes this a continuous practice For the most part we're not interested
We don't feel like contemplating this sort of thing
We'd much rather contemplate whether this or that food will taste good or not and if it doesn't taste good how to fix it so that it will
That's the sort of thing we like to contemplate
Try to see the filthiness of food and of the physical properties in general to see their emptiness of any real entity or self
There's nothing of any substance to the physical properties of the body which are all rotten and decomposing
The body is like a restroom over a cesspool
We can decorate it on the outside to make it pretty and attractive but on the inside it's full of the most horrible filthy things
Whenever we excrete anything we ourselves are repelled by it yet even though we're repelled by it it's there inside us in our intestines  decomposing full of worms awful smelling
There's just the flimsiest membrane covering it up yet we fall for it and hold tight to it
We don't see the constant decomposition of this body in spite of the filth and smells it sends out
The reason we're taught to memorize the passage for reflecting on the requisites and to use it to contemplate is so that we'll see the inconstancy of the body to see that there's no self to any of it or to any of the mental phenomena we sense with every moment
We contemplate mental phenomena to see clearly that they're notself to see this with every moment
The moments of the mind  the arising persisting and disbanding of mental sensations  are very subtle and fast
To see them the mind has to be quiet
If the mind is involved in distractions thoughts and imaginings we won't be able to penetrate in to see its characteristics as it deals with its objects to see what the arising and disbanding within it is like
This is why we have to practice concentration to make the mind quiet to provide a foundation for our contemplation
For instance you can focus on the breath or be aware of the mind as it focuses on the breath
Actually when you focus on the breath you're also aware of the mind
And again the mind is what knows the breath
So you focus exclusively on the breath together with the mind
Don't think of anything else and the mind will settle down and grow still
Once it attains stillness on this level you've got your chance to contemplate
Making the mind still so that you can contemplate it is something you have to keep working at in the beginning
The same holds true with training yourself to be mindful  alert in all your activities
This is something you really have to work at continuously in this stage something you have to do all the time
At the same time you have to arrange the external conditions of your life so that you won't have any concerns to distract you
Now of course the practice is something you can do in any set of circumstances  for example when you come home from work you can sit and meditate for a while  but when you're trying seriously to make it continuous to make it habitual it's much more difficult than that
Making it habitual means being fully mindful and aware with each inandout breath wherever you go whatever you do whether you're healthy sick or whatever and regardless of what happens inside or out
The mind has to be in a state of allencompassing awareness while keeping track of the arising and disbanding of mental phenomena at all times  to the point where you can stop the mind from forming thoughts under the power of craving and defilement the way it used to before you began the practice
Try keeping your awareness with the breath to see what the still mind is like
It's very simple all the rules have been laid out but when you actually try to do it something resists
It's hard
But when you let your mind think or things no matter what it's all easy
It's not hard at all
Try and see if you can engage your mind with the breath in the same way it's been engaged with the defilements
Try engaging it with the breath and see what happens
See if you can disperse the defilements with every inandout breath
Why is it that the mind can stay engaged with the defilements all day long and yet go for entire days without knowing how heavy or subtle the breath is at all
So try and be observant
The bright clear awareness that stems from staying focused on the mind at all times Sometimes a strong sensory contact comes and can make it blur and fade away with no trouble at all
But if you can keep hold of the breath as a reference point that state of mind can be more stable and sure more insured
It has two fences around it
If there's only one fence it can easily break
Normally the mind isn't willing to stop and look to stop and know itself which is why we have to keep training it continually so that it will settle down from its restlessness and grow still
Let your desires and thoughtprocesses settle down
Let the mind take its stance in a state of normalcy not liking or disliking anything
To reach a basic level of emptiness and freedom you first have to take a stance
If you don't have a stance against which to measure things progress will be very difficult
If your practice is hitormiss  a bit of that a little of this  you won't get any results
So the mind first has to take a stance
When you take a stance that the mind can maintain in a state of normalcy don't go slipping off into the future
Have the mind know itself in the stance of the present Right now it's in a state of normalcy
No likes or dislikes have arisen yet
It hasn't created any issues
It's not being disturbed by a desire for this or that
Then look on in to the basic level of the mind to see if it's as normal and empty as it should be
If you're really looking inside really aware inside then that which is looking and knowing is mindfulness and discernment in and of itself
You don't need to search for anything anywhere else to come and do your looking for you
As soon as you stop to look stop to know whether or not the mind is in a state of normalcy then if it's normal you'll know immediately that it's normal
If it's not you'll know immediately that it's not
Take care to keep this awareness going
If you can keep knowing like this continuously the mind will be able to keep its stance continuously as well
As soon as the thought occurs to you to check things out you'll immediately stop to look stop to know without any need to go searching for knowledge from anywhere else
You look you know right there at the mind and can tell whether or not it's empty and still
Once you see that it is then you investigate to see how it's empty how it's still
It's not the case that once it's empty that's the end of the matter once it's still that's the end of the matter
That's not the case at all
You have to keep watch of things you have to investigate at all times
Only then will you see the changing  the arising and disbanding  occurring in that emptiness that stillness that state of normalcy
To lead your daily life by keeping constant supervision over the mind is a way of learning what life is for
It's a way of learning how we can act so as to rid ourselves more and more of suffering and stress  because the suffering and stress caused by defilement attachment and craving are sure to take all sorts of forms
Only by being aware with true mindfulness and discernment can we comprehend them for what they are
Otherwise we'll simply live obliviously going wherever events will lead us
This is why mindfulness and discernment are tools for reading yourself for testing yourself within so that you won't be careless or complacent oblivious to the fact that suffering is basically what life is all about
This point is something we really have to comprehend so that we can live without being oblivious
The pains and discontent that fill our bodies and minds all show us the truths of inconstancy stress and notselfness within us
If you contemplate what's going on inside until you can get down to the details you'll see the truths that appear within and without all of which come down to inconstancy stress and notselfness
But the delusion basic to our nature will see everything wrongly  as constant easeful and self  and so make us live obliviously even though there is nothing to guarantee how long our lives will last
Our dreams and delusions make us forget that we live in the midst of a mass of pain and stress  the stress of defilements the pain of birth
Birth aging illness and death All of these are painful and stressful in the midst of instability and change
They're things we have no control over for they must circle around in line with the laws of kamma and the defilements we've been amassing all along
Life that floats along in the round of rebirth is thus nothing but stress and pain
If we can find a way to develop our mindfulness and discernment they'll be able to cut the round of rebirth so that we won't have to keep wandering on
They'll help us know that birth is painful aging is painful illness is painful death is painful and that these are all things that defilement attachment and craving keep driving through the cycles of change
So as long as we have the opportunity we should study the truths appearing throughout our body and mind and we'll come to know that the elimination of stress and pain the elimination of defilement is a function of our practice of the Dhamma
If we don't practice the Dhamma we'll keep floating along in the round of rebirth that is so drearily repetitious  repetitious in its birth aging illness and death driven on by defilement attachment and craving causing us repeated stress repeated pain
Living beings for the most part don't know where these stresses and pains come from or what they come from because they've never studied them never contemplated them so they stay stupid and deluded wandering on and on without end
If we can stop and be still the mind will have a chance to be free to contemplate its sufferings and to let them go
This will give it a measure of peace because it will no longer want anything out of the round of rebirth  for it sees that there's nothing lasting to it that it's simply stress over and over again
Whatever you grab hold of is stress
This is why you need mindfulness and discernment to know and see things for yourself so that you can supervise the mind and keep it calm without letting it fall victim to temptation
This practice is something of the highest importance
People who don't study or practice the Dhamma have wasted their birth as human beings because they're born deluded and simply stay deluded
But if we study the Dhamma we'll become wise to suffering and know the path of practice for freeing ourselves from it
Once we follow the right path the defilements won't be able to drag us around won't be able to burn us because we're the ones burning them away
We'll come to realize that the more we can burn them away the more strength of mind we'll gain
If we let the defilements burn us the mind will be sapped of its strength which is why this is something you have to be very careful about
Keep trying to burn away the defilements in your every activity and you'll be storing up strength for your mindfulness and discernment so that they'll be brave in dealing with all sorts of suffering and pain
You must come to see the world as nothing but stress
There's no real ease to it at all
The awareness we gain from mindfulness and discernment will make us disenchanted with life in the world because it will see things for what they are in every way both within us and without
The entire world is nothing but an affair of delusion an affair of suffering
People who don't know the Dhamma don't practice the Dhamma  no matter what their status or position in life  lead deluded oblivious lives
When they fall ill or are about to die they're bound to suffer enormously because they haven't taken the time to understand the defilements that burn their hearts and minds in everyday life
Yet if we make a constant practice of studying and contemplating ourselves as our everyday activity it will help free us from all sorts of suffering and distress
And when this is the case how can we not want to practice
Only intelligent people though will be able to stick with the practice
Foolish people won't want to bother
They'd much rather follow the defilements than burn them away
To practice the Dhamma you need a certain basic level of intelligence  enough to have seen at least something of the stresses and sufferings that come from defilement
Only then can your practice progress
And no matter how difficult it gets you'll have to keep practicing on to the end
This practice isn't something you do from time to time you know
You have to keep at it continuously throughout life
Even if it involves so much physical pain or mental anguish that tears are bathing your cheeks you have to keep with the chaste life because you're playing for real
If you don't follow the chaste life you'll get mired in heaps of suffering and flame
So you have to learn your lessons from pain
Try to contemplate it until you can understand it and let it go and you'll gain one of life's greatest rewards
Don't think that you were born to gain this or that level of comfort
You were born to study pain and the causes of pain and to follow the practice that frees you from pain
This is the most important thing there is
Everything else is trivial and unimportant
What's important all lies with the practice
Don't think that the defilements will go away easily
When they don't come in blatant forms they come in subtle ones  and the dangers of the subtle ones are hard to see
Your contemplation will have to be subtle too if you want to get rid of them
You'll come to realize that this practice of the Dhamma in which we contemplate to get to the details inside us is like sharpening our tools so that when stress and suffering arise we can weaken them and cut them away
If your mindfulness and discernment are brave the defilements will have to lose out to them
But if you don't train your mindfulness and discernment to be brave the defilements will crush you to pieces
We were born to do battle with the defilements and to strengthen our mindfulness and discernment
We'll find that the worth of our practice will grow higher and higher because in our everyday life we've done continuous battle with the stresses and pains caused by defilement craving and temptation all along  so that the defilements will grow thin and our mindfulness and discernment stronger
We'll sense within ourselves that the mind isn't as troubled and restless as it used to be
It's grown peaceful and calm
The stresses and sufferings of defilement attachment and craving have grown weaker
Even though we haven't yet wiped them out completely they've grown continually weaker  because we don't feed them
We don't give them shelter
We do what we can to weaken them so that they grow thinner and thinner each time
And we have to be brave in contemplating stress and pain because when we don't feel any great suffering we tend to get complacent
But when the pains and sufferings in our body and mind grow sharp and biting we have to use our mindfulness and discernment to be strong
Don't let your spirits be weak
Only then will you be able to do away with your sufferings and pains
We have to learn our lessons from pain so that ultimately the mind can gain its freedom from it instead of being weak and losing out to it all of the time
We have to be brave in doing battle with it to the ultimate extreme  until we reach the point where we can let it go
Pain is something always present in this conglomerate of body and mind
It's here for us to see with every moment
If we contemplate it till we know all its details we can then make it our sport seeing that the pain is the pain of natural conditions and not our pain
This is something we have to research so as to get to the details that it's not our pain it's the pain of the aggregates
Knowing in this way means that we can separate out the properties  the properties of matter and those of the mind  to see how they interact with one another how they change
It's something really fascinating Watching pain is a way of building up lots of mindfulness and discernment
But if you focus on pleasure and ease you'll simply stay deluded like people in general
They get carried away with the pleasure that comes from watching or listening to the things they like  but then when pain comes to their bodies and minds to the point where tears are bathing their cheeks think of how much they suffer
And then they have to be parted from their loved ones which makes it even worse
But those of us who practice the Dhamma don't need to be deluded like that because we know and see with every moment that only stress arises only stress persists only stress passes away
Aside from stress nothing arises aside from stress nothing passes away
This is there for us to perceive with every moment
If we contemplate it we'll see it
So we can't let ourselves be oblivious
This is what the truth is and we have to study it so as to know it  especially in our life of the practice
We have to contemplate stress all the time to see its every manifestation
The arahants live without being oblivious because they know the truth at all times and their hearts are clean and pure
As for us with our defilements we have to keep trying because if we continually supervise the mind with mindfulness and discernment we'll be able to keep the defilements from making it dirty and obscured
Even if it does become obscured in any way we'll be able to remove that obscurity and make the mind empty and free
This is the practice that weakens all the defilements attachments and cravings within us
It's because of this practice of the Dhamma that our lives will become free
So I ask you to keep working at the practice without being complacent because if in whatever span of life is left to you you keep trying to the full extent of your abilities you'll gain the mindfulness and discernment to see the facts within yourself and be able to let go  free from any sense of self free from any sense of self  continuously
The mind if mindfulness and awareness are watching over it won't meet with any suffering as the result of its actions
If suffering does arise we'll be immediately aware of it and able to put it out
This is one point of the practice we can work at constantly
And we can test ourselves by seeing how refined and subtle our allaround awareness is inside the mind
Whenever the mind slips away and goes out to receive external sensory contact Can it maintain its basic stance of mindfulness or internal awareness
The practice we need to work at in our everyday life is to have constant mindfulness constant allaround present awareness like this
This is something we work at in every posture sitting standing walking and lying down
Make sure that your mindfulness stays continuous
Living in this world  the mental and physical phenomena of these five aggregates  gives us plenty to contemplate
We must try to watch them to contemplate them so that we can understand them  because the truths we must learn how to read in this body and mind are here to be read with every moment
We don't have to get wrapped up with any other extraneous themes because all the themes we need are right here in the body and mind
As long as we can keep the mind constantly aware all around we can contemplate them
If you contemplate mental and physical events to see how they arise and disband right in the here and now and don't get involved with external things  like sights making contact with the eyes or sounds with the ears  then there really aren't a lot of issues
The mind can be at normalcy at equilibrium  calm and undisturbed by defilement or the stresses that come from sensory contact
It can look after itself and maintain its balance
You'll come to sense that if you're aware right at awareness in and of itself without going out to get involved in external things like the mental labels and thoughts that will tend to arise the mind will see their constant arising and disbanding  and won't be embroiled in anything
This way it can be disengaged empty and free
But if it goes out to label things as good or evil as me or mine or gets attached to anything it'll become unsettled and disturbed
You have to know that if the mind can be still totally and presently aware and capable of contemplating with every activity then blatant forms of suffering and stress will dissolve away
Even if they start to form you can be alert to them and disperse them immediately
Once you see this actually happening  even in only the beginning stages  it can disperse a lot of the confusion and turmoil in your heart
In other words don't let yourself dwell on the past or latch onto thoughts of the future
As for the events arising and passing away in the present you have to leave them alone
Whatever your duties simply do them as you have to  and the mind won't get worked up about anything
It will be able to at least some extent to be empty and still
This one thing is something you have to be very careful about
You have to see this for yourself that if your mindfulness and discernment are constantly in charge the truths of the arising and disbanding of mental and physical phenomena are always there for you to see always there for you to know
If you look at the body you'll have to see it simply as physical properties
If you look at feelings you'll have to see them as changing and inconstant pleasure pain neither pleasure nor pain
To see these things is to see the truth within yourself
Don't let yourself get caught up with your external duties
Simply keep watch in this way inside
If your awareness is the sort that lets you read yourself correctly the mind will be able to stay at normalcy at equilibrium at stillness without any resistance
If the mind can stay with itself and not go out looking for things to criticize or latch onto it can maintain a natural form of stillness
So this is something we have to try for in our every activity
Keep your conversations to a minimum and there won't be a whole lot of issues
Keep watch right at the mind
When you keep watch at the mind and your mindfulness is continuous your senses can stay restrained
Being mindful to keep watch in this way is something you have to work at
Try it and see Can you keep this sort of awareness continuous
What sort of things can still get the mind engaged
What sorts of thoughts and labels of good and bad me and mine does it think up
Then look to see if these things arise and disband
The sensations that arise from external contact and internal contact all have the same sorts of characteristics
You have to look till you can see this
If you know how to look you'll see it  and the mind will grow calm
So the point we have to practice in this latter stage doesn't have a whole lot of issues
There's nothing you have to do nothing you have to label nothing you have to think a whole lot about
Simply look carefully and contemplate and in this very lifetime you'll have a chance to be calm and at peace to know yourself more profoundly within
You'll come to see that the Dhamma is amazing right here in your own heart
Don't go searching for the Dhamma outside for it lies within
Peace lies within but we have to contemplate so that we're aware all around  subtly deep down
If you look just on the surface you won't understand anything
Even if the mind is at normalcy on the ordinary everyday level you won't understand much of anything at all
You have to contemplate so that you're aware all around in a skillful way
The word skillful is something you can't explain with words but you can know for yourself when you see the way in which awareness within the heart becomes special when you see what this special awareness is about
This is something you can know for yourself
And there's not really much to it simply arising persisting disbanding
Look until this becomes plain  really really plain  and everything disappears
All suppositions all conventional formulations all those aggregates and properties get swept away leaving nothing but awareness pure and simple not involved with anything at all  and there's nothing you have to do to it
Simply stay still and watch be aware letting go with every moment
Simply watching this one thing is enough to do away with all sorts of defilements all sorts of suffering and stress
If you don't know how to watch it the mind is sure to get disturbed
It's sure to label things and concoct thoughts
As soon as there's contact at the senses it'll go looking for things to latch onto liking and disliking the objects it meets in the present and then getting involved with the past and future spinning a web to entangle itself
If you truly look at each moment in the present there's really nothing at all
You'll see with every mental moment that things disband disband disband  really nothing at all
The important point is that you don't go forming issues out of nothing
The physical elements perform their duties in line with their elementary physical nature
The mental elements keep sensing in line with their own affairs
But our stupidity is what goes looking for issues to cook up to label to think about
It goes looking for things to latch onto and then gets the mind into a turmoil
This point is all we really have to see for ourselves
This is the problem we have to solve for ourselves
If things are left to their nature pure and simple there's no us no them This is a singular truth that will arise for us to know and see
There's nothing else we can know or see that can match it in any way
Once you know and see this one thing it extinguishes all suffering and stress
The mind will be empty and free with no meanings no attachments for anything at all
This is why looking inward is so special in so many ways
Whatever arises simply stop still to look at it
Don't get excited by it
If you become excited when any special intuitions arise when the mind is still you'll get the mind worked up into a turmoil
If you become afraid that this or that will happen that too will get you in a turmoil
So you have to stop and look stop and know
The first thing is simply to look
The first thing is simply to know
And don't latch onto what you know  because whatever it is it's simply a phenomenon that arises and disbands arises and disbands changing as part of its nature
So your awareness has to take a firm stance right at the mind in and of itself
In the beginning stages you have to know that when mindfulness is standing firm the mind won't be affected by the objects of sensory contact
Keep working at maintaining this stance holding firm to this stance
If you gain a sense of this for yourself really knowing and seeing for yourself your mindfulness will become even more firm
If anything arises in any way at all you'll be able to let it go  and all the many troubles and turmoils of the mind will dissolve away
If mindfulness slips and the mind goes out giving meanings to anything latching onto anything troubles will arise so you have to keep checking on this with every moment
There's nothing else that's so worth checking on
You have to keep check on the mind in and of itself contemplating the mind in and of itself
Or else you can contemplate the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves or the phenomenon of arising and disbanding  ie the Dhamma  in and of itself
All of these things are themes you can keep track of entirely within yourself
You don't have to keep track of a lot of themes because having a lot of themes is what will make you restless and distracted
First you'll practice this theme then you'll practice that then you'll make comparisons all of which will keep the mind from growing still
If you can take your stance at awareness if you're skilled at looking the mind can be at peace
You'll know how things arise and disband
First practice keeping awareness right within yourself so that your mindfulness can be firm without being affected by the objects of sensory contact so that it won't label things as good or bad pleasing or displeasing
You have to keep checking to see that when the mind can be at normalcy centered and neutral as its primary stance then  whatever it knows or sees  it will be able to contemplate and let go
The sensations in the mind that we explain at such length are still on the level of labels
Only when there can be awareness right at awareness will you really be able to know that the mind that is aware of awareness in this way doesn't send its knowing outside of this awareness
There are no issues
Nothing can be concocted in the mind when it knows in this way
In other words
The only thing you have to work at maintaining is the state of mind at normalcy  knowing seeing and still in the present
If you don't maintain it if you don't keep looking after it then when sensory contact comes it will have an effect
The mind will go out with labels of good and bad liking and disliking
So make sure you maintain the basic awareness that's aware right at yourself
And don't let there be any labeling
No matter what sort of sensory contact comes you have to make sure that this awareness comes first
If you train yourself correctly in this way everything will stop
You won't go straying out through your senses of sight hearing etc
The mind will stop and look stop and be aware right at awareness so as to know the truth that all things arise and disband
There's no real truth to anything
Only our stupidity is what latches onto things giving them meanings and then suffering for it  suffering because of its ignorance suffering because of its unacquaintance with the five aggregates  form feelings perceptions thoughtformations and consciousness  all of which are inconstant stressful and notself
Use mindfulness to gather your awareness together and the mind will stop getting unsettled stop running after things
It will be able to stop and be still
Then make it know in this way see in this way constantly  at every moment with every activity
Work at watching and knowing the mind in and of itself That will be enough to cut away all sorts of issues
You won't have to concern yourself with them
If the body is in pain simply keep watch of it
You can simply keep watch of feelings in the body because the mind that's aware of itself in this way can keep watch of anything within or without
Or it can simply be aware of itself to the point where it lets go of things outside lets go of sensory contact and keeps constant watch on the mind in and of itself
That's when you'll know that this is what the mind is like when it's at peace It doesn't give meanings to anything
It's the emptiness of the mind unattached uninvolved unconcerned with anything at all
These words  unattached uninvolved and unconcerned  are things you have to consider carefully because what they refer to is subtle and deep
Uninvolved means uninvolved with sensory contact undisturbed by the body or feelings
Unconcerned means not worried about past future or present
You have to contemplate these things until you know them skillfully
Even though they're subtle you have to contemplate them until you know them thoroughly
And don't go concerning yourself with external things because they'll keep you unsettled keep you running keep you distracted with labels and thoughts of good and bad and all that sort of thing
You have to put a stop to these things
If you don't your practice won't accomplish anything because these things keep playing up to you and deceiving you  ie once you see anything it will fool you into seeing it as right wrong good bad and so forth
Eventually you have to come down to the awareness that everything simply arises persists and then disbands
Make sure you stay focused on the disbanding
If you watch just the arising you may get carried off on a tangent but if you focus on the disbanding you'll see emptiness Everything is disbanding every instant
No matter what you look at no matter what you see it's there for just an instant and then disbands
Then it arises again
Then it disbands
There's simply arising knowing disbanding
So let's watch what happens of its own accord  because the arising and disbanding that occurs by way of the senses is something that happens of its own accord
You can't prevent it
You can't force it
If you look and know it without attachment there will be none of the harm that comes from joy or sorrow
The mind will stay in relative normalcy and neutrality
But if you're forgetful and start latching on labeling things in pairs in any way at all  good and bad happy and sad pleasing and displeasing  the mind will become unsettled no longer empty no longer still
When this happens you have to probe on in to know why
All the worthless issues that arise in the mind have to be cut away
Then you'll find that you have less and less to say less and less to talk about less and less to think about
These things grow less and less on their own
They stop on their own
But if you get involved in a lot of issues the mind won't be able to stay still
So we have to keep watching things that are completely worthless and without substance to see that they're notself
Keep watching them repeatedly because your awareness coupled with the mindfulness and discernment that will know the truth has to see that This isn't my self
There's no substance or worth to it at all
It simply arises and disbands right here
It's here for just an instant and then it disbands
All we have to do is stop and look stop and know clearly in this way and we'll be able to do away with many many kinds of suffering and stress
The normal stress of the aggregates will still occur  we can't prevent it  but we'll know that it's the stress of nature and won't latch onto it as ours
So we keep watch of things that happen on their own
If we know how to watch we keep watching things that happen on their own
Don't latch onto them as being you or yours
Keep this awareness firmly established in itself as much as you can and there won't be much else you'll have to remember or think about
When you keep looking keep knowing like this at all times you'll come to see that there are no big issues going on
There's just the issue of arising persisting and disbanding
You don't have to label anything as good or bad
If you simply look in this way it's no great weight on the heart
But if you go dragging in issues of good and bad self and all that then suffering starts in a big way
The defilements start in a big way and weigh on the heart making it troubled and upset
So you have to stop and look stop and investigate really deep down inside
It's like water covered with duckweed Only when we take our hand to part the duckweed and take a look will we see that the water beneath it is crystal clear
As you look into the mind you have to part it you have to stop stop thinking stop labeling things as good or bad stop everything
You can't go branding anything
Simply keep looking keep knowing
When the mind is quiet you'll see that there's nothing there
Everything is all still
Everything has all stopped inside
But as soon as there's labeling even in the stillness the stopping the quiet it will set things in motion
And as soon as things get set into motion and you don't know how to let go right from the start issues will arise waves will arise
Once there are issues and waves they strike the mind and it goes splashing all out of control
This splashing of the mind includes craving and defilement as well because avijja  ignorance  lies at its root
Our major obstacle is this aggregate of perceptions of labels
If we aren't aware of the arising and disbanding of perceptions these labels will take hold
Perceptions are the chief instigators that label things within and without so we have to be aware of their arising and disbanding
Once we're aware in this way perceptions will no longer function as a cause of suffering
In other words they won't give rise to any further thoughtformations
The mind will be aware in itself and able to extinguish these things in itself
So we have to stop things at the level of perception
If we don't thoughtformations will fashion things into issues and then cause consciousness to wobble and waver in all sorts of ways
But these are things we can stop and look at things we can know with every mental moment If we aren't yet really acquainted with the arising and disbanding in the mind we won't be able to let go
We can talk about letting go but we can't do it because we don't yet know
As soon as anything arises we grab hold of it  even when actually it's already disbanded but since we don't really see we don't know
So I ask that you understand this basic principle
Don't go grasping after this thing or that or else you'll get yourself all unsettled
The basic theme is within Look on in keep knowing on in until you penetrate everything
The mind will then be free from turmoil
Empty
Quiet
Aware
So keep continuous watch of the mind in and of itself and you'll come to the point where you simply run out of things to say
Everything will stop on its own grow still on its own because the underlying condition that has stopped and is still is already there simply that we aren't aware of it yet
We have to catch sight of the sensation of knowing when the mind gains knowledge of anything and yet isn't aware of itself to see how it latches onto things physical form feeling perceptions thoughtformations and consciousness
We have to probe on in and look on our own
We can't use the teachings we've memorized to catch sight of these things
That won't get us anywhere at all
We may remember The body is inconstant but even though we can say it we can't see it
We have to focus on in to see exactly how the body is inconstant to see how it changes
And we have to focus on feelings  pleasant painful and neutral  to see how they change
The same holds true with perceptions thoughtformations and so forth
We have to focus on them investigate them contemplate them to see their characteristics as they actually are
Even if you can see these things for only a moment it'll do you a world of good
You'll be able to catch yourself The things you thought you knew you didn't really know at all This is why the knowledge we gain in the practice has to keep changing through many many levels
It doesn't stay on just one level
So even when you're able to know arising and disbanding with every moment right in the present If your contemplation isn't continuous it won't be very clear
You have to know how to contemplate the bare sensation of arising and disbanding simply arising and disbanding without any labels of good or bad Just keep with the pure sensation of arising and disbanding
When you do this other things will come to intrude  but no matter how they intrude it's still a matter of arising and disbanding so you can keep your stance with arising and disbanding in this way
If you start labeling things it gets confusing
All you need to do is keep looking at the right spot the bare sensation of arising and disbanding
Simply make sure that you really keep watch of it
Whether there's awareness of sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations just stay with the sensation of arising and disbanding
Don't go labeling the sight sound smell taste or tactile sensation
If you can keep watch in this way you're with the pure present  and there won't be any issues
When you keep watch in this way you're keeping watch on inconstancy on change as it actually occurs  because even the arising and disbanding changes
It's not the same thing arising and disbanding all the time
First this sort of sensation arises and disbands then that sort arises and disbands
If you keep watch on bare arising and disbanding like this you're sure to arrive at insight
But if you keep watch with labels  That's the sound of a cow That's the bark of a dog  you won't be watching the bare sensation of sound the bare sensation of arising and disbanding
As soon as there's labeling thoughtformations come along with it
Your senses of touch sight hearing and so forth will continue their bare arising and disbanding but you won't know it
Instead you'll label everything  sights sounds etc
 and then there will be attachments feelings of pleasure and displeasure and you won't know the truth
The truth keeps going along on its own
Sensations keep arising and then disbanding
If we focus right here  at the consciousness of the bare sensation of sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations  we'll be able to gain insight quickly
If we know how to observe things in this way we'll be able to see easily when the mind is provoked by passion or greed and even more easily when it's provoked by anger
As for delusion that's something more subtle something you have to take a great interest in and investigate carefully
You'll come to see all sorts of hidden things  how the mind is covered with many many layers of film
It's really fascinating
But then that's what insight meditation is for  to open your eyes so that you can know and see so that you can destroy your delusion and ignorance
You have to find approaches for contemplating and probing at all times so as to catch sight of the flickerings of awareness to see in what ways it streams out to know things
Be careful to catch sight of it both when its knowing is right and when it's wrong
Don't mix things up taking wrong knowledge for right or right knowledge for wrong
This is something extremely important for the practice this question of right and wrong knowing for these things can play tricks on you
When you gain any new insights don't go getting excited
You can't let yourself get excited by them at all because it doesn't take long for your insight to change  to change right now before your very eyes
It's not going to change at some other time or place
It's changing right now
You have to know how to observe how to acquaint yourself with the deceits of knowledge
Even when it's correct knowledge you can't latch onto it
Even though we may have standards for judging what sort of knowledge is correct in the course of our practice don't go latching onto correct knowledge  because correct knowledge is inconstant
It changes
It can turn into false knowledge or into knowledge that is even more correct
You have to contemplate things very carefully  very very carefully  so that you won't fall for your knowledge thinking I've gained right insight I know better than other people so that you won't start assuming yourself to be special
The moment you assume yourself your knowledge immediately turns wrong
Even if you don't let things show outwardly the mere mental event in which the mind labels itself is a form of wrong knowing that obscures the mind from itself in an insidious way
This is why meditators who tend not to contemplate things who don't catch sight of the deceits of every form of knowledge  right and wrong good and bad  tend to get bogged down in their knowledge
The knowledge that deceives them into thinking What I know is right gives rise to strong pride and conceit within them without their even realizing it
This is because the defilements are always getting into the act without our realizing it
They're insidious and in their insidious way they keep getting into the act as a matter of course for the defilements and mental effluents are still there in our character
Our practice is basically a probing deep inside from the outer levels of the mind to the inner ones
This is an approach that requires a great deal of subtlety and precision The mind has to use its own mindfulness and discernment to dig everything out of itself leaving just the mind in and of itself the body in and of itself and then keep watch of them
The basic challenge in the practice is this one point and nothing else this problem of how to look inward so that you see clear through
If the mind hasn't been trained to look inward it tends to look outward simply waiting to receive its objects from outside  and all it gets is the confusion of its sensations going in and out in and out
And even though this confusion is one aspect of change and inconstancy we don't see it that way
Instead we see it as issues good and bad pertaining to the self
When this is the case we're back right where we started not knowing what's what
This is why the mind's sensations when it isn't acquainted with itself are so secretive and hard to perceive
If you want to find out about them by reading a lot of books you end up piling more defilements onto the mind making it even more thickly covered than before
So when you turn to look inward you shouldn't use concepts and labels to do your looking for you
If you use concepts and labels to do your looking there will be nothing but concepts arising changing and disbanding
Everything will get all concocted into thoughts  and then how will you be able to watch in utter silence
The more you take what you've learned from books to look inside yourself the less you'll see
So whatever you've learned when you come to the practice you have to put all the labels and concepts you've gained from your learning to one side
You have to make yourself an innocent beginner once more
Only then will you be able to penetrate in to read the truths within you
If you carry all the paraphernalia of the concepts and standards you've gained from your learning to gauge things inside you you can search to your dying day and yet won't meet with any real truths at all
This is why you have to hold to only one theme in your practice
If the mind has lots of themes to concern itself with it's still just wandering around  wandering around to know this and that going out of bounds without realizing it and not really wanting to know itself
This is why those with a lot of learning like to teach others to show off their level of understanding
And this is precisely how the desire to stand out keeps the mind obscured
Of all the various kinds of deception there's none as bad as deceiving yourself
When you haven't yet really seen the truth what business do you have making assumptions about yourself that you've attained this or that sort of knowledge or that you know enough to teach others correctly
The Buddha is quite critical of teachers of this sort
He calls them people in vain Even if you can teach large numbers of people to become arahants while you yourself haven't tasted the flavor of the Dhamma the Buddha says that you're a person in vain
So you have to keep examining yourself
If you haven't yet really trained yourself in the things you teach to others how will you be able to extinguish your own suffering
Think about this for a moment
Extinguishing suffering gaining release from suffering Aren't these subtle matters
Aren't they completely personal within us
If you question yourself in this way you'll be on the right track
But even then you have to be careful
If you start taking sides with yourself the mind will cover itself up with wrong insights and wrong opinions
If you don't observe really carefully you can get carried off on a tangent  because the awareness with which the mind reads itself and actually sees through itself is something really extraordinary really worth developing  and it really eliminates suffering and defilement
This is the real honest truth not a lot of propaganda or lies
It's something you really have to practice and then you'll really have to see clearly in this way
When this is the case how can you not want to practice
If you examine yourself correctly in this way you'll be able to know what's real
But you have to be careful to examine yourself correctly
If you start latching onto any sense of self thinking that you're better than other people then you've failed the examination
No matter how correct your knowledge you have to keep humble and respectful above all else
You can't let there be any pride or conceit at all or it will destroy everything
This is why the awareness that eliminates the sense of self depends more than anything else on your powers of observation  to check and see if there's still anything in your knowledge or opinions that comes from the force of pride in any sense of self You have to use the full power of your mindfulness and discernment to cut these things away
It's nothing you can play around at
If you gain a few insights or let go of things a bit don't go thinking you're anything special
The defilements don't hold a truce with anyone
They keep coming right out as they like
So you have to be circumspect and examine things on all sides
Only then will you be able to benefit in ways that make your defilements and sufferings lighter and lighter
When we probe in to find the instigator  the mind or this property of consciousness  that's when we're on the right track and our probing will keep getting results will keep weakening the germs of craving and wiping them out
In whatever way craving streams out for being or having in any way at all we'll be able to catch sight of it every time
To catch hold and examine this being and having in this way though requires a lot of subtlety
If you aren't really mindful and discerning you won't be able to catch sight of these things at all because the mind is continually wanting to be and to have
The germs of defilement lie hidden deep in the seed of the mind in this property of consciousness
Simply to be aware of them skillfully is no mean feat  so we shouldn't even think of trying to wipe them out with our mere opinions
We have to keep contemplating probing on in until things come together just right in a single moment and then it's like reaching the basic level of knowing that exists on its own with no willing or intention at all
This is something that requires careful observation the difference between willed and unwilled knowing
Sometimes there's the intention to look and be aware within but there come times when there's no intention to look within and yet knowledge arises on its own
If you don't yet know look at the intention to look inward What is it like
What is it looking for
What does it see
This is a basic approach you have to hold to
This is a level you have to work at and one in which you have to make use of intention  the intention to look inward in this way But once you reach the basic level of knowing then as soon as you happen to focus down and look within the knowledge will occur on its own
One night I was sitting in meditation outside in the open air  my back straight as an arrow  firmly determined to make the mind quiet but even after a long time it wouldn't settle down
So I thought I've been working at this for many days now and yet my mind won't settle down at all
It's time to stop being so determined and to simply be aware of the mind I started to take my hands and feet out of the meditation posture but at the moment I had unfolded one leg but had yet to unfold the other I could see that my mind was like a pendulum swinging more and more slowly more and more slowly  until it stopped
Then there arose an awareness that was sustained by itself
Slowly I put my legs and hands back into position
At the same time the mind was in a state of awareness absolutely and solidly still seeing clearly into the elementary phenomena of existence as they arose and disbanded changing in line with their nature  and also seeing a separate condition inside with no arising disbanding or changing a condition beyond birth and death something very difficult to put clearly into words because it was a realization of the elementary phenomena of nature completely internal and individual
After a while I slowly got up and lay down to rest
This state of mind remained there as a stillness that sustained itself deep down inside
Eventually the mind came out of this state and gradually returned to normal
From this I was able to observe how practice consisting of nothing but fierce desire simply upsets the mind and keeps it from being still
But when one's awareness of the mind is just right an inner awareness will arise naturally of its own accord
Because of this clear inner awareness I was able to continue knowing the facts of what's true and false right and wrong from that point on and it enabled me to know that the moment when the mind let go of everything was a clear awareness of the elementary phenomena of nature because it was an awareness that knew within and saw within of its own accord  not something you can know or see by wanting
For this reason the Buddha's teaching Sabbe dhamma anatta  All phenomena are notself tells us not to latch onto any of the phenomena of nature whether conditioned or unconditioned
From that point on I was able to understand things and let go of attachments step by step
It's important to realize how to focus on events in order to get special benefits from your practice
You have to focus so as to observe and contemplate not simply to make the mind still
Focus on how things arise how they disband
Make your focus subtle and deep
When you're aware of the characteristics of your sensations then  if it's a physical sensation  contemplate that physical sensation
There will have to be a feeling of stress
Once there's a feeling of stress how will you be aware of it simply as a feeling so that it won't lead to anything further
Once you can be aware of it simply as a feeling it stops right there without producing any taste in terms of a desire for anything
The mind will disengage right there  right there at the feeling
If you don't focus on it in this way craving will arise on top of the feeling  craving to attain ease and be rid of the stress and pain
If you don't focus on the feeling in the proper way right from the start craving will arise before you're aware of it and if you then try to let go of it it'll be very tiring
The way in which preoccupations take shape the sensations of the mind as it's aware of things coming with every moment the way these things change and disband These are all things you have to focus on to see clearly
This is why we make the mind disengaged
We don't disengage it so that it doesn't know or amount to anything
That's not the kind of disengagement we want
The more the mind is truly disengaged the more it sees clearly into the characteristics of the arising and disbanding within itself
All I ask is that you observe things carefully that your awareness be allaround at all times
Work at this as much as you can
If you can keep this sort of awareness going you'll find that the mind or consciousness under the supervision of mindfulness and discernment in this way is different from  is opposite from  unsupervised consciousness
It will be the opposite sort of thing continually
If you keep the mind well supervised so that it's sensitive in the proper way it will yield enormous benefits not just small ones
If you don't make it properly sensitive and aware what can you expect to gain from it
When we say that we gain from the practice we're not talking about anything else We're talking about gaining disengagement
Freedom
Emptiness
Before the mind was embroiled
Defilement and craving attacked and robbed it leaving it completely entangled
Now it's disengaged freed from the defilements that used to gang up to burn it
Its desires for this or that thing its concocting of this or that thought have all fallen away
So now it's empty and disengaged
It can be empty in this way right before your very eyes
Try to see it right now before your eyes right now as I'm speaking and you're listening
Probe on in so as to know
If you can be constantly aware in this way you're following in the footsteps or taking within you the quality called buddho which means one who knows who is awake who has blossomed in the Dhamma
Even if you haven't fully blossomed  if you've blossomed only to the extent of disengaging from the blatant levels of craving and defilement  you still benefit a great deal for when the mind really knows the defilements and can let them go it feels cool and refreshed in and of itself
This is the exact opposite of the defilements that as soon as they arise make us burn and smoulder inside
If we don't have the mindfulness and discernment to help us know the defilements will burn us
But as soon as mindfulness and discernment know the fires go out  and they go out cold
Observe how the defilements arise and take shape  they also disband in quick succession but when they disband on their own in this way go out on their own in this way they go out hot
If we have mindfulness and discernment watching over them they go out cold
Look so that you can see what the true knowledge of mindfulness and discernment is like It goes out it goes out cold
As for the defilements even when they arise and disband in line with their nature they go out hot  hot because we latch onto them hot because of attachment
When they go out cold look again  it's because there's no attachment
They've been let go put out
This is something really worth looking into the fact that there's something very special like this in the mind  special in that when it really knows the truth it isn't attached
It's unentangled empty and free
This is how it's special
It can grow empty of greed anger and delusion step after step
It can be empty of desire empty of mental processes
The important thing is that you really see for yourself that the true nature of the mind is that it can be empty This is why I said this morning that nibbana doesn't lie anywhere else
It lies right here right where things go out and are cool go out and are cool
It's staring us right in the face
The Buddha taught that we are to know with our own hearts and minds
Even though there are many many words and phrases coined to explain the Dhamma we need focus only on the things we can know and see extinguish and let go of right in each moment of the immediate present  better than taking on a load of other things
Once we can read and comprehend our inner awareness we'll be struck deep within us that the Buddha awakened to the truth right here in the heart
His truth is truly the language of the heart
When they translate the Dhamma in all sorts of ways it becomes something ordinary
But if you keep close and careful watch right at the heart and mind you'll be able to see clearly to let go to put down your burdens
If you don't know right here your knowledge will send out all sorts of branches turning into thoughtformations with all sorts of meanings in line with conventional labels  and all of them way off the mark
If you know right at your inner awareness and make it your constant stance there's nothing at all no need to take hold of anything no need to label anything no need to give anything names
Right where craving arises right where it disbands That's where you'll know what nibbana is like Nibbana is simply this disbanding of craving That's what the Buddha stressed over and over again
In June the Khao Suan Luang community celebrated Upasika Kee's nd birthday  an important milestone in a culture that calculates years in twelveyear cycles  by printing a collection of excerpts from her Dhamma talks
The following selections are drawn from that collection
 The first requirement when you come to practice is that you need to be the sort of person who loves the truth  and you need to possess endurance to do what's true
Only then will your practice get anywhere
Otherwise it all turns into failure and you go back to being a slave to your defilements and cravings just as before
 When you don't contemplate yourself how much suffering do you cause for yourself
And how much do you cause for others
These are things we should contemplate as much as we can
If we don't we keep trying to get get get
We don't try to let go to put things aside to make any sacrifices at all
We just keep trying to get for the more we get the more we want
 If you're greedy and stingy then even if you have loads of money the Buddha says you're poor poor in noble treasures poor in the treasures of the mind
Even if you have lots of external wealth when you die it all goes to other people it turns into common property but you yourself are left poor in virtue poor in the Dhamma
 The mind without its own home  a mind without the Dhamma as its home  has to live with the defilements
This defilement arises and the mind goes running after it
As soon as it disappears that one arises over there and the mind goes running after that
Because the mind has no dwelling of its own it has to keep running wild all over the place
 Practicing to put an end to defilement and suffering is a high level of practice so you first have to clear the ground and put it in good order
Don't think that you can practice without any preparation If you live for your appetites all you can think of is getting things for the sake of your appetites
If you don't develop a sense of contentment or a sense of shame on the beginning level it'll be hard to practice the higher levels
 The important part of the practice lies in contemplating
If you don't contemplate discernment won't arise
The Buddha taught us to contemplate and test things to the point where we can clearly know for ourselves
Only then will we have a proper refuge
He never taught us to take refuge in things we ourselves can't see or do
 If you truly want to gain release from suffering you have to practice truly you have to make a true effort
You have to let go starting with outward things and working inward
You have to free yourself from the delusion that falls for delicious allures of every kind
The important point in letting go is to see the drawbacks of what you're letting go
Only then can you let it go once and for all
If you don't see its drawbacks you'll still be attached and will miss having it around
 If you're going to let go of anything you first have to see its drawbacks
If you just tell yourself to let go let go the mind won't easily obey
You really have to see the drawbacks of the thing you're holding onto and then the mind will let go of its own accord
It's like grabbing hold of fire When you feel the heat you let go of your own accord and will never dare grasp it again
 It's hard to see the drawbacks of sensual passion but even harder to see the drawbacks of more subtle things like your sense of self
 On the beginning level of the practice you have to learn how to control yourself in the area of your words and deeds  in other words on the level of virtue  so that you can keep your words and deeds at normalcy calm and restrained
In this way the mind won't follow the power of the crude defilements
When violent urges arise you stop them first with your powers of endurance
After you've been able to endure for a while your insight will gain the strength it needs to develop a sense of right and wrong and in this way you'll see the worth of endurance that it really is a good thing
 When you do good let it be good in line with nature
Don't latch onto the thought that you're good
If you get attached to the idea that you're good it will give rise to lots of other attachments
 When a mind without pride or conceit gets a scolding it shrinks back like a cow hit by a stick
Your sense of self will disappear right before your eyes
A good cow even it sees only the shadow of the whip or the stick stays still and composed ready to do quickly what it's told
A meditator who can reduce her pride and conceit is sure to make progress and will have nothing heavy to weigh down her mind
The mind will be still and empty  free from any attachment to me or mine
This is how the mind grows empty
 If you're the sort of person who's open and honest you'll find your window for disbanding suffering and defilement right where you're honest with yourself right where you come to your senses
You don't have to go explaining high level Dhamma to anyone
All you need is the ordinary level of being honest with yourself about the sufferings and drawbacks of your actions so that you can put a stop to them so that you develop a sense of wariness a sense of shame
That's much better than talking about highlevel Dhamma but then being heedless complacent and shameless
 When you look back to the past you see that it's all an affair of your own heedlessness
Even though you knew the Buddha's teachings and were able to explain them correctly still the heart and mind were in a state of heedlessness
Actually when people know a lot of Dhamma and can show off a lot of their knowledge they can be more heedless than people who know only a little
Those who've never read Dhamma books tend to be more heedful for they're more modest and know that they need to read their own minds all the time
Those who've read a lot of books or heard a lot of talks tend to get complacent
And in this way they become heedless and disrespectful of the Dhamma
 We have to figure out how to use our own mindfulness and discernment to look inwardly at all times for no one else can know these things or see these things for us
We have to know for ourselves
 When things are weak and watery they flow away
When they're solid they don't flow
When the mind is weak and devoid of strength it's always ready to flow away like water
But when the mind is endowed with mindfulness and discernment when it's solid and true in its effort it can withstand the flow of the defilements
 When you first start meditating it's like catching a monkey and tying it to a leash
When it's first tied down it'll struggle with all its might to get away
In the same way when the mind is first tied down to its meditation object it doesn't like it
It'll struggle more than it normally would which makes us feel weak and discouraged
So in this first stage we simply have to use our endurance to resist the mind's tendency to stray off in search of other objects
Over time it will gradually grow tame
 You want the mind to be quiet but it won't be quiet
So what do you have to do what do you have to focus on what do you have to know so that you can see how the arising and passing away of fabrication occur
Try to look carefully and you're sure to know for yourself for it's not anything hidden or mysterious
It's something whose basic principles you can catch sight of yourself
 What can we do so that the mind doesn't get distracted with its preoccupations or its nonsensical mental fabrications
We have to give the mind something to focus its awareness on for if its awareness isn't focused on one thing it wanders around to know other things other matters aside from itself
This is why there's the practice of focusing our awareness on the body or on the breath making the breath the post to which we tie our monkey  the mind
In other words we use mindfulness to keep the mind focused on the breath
This is the first step in the practice
Training the mind to stay focused on the breath is something we have to do continuously with each inandout breath in every posture  sitting standing walking lying down
No matter what you're doing stay focused on the breath
If you want you can simply stay focused on nothing more than the sensation of the breath without determining whether it's long or short
Keep breathing normally
Don't force the breath or hold the breath or sit with your body too tense
Sit straight and face comfortably straight ahead
If you're going to turn to the left make sure to be focused on the breath as you turn
If you turn to the right stay focused on the breath as you turn
Whatever posture you use is up to you but stay focused on the breath continuously
If your attention lapses bring it back to knowing the breath again
Whatever you're doing at any time watch the breath with every inandout breath and you'll be developing mindfulness and alertness  fullbody selfawareness  at the same time you're being aware of the breath
When you walk you don't have to focus on the steps of the feet
Focus on the breath and let the feet do the stepping on their own
Let each part of the body perform its function on its own
All you have to do is stay focused on the breath and you'll have fullbody awareness
Whether the eye is looking at sights or the ear is listening to sounds stay focused on the breath
When you look at a sight make sure that knowing the breath underlies the looking
When you listen to a sound make sure that knowing the breath underlies the listening
The breath is a means for making the mind quiet so you first have to train yourself with it
Don't be in a hurry to get higher results
Train the mind to stay under the control of mindfulness continuously for days on end  to the point where the mind can't let its attention lapse
It will come to stay more and more with the breath focused on knowing the breath continuously and then other things will stop on their own Thinking stops speaking stops
Whatever tasks you have to do you can still do them while at the same time keeping track of the breath each and every moment
If there are any lapses you come back to knowing the breath again
There's nothing else you have to think about
Be aware of the breath at the same time you're aware of the normalcy of the mind
 When the mind can maintain its stance in normalcy you can observe the breath and see that it's at normalcy too
When their normalcy is in balance you focus down on knowing that the breath is simply a natural phenomenon  the wind property
The body as a whole is composed of the four properties earth water fire and wind
So here we're focused on the wind property
The wind property is a natural phenomenon not us or ours
The mind is then at normalcy not thinking or fabricating anything to stir things up
It too is a natural phenomenon pure and simple
If it's not fabricated into anything else if it's not burned by defilements it can stay still and at normalcy
When you stay focused on the breath in every posture it's a means of blocking the mind from traipsing around with its thoughts and labels
You have to be intent on training the mind to stay with the breath with every posture That's how you'll come to know what the mind is like when it has mindfulness of breathing as its dwelling place
 Focusing on the breath helps the mind grow quiet more than any other method  and it's not at all tiring
Simply breathe comfortably
If you let the breath come in and out strongly it helps the breath energy and blood flow throughout the body
If you breathe deeply so that the stomach muscles relax it helps to prevent constipation
When you train with the breath it exercises both the body and the mind and in this way everything calms down in a natural way more easily than if we try to calm things down with force or threats
No matter how much you threaten the mind it won't surrender
It'll run all over the place
So instead we train it to fall in line with nature  for after all the breath is an aspect of nature
Whether you're aware of it or not the breath breathes in line with its nature
Only when we focus on it are we aware of it
The body is also an aspect of nature
The mind is an aspect of nature
When they're trained in an appropriate way there aren't a lot of problems that you have to solve
The flow of blood and breath energy in the body improves the state of your nerves
If you train your mindfulness and alertness to be aware of the whole body at the same time you're aware of the breath the breath will flow effortlessly
If you sit for long periods of time this practice will help keep the blood and breath energy flowing naturally
You don't have to fight the breath or hold it in
When you place your feet and hands in the meditation posture don't tense them up
If you relax them so that the blood and breath energy flow easily it will be very helpful
Focusing on mindfulness of the breath is appropriate in every way  appropriate for the body appropriate for the mind
Before his awakening when he was still a bodhisattva the Buddha used mindfulness of breathing more than any other practice as the dwelling place for his mind
So when you practice it you too will have mindfulness of breathing as the dwelling place for your mind
That way the mind won't wander around fabricating thoughts and getting embroiled
You have to get it to settle down and be still
As soon as anything springs up focus on the breath
If you try to focus directly on the mind right from the start it might be too difficult to manage if you're not familiar with it
If you want to focus directly on the mind that's fine too but you have to be aware of it with every inandout breath
Make your awareness continuous for long periods of time
 Work at this in every posture and see what results arise
