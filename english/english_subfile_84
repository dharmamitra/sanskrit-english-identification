excellent power of the Saṅgha go to destructionRecollection of the Buddha friendliness unattractiveness and mindfulness of death these are the four protective meditations that a virtuous monk should developRecollecting the Sages virtue and his endless extensive good qualitiesthe wise monk should develop the recollection of the Buddha firstAlone he destroyed all the corruptions and bad predispositionsand being continually and fully pure he is worthy of worship at all timesThe Sage by himself has in every way completely awakened to all thingsthroughout the whole of time and alone he has arrived at omniscienceBeing endowed with great psychic power good conduct virtue and so ontrue understanding insight and so on the leader was like the shining skyHe who never spoke foolish words has arrived at that glorious state Nibbānahe knew the threefold world system completely without leaving anything outOverflowing with countless good qualities he is supreme among all beingswith countless skilful means he tamed those men who could be tamedHe alone to the whole world was the teacher of everything goodhe is the highest treasure having qualities such as good fortune mastery and so onBeing wise in regard to all things compassionate to everybodyhe exceeded others in the best qualities knowing what was for his own and others goodThrough sympathy he set his mind on the perfections through wisdom he raised himself uphe raised himself above all things through sympathy he raised others tooEven his visible formbody was beyond thoughtwhat can be said of his spiritual body which was unique having powerful knowledgeIn a similar way to oneself all beings desire happinesshaving seen that one should gradually develop friendliness towards all beingsMay I constantly be happy free from suffering and like myselfmay my benefactors be happy neutral persons and foes alsoIn this village and its surrounding fields may beings always be happyand those in other countries and people throughout the universeThroughout the entire universe may the countless beings creaturespersons and bhūtas who have attained individuality be happyand so too all women men noble ones and also ignoble onesgods humans and fallen creatures and likewise all beings in the ten directionsWith consciousness it is unattractive just as it is without ie deadseeing this body as unattractive a monk should develop the recollection of the unattractiveThus by way of colour shape smell location and appearancethe thirtytwo parts in my body are like repulsive corpsesThe parts that depend on this body are contemptible as is what falls from a corpsefor their receptacle is impure they are situated in this corpse of a bodyLike a worm in excrement this body arose in what is impure ie the wombinside it is full of impurities just like a full lavatoryAlways the impurities overflow like fat overflows from a frying panvarious kinds of worms dwell in it the same as in a cesspoolThis bodily heap is like a boil like a disease or like a soreit is incurable contemptible just like a rotting corpseBy comparing a lamp in a breeze with the destruction of the life continuumthrough seeing oneself as similar to others one should develop mindfulness of deathJust as people who have attained great good fortune here have diedin the same way will I die death is surely coming to meIndeed death always comes along with that which has arisenit is like a murderer who is seeking an opportunity to killThis life is slowly without turning back continually eagerlygoing its way it rises and falls just as the sun runs its course and setsLike lightning a bubble dew a line drawn on water life quickly goes to destructionlike an executioner in regard to his rival death can never be constrainedEven the two kinds of Victors who are famous strong meritorious powerful and of great intelligencewere quickly slaughtered by death so what to say about one like meWhen conditions fail there are internal and external adversitiesdying at each and every moment I will die in less time than a blink of an eyeHaving developed these four protections one should consider nextthe eight great bases for urgency having nonstop energyBirth old age sickness death the lower realmsthe past and future suffering in the roundthe suffering in having to seek food in the present these are the eight bases for urgencyIf in the morning

dressed in the morning time after picking up his bowl and robeapproached the place where the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja was workingThen at that time the brahmin Kasībhāradvājas food distribution was proceedingThen the Fortunate One approached the food distributionand after approaching he stood on one sideThe brahmin Kasībhāradvāja saw the Fortunate One standing for almsand after seeing him he said this to the Fortunate OneAscetic I plough and I sowand after ploughing and sowing I eatYou also ascetic should plough and sowand after ploughing and sowing you can eatBrahmin I also plough and sowand after ploughing and sowing I eatBut we do not see the reverend Gotamasyoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxenbut still the reverend Gotama said thisBrahmin I also plough and sowand after ploughing and sowing I eat Then the brahmin Kasībhāradvājarecited a verse to the Fortunate OneYou claim that you are a ploughman but we do not see your ploughingPlease tell us about ploughing when asked so that we may know your ploughingConfidence the seed austerity the rain wisdom is my yoke and ploughconscience the pole mind is the strap mindfulness is my ploughshare and goadWith body guarded speech guarded and stomach restrained regarding foodI make truth the mower temperance the setting free of the yokeEnergy my beast of burden the vehicle yoked to security without turning back it goes to that place where having gone one does not grieveThus this ploughing has been ploughed that produces the fruit of the deathlessand after ploughing this ploughing one is set free from all sufferingThen the brahmin Kasībhāradvājahaving arranged milkrice in a large bronze bowl presented it to the Fortunate One sayingEat this milkrice reverend Gotamathe reverend one is a ploughman for the reverend Gotamaploughs the ploughing which has the deathless as fruitI will not eat what is gained through chanting versesthat is not the Dhamma brahmin of those who seeBuddhas reject what is gained through chanting verseswhile Dhamma lasts brahmin this is their way of lifeAnother great sage who is fully adeptpollutantfree at peace regarding worry about wrongdoingattend to with food and drinkfor that is the field for those who look for meritThen to whom reverend Gotama should I give this milkriceI certainly do not see brahminin the world with its gods Māra and Brahmain this generation with its ascetics and brahmins princes and menanyone who having eaten this milkrice could properly digest itexcept a Realised One or a Realised Ones discipleTherefore brahmin cast away that milkrice where there is but little grassor drop it into water which has no breathing creaturesThen the brahmin Kasībhāradvājadropped that milkrice into water which had no breathing creaturesThen that milkrice being thrown into waterdid hiss and sizzle and steam and smokejust as a ploughshare heated for a day when thrown into waterhisses and sizzles and steams and smokesso that milkrice being thrown into waterdid hiss and sizzle and steam and smokeThen the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja anxious and horrifiedapproached the Fortunate Oneand after approaching he fell down placing his head at the Fortunate Ones feetsaid this to the Fortunate OneExcellent reverend Gotama Excellent reverend GotamaJust as reverend Gotama one might set upright what has been overturnedor open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lostor bear an oil lamp in the darknessso that one who has eyes can see formsjust so has the Dhamma been made clear by reverend Gotama in more than one wayI go to the reverend Gotama for refugeand to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monksMay I receive the going forth in the presence of reverend Gotamamay I receive the full ordinationThe brahmin Kasībhāradvāja receivedthe going forth in the presence of the Fortunate One recieved full ordinationThen not long after ordination venerable Bhāradvājawhile dwelling solitary secluded heedful ardent and resoluteafter no long time attained

Pasenadi after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Fortunate Onehaving worshipped and circumambulated the Fortunate One departedat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Icchānaṅgalain the Icchānaṅgala jungle thicketHerein In the Icchānaṅgala jungle thicket meansin the jungle thicket not too far from the village of IcchānaṅgalaThen at that time many wellknownwealthy brahmins were living in Icchānaṅgala such asthe brahmin Caṅkī the brahmin Tārukkha the brahmin Pokkharasātithe brahmin Jānussoni the brahmin TodeyyaCaṅkī and so on means the five people who were religious advisors to King Pasenadi of Kosalaand other wellknown brahminsOther wellknown brahmins means many other wellknown brahminsIt seems every six months they would assemble in one of two placesWhen they desired to purify their castethen they would assemble near Pokkharasāti especially to purify their casteWhen they desired to purify the Vedic mantrasthen they would assemble at IcchānaṅgalaAt this time they had assembled there for the purpose of completely purifying the Vedic mantrasThen to the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvājawhile wandering and strolling around on a walkthis discussion aroseThis discussion meansthey were discussing what was suitable in a friendly discussion as they strolled aroundand this topic for discussion arose amongst other topicsHow dear friend is one a brahminThe student Bhāradvāja said thisWhen dear friend one is wellborn on both the mothers and fathers sideof pure descent as far as the seventh generationnot despised and blameless with regard to the matter of ones birthto that extent one is a brahminThe student Vāseṭṭha said thisWhen dear friend one is virtuous and endowed with good conductto that extent one is a brahminVirtuous means having good qualitiesEndowed with good conduct means endowed with good practicesBut neither was the student Bhāradvāja able to convince the student Vāseṭṭhaand nor was the student Vāseṭṭha able to convince the student BhāradvājaThen the student Vāseṭṭha addressed the student Bhāradvāja sayingThis ascetic Gotama Bhāradvāja a son of the Sakyas having gone forth from the Sakyan clanis dwelling near Icchānaṅgala in the Icchānaṅgala jungle thicketand about this dear Gotama this beautiful report has gone roundSuch is he the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddhathe one endowed with understanding and good conduct the Happy One the one who understands the worldsthe unsurpassed guide for those people who need tamingthe Teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Fortunate OneCome dear Bhāradvāja let us approach the ascetic Gotamaand having approached the ascetic Gotama let us ask him about this matterand in whatever way this ascetic Gotama will explain it so we will bear it in mindJust so dear friend the student Bhāradvāja replied to the student VāseṭṭhaThen the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja approached the Fortunate Oneand after approaching they exchanged greetings with the Fortunate Oneand after exchanging polite and courteous greetings sat down on one sideWhile sitting on one side the student Vāseṭṭhaaddressed the Fortunate One with a verseWe are both of us acknowledged sanctioned as knowing the three VedasAcknowledged sanctioned means acknowledged as trained by their teachers sayingYes teacher we have been trained thus they are sanctionedWe are means we are alternative verbI am Pokkharasātis and this one is Tārukkhas student meansI am Pokkharasātis senior attendant or chief pupilthis one is Tārukkhas so it is explainedWhat is declared in the three Vedas in that we are surely completeThe three Vedas means knowledge of the brahmins three VedasWhat is declared means that which is declared in each word according to the meaning and syllablesHerein We are complete the meaning is knowing all this we have come to completionNow explaining completeness according to the line The words and so on is what is saidHerein chanting  like our teachers means we surely recite the same way as our teachersConcerning the matter of birth there is a dispute between us GotamaBhāradvāja says one is a brahmin just by birthAccording to deeds means according to the ten types of wholesome deedsBecause formerly in reference to the seven ways of bodily and verbal deedsthis was said When dear friend one is virtuousin reference to the three ways of mental deeds good conduct is saidEndowed with this there is good practiceVisionary means having the five eyes of the Visionaryhe is addressing the Fortunate OneWe are unable to convince one another concerning thisJust as when the moon is full the people approach with their hands raised in salutationFull means having a state of deficiency only in the past full is the meaningApproach means come close toPay homage means make homageThe Eye has arisen in the world and therefore we ask Gotamais one a brahmin through birth or is it through deedsThe Eye has arisen in the world meanshaving destroyed the darkness of blindignorance in the worldfor showing the benefit of the world and what belongs to this world and so on he is endowed with the EyeI will explain this to you said the Fortunate One to VāseṭṭhaThus having been praised by Vāseṭṭha and being requested the Fortunate Onetreating the two people kindly said I will explain this to you and so on is what is saidHerein I will explain means I will explain alternate formIn order means lets leave the ideas of the brahminsand I will explain to you successively beginning with plants trees arthropods and grasshoppers is the meaningA classification of the species means an exposition of the speciesFor the species are different meansfor the species of the various creatures are different of many kinds is the meaningUnderstand plants and trees although they do not acknowledge itPlants and trees means not having spoken about grasping another speciesbut later grasping this species I will sayThis will be his natural species differentiation and so this teaching is begunBut the Elder Mahāsīvali saysWhy is there nongrasping venerable Sir with the diversity of seedsbut there is grasping with a diversity of actionWhat is said in this way is not rightWhen asked thus it is certainly not right because an intentional deed despatches one to a wombThere are various types of beings that occur in the wombPlants and trees herein at the very least having pith on the inside and wood on the outsidesuch as palms coconut and so on these are plantsbut having heartwood on the inside and pith on the outside these are all known as treesAlthough they do not acknowledge it meanssaying We are plants we are trees orI am a plant I am a tree they do not know it in this waySign of their species means without knowing itthere is the sign of their species their own formlike the root and body of the plant and so on are the sameWhy is thatThe species are differentBecause plant species are one thing tree species are anotherIn plants palms are one species and reeds are another species thus it should be explainedThrough this it is shown that on account of species there is diversityeven without ones own acknowledgment or without anothers indicationit is knownIf there would be a brahmin by specieseven without ones own acknowledgment or without anothers indicationhe would be known as distinct from nobles traders and workers but he is not knownTherefore he is not a brahmin by birthBut further Just as in these speciesthrough the words in the verse below the meaning will be explainedThen arthropods and grasshoppersHaving thus shown the species without graspingshowing those with grasping Then arthropods and so on is saidUp to ants and other insects the meaning is having made ants and other insects the limitHerein after jumping in the air they proceedFor the species are different meansbecause their colour is blue red and so on there are species of diverse kindsUnderstand also quadrupeds the small and the largeSmall means squirrels and so onLarge means cats and so onUnderstand reptiles snakes and pythonsReptiles means they use their stomach as feet those whose stomach is their feet is what is saidPythons means because it is like snakes from its head as far as its back and tailthrough that they say pythonsThen understand the fish also aquatics and amphibiansAquatics means belonging to water born in the waterThen understand birds flying creatures those who go through the skyBirds means birds alternative wordThey fly with their wings therefore they are flying creaturesThey go through the sky therefore they are those who go through the skyJust as in these species the sign of the species is variousThus having shown that there is a species differentiation of living beings on the ground in the water and in the airnow with the intention of showing whereexplaining this the verse Just as in these was spokenThat is the meaning in short is what was saidBut here is what should be spoken about in extensionshowing it oneself Not with the hairHerein this is how to construe it that which is saidIn humans there is no sign that the species is variousshould be known This is not soIn what wayNot with the hairThere is no limitation saying The hair of brahmins is suchlike of nobles is suchlikeas it could be construed of all the elephants horses deer and so on in similar waysnot with the hair not with the head not with the ears not with the eyesnot with the neck not with the shoulders not with the belly not with the backnot with the hands not with the feet not with fingers not with the nailsThere is no sign of a species as there is in other speciesit should be known that this is the explanation of what is said it is the conclusionThis is how to construe it because there is nothing through this hair and so onthat is a different sign of species in humanstherefore this is to be knownThere is no sign of a species that differentiates brahmins from other humans and so onas there is in other speciesThere is divergence in bodies but in humans this divergence is not foundAlthough now differentiation of species is not found as brahmin noblethis diversity is according to birthit is said this is to be shown in the There is divergence verseHerein Difference means diversityHerein this is however the meaning in shortbecause for animals diversity in the composition of hair and so on happens in the wombbut for brahmins and so on there is no such diversity in their bodiesEven this being so with this designation of brahmin noblethe difference in humans is said to be through designationis said to be only through the designationWhoever amongst humans makes his living protecting cattleThus far the Fortunate One has censured Bhāradvājas viewnow if one can be a brahmin by birth onlyone can be a brahmin even though lacking good livelihood virtue and practicesBecause the brahmins of old did not desire this brahmin statusother wise humans in the world therefore were supporting Vāseṭṭhas viewand he spoke the eight verses beginning Whoever amongst humansHerein Protecting cattle means protecting the fields husbandry is what is saidCattle is a name for

by working as a religious advisorWhoever amongst humans lives off a village or a kingdomI do not call one a brahmin simply because of being born from the womb of a certain motherThus through the brahmin view and through wordly usagewe have concluded that a brahmin lacking a good livelihood virtue and practices has no brahmin statusas that is the case one is not a brahmin by birth but one is a brahmin through good qualitiesTherefore the one who is endowed with good qualities in whatever familyhe is a brahmin herein this is the right methodthus this is the right method produced from the meaningnow explaining the wordsI do not call one a brahmin and so on was saidThe meaning of this isfrom whichever of the four wombs he is bornthe one who has the distinction of being arisen in a mother who is praised as a brahminbut he is Simply  born from the womb of a certain motherwhoever is wellborn on both sides and so on through the brahmins methodit is said a brahmins womb is reckoned as a pure birth canaland there is a pure gestation through the excellency of the mothereven so the fact is the birth has been produced in a wombit is said he is simply born from a certain motherthat Simply  born from a certain motherI say from simply being born through the womb of a certain mother one is not a brahminWhyBecause saying bho bho is merely wordshe has distinction through his other attachmentsThat one is just one who says bho if he is attached having impedimentsBut the one who wherever he is bornhaving nothing through the state of not having passion and so onunattached through the giving up of all graspingsHaving nothing and unattached that one I say is a brahminWhyBecause he has removed bad thingsWhoever has cut off all the fetters surely does not trembleMoreover Whoever

lying latent for a long time this false view of the ignorantname and clan have been madethis is just his name and clan it is only an designation that has been made upfor ignorant beings this view has been lying latent for a long time in the heartFor those who are ignorant in a latent state say to us about his name and lineageone is a brahmin by birthwithout knowing they say this is what is saidOne is not a brahmin by birth nor by birth is one not a brahminThus those who have adhered to the idea a brahmin is from birthare ignorant that this is only a designationand that their view is a wrong view having shown thisand now rejecting and making no distinction based on birthbut establishing the view of deeds Not  by birth and so on was saidIts by deeds one is a farmer and by deeds one is a craftsmanHerein By deeds in this half verse the meaning is explainedBy deeds one is a farmer and so on is saidHerein By deeds meansat the present time agriculture and so on is brought forth through intentional deedsby deeds one is a robber by deeds one is a soldierThus the wise seeing this deed as it really isSeeing conditional origination it is through this condition thusthat he is one seeing conditional originationSkilled in deeds and resultsa family is worthy of respect and disrespect because of the production of deedsthrough knowing what is despicable and excellent there is a ripening of despicable and excellent deedsThus there is skill in deeds and resultsBy deeds the world goes round by deeds this generation goes roundBy deeds  goes roundin this verse the world and this generation and beings have one single meaningit is only the words that differHerein through the first foot this is brahmā mahābrahmā  the highest the creatorit should be known as a warding off of these sorts of viewsThrough deeds there are various destinies and the world goes round so who is his creatorThrough the second foot there is thus rebirth through deedsthe circle of existence goes round by the different kinds of past and present deedsexperiencing happiness and sufferingundergoing the different kinds of what is despicable and excellent and so on is shownWith the third foot this concludes the meaningThus in every way beings are bound by deedsthey carry on having been bound by deeds and not otherwiseWith the fourth foot the meaning is made clear with a simileAs the chariots roll on bound by their linchpinand do not go when not bound by itso for the world there is rebirthing and existing because of the bondage of deedsand without that bondage there is no rebirthing or existingThrough austerity celibacy restraint and controlNow because the world is bound by deeds in this waytherefore showing the state of excellence through excellent deedsthe Through austerity pair of verses were spokenHerein Through austerity means through the austere practicesThrough celibacy means through abstaining from sexual intercourseThrough restraint means through virtueThrough control means through control of the sense facultiesThrough thesemeans through these best and pure and most excellent deeds one is a brahminWhyBecause This is the brahmin supremebecause this deed is said to be the supreme brahmin qualityBrahmās is a reading alsoHowever this is the meaning of the words hereinliving the best they are Brahmāsbringing about the state of brahmin is what is saidEndowed with the three knowledges peaceful and with rebirth destroyedIn the second verse peaceful means pacifying the defilementsBrahmā and Sakka means Brahmā and Sakka whoever is suchhe is not only a brahminbut he is also Brahmā and Sakka to those who know to the wise onesknow thus Vāseṭṭha is what is saidAll the rest is clearWhen this was said the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvājasaid this to the Fortunate OneExcellent dear Gotama Excellent dear GotamaJust as dear Gotama one might set upright what has been overturnedor open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lostor carry an oil lamp

monasticssaying This female lay follower Veḷukaṇḍakī Nandamātā monasticsAnd what monastics is a gift endowed with six factorsHere monastics for the donor there are three factors and for the receivers there are three factorsWhat are the three factors for the donorHere monks the donor before giving is happy in mindBefore giving is happy in mind means before giving a giftfor a fortnight or a month before she has a feeling of wellbeingHerein previously having the intention I will givefrom the time that this idea arises I will give a gift with proper effortby acquiring the field and so on she has this thoughtwhile giving her mind is gladdened and after giving there is delightWhile giving her mind is gladdened this is said because she realises her intention at the time of givingAfter giving there is delight but this is another thought she receives that comes when remembering her giftThese are the three factors for the donorWhat are the three factors for the receiversHere monastics the receivers are without passion or they are practising to remove passionWithout passion means without passion different form without pollutantsPractising to remove passion means practising the path to

such is the ending of formSuch is feeling perception consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousnessThats how a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of all things that entail sufferingAnd how has a mendicant seen sensual pleasures in such a way that they have no underlying tendency for desire affection infatuation and passion for sensual pleasuresSuppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a mans height filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smokedThen a person would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from painThen two strong men grab would grab each arm and drag them towards the pit of glowing coalsTheyd writhe and struggle to and froWhy is thatFor that person knows If I fall in that pit of glowing coals that will result in my death or deadly painIn the same way when a mendicant has seen sensual pleasures as like a pit of glowing coals they have no underlying tendency for desire affection infatuation and passion for sensual pleasuresAnd how has a mendicant awakened to a way of conduct and a way of living such that when they live in that way bad unskillful qualities of desire and grief dont overwhelm themSuppose a person was to enter a thicket full of thornsTheyd have thorns in front and behind to the left and right below and aboveSo theyd go

bad unskillful memories and thoughts prone to fetters ariseIf this happens their mindfulness is slow to come up but they quickly give them up get rid of eliminate and obliterate those thoughtsSuppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day and a person let two or three drops of water fall onto itThe drops would be slow to fall but theyd quickly dry up and evaporateIn the same way though that mendicant conducts themselves and lives in this way every so often they might lose mindfulness and bad unskillful memories and thoughts prone to fetters ariseIf this happens their

theyd grab them above the hump and hold them fast thereThen theyd give them a good thrashingbefore driving them awayFor a second timeand even a third time the same thing might happenAs a result no matter how long they stand or sit in a village or wilderness that ox fond of crops would never invade that crop againremembering the beating they got earlierIn the same way when a mendicants mind is
