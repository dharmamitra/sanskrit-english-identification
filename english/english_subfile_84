The Moon who was seized by Rāhu was released by that safeguards power
the destruction of fear of all foes we will recite that safeguard
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then at that time the Moon god
was seized by the asura lord Rāhu
Then the Moon god recollecting the Fortunate One
on that occasion recited this verse
Reverence to you Buddhahero you who are free in every way
I am being obstructed therefore please be a refuge to me
Then with reference to the Moon god the Fortunate One
addressed the asura lord Rāhu with a verse
To the Realised One the Worthy One the Moon has gone for refuge
you must release the Moon Rāhu For the Buddhas pity the world
Then the asura lord Rāhu having released the Moon god
hurriedly approached the asura lord Vepacitti
and after approaching anxious and horrified he stood on one side
While he was standing on one side the asura lord Vepacitti recited this verse to the asura lord Rāhu
Why did you so hurriedly release the Moon god Rāhu
After coming here why do you stand there like someone anxious and frightened
My head will split into seven while living I will have no happiness
 I am one to whom the Buddha has chanted a verse  if I do not release the Moon
The water that washed the seat of the one reciting
that safeguard destroys all dangers
Reciting it will acomplish safety for the child in the womb
The Elder Aṅgulimāla was told by the Friend of the World
We will recite that safeguard of great power that lasts for an aeon
Sister since my birth in the Ariyan birth
I am not aware of having intentionally taken the life of any living being
By this truth may you be be safe and may the child in your womb be safe
While fulfilling the conditions for Awakening he was born from a peahens womb
As the Great Being was protected with a safeguard the forest dwellers
were unable to catch him though they endeavoured for a long time
It is declared to be Brahmas Charm we will recite that safeguard
That One who gives Vision the sole king comes up
he is golden coloured he enlightens the earth
therefore I revere the golden coloured one who enlightens the earth
guarded by you today we will live out the day

Recollection of the Buddha friendliness unattractiveness and mindfulness of death 
these are the four protective meditations that a virtuous monk should develop
Recollecting the Sages virtue and his endless extensive good qualities
the wise monk should develop the recollection of the Buddha first
Alone he destroyed all the corruptions and bad predispositions
and being continually and fully pure he is worthy of worship at all times
The Sage by himself has in every way completely awakened to all things
throughout the whole of time and alone he has arrived at omniscience
Being endowed with great psychic power good conduct virtue and so on
true understanding insight and so on the leader was like the shining sky
He who never spoke foolish words has arrived at that glorious state Nibbāna
he knew the threefold world system completely without leaving anything out
Overflowing with countless good qualities he is supreme among all beings
with countless skilful means he tamed those men who could be tamed
He alone to the whole world was the teacher of everything good
he is the highest treasure having qualities such as good fortune mastery and so on
Being wise in regard to all things compassionate to everybody
he exceeded others in the best qualities knowing what was for his own and others good
Through sympathy he set his mind on the perfections through wisdom he raised himself up
he raised himself above all things through sympathy he raised others too
Even his visible formbody was beyond thought
what can be said of his spiritual body which was unique having powerful knowledge
In a similar way to oneself all beings desire happiness
having seen that one should gradually develop friendliness towards all beings
May I constantly be happy free from suffering and like myself
may my benefactors be happy neutral persons and foes also
In this village and its surrounding fields may beings always be happy
and those in other countries and people throughout the universe
Throughout the entire universe may the countless beings creatures
persons and bhūtas who have attained individuality be happy
and so too all women men noble ones and also ignoble ones
gods humans and fallen creatures and likewise all beings in the ten directions
With consciousness it is unattractive just as it is without ie dead
seeing this body as unattractive a monk should develop the recollection of the unattractive
Thus by way of colour shape smell location and appearance
the thirtytwo parts in my body are like repulsive corpses
The parts that depend on this body are contemptible as is what falls from a corpse
for their receptacle is impure they are situated in this corpse of a body
Like a worm in excrement this body arose in what is impure ie the womb
inside it is full of impurities just like a full lavatory
Always the impurities overflow like fat overflows from a frying pan
various kinds of worms dwell in it the same as in a cesspool
This bodily heap is like a boil like a disease or like a sore
it is incurable contemptible just like a rotting corpse
By comparing a lamp in a breeze with the destruction of the life continuum
through seeing oneself as similar to others one should develop mindfulness of death
Just as people who have attained great good fortune here have died
in the same way will I die death is surely coming to me
Indeed death always comes along with that which has arisen
it is like a murderer who is seeking an opportunity to kill
This life is slowly without turning back continually eagerly
going its way it rises and falls just as the sun runs its course and sets
Like lightning a bubble dew a line drawn on water life quickly goes to destruction
like an executioner in regard to his rival death can never be constrained
Even the two kinds of Victors who are famous strong meritorious powerful and of great intelligence
were quickly slaughtered by death so what to say about one like me
When conditions fail there are internal and external adversities
dying at each and every moment I will die in less time than a blink of an eye
Having developed these four protections one should consider next
the eight great bases for urgency having nonstop energy
Birth old age sickness death the lower realms
the past and future suffering in the round
the suffering in having to seek food in the present 
these are the eight bases for urgency
If in the morning and in the evening one who knows the way
who desires his own benefit practises these meditations continually
then after destroying even extensive obstacles that sage
Having beautiful feet marked with a fine wheel
his long heels are a characteristic mark
his feet decorated with chowrie and sunshade
that indeed is your father a lion of a man
An excellent and graceful Sakyan prince
with a body full of characteristic marks
a hero who has come for the worlds benefit
that indeed is your father a lion of a man
Just like the full moon is his beautiful face
dear to gods and men a Nāga amongst men
walking like a charming lord of elephants
that indeed is your father a lion of a man
Born into a leading noble family
gods and men revere his feet
having virtue and concentration established in his mind
that indeed is your father a lion of a man
Having a long prominent and wellformed nose
cowlike eyelashes beautiful deep black eyes
his deep black eyebrows are just like Indras bow
that indeed is your father a lion of a man
Having a round sizeable and wellformed neck
a lions jaw a body like the king of beasts
beautiful golden skin of supreme colour
that indeed is your father a lion of a man
Having a very deep charming and sweet voice
with a beautiful tongue red like vermillion
with twenty by twenty beautiful white teeth
that indeed is your father a lion of a man
Having beautiful glossy blackcoloured hair
a forehead like a plate of purified gold
and hair between the brows like a pure white star
that indeed is your father a lion of a man
Like the moon going along the dark night path
surrounded by a body of stars
is the Lord of Ascetics in the midst of his disciples
that indeed is your father a lion of a man
Preaching the names of the Independent Buddhas he preached this safeguard

Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near lavī
in the domicile of the yakkha lavaka
Then the yakkha lavaka approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One
Get out ascetic
Yes friend said the Fortunate One and he got out
Go in ascetic
Yes friend said the Fortunate One and he went in
For a second time the yakkha lavaka said this to the Fortunate One
Get out ascetic
Yes friend said the Fortunate One and he got out
Go in ascetic
Yes friend said the Fortunate One and he went in
For a third time the yakkha lavaka said this to the Fortunate One
Get out ascetic
Yes friend said the Fortunate One and he got out
Go in ascetic
Yes friend said the Fortunate One and he went in
For a fourth time the yakkha lavaka said this to the Fortunate One
Get out ascetic
I certainly will not get out friend
so please do whatever it is you must do
I will ask you a question ascetic and if you do not answer me
I will overthrow your mind or split your heart
or seize you by the feet and throw you across the river
I certainly do not see friend
in the world with its gods Māra and Brahma
in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins princes and men
anyone who could overthrow my mind or split my heart
or seize me by the feet and throw me across the river
Still you may ask what you want friend
Then the yakkha lavaka recited a verse to the Fortunate One
What is the greatest wealth for a person here
What when accomplished brings about happiness
What for sure is the sweetest of tastes
Living what life do they say is the greatest
Confidence is a persons greatest wealth here
The Dhamma when accomplished brings about happiness
Truth for sure is the sweetest of tastes
Living a wise life they say is the greatest
How does one cross over the flood How does one cross over the sea
How does one overcome suffering How does one become purified
Through confidence one crosses the flood Through heedfulness one crosses the sea
Through energy one overcomes suffering Through wisdom one is purified
How is it one gains true wisdom How is it one finds true wealth
How does one acquire good repute How does one bind friends to oneself
How after passing from this world to the next world does one not grieve
Confident in the Worthy Ones Dhamma taught for attaining Nibbāna
one gains wisdom through wanting to hear it heedfulness and application
Doing what is suitable bearing up aroused one finds true wealth
Through truth one acquires good repute Through giving one binds friends to oneself
That confident householder who has these four things
truth Dhamma courage liberality after passing away he does not grieve
thus after passing from this world to the next world one does not grieve
Come now ask others also the many ascetics and brahmins
if there is something more than truth selfcontrol liberality and patience
Why should I ask others now the many ascetics and brahmins
Today I have come to know what is the next lifes true welfare
Indeed for my welfare did the Buddha come and spend time in lavī
when today I have come to know where that which is given bears great fruit
I will roam about from village to village city to city
revering the Sambuddha and the good qualities of the Dhamma
After saying this the yakkha lavaka said this to the Fortunate One
Excellent reverend Gotama Excellent reverend Gotama
Just as reverend Gotama one might set upright what has been overturned
or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost
or bear an oil lamp in the darkness
so that one who has eyes can see forms
just so has the Dhamma been made clear by reverend Gotama in more than one way
I go to the reverend Gotama for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
Please bear it in mind reverend Gotama that I am a lay disciple
who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I am furnished with life
May all creatures all breathing creatures all beings

In in the Eastern direction in the Western direction

May all creatures all breathing creatures all beings

I have attained what is wholesome by the power of this may all beings
having understood the King of the True Dhammas Doctrine be led to happiness
attain to purity practise comfortably
be without grief without continuing despair and attain the supreme happiness of Emancipation
May the True Dhamma last long may all beings have respect for the Dhamma
may the raingods rain down at the right time
Just like the Good Kings of old gave protection likewise
may the present King protect the people righteously like he protects himself
By this practice in conformity with the Dhamma I worship the Buddha
by this practice in conformity with the Dhamma I worship the Dhamma
by this practice in conformity with the Dhamma I worship the Saṅgha
by this practice may I be freed from birth old age sickness and death
May my merit bring about the destruction of the pollutants
May my merit be a condition for gaining Emacipation
I share my portion of merits with all beings
may all of them share my portion of merits evenly
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then a certain god towards the end of the night
whose surpassing beauty lit up the whole of Jetas Wood
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he stood on one side
While standing on one side that god recited a verse to the Fortunate One
We ask reverend Gotama regarding the man going to ruin

To all kinds of poisonous snakes it is like the medicine of a divine charm
it destroyed terrible poisons and all other dangers
In this orders domain which is everywhere always for all living creatures
it thoroughly destroys all dangers we will recite that safeguard
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then at that time near Sāvatthī
a certain monk was bitten by a snake and died
Then a great many monks approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sitting on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir near Sāvatthī
a certain monk has been bitten by a snake and has died
Surely monks that monk did not
suffuse the four royal families of snakes with a mind full of friendliness
For if monks that monk
had suffused the four royal families of snakes with a mind full of friendliness
then that monk monks would not have been bitten by a snake and died
Who are the four royal families of snakes
The Virūpakkha royal family of snakes
the Erāpatha royal family of snakes
the Chabyāputta royal family of snakes
the Kaṇhāgotamaka royal family of snakes
Surely monks that monk did not
suffuse these four royal families of snakes with a mind full of friendliness
For if monks that monk
had suffused these four royal families of snakes with a mind full of friendliness
then that monk monks would not have been bitten by a snake and died
I allow you monks
to suffuse these four royal families of snakes with a mind full of friendliness
to guard yourselves to protect yourselves to safeguard yourselves
The Fortunate One said this
and after saying this the Happy One the Teacher said something more
I am friendly with the Virūpakkhas with the Erāpathas I am friendly
I am friendly with the Chabyāputtas and friendly with the Kaṇhāgotamakas
I am friendly with those without feet with those with two feet I am friendly
I am friendly with those with four feet with those with many feet I am friendly
May the one without feet not hurt me may the one with two feet not hurt me
may the one with four feet not hurt me may the one with many feet not hurt me
May all beings all living creatures all who are born in their entirety
may all see prosperity may nothing bad come to anyone
The Buddha is measureless
The Dhamma is measureless
The Saṅgha is measureless
Measurable are creeping things such as snakes scorpions centipedes spiders lizards and rats
I have made this protection I have made this safeguard may all these beings go away
I revere the Fortunate One I revere the seven Perfect Sambuddhas
With proper discernment I make use of the robe
only to ward off the cold to ward off the heat
to ward off contact with gadflies mosquitoes wind the heat of the sun and creeping things
only as a cover for the shameful parts
With proper discernment I make use of almsfood
not for sport or for showing off not for ornament or for adornment
but only to maintain this body and to carry on
to inhibit annoyance and to assist in the spiritual life
and so I will get rid of any old feeling
and not produce any new feeling
and I will carry on being blameless and living comfortably
With proper discernment I make use of a dwelling
only to ward off the cold to ward off the heat
to ward off contact with gadflies mosquitoes wind the heat of the sun and serpents
only to dispel the trouble of the varying seasons and so as to delight in seclusion
With proper discernment I make use of the requisite of medicine for support when sick
only to ward off oppressive feelings that have arisen
and at least be free from oppression
Whatever bad sign inauspicious event or whatever ominous bird shriek there is
also evil planets and unpleasant dreams may they perish through the power of the Buddha
Whatever bad sign inauspicious event or whatever ominous bird shriek there is
also evil planets and unpleasant dreams may they perish through the power of the Dhamma
whatever bad sign inauspicious event or whatever ominous bird shriek there is
also evil planets and unpleasant dreams may they perish through the power of the Saṅgha
May those who suffer be without suffering may those who fear be without fear
may those who grieve be without grief  may all living creatures be so
All the Buddhas strength and whatever strength the Independent Buddhas
and Worthy Ones have by that power we bind this protection in every way
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of all the Buddhas may you be safe forever
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you

By the recollection of that safeguard living creatures in the firmament

From the net of all adversity arising from yakkhas thieves and rivals
those who were released cannot be numbered we will recite that safeguard
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
There it was that the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Monks Reverend Sir those monks replied to the Fortunate One
and the Fortunate One said this
Formerly monks there was a massed battle between the gods and the asuras
Then monks the lord of the gods Sakka addressed the Tāvatisa gods saying
If dear Sirs to the gods who have gone into battle
there should arise fear or terror or horror
at that time you could look for the top of my banner
For to those who look to the top of my banner
whatever fear there may be or terror
or horror will be given up
If you cannot look to the top of my banner
then you could look for the top of the godking Pajāpatis banner
For to those who look to the top of the godking Pajāpatis banner
whatever fear there may be or terror
or horror will be given up
If you cannot look to the top of the godking Pajāpatis banner
then you could look for the top of the godking Varuṇas banner
For to those who look to the top of the godking Varuṇas banner
whatever fear there may be or terror
or horror will be given up
If you cannot look to the top of the godking Varuṇas banner
then you could look for the top of the godking sānas banner
For to those who look to the top of the godking sānas banner
whatever fear there may be or terror
or horror will be given up
But monks to he
who looks to the top of the lord of the gods Sakkas banner
or who looks to the top of the godking Pajāpatis banner
or who looks to the top of the godking Varuṇas banner
or who looks to the top of the godking sānas banner
whatever fear there may be or terror or horror
may be given up and may not be given up
What is the reason for that
The lord of the gods Sakka monks is not free from passion is not free from hatred is not free from delusion
being fearful terrified scared he ran away
But I say this monks
If to you monks after going to the wilderness
or to the root of a tree or to an empty place
there should arise fear or terror or horror
at that time you could recollect me thus
Such is he the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
the one endowed with understanding and good conduct the Happy One the One who understands the worlds
the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming
the Teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Fortunate One
For monks to those who recollect me whatever fear there may be
or terror or horror will be given up
If you cannot recollect me then recollect the Dhamma thus
The Dhamma has been wellproclaimed by the Fortunate One
it is visible not subject to time inviting inspection onward leading
and can be understood by the wise for themselves
For monks to those who recollect the Dhamma whatever fear there may be
or terror or horror will be given up
If you cannot recollect the Dhamma then recollect the Saṅgha thus
The Fortunate Ones Saṅgha of disciples are good in their practice
the Fortunate Ones Saṅgha of disciples are straight in their practice
the Fortunate Ones Saṅgha of disciples are systematic in their practice
the Fortunate Ones Saṅgha of disciples are correct in their practice
that is to say the four pairs of persons the eight individual persons
this is the Fortunate Ones Saṅgha of disciples
they are worthy of offerings of hospitality of gifts and of reverential salutation
they are an unsurpassed field of merit for the world
For monks to those who recollect the Saṅgha whatever fear there may be
or terror or horror will be given up
What is the reason for that
The Realised One monks the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
is free from passion is free from hatred is free from delusion
not being fearful not terrified not scared he did not run away
The Fortunate One said this
and after saying this the Happy One the Teacher said something more
In the wilds at the root of a tree or in an empty place monks
you must recollect the Sambuddha and there will be no fear for you
if you can't remember the Buddha the worlds elder the manbull
then you must remember the Dhamma which leads out which is well preached
If you can't remember the Dhamma which leads out which is well preached
then you must remember the Saṅgha which is an unsurpassed field of merit
Thus for those who remember the Buddha the Dhamma or the Saṅgha monks
there will be no fear or terror there will be no horror
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana
There it was that the Fortunate One addressed the groupoffive monks saying
There are these two extremes monks that one who has gone forth ought not to associate with
which is this devotion to the pleasure and happiness in sense pleasures
which is low vulgar worldly ignoble and not connected with the goal
and this devotion to selfmortification
which is painful ignoble and not connected with the goal
Not having approached either of these two extremes monks the middle practice
was awakened to by the Realised One which produces vision produces knowledge
and which leads to peace deep knowledge Complete Awakening and Nibbāna
Now what is this middle practice monks
that was awakened to by the Realised One which produces vision produces knowledge
and which leads to peace deep knowledge Complete Awakening and Nibbāna
It is this noble path with eight factors as follows
right view
right thought
right speech
right action
right livelihood
right endeavour
right mindfulness
right concentration
This is the middle practice monks
that was awakened to by the Realised One which produces vision produces knowledge
and which leads to peace deep knowledge Complete Awakening and Nibbāna
Now this monks is the noble truth of suffering
birth is suffering
also old age is suffering
also sickness is suffering
also death is suffering
being joined to what is not dear is suffering
being separated from what is dear is suffering
also not to obtain what one longs for is suffering
in brief the five constituent groups of mind and body that provide fuel for attachment are suffering
Now this monks is the noble truth of the arising of suffering
it is that craving which leads to continuation in existence
which is connected with enjoyment and passion greatly enjoying this and that as follows
craving for sense pleasures
craving for continuation
craving for discontinuation
Now this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering
it is the complete fading away and cessation without remainder of that craving 
liberation letting go release and nonadherence
Now this monks
is the noble truth of the practice leading to the end of suffering
It is this noble path with eight factors as follows
right view
right thought
right speech
right action
right livelihood

to me monks regarding these previously unheardof things

For as long as to me monks in regard to these four noble truths
 turned like this in three ways twelvefold 
knowledge and insight as it really is was not quite clear
for that long monks I did not declare to the world with its gods Māra and Brahma
to this generation with its ascetics and brahmins princes and men
that I was fully awakened with unsurpassed complete awakening
But when to me monks in regard to these four noble truths
 turned like this in three ways twelvefold 
knowledge and insight as it really is was quite clear
then monks I did declare to the world with its gods Māra and Brahma
to this generation with its ascetics and brahmins princes and men
that I was fully awakened with unsurpassed complete awakening
To me knowledge and seeing arose
Sure is my freedom of mind
this is my last birth
now there is no continuation of existence
The Fortunate One said this
and the groupoffive monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One
Moreover as this sermon was being given
to venerable Koṇḍañña the dustfree stainless
VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing

Sikhī the Teacher who is a benefit to all Vessabhū who gives happiness
Kakusandha the leader of the pack Koṇāgamana who gave up what is harmful

Through their truth and virtue and the strength of their patience and friendliness

There are in this body
hairs of the head body hairs nails teeth skin
flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys
heart liver pleura spleen lungs
intestines mesentery undigested food excrement
bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat
tears grease spit mucus synovial fluid urine
and the brain in the head
To the monks who felt a sense of urgency after hearing the simile on the mass of fire
the Great Sage preached this safeguard for their welfare and satisfaction
For the whole worlds welfare and benefit we will recite that safeguard
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
There it was that the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Monks Reverend Sir those monks replied to the Fortunate One
and the Fortunate One said this
Monks from the freedom of mind by friendliness meditation
when practised developed made much of carried on
established maintained augmented and properly instigated
eleven advantages are to be expected
What are the eleven
He sleeps happily
he wakes up happily
he does not see bad dreams
he is dear to human beings
he is dear to nonhuman beings
the gods protect him
neither fire poison or sword can affect him
he can concentrate his mind quickly
his complexion becomes clear
he dies unbewildered
and if he penetrates no further he will at least go to the Brahma world
Monks from the freedom of mind by friendliness meditation
when practised developed made much of carried on
established maintained augmented and properly instigated
there are these eleven advantages to be expected
The Fortunate One said this
and those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in the Fortunate Ones words
Because of the power of that safeguard the yakkhas could not make fearful sights appear
by practising that diligently night and day
he sleeps happily and while sleeping does not see anything bad 
it is endowed with such qualities we will recite that safeguard
What should be done by one skilled in goodness who has comprehended the state of peace
he ought to be able straight and upright easy to speak to meek without conceit
satisfied with little easy to support free from duties and light in living
with faculties at peace prudent not forward and greedless among the families
he should not do the slightest thing whereby others who are wise might find fault with him
May all beings be happy and secure may all beings in their hearts be happy
Whatsoever breathing beings there are  trembling firm or any other beings
whether they be long or great of middle size short tiny or of compact body
those who are seen and those who are unseen those who live far away those who are near
those who are born and those who still seek birth may all beings in their hearts be happy
No one should cheat another nor should he despise anyone wherever he is
he should not long for suffering for another because of anger or resentment
In the same way as a mother would protect her child her only child with her life
so too towards all beings one should develop the measureless thought of friendliness
Towards the entire world he should develop the measureless thought of friendliness
above below and across the middle without barriers hate or enmity
Standing walking sitting lying for as long as he is without torpor
he should be resolved on this mindfulness for this they say here is the true spiritual life
Without going near a wrong view virtuous and endowed with true insight
having removed greed towards sense pleasures he does not come to lie in a womb again
The elder Girimānanda having heard that safeguard
from the elder nanda at that moment became free from adversity
It is about the ten perceptions we will recite that safeguard
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then at that time venerable Girimānanda
was afflicted suffering and very sick
Then venerable nanda approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
Reverend Sir venerable Girimānanda is afflicted suffering and very sick
Please reverend Sir may the Fortunate One approach
venerable Girimānanda taking pity on him
If you nanda having approached the monk Girimānanda
were to recite the ten perceptions then it is possible that
having heard the ten perceptions the monk Girimānandas
affliction would immediately abate
What are the ten
The perception of impermanence
the perception of nonself
the perception of the unattractive
the perception of danger
the perception of giving up
the perception of dispassion
the perception of cessation
the perception of nondelight in the whole world
the perception of impermanence in all processes
mindfulness while breathing
Now what nanda is the perception of impermanence
Here nanda a monk who has gone to the wilderness or to the root of a tree
or to an empty place considers thus
form is impermanent
feelings are impermanent
perceptions are impermanent
mental processes are impermanent
consciousness is impermanent
Thus in regard to these five constituent groups of mind and body that provide fuel for attachment he dwells contemplating impermanence
This nanda is called the perception of impermanence
Now what nanda is the perception of nonself
Here nanda a monk who has gone to the wilderness or to the root of a tree
or to an empty place considers thus
the eye is not self  forms are not self
the ear is not self  sounds are not self
the nose is not self  smells are not self
the tongue is not self  tastes are not self
the body is not self  tangibles are not self
the mind is not self  thoughts are not self
Thus in regard to these six internal and external sense spheres
he dwells contemplating nonself
This nanda is called the perception of nonself
Now what nanda is the perception of the unattractive
Here nanda a monk in regard to this body 
from the sole of the feet upwards from the hair of the head down bounded by the skin
and filled with manifold impurities  reflects thus
There are in this body
hairs of the head body hairs nails teeth skin
flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys
heart liver pleura spleen lungs
intestines mesentery undigested food excrement
bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat
tears grease spit mucus synovial fluid urine
Thus in regard to this body he dwells contemplating what is unattractive
This nanda is called the perception of the unattractive
Now what nanda is the perception of danger
Here nanda a monk who has gone to the wilderness or to the root of a tree
or to an empty place considers thus
This body has many sufferings many dangers
thus in connection with this body various afflictions arise like this
eyedisease eardisease nosedisease tonguedisease bodydisease ie diseases affecting the sense spheres
headdisease eardisease mouthdisease toothdisease
cough asthma catarrh pyrexia fever
stomachache fainting diarrhoea gripes cholera

afflictions arising from excess bile afflictions arising from excess phlegm
afflictions arising from excess wind afflictions arising from a conflict of humours
afflictions born of a change of season afflictions born of not being careful
afflictions from being attacked afflictions born as a result of previous unwholesome actions
cold heat hunger thirst stool urine
Thus in regard to this body he dwells contemplating danger
This nanda is called the perception of danger
Now what nanda is the perception of giving up
Here nanda a monk does not consent to thoughts of sense desire that have arisen
these he gives up dispels brings to an end and makes nonexistent
He does not consent to thoughts of illwill that have arisen
these he gives up dispels brings to an end and makes nonexistent
He does not consent to thoughts of violence that have arisen
these he gives up dispels brings to an end and makes nonexistent
He does not consent to any bad unwholesome thoughts that have arisen
these he gives up dispels brings to an end and makes nonexistent
This nanda is called the perception of giving up
Now what nanda is the perception of dispassion
Here nanda a monk who has gone to the wilderness or to the root of a tree
or to an empty place considers thus
This is peaceful this is excellent
that is to say
the tranquilising of all processes
the letting go of all bases for cleaving
the end of craving
dispassion
Nibbāna
This nanda is called the perception of dispassion
Now what nanda is the perception of cessation
Here nanda a monk who has gone to the wilderness or to the root of a tree
or to an empty place considers thus
This is peaceful this is excellent
that is to say
the tranquilising of all processes
the letting go of all bases for cleaving

cessation
Nibbāna
This nanda is called the perception of cessation
Now what nanda is the perception of nondelight in the whole world
Here nanda a monk in regard to whatever in the world are selfish means and attachments or mental determinations settled beliefs and tendencies
giving these up not being attached he abstains from them
This nanda is the perception of nondelight in the whole world
Now what nanda is the perception of impermanence in all processes
Here nanda a monk
in regard to all processes is distressed ashamed and disgusted
This nanda is the perception of impermanence in all processes
Now what nanda is mindfulness while breathing
Here nanda a monk who has gone to the wilderness or to the root of a tree
or to an empty place sits down
After folding his legs crosswise setting his body straight
and establishing mindfulness at the front
mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
While breathing in long he knows I am breathing in long
while breathing out long he knows I am breathing out long
while breathing in short he knows I am breathing in short
while breathing out short he knows I am breathing out short
he trains like this experiencing the whole body I will breathe in

This nanda is mindfulness while breathing
If you nanda having approached the monk Girimānanda
were to recite these ten percpetions then it is possible that
having heard these ten perceptions the monk Girimānandas
affliction would immediately abate
Then venerable nanda having learned these ten perceptions from the Fortunate One
approached venerable Girimānanda
and after approaching he recited these ten perceptions to venerable Girimānanda
Then having heard these ten perceptions venerable Girimānandas
affliction immediately abated
and venerable Girimānanda recovered from that affliction
and by that venerable Girimānandas affliction was brought to an end
Then the Fortunate One when that night had passed addressed the monks saying
This night monks the Four Great Kings
with a great army of yakkhas with a great army of gandhabbas
with a great army of kumbhaṇḍas with a great army of nāgas
having set up a protection over the four quarters having set serried troops at the four directions
having set up a barricade at the four directions at the end of the night
having lit up the whole of Vultures Peak with their surpassing beauty
approached me
and after approaching and worshipping me they sat down on one side
Then of those yakkhas monks
some after worshipping me sat down on one side
Some exchanged greetings with me
and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings sat down on one side
Some after raising their hands in respectful salutation to me sat down on one side
Some after announcing their name and family sat down on one side
Some while keeping silent sat down on one side
Then while sitting on one side monks
the Great King Vessavaṇa said this to me
There are reverend Sir some high ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Fortunate One
there are reverend Sir some high ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Fortunate One
there are reverend Sir some middle ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Fortunate One
there are reverend Sir some middle ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Fortunate One
there are reverend Sir some low ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Fortunate One
there are reverend Sir some low ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Fortunate One
But reverend Sir almost all of the yakkhas are not pleased with the Fortunate One
What is the reason for that
Because reverend Sir the Fortunate One preaches the Dhamma of refraining from killing living creatures
preaches the Dhamma of refraining from taking what has not been given
preaches the Dhamma of refraining from sexual misconduct
preaches the Dhamma of refraining from false speech
preaches the Dhamma of refraining from liquor wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessness
But reverend Sir almost all of the yakkhas do not refrain from killing living creatures
do not refrain from taking what has not been given
do not refrain from sexual misconduct
do not refrain from false speech
do not refrain from liquors wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessness
To them that is neither dear nor appealing
There are reverend Sir disciples of the Fortunate One in the wilderness
who are practising in remote jungle dwelling places
where there is little sound little noise which have a lonely atmosphere
lying hidden away from men which are suitable for seclusion
And there are high ranking yakkhas settled there
who are not pleased with the word of the Fortunate One
To please then reverend Sir may the Fortunate One learn this ṭānāṭiya protection
for the monks nuns laymens and laywomens
guard protection freedom from harm and comfortable living
And I monks by keeping silent gave consent
Then the Great King Vessavaṇa monks having understood my consent
on that occasion recited this ṭānāṭiya protection

The Fortunate One said this
and those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One
By this declaration of the truth may you be safe at all times
By this declaration of the truth may you have the blessing of success
By this declaration of the truth may all disease be destroyed
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling amongst the Sakyans
in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu with a great Saṅgha of monks
consisting of five hundred monks all of them Worthy Ones
and almost all of the gods from the ten worldelements had assembled
to see the Fortunate One and the Saṅgha of monks
Then this occurred to four gods from among the hosts in the Pure Abodes
The Fortunate One is dwelling amongst the Sakyans
in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu with a great Saṅgha of moṅks
consisting of five hundred monks all of them Worthy Ones
and almost all of the gods from the ten world elements have assembled
to see the Fortunate One and the Saṅgha of monks
Well now we too could approach the Fortunate One
and after approaching the Fortunate One we could recite a verse each in his presence
Then those gods just as a strong man
might stretch out a bent arm or bend in an outstretched arm
in the same way disappeared from among the gods of the Pure Abodes
and appeared in front of the Fortunate One
Then those gods after worshipping the Fortunate One stood on one side
While standing on one side one of the gods
recited this verse in the presence of the Fortunate One
There is a great convention in the wood and a host of gods have come
we have come to this Dhamma convention
to see the Saṅgha who are undefeated
Then another god recited this verse in the presence of the Fortunate One
In this place the monks are concentrated
they have straightened out their minds by themselves
like a charioteer who has taken the reins
the wise protect their sense faculties
Then another god recited this verse in the presence of the Fortunate One
Having cut off the hindrance and obstacle
and dug up the locking post they are unmoved
they live pure and unstained
young nāgas welltamed by the Visionary
Then another god recited this verse in the presence of the Fortunate One
Whoever has gone to the Buddha for refuge
will not go to the lower worlds
After giving up the human body
they will fill up the ranks of the gods
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Monks almost all of the gods from the ten worldelements have assembled
to see the Realised One and the Saṅgha of monks
Monks those who in the past were Worthy Ones
Perfect Sambuddhas for those Fortunate Ones also
at least as many gods have assembled
as for me at the present time
Monks those who in the future will be Worthy Ones
Perfect Sambuddhas for those Fortunate Ones also
at least as many gods will assemble
as for me at the present time
Monks I will declare the names of the hosts of gods
monks I will proclaim the names of the hosts of gods
monks I will reveal the names of the hosts of gods
Listen to it apply your minds well and I will speak
Yes reverend Sir those monks replied to the Fortunate One
and the Fortunate One said this
I will repeat a famous verse a Siloka wherever the gods of the Earth live
There are monks who live in a hill cave who are resolute composed
who are like lions crouching who have overcome all horror
with minds that are cleansed and purified which are clear and undisturbed
He knew there were more than five hundred in the wood near Kapilavatthu like this
therefore the Teacher addressed those disciples who delight in the teaching
A host of gods have drawn near to us you should know who they are monks
Then those monks became ardent after hearing the Buddhas teaching
and knowledge was manifest to them seeing those nonhuman beings
and some of them saw a hundred a thousand or seventy thousand
Some of them saw a hundred thousand of those nonhuman beings
and some saw an endless number spread out in every direction
Having deep knowledge of all that the Visionary desired to speak
therefore the Teacher addressed those disciples who delight in the teaching
A host of gods have drawn near to us you should know who they are monks
I will proclaim their names to you with lyrics in regular order
There are seven thousand yakkhas Earth gods from Kapilavatthu
rejoicing they have drawn near the gathering of monks in the wood
From Hemavant there are six thousand yakkhas diverse in colour
rejoicing they have drawn near the gathering of monks in the wood
From Sātāgira there are three thousand yakkhas diverse in colour
who have psychic power who are bright beautiful and resplendent
rejoicing they have drawn near the gathering of monks in the wood
Like this there are sixteen thousand yakkhas diverse in colour

But at that time the nāga kings were without fear
for the Buddha made them safe from the supaṇṇas
Calling on one another with gentle words

Defeated by Vajirahattha the asuras live in the ocean

We shall see the casteless Saṅgha unhindered floodcrossers pollutionfree
and the nāga who is beyond the flood who like the Moon has overcome the darkness
Subrahmā and Paramatta along with the sons of the powerful one came
Sanaṅkumāra and Tissa also came to the gathering in the wood
In the thousand brahma worlds a Great Brahma has arisen
a bright one who stands out whose awesome body is resplendent
The ten Issarā brahmās came who individually wield power
and in the midst of them came Hārita with his entourage
Now when they had all drawn near Inda with the gods and the brahmās
Māras army also drew near behold the foolishness of the Dark One
Come now seize them and bind them he said let them be bound by passion
surround them on all sides do not let anyone of them go free
Thus in that place the great army leader sent forth his dark army
after striking the ground with his hand and making a fearful noise
like a storm cloud shedding rain thundering with flashes of lightning 
but then he retreated angry and unable to control himself
Knowing all that was happening the Visionary desired to speak
therefore the Teacher addressed those disciples who delight in the teaching
Māras army has drawn near to us you should know who they are monks
Then those monks became ardent after hearing the Buddhas teaching
They withdrew from the passionless monks not one of their hairs was shaken
They are all victorious in battle beyond fear and resplendent
those disciples famous among men along with all beings are glad
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak mountain
Then the Four Great Kings
with a great army of yakkhas with a great army of gandhabbas
with a great army of kumbhaṇḍas with a great army of nāgas
having set up a protection over the four quarters having set serried troops at the four directions
having set up a barricade at the four directions at the end of the night
having lit up the whole of Vultures Peak with their surpassing beauty
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
Then of those yakkhas
some after worshipping the Fortunate One sat down on one side
Some exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One
and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings sat down on one side
Some after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Fortunate One sat down on one side
Some after announcing their name and family sat down on one side
Some while keeping silent sat down on one side
Then while sitting on one side the Great King Vessavaṇa
said this to the Fortunate One
There are reverend Sir some high ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Fortunate One
there are reverend Sir some high ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Fortunate One
there are reverend Sir some middle ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Fortunate One
there are reverend Sir some middle ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Fortunate One
there are reverend Sir some low ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Fortunate One
there are reverend Sir some low ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Fortunate One
But reverend Sir almost all of the yakkhas are not pleased with the Fortunate One
What is the reason for that
Because reverend Sir the Fortunate One preaches the Dhamma of refraining from killing living creatures
preaches the Dhamma of refraining from taking what has not been given
preaches the Dhamma of refraining from sexual misconduct
preaches the Dhamma of refraining from false speech
preaches the Dhamma of refraining from liquor wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessness
But reverend Sir almost all of the yakkhas do not refrain from killing living creatures
do not refrain from taking what has not been given
do not refrain from sexual misconduct
do not refrain from false speech
do not refrain from liquors wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessness
To them that is neither dear nor appealing
There are reverend Sir disciples of the Fortunate One in the wilderness
who are practising in remote jungle dwelling places
where there is little sound little noise which have a lonely atmosphere
lying hidden away from men which are suitable for seclusion
And there are high ranking yakkhas settled there
who are not pleased with the word of the Fortunate One
To please then reverend Sir may the Fortunate One learn this ṭānāṭiya protection
for the monks nuns laymens and laywomens
guard protection freedom from harm and comfortable living
The Fortunate One by keeping silent gave consent
Then the Great King Vessavaṇa having understood the Fortunate Ones consent
on that occasion recited this ṭānāṭiya protection

This is what the Great Sage preached about the qualities of the monks
after hearing it and while practising he is freed from all suffering
For the whole worlds benefit and welfare we will recite that safeguard
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
There it was that the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Monks Reverend Sir those monks replied to the Fortunate One
and the Fortunate One said this
There are these ten things monks
that one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on
What are the ten
I have become one who has no distinctive appearance
one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this
I am bound to others for my livelihood
one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this
I should comport myself differently
one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this
Can I myself find no fault with my virtue
one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this
Will my wise companions in the spiritual life after testing me
find no fault with my virtue
one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this
There is alteration in and separation from all that is dear and appealing to me
one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this
It is actions that I own it is actions that I am heir to it is actions that I am born from
actions are my kinsfolk actions are my refuge 
whatever actions I perform whether good or bad
to that I will be the heir
one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this
In what way do the nights and days pass for me
one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this
Do I delight in empty places
one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this
Has a state beyond ordinary human beings 
the distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and seeing  been attained by me
Will I at the end when questioned by my companions in the spiritual life
not be embarrassed
one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this
These are the ten things monks
that one who has gone forth should frequently reflect on
The Fortunate One said this
and those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in the Fortunate Ones words
While fulfilling the conditions for Awakening he was born as a kind of quail
and through his spiritual power the Great Being avoided the forestfire
This was spoken by the Lord of the World to the Elder Sāriputta
it has great power for a worldcycle we will recite that safeguard
There is in the world virtue truth purity and empathy
by the truth of that I will make an asseveration of supreme truth
After reflecting on the strength of the Dhamma and recalling the former Victors
relying on the strength of truth I made an asseveration of truth
There are wings which fly not there are feet which walk not
Mother and Father have gone out Fire please depart
This asseveration was made by me with truth and the great blazing fire
avoided this area for sixteen measures like fire after reaching water
there is no one my equal for truth such is my perfection of truth
By this declaration of the truth may you be safe at all times
The elder Mahā Moggallāna having heard that safeguard
from the Sage at that moment became free from adversity
It is about the strength of the factors of Awakening we will recite that safeguard
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
at the Squirrels Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood
Then at that time venerable Mahā Moggallāna

Then the Fortunate One rising from seclusion in the evening time
approached venerable Mahā Moggallāna
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat
Having sat down the Fortunate One said this to venerable Mahā Moggallāna
Can you bear up Moggallāna Can you carry on
Do painful feelings decrease and not increase
Is it known that they are decreasing and not increasing
No reverend Sir I cannot bear up nor can I carry on

Thus the tree and the lord and the lord and the tree
With each other quarrel and each other destroy
So it is with men wherever a quarrel starts
They dance the peacock dance like the lord and the tree
I say this to you hearken all assembled here
Be friendly dont quarrel be not like lord and tree
Train in peace this is praised by the Awakened Ones
Delight in peace righteousness safety will not be destroyed
Whatever beings have come together here whether of the earth or in the firmament
may the minds of all those beings be happy and may they listen carefully to what is said
Therefore all of you beings be attentive be friendly towards this generation of men
they who bring offerings by day and by night therefore being heedful you must protect them
Whatever riches there are  here or elsewhere or in the heavens  that excellent treasure
is not equal unto the Realised One this excellent treasure is in the Buddha
by virtue of this truth may there be safety
Pollutants end dispassion deathlessness excellence which the concentrated Sakyan sage attained
there is nothing that is equal to that state this excellent treasure is in the Dhamma

What should be done by one skilled in goodness who has comprehended the state of peace
he ought to be able straight and upright easy to speak to meek without conceit
satisfied with little easy to support free from duties and light in living
with faculties at peace prudent not forward and greedless among the families
he should not do the slightest thing whereby others who are wise might find fault with him
May all beings be happy and secure may all beings in their hearts be happy
Whatsoever breathing beings there are trembling firm or any other beings
whether they be long or great of middle size short tiny or of compact body
those who are seen and those who are unseen those who live far away those who are near
those who are born and those who still seek birth may all beings in their hearts be happy
No one should cheat another nor should he despise anyone wherever he is
he should not long for suffering for another because of anger or resentment
In the same way as a mother would protect her child her only child with her life
so too towards all beings one should develop the measureless thought of friendliness
Towards the entire world he should develop the measureless thought of friendliness
above below and across the middle without barriers hate or enmity
Standing walking sitting lying for as long as he is without torpor
he should be resolved on this mindfulness for this they say here is the true spiritual life
Without going near a wrong view virtuous and endowed with true insight
having removed greed towards sense pleasures he does not come to lie in a womb again
Those gods who are peaceful with peaceful minds who have taken refuge in the triple refuge whether here or above the worlds
the various earth gods that group who have taken up and are engaged in virtuous deeds all of the time
may these gods come those who dwell on the majestic Mt Meru that excellent golden mountain
peacefully and with good reason  to hear the Sages excellent word about entering the stream and harmony
May all yakkhas gods and deities from the whole universe
After partaking of the merits and of all the thoroughly good fortune
We have acquired being in harmony and delighting in the teaching
Be not heedless and grant us complete protection
May the teaching and the world be on the increase every day
And may the gods every day protect the teaching and the world
May you and all those who are around you together with
All your relatives be untroubled happy and easy in mind
May you be protected from the king thieves humans and nonhumans
from fire and water demons stumps and thorns
from unlucky stars and epidemics
from what is not the true dhamma not right view not a good person
and from fierce elephants horses antelopes bulls dogs snakes scorpions poisonous serpents
panthers bears hyenas wild boars buffaloes yakkhas rakkhasas and so on
from the manifold fears the manifold diseases
the manifold calamities from all of these troubles may you receive protection
Beginning with the aspiration for Buddhahood and thinking of the Realised Ones ten perfections
Ten minor perfections ten great perfections  altogether thirty perfections
His five great sacrifices three ways of conduct
descent into the womb for his final existence birth
Great renunciation life of effort sitting cross legged at the Bodhi tree victory over Māra
His penetration and knowledge of omniscience and his nine supermundane attainments
And after considering all these Buddha qualities going around the three walls of Vesāli
During the three watches of the night the venerable elder nanda
After establishing great compassion in his heart made this safeguard
All beings subsist on food
Mind and body
The three feelings
The four noble truths
The five constituent groups of mind and body that provide fuel for attachment
The six internal sense spheres
The seven factors of Awakening
The noble path with eight factors
The nine abodes of beings
When endowed with ten factors he is said to be Worthy
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling amongst the Magadhans
on the Southern Hill near the brahmin village Ekanālā
Then at that time the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja
had about five hundred ploughs yoked up during the sowing season
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time after picking up his bowl and robe
approached the place where the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja was working
Then at that time the brahmin Kasībhāradvājas food distribution was proceeding
Then the Fortunate One approached the food distribution
and after approaching he stood on one side
The brahmin Kasībhāradvāja saw the Fortunate One standing for alms
and after seeing him he said this to the Fortunate One
Ascetic I plough and I sow
and after ploughing and sowing I eat
You also ascetic should plough and sow
and after ploughing and sowing you can eat
Brahmin I also plough and sow
and after ploughing and sowing I eat
But we do not see the reverend Gotamas
yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxen
but still the reverend Gotama said this
Brahmin I also plough and sow
and after ploughing and sowing I eat 
Then the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja
recited a verse to the Fortunate One
You claim that you are a ploughman but we do not see your ploughing
Please tell us about ploughing when asked so that we may know your ploughing
Confidence the seed austerity the rain wisdom is my yoke and plough
conscience the pole mind is the strap mindfulness is my ploughshare and goad
With body guarded speech guarded and stomach restrained regarding food
I make truth the mower temperance the setting free of the yoke
Energy my beast of burden the vehicle yoked to security 
without turning back it goes to that place where having gone one does not grieve
Thus this ploughing has been ploughed that produces the fruit of the deathless
and after ploughing this ploughing one is set free from all suffering
Then the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja
having arranged milkrice in a large bronze bowl presented it to the Fortunate One saying
Eat this milkrice reverend Gotama
the reverend one is a ploughman for the reverend Gotama
ploughs the ploughing which has the deathless as fruit
I will not eat what is gained through chanting verses
that is not the Dhamma brahmin of those who see
Buddhas reject what is gained through chanting verses
while Dhamma lasts brahmin this is their way of life
Another great sage who is fully adept
pollutantfree at peace regarding worry about wrongdoing
attend to with food and drink
for that is the field for those who look for merit
Then to whom reverend Gotama should I give this milkrice
I certainly do not see brahmin
in the world with its gods Māra and Brahma
in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins princes and men
anyone who having eaten this milkrice could properly digest it
except a Realised One or a Realised Ones disciple
Therefore brahmin cast away that milkrice where there is but little grass
or drop it into water which has no breathing creatures
Then the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja
dropped that milkrice into water which had no breathing creatures
Then that milkrice being thrown into water
did hiss and sizzle and steam and smoke
just as a ploughshare heated for a day when thrown into water
hisses and sizzles and steams and smokes
so that milkrice being thrown into water
did hiss and sizzle and steam and smoke
Then the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja anxious and horrified
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he fell down placing his head at the Fortunate Ones feet
said this to the Fortunate One
Excellent reverend Gotama Excellent reverend Gotama
Just as reverend Gotama one might set upright what has been overturned
or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost
or bear an oil lamp in the darkness
so that one who has eyes can see forms
just so has the Dhamma been made clear by reverend Gotama in more than one way
I go to the reverend Gotama for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
May I receive the going forth in the presence of reverend Gotama
may I receive the full ordination
The brahmin Kasībhāradvāja received
the going forth in the presence of the Fortunate One recieved full ordination
Then not long after ordination venerable Bhāradvāja
while dwelling solitary secluded heedful ardent and resolute
after no long time attained that good for which young gentlemen
rightly go forth from the house to the houseless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
and dwelt having known experienced and attained it himself in this very life
Destroyed is rebirth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of this mundane state  this he knew
And venerable Bhāradvāja became another of the Worthy Ones

at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There it was that the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
I will teach and analyse conditional origination monks for you
Apply your minds thoroughly to it and I will speak
Yes reverend Sir those monks replied to the Fortunate One
And what monks is conditional origination
With ignorance as condition monks there are volitional processes
with volitional processes as condition consciousness
with consciousness as condition mind and bodily form
with mind and bodily form as condition the six sense spheres
with the six sense spheres as condition contact
with contact as condition feeling
with feeling as condition craving
with craving as condition attachment
with attachment as condition continuation
with continuation as condition birth
with birth as condition old age death
grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all arise
and so there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering
And what monks is oldage and death
For the various beings in the various classes of beings
there is aging agedness broken teeth greying hair and wrinkled skin
the dwindling away of the life span the decay of the sense faculties
For the various beings in the various classes of beings
there is a fall a falling away a breaking up a disappearance a dying a death a making of time
the break up of the constituent groups of mind and bodily form the throwing off of the body
a cutting off of the lifefaculty
This is called death
This is oldage and this is death
This monks is called oldage and death
And what monks is birth
For the various beings in the various classes of beings
there is birth being born appearing arising turning up
the manifestation of the constituent groups of mind and bodily form the acquisition of the sense spheres
This monks is called birth
And what monks is coninuation
this monks is called continuation
And what monks is attachment
There are monks these four attachments attachment to sense pleasures attachment to views
attachment to virtue and practice attachment to selftheories
This monks is called attachment
And what monks is craving
There are these six cravings monks
craving for forms craving for sounds craving for odours
craving for tastes craving for touches craving for thoughts
This is called monks craving
And what monks is feeling
There are these six feelings monks
feeling arising from eyecontact feeling arising from earcontact feeling arising from nosecontact
feeling arising from tonguecontact feeling arising from bodycontact feeling arising from mindcontact
This is called monks feeling
And what monks is contact
There is a group of these six contacts monks
eyecontact earcontact nosecontact
tonguecontact bodycontact mindcontact
This is called monks contact
And what monks are the six sensespheres
eye sensesphere ear sensesphere nose sensesphere
tongue sensesphere body sensesphere mind sensesphere
This is called monks the six sensespheres
And what monks is mind and bodily form
Feeling perception intention contact application of mind
This is called mind
The four great elementals and the form attached to the four great elementals
This is called bodily form
This is mind and this is bodily form
This is called monks mind and bodily form
And what monks is consciousness
There are these six consciousnesses monks
eyeconsciousness earconsciousness noseconsciousness
tongueconsciousness bodyconsciousness mindconsciousness
This monks is called consciousness
And what monks are volitional processes
There are these three volitional processes monks
volitional processes expressed by way of body volitional processes expressed by way of speech volitional processes expressed by way of mind
These monks are called volitional processes
And what monks is ignorance
Whatever monks is not knowing suffering not knowing the origination of suffering
not knowing the cessation of suffering not knowing the path leading to the cessation of suffering
This monks is called ignorance
Thus monks with ignorance as condition there are volitional processes
with volitional processes as condition consciousness
with consciousness as condition mind and bodily form
with mind and bodily form as condition the six sense spheres
with the six sense spheres as condition contact
with contact as condition feeling
with feeling as condition craving
with craving as condition attachment
with attachment as condition continuation
with continuation as condition birth
with birth as condition old age death
grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all arise
and so there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering
But from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of volitional processes
from the cessation of volitional processes the cessation of consciousness
from the cessation of consciousness the cessation of mind and bodily form
from the cessation of mind and bodily form the cessation of the six sense spheres
from the cessation of the six sense spheres the cessation of contact
from the cessation of contact the cessation of feeling
from the cessation of feeling the cessation of craving
from the cessation of craving the cessation of attachment
from the cessation of attachment the cessation of continuation
from the cessation of continuation the cessation of birth
from the cessation of birth old age death
grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all cease
and so there is a cessation of this whole mass of suffering
There are these three belief systems monks
and though questioned queried and discussed by wise men
because they
Which three
There are some ascetics and brahmins monks who are of this argument this view
Whatever an individual experiences
whether pleasant painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant all of that is due to what was done in the past
There are some ascetics and brahmins monks who are of this argument this view
Whatever an individual experiences
whether pleasant painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant all of that is due to the power of God
There are some ascetics and brahmins monks who are of this argument this view
Whatever an individual experiences
whether pleasant painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant all of that has no cause or condition
Here monks as for those ascetics and brahmins who are of this argument this view
Whatever an individual experiences
whether pleasant painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant all of that is due to what was done in the past
having approached them I say
Is it true that you venerables are of this argument this view
Whatever an individual experiences
whether pleasant painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant all of that is due to what was done in the past
and if they agree with me when questioned thus saying yes I say to them
Then venerables people will be killers of living creatures because of what was done in the past
they will be takers of what is not given because of what was done in the past
they will be unchaste because of what was done in the past
they will be speakers of what is false because of what was done in the past
they will be utterers of divisive words because of what was done in the past
they will be utterers of harsh words because of what was done in the past
they will be frivolous talkers because of what was done in the past
they will be avaracious because of what was done in the past
they will be malevolent because of what was done in the past
they will hold to wrong views because of what was done in the past
But monks for he who holds what was done in the past as the essential thing
there is no desire nor effort thinking this should be done or this should not be done
but there being no truth or trust in what should be done or what should not be done
he lives without mindfulness
and that individual cannot reasonably be called an ascetic
This monks for the ascetics and brahmins who are of these arguments these views
is my first reasonable reproach
Here monks as for those ascetics and brahmins who are of this argument this view
Whatever an individual experiences
whether pleasant painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant all of that is due to the power of God

they will be frivolous talkers due to the power of God
they will be avaracious due to the power of God
they will be malevolent due to the power of God
they will hold to wrong views due to the power of God
But monks for he who holds the power of God as the essential thing
there is no desire nor effort thinking this should be done or this should not be done
but there being no truth or trust in what should be done or what should not be done
he lives without mindfulness without protection
and that individual cannot reasonably be called an ascetic
This monks for the ascetics and brahmins who are of these arguments these views

clansmen with an ochre robe around their necks who are unvirtuous and badnatured
But even a gift that is given to those unvirtuous ones because of the Community
at that time nanda will be an immeasureable unlimited offering to the Community I say
I certainly in no way nanda
say that a gift to an individual can have greater fruit than an offering to a Community
There are nanda these four purifications of offerings
Which four
There is an offering that is purified by the giver not by the receiver
there is an offering that is purified by the receiver not by the giver
there is an offering that is neither purified by the giver nor by the receiver
there is an offering that is purified by the giver and by the receiver
What nanda is an offering that is purified by the giver not by the receiver
Here nanda the giver is virtuous and goodnatured
and the receivers are unvirtuous and badnatured
in this way nanda the offering is purified by the giver not by the receiver
What nanda is an offering that is purified by the receiver not by the giver
Here nanda the giver is unvirtuous and badnatured
and the receivers are virtuous and goodnatured
in this way nanda the offering is purified by the receiver not by the giver
What nanda is an offering that is neither purified by the giver nor by the receiver
Here nanda the giver is unvirtuous and badnatured
and the receivers are unvirtuous and badnatured
in this way nanda the offering is purified neither by the giver nor by the receiver
What nanda is an offering that is purified by the giver and by the receiver
Here nanda the giver is virtuous and goodnatured
and the receivers are virtuous and goodnatured
in this way nanda the offering is purified by the giver and by the receiver
These nanda are these four purifications of offerings
The Fortunate One said this and after saying this the Happy One the Teacher said something more
That virtuous person who with a mind full of confidence gives a gift that has been righteously obtained to unvirtuous people
who has great faith in actions and their results that gift will be purified by the giver
That unvirtuous person who with a mind lacking in confidence gives a gift that has been unrighteously obtained to virtuous people
who does not have great faith in actions and their results that gift will be purified by the receiver
That unvirtuous person who with a mind lacking in confidence gives a gift that has been unrighteously obtained to unvirtuous people
who does not have great faith in actions and their results that gift will not bring an extensive reward I say
That virtuous person who with a mind full of confidence gives a gift that has been righteously obtained to virtuous people
who has great faith in actions and their results that gift will bring an extensive reward I say
That passionless person who with a mind full of confidence gives a gift that has been righteously obtained to passionless people
who has great faith in actions and their results that gift is the highest of worldly gifts
At one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then at that time the nun Khemā
while walking gradually through Kosala on walking tour
between Sāvatthī and Sāketa
had reached and was dwelling in Toraṇavatthu
Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi was going to Sāvatthī from Sāketa
and was between Sāvatthī and Sāketa
and had reached and was dwelling in Toraṇavatthu for a night
Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi addressed a certain man
saying Please go dear Sir and in Toraṇavatthu
see if there would be a suitable and knowledgeable ascetic or brāhmaṇa
I can pay homage to today
Yes your Majesty said that man and after replying to the Kosalan King Pasenadi
and wandering through the whole of Toraṇavatthu he did not find
a suitable and knowledgeable ascetic or brāhmaṇa
that the Kosalan King Pasenadi could pay homage to
But the man did see that the nun Khemā
had reached and was dwelling in Toraṇavatthu
Having seen her he approached the Kosalan King Pasenadi
and after approaching he said this to the Kosalan King Pasenadi
There is not your Majesty in Toraṇavatthu
a suitable and knowledgeable ascetic or brāhmaṇa your Majesty can pay homage to today
But there is your Majesty the nun named Khemā
who is a disciple of the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
and about this Noble Lady this beautiful report has gone round
She is wise learned intelligent a beautiful orator and extemporary speaker
Your Majesty can pay homage to her
Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi approached the nun Khemā
and after approaching and worshipping the nun Khemā he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the Kosalan King Pasenadi
said this to the nun Khemā
This has not been answered Great King by the Fortunate One

 you say This has not been answered Great King by the Fortunate One
Does the Realised One neither exist nor not exist after death 
What is the cause Noble Lady what is the reason why does the Fortunate One not answer this
Now then Great King here I will ask you something in return
as you see fit so you should answer

Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi
after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the nun Khemā
having worshipped and circumambulated the nun Khemā departed
Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi
at another time approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the Kosalan King Pasenadi said this to the Fortunate One

It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
in as much as the Teacher and the Disciple
agree in the meaning with the meaning and in the letter with the letter
concur do not contradict that is to say in regard to the highest matter
On one occasion reverend Sir after approaching the nun Khemā
I asked about this matter
and the Noble Lady answered this matter for me with this meaning with this letter
just as the Fortunate One did
It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
in as much as the Teacher and the Disciple
agree in the meaning with the meaning and in the letter with the letter
concur do not contradict that is to say in regard to the highest matter
And now reverend Sir we shall go
as we have many duties and there is much which ought to be done
Now is the time Great King for whatever you are thinking
The Kosalan King Pasenadi after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Fortunate One
having worshipped and circumambulated the Fortunate One departed
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Icchānaṅgala
in the Icchānaṅgala jungle thicket
Herein In the Icchānaṅgala jungle thicket means
in the jungle thicket not too far from the village of Icchānaṅgala
Then at that time many wellknown
wealthy brahmins were living in Icchānaṅgala such as
the brahmin Caṅkī the brahmin Tārukkha the brahmin Pokkharasāti
the brahmin Jānussoni the brahmin Todeyya
Caṅkī and so on means the five people who were religious advisors to King Pasenadi of Kosala
and other wellknown brahmins
Other wellknown brahmins means many other wellknown brahmins
It seems every six months they would assemble in one of two places
When they desired to purify their caste
then they would assemble near Pokkharasāti especially to purify their caste
When they desired to purify the Vedic mantras
then they would assemble at Icchānaṅgala
At this time they had assembled there for the purpose of completely purifying the Vedic mantras
Then to the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja
while wandering and strolling around on a walk
this discussion arose
This discussion means
they were discussing what was suitable in a friendly discussion as they strolled around
and this topic for discussion arose amongst other topics
How dear friend is one a brahmin
The student Bhāradvāja said this
When dear friend one is wellborn on both the mothers and fathers side
of pure descent as far as the seventh generation
not despised and blameless with regard to the matter of ones birth
to that extent one is a brahmin
The student Vāseṭṭha said this
When dear friend one is virtuous and endowed with good conduct
to that extent one is a brahmin
Virtuous means having good qualities
Endowed with good conduct means endowed with good practices
But neither was the student Bhāradvāja able to convince the student Vāseṭṭha
and nor was the student Vāseṭṭha able to convince the student Bhāradvāja
Then the student Vāseṭṭha addressed the student Bhāradvāja saying
This ascetic Gotama Bhāradvāja a son of the Sakyas having gone forth from the Sakyan clan
is dwelling near Icchānaṅgala in the Icchānaṅgala jungle thicket
and about this dear Gotama this beautiful report has gone round
Such is he the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
the one endowed with understanding and good conduct the Happy One the one who understands the worlds
the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming
the Teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Fortunate One
Come dear Bhāradvāja let us approach the ascetic Gotama
and having approached the ascetic Gotama let us ask him about this matter
and in whatever way this ascetic Gotama will explain it so we will bear it in mind
Just so dear friend the student Bhāradvāja replied to the student Vāseṭṭha
Then the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching they exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One
and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the student Vāseṭṭha
addressed the Fortunate One with a verse
We are both of us acknowledged sanctioned as knowing the three Vedas
Acknowledged sanctioned means acknowledged as trained by their teachers saying
Yes teacher we have been trained thus they are sanctioned
We are means we are alternative verb
I am Pokkharasātis and this one is Tārukkhas student means
I am Pokkharasātis senior attendant or chief pupil
this one is Tārukkhas so it is explained
What is declared in the three Vedas in that we are surely complete
The three Vedas means knowledge of the brahmins three Vedas
What is declared means that which is declared in each word according to the meaning and syllables
Herein We are complete the meaning is knowing all this we have come to completion
Now explaining completeness according to the line The words and so on is what is said
Herein chanting  like our teachers means we surely recite the same way as our teachers
Concerning the matter of birth there is a dispute between us Gotama
Bhāradvāja says one is a brahmin just by birth
According to deeds means according to the ten types of wholesome deeds
Because formerly in reference to the seven ways of bodily and verbal deeds
this was said When dear friend one is virtuous
in reference to the three ways of mental deeds good conduct is said
Endowed with this there is good practice
Visionary means having the five eyes of the Visionary
he is addressing the Fortunate One
We are unable to convince one another concerning this
Just as when the moon is full the people approach with their hands raised in salutation
Full means having a state of deficiency only in the past full is the meaning
Approach means come close to
Pay homage means make homage
The Eye has arisen in the world and therefore we ask Gotama
is one a brahmin through birth or is it through deeds
The Eye has arisen in the world means
having destroyed the darkness of blindignorance in the world
for showing the benefit of the world and what belongs to this world and so on he is endowed with the Eye
I will explain this to you said the Fortunate One to Vāseṭṭha
Thus having been praised by Vāseṭṭha and being requested the Fortunate One
treating the two people kindly said I will explain this to you and so on is what is said
Herein I will explain means I will explain alternate form
In order means lets leave the ideas of the brahmins
and I will explain to you successively beginning with plants trees arthropods and grasshoppers is the meaning
A classification of the species means an exposition of the species
For the species are different means
for the species of the various creatures are different of many kinds is the meaning
Understand plants and trees although they do not acknowledge it
Plants and trees means not having spoken about grasping another species
but later grasping this species I will say
This will be his natural species differentiation and so this teaching is begun
But the Elder Mahāsīvali says
Why is there nongrasping venerable Sir with the diversity of seeds
but there is grasping with a diversity of action
What is said in this way is not right
When asked thus it is certainly not right because an intentional deed despatches one to a womb
There are various types of beings that occur in the womb
Plants and trees herein at the very least having pith on the inside and wood on the outside
such as palms coconut and so on these are plants
but having heartwood on the inside and pith on the outside these are all known as trees
Although they do not acknowledge it means
saying We are plants we are trees or
I am a plant I am a tree they do not know it in this way
Sign of their species means without knowing it
there is the sign of their species their own form
like the root and body of the plant and so on are the same
Why is that
The species are different
Because plant species are one thing tree species are another
In plants palms are one species and reeds are another species thus it should be explained
Through this it is shown that on account of species there is diversity
even without ones own acknowledgment or without anothers indication
it is known
If there would be a brahmin by species
even without ones own acknowledgment or without anothers indication
he would be known as distinct from nobles traders and workers but he is not known
Therefore he is not a brahmin by birth
But further Just as in these species
through the words in the verse below the meaning will be explained
Then arthropods and grasshoppers
Having thus shown the species without grasping
showing those with grasping Then arthropods and so on is said
Up to ants and other insects the meaning is having made ants and other insects the limit
Herein after jumping in the air they proceed
For the species are different means
because their colour is blue red and so on there are species of diverse kinds
Understand also quadrupeds the small and the large
Small means squirrels and so on
Large means cats and so on
Understand reptiles snakes and pythons
Reptiles means they use their stomach as feet those whose stomach is their feet is what is said
Pythons means because it is like snakes from its head as far as its back and tail
through that they say pythons
Then understand the fish also aquatics and amphibians
Aquatics means belonging to water born in the water
Then understand birds flying creatures those who go through the sky
Birds means birds alternative word
They fly with their wings therefore they are flying creatures
They go through the sky therefore they are those who go through the sky
Just as in these species the sign of the species is various
Thus having shown that there is a species differentiation of living beings on the ground in the water and in the air
now with the intention of showing where
explaining this the verse Just as in these was spoken
That is the meaning in short is what was said
But here is what should be spoken about in extension
showing it oneself Not with the hair
Herein this is how to construe it that which is said
In humans there is no sign that the species is various
should be known This is not so
In what way
Not with the hair
There is no limitation saying The hair of brahmins is suchlike of nobles is suchlike
as it could be construed of all the elephants horses deer and so on in similar ways
not with the hair not with the head not with the ears not with the eyes
not with the neck not with the shoulders not with the belly not with the back
not with the hands not with the feet not with fingers not with the nails
There is no sign of a species as there is in other species
it should be known that this is the explanation of what is said it is the conclusion
This is how to construe it because there is nothing through this hair and so on
that is a different sign of species in humans
therefore this is to be known
There is no sign of a species that differentiates brahmins from other humans and so on
as there is in other species
There is divergence in bodies but in humans this divergence is not found
Although now differentiation of species is not found as brahmin noble
this diversity is according to birth
it is said this is to be shown in the There is divergence verse
Herein Difference means diversity
Herein this is however the meaning in short
because for animals diversity in the composition of hair and so on happens in the womb
but for brahmins and so on there is no such diversity in their bodies
Even this being so with this designation of brahmin noble
the difference in humans is said to be through designation
is said to be only through the designation
Whoever amongst humans makes his living protecting cattle
Thus far the Fortunate One has censured Bhāradvājas view
now if one can be a brahmin by birth only
one can be a brahmin even though lacking good livelihood virtue and practices
Because the brahmins of old did not desire this brahmin status
other wise humans in the world therefore were supporting Vāseṭṭhas view
and he spoke the eight verses beginning Whoever amongst humans
Herein Protecting cattle means protecting the fields husbandry is what is said
Cattle is a name for the earth
Whoever amongst humans lives by a craft of a certain kind
By a craft of a certain kind means by a craft such as weaving work and so on
Whoever amongst humans makes his livelihood through business
Business means trading
Whoever amongst humans lives by way of service to others
By way of service to others means through being anothers agent
Whoever amongst humans makes his livelihood through thievery
Whoever amongst humans makes his living as an archer
Aa archer means a weaponbearer an arrow or a spear is what is said
Whoever amongst humans makes his livelihood by advising
By advising means by working as a religious advisor
Whoever amongst humans lives off a village or a kingdom
I do not call one a brahmin simply because of being born from the womb of a certain mother
Thus through the brahmin view and through wordly usage
we have concluded that a brahmin lacking a good livelihood virtue and practices has no brahmin status
as that is the case one is not a brahmin by birth but one is a brahmin through good qualities
Therefore the one who is endowed with good qualities in whatever family
he is a brahmin herein this is the right method
thus this is the right method produced from the meaning
now explaining the words
I do not call one a brahmin and so on was said
The meaning of this is
from whichever of the four wombs he is born
the one who has the distinction of being arisen in a mother who is praised as a brahmin
but he is Simply  born from the womb of a certain mother
whoever is wellborn on both sides and so on through the brahmins method
it is said a brahmins womb is reckoned as a pure birth canal
and there is a pure gestation through the excellency of the mother
even so the fact is the birth has been produced in a womb
it is said he is simply born from a certain mother
that Simply  born from a certain mother
I say from simply being born through the womb of a certain mother one is not a brahmin
Why
Because saying bho bho is merely words
he has distinction through his other attachments
That one is just one who says bho if he is attached having impediments
But the one who wherever he is born
having nothing through the state of not having passion and so on
unattached through the giving up of all graspings
Having nothing and unattached that one I say is a brahmin
Why
Because he has removed bad things
Whoever has cut off all the fetters surely does not tremble
Moreover Whoever has cut off all the fetters and so on for twentyseven verses
Herein All the fetters means all the ten kinds of fetters
Does not tremble means he does not tremble through the trembling caused by craving
Surmounting attachments means overcoming attachment to passion and so on
Detached means detached from the four lower births
Whoever has cut off the thong the strap the rope together with the bridle
Thong means enmity
Strap means craving
Rope means a yokesling this is a designation for possession by views
Bridle means a rein it is said the knot that enters over a sling
this is a name for the underlying tendency to views
Thrown off the obstacle herein ignorance is an obstruction
Awakened means awakened to the four noble truths
Whoever being pure forebears with punishment bondage and abuse
Forebears means has patience
Strength of endurance means strength of endurance and perseverance
But once arisen it is known as the strength of might
it arises again and again
Because of the presence of endurance there is strength of might
Whoever is controlled of mind dutiful virtuous taintfree
Dutiful means endowed with the ascetic duties
Virtuous means endowed with good qualities
Taintfree means fully free of the taint of passion and so on
Lustfree is another reading the meaning is free of desire
Welltrained means not being selfindulgent
Like water on the lotus leaf like a mustard seed on a needle
Not smeared means one isnt clinging
By sensual desires means by the defilement of sensual desires and sensual object
Whoever knows right here the destruction of his suffering
Whoever knows right here the destruction of  suffering
herein the fruit of Arahatship the destruction of suffering is what is intended
Knows means he knows through attainment
Putting down the burden means laying down the burden
standing firm after lowering the burden of the accumulated strands of sensual desire and the mass of defilements
The word detached has the meaning already given previously
The deeply wise sagacious one skilled in what is path and not path
Deeply wise means being in a state of wisdom in regard to deep subjects
Sagacious means endowed with wisdom regarding natural wisdom
Whoever doesnt mix with either householders or the houseless
With  either the houseless means doesnt mix with either householders or the houseless
doesnt mix these two kinds of people is the meaning
Wandering homeless home it is said means clinging to the five strands of sense pleasure
having a nonclinging mind is the meaning
Few desires means without desire
Whoever has laid down the stick used against fearful and fearless beings
Against fearful means against those having craving
Against  fearless means against those without craving
Being friendly with the hostile calm amongst those holding weapons
Amongst those holding weapons means amongst those with weapons held high
Calm means calm through the emancipation from defilements
Amongst those attached means amongst those still with attachments
For whoever has thrown aside passion hatred conceit and anger
Whoever speaks a word of truth that is informed and is not coarse
Not coarse means without hatred
It is with hatred like a tree is coarse it is said
Informed means informed with meaning and not slanderous
Truth means actual
Speaks means says
Through which no one will be angry means
through anothers word no one has clinging or sticking
the one who speaks words that are not harsh is the meaning
 Whoever here in the world does not take what is not given be it long or short
Long means goods such as strings of ornaments
Short means goods such as are strewn around
Small means minor
Large means major
Attractive or unattractive means lovely or unlovely
For long goods are valuable or not valuable
For short and so on this is also the method
So far not all are overpowered

Without longings means without craving
For the one who has no desires who through knowledge is without doubt

Immersion in the deathless means internally deathless
Has attained means has reached
Whoever here has overcome clinging to both merit and demerit

Overcome means got past

Undisturbed means being free from the disturbance caused by defilements
Has destroyed joy in existence has destroyed joy has destroyed existence

Crossed over means crossed over the four floods

Whoever would wander homeless here giving up all of his craving
Abandoning the human yoke overcoming the divine yoke

Being unattached to all yokes means being unattached to the yokes of all the defilements
Abandoning delight and aversion cooled off and free from all cleaving

Aversion means dissatisfaction with the cultivation of the wholesome
A hero means one endowed with heroism
Whoever knows in every way the passing and rebirth of beings
Fortunate means having gone to a lovely place or having gone to a lovely practice
For the one whose destiny is unknown to gods gandhabbas and men
Destiny means the result
For whom there is nothing in the past the future or the present
In the past means in the former time
In the future means in the later time
In the present means in the present time
Nothing means doing nothing defiled
A noble leader heroic a great seer victorious
A great seer means because of seeking great qualities he is a great seer
Victorious means triumphant through victory
Whoever knows their former lives and sees heaven and the lower worlds
These designations in the world have been made about name and clan
Thus the Fortunate One having shown that the pollutantfree brahmin is such from good qualities
those who have adhered to the idea that a brahmin is from birth
not knowing this and showing that their view is a wrong view
spoke the two verses these designations
The meaning of this is
that is brahmin noble Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha
Name and clan  have been made made up and prepared
These designations in the world are only expressions is the meaning
Why
Because through common consent they have found approval
This here and there means at the time of birth relatives and kin have made have made it up
If they hadnt made them
no one seeing them would know this is a brahmin or this is Bhāradvāja
Lying latent for a long time this false view of the ignorant
Thus having made this lying latent for a long time this false view of the ignorant
name and clan have been made
this is just his name and clan it is only an designation that has been made up
for ignorant beings this view has been lying latent for a long time in the heart
For those who are ignorant in a latent state say to us about his name and lineage
one is a brahmin by birth
without knowing they say this is what is said
One is not a brahmin by birth nor by birth is one not a brahmin
Thus those who have adhered to the idea a brahmin is from birth
are ignorant that this is only a designation
and that their view is a wrong view having shown this
and now rejecting and making no distinction based on birth
but establishing the view of deeds Not  by birth and so on was said
Its by deeds one is a farmer and by deeds one is a craftsman
Herein By deeds in this half verse the meaning is explained
By deeds one is a farmer and so on is said
Herein By deeds means
at the present time agriculture and so on is brought forth through intentional deeds
by deeds one is a robber by deeds one is a soldier
Thus the wise seeing this deed as it really is
Seeing conditional origination it is through this condition thus
that he is one seeing conditional origination
Skilled in deeds and results
a family is worthy of respect and disrespect because of the production of deeds
through knowing what is despicable and excellent there is a ripening of despicable and excellent deeds
Thus there is skill in deeds and results
By deeds the world goes round by deeds this generation goes round
By deeds  goes round
in this verse the world and this generation and beings have one single meaning
it is only the words that differ
Herein through the first foot this is brahmā mahābrahmā  the highest the creator
it should be known as a warding off of these sorts of views
Through deeds there are various destinies and the world goes round so who is his creator
Through the second foot there is thus rebirth through deeds
the circle of existence goes round by the different kinds of past and present deeds
experiencing happiness and suffering
undergoing the different kinds of what is despicable and excellent and so on is shown
With the third foot this concludes the meaning
Thus in every way beings are bound by deeds
they carry on having been bound by deeds and not otherwise
With the fourth foot the meaning is made clear with a simile
As the chariots roll on bound by their linchpin
and do not go when not bound by it
so for the world there is rebirthing and existing because of the bondage of deeds
and without that bondage there is no rebirthing or existing
Through austerity celibacy restraint and control
Now because the world is bound by deeds in this way
therefore showing the state of excellence through excellent deeds
the Through austerity pair of verses were spoken
Herein Through austerity means through the austere practices
Through celibacy means through abstaining from sexual intercourse
Through restraint means through virtue
Through control means through control of the sense faculties
Through these
means through these best and pure and most excellent deeds one is a brahmin
Why
Because This is the brahmin supreme
because this deed is said to be the supreme brahmin quality
Brahmās is a reading also
However this is the meaning of the words herein
living the best they are Brahmās
bringing about the state of brahmin is what is said
Endowed with the three knowledges peaceful and with rebirth destroyed
In the second verse peaceful means pacifying the defilements
Brahmā and Sakka means Brahmā and Sakka whoever is such
he is not only a brahmin
but he is also Brahmā and Sakka to those who know to the wise ones
know thus Vāseṭṭha is what is said
All the rest is clear
When this was said the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja
said this to the Fortunate One
Excellent dear Gotama Excellent dear Gotama
Just as dear Gotama one might set upright what has been overturned
or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost
or carry an oil lamp into the darkness thinking those with vision will see forms
just so has the Dhamma been explained by the dear Gotama in countless ways
We go to the dear Gotama for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
Please bear it in mind dear Gotama that we are lay followers
who have gone for refuge from today forward for as long as we have the breath of life
Translation
At one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time many monks
after returning from the almsround after the meal
assembling together and sitting in the attendance hall
dwelt engaged in countless kinds of animaltalk
talk about kings talk about thieves talk about ministers
talk about armies talk about dangers talk about wars
talk about food talk about drinks talk about clothes talk about beds
talk about garlands talk about incense talk about relatives talk about vehicles
talk about villages talk about towns talk about cities talk about states
talk about women talk about heros talk about streets talk about wells
talk about the deceased talk about diversity talk about nature talk about oceans
or talk about profit and loss
Then the Fortunate One having risen from seclusion in the evening time
went to the assembly hall
and after going he sat down on the prepared seat
Having sat down the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
What is the talk about monks amongst those who have assembled together and are sitting here at present
and what is the conversation that you left unfinished
Here reverend Sir after returning from the almsround after the meal
assembling together and sitting in the attendance hall
we dwelt engaged in countless kinds of animaltalk such as
talk about kings talk about thieves talk about ministers
talk about armies talk about dangers talk about wars
talk about food talk about drinks talk about clothes talk about beds
talk about garlands talk about incense talk about relatives talk about vehicles
talk about villages talk about towns talk about cities talk about states
talk about women talk about heros talk about streets talk about wells
talk about the deceased talk about diversity talk about nature talk about oceans
or talk about profit and loss
This is certainly not suitable monks for you
sons of good family who through faith have gone forth from the home to homelessness
that you should dwell engaged in countless kinds of animaltalk such as
talk about kings talk about thieves talk about ministers
talk about armies talk about dangers talk about wars
talk about food talk about drinks talk about clothes talk about beds
talk about garlands talk about incense talk about relatives talk about vehicles
talk about villages talk about towns talk about cities talk about states
talk about women talk about heros talk about streets talk about wells
talk about the deceased talk about diversity talk about nature talk about oceans
or talk about profit and loss
There are these ten bases for talk monks
Which ten
Talk about wanting little talk about contentment talk about seclusion talk about disassociation
talk about energy talk about morality talk about concentration talk about wisdom
talk about liberation talk about insight and knowledge of liberation
These monks are the ten bases for talk
If you monks were to speak
concerning these ten bases for talk
even the glory of the Moon and the Sun of such great power of such great majesty
would be overcome by your glory
what to say about the wanderers of other sects
At one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the Fortunate One said this to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika
There are these five uses of wealth householder
Here householder a Noble Disciple with the wealth he has attained through industry and effort
accumulated through the strength of his arms through the sweat of his brow righteously in accordance with the Dhamma
makes himself happy and satisfied and he looks after himself in a correct and pleasant way
he makes his mother and father happy and satisfied and he looks after them in a correct and pleasant way
he makes his children wife workers and servants happy and satisfied and he looks after them in a correct and pleasant way
this is the first use of wealth
Moreover householder a Noble Disciple with the wealth he has attained through industry and effort
accumulated through the strength of his arms through the sweat of his brow righteously in accordance with the Dhamma
makes his friends and comrades happy and satisfied and he looks after them in a correct and pleasant way
this is the second use of wealth
Moreover householder a Noble Disciple with the wealth he has attained through industry and effort
accumulated through the strength of his arms through the sweat of his brow righteously in accordance with the Dhamma
from whatever dangers there are
from fire or from water or from kings or from thieves or from unloved heirs
defends his wealth from such dangers
and he keeps himself safe
this is the third use of wealth
Moreover householder a Noble Disciple with the wealth he has attained through industry and effort
accumulated through the strength of his arms through the sweat of his brow righteously in accordance with the Dhamma
makes five offerings
offerings to relatives offerings to guests offerings to the departed offerings to kings and offerings to the gods
this is the fourth use of wealth
Moreover householder a Noble Disciple with the wealth he has attained through industry and effort
accumulated through the strength of his arms through the sweat of his brow righteously in accordance with the Dhamma
towards whatever ascetics and brāhmaṇas have put aside pride and heedlessness who are established in patience and gentleness
who tame themselves calm themselves and emancipate themselves
he establishes a beneficial donation for those ascetics and brāhmaṇas
which is heavenly itself and has a happy result leading to heaven
this is the fifth use of wealth
These householder are the five uses of wealth
If for a Noble Disciple householder from the usage of these five uses of wealth
his wealth goes to destruction this occurs to him
Whatever good uses for wealth there are I have used them in that way
let my wealth go to destruction
He is not remorseful
If for a Noble Disciple householder from the use of these five uses of wealth
wealth increases this occurs to him
Whatever good uses for wealth there are I have used them in that way
let my wealth increase
Either way he is not remorseful
Wealth enjoyed by servants brothers for removing dangers or by me
Given in beneficial donations also through making the five offerings
Has been established by the virtuous skilful one who lives spiritually
The wise one who lives in a house will wish for wealth and welfare thinking
That prosperity attained by me causes lack of remorse
A man remembering this a person established in Nobility
Is praised right here and now and later rejoices in heaven
Then venerable Māluṅkyaputta approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the venerable Māluṅkyaputta
said this to the Fortunate One
Please reverend Sir may the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma to me in brief
then I having heard the Fortunate Ones Dhamma
may dwell solitary secluded heedful ardent and resolute
Now what shall we say to the young monks Māluṅkyaputta
if you who are an old monk
elderly of great age far gone advanced in years
ask for advice in brief
Although I reverend Sir am old
elderly of great age far gone advanced in years
let the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma to me in brief reverend Sir
let the Happy One preach the Dhamma to me in brief
I will surely understand the meaning of what is spoken by the Fortunate One
I will surely be an heir to what is spoken by the Fortunate One
Then what do you think Māluṅkyaputta
those forms cognizable by the eye which have not been seen
 which formerly have not been seen which you are not seeing and which you do not expect to see 
can there be desire or passion or love relating to them
Surely not reverend Sir
Those sounds cognizable by the ear which have not been heard
 which formerly have not been heard which you are not hearing and which you do not expect to hear 
can there be desire or passion or love relating to them
Surely not reverend Sir
Those smells cognizable by the nose which have not been smelt
 which formerly have not been smelt which you are not smelling and which you do not expect to smell 
can there be desire or passion or love relating to them
Surely not reverend Sir
Those tastes cognizable by the tongue which have not been tasted
 which formerly have not been tasted which you are not tasting and which you do not expect to taste 
can there be desire or passion or love relating to them
Surely not reverend Sir
Those tangibles cognizable by the body which have not been touched
 which formerly have not been touched which you are not touching and which you do not expect to touch 
can there be desire or passion or love relating to them
Surely not reverend Sir
Those thoughts cognizable by the mind which have not been cognized
 which formerly have not been cognized which you are not cognizing and which you do not expect to cognize 
can there be desire or passion or love relating to them
Surely not reverend Sir
Now here for you Māluṅkyaputta
in regard to things that are seen heard sensed or cognized
in what is seen there must be only what is seen
in what is heard there must be only what is heard
in what is sensed there must be only what is sensed
And since for you Māluṅkyaputta
in regard to things that are seen heard sensed or cognized
in what is seen there will be only what is seen
in what is heard there will be only what is heard
in what is sensed there will be only what is sensed
in what is cognized there will be only what is cognized
therefore Māluṅkyaputta you will not be with that
and since Māluṅkyaputta you will not be with that
therefore Māluṅkyaputta you will not be in that
and since Māluṅkyaputta you will not be in that
therefore Māluṅkyaputta you will not be here or hereafter or in between the two
 just this is the end of suffering
Of this reverend Sir that was spoken in brief by the Fortunate One
thus do I understand the meaning in detail
Having seen a form and forgotten mindfulness
Applying the mind to an object held dear
He feels it with an excited mind and persists in indulging it
So for him increase various feelings that originate with form
And by covetousness and by violence is his mind destroyed 
For one heaping up suffering like this nibbāna is said to be far away

Of this reverend Sir that was spoken in brief by the Fortunate One
so do I understand the meaning in detail
Good good Māluṅkyaputta it is good Māluṅkyaputta
of what was spoken in brief by me so do you understand the meaning in detail
Of this Māluṅkyaputta that was spoken in brief by me
so should you understand the meaning in detail
Then venerable Māluṅkyaputta
having rejoiced in and been gladdened by the Fortunate Ones speech
having risen from his seat and worshipped the Fortunate One after circumambulating him departed
Then venerable Māluṅkyaputta
while dwelling solitary secluded heedful ardent and resolute
after no long time attained that good for which young gentlemen
rightly go forth from the house to the houseless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
and dwelt having known experienced and attained it himself in this very life
Destroyed is rebirth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of being in this mundane state  this he knew
And venerable Māluṅkyaputta became another of the Worthy Ones
At one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the female lay follower Veḷukaṇḍakī Nandamātā
The Fortunate One saw with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
the female lay follower Veḷukaṇḍakī Nandamātā
And after seeing it he addressed the monastics
saying This female lay follower Veḷukaṇḍakī Nandamātā monastics
And what monastics is a gift endowed with six factors
Here monastics for the donor there are three factors and for the receivers there are three factors
What are the three factors for the donor
Here monks the donor before giving is happy in mind
Before giving is happy in mind means before giving a gift
for a fortnight or a month before she has a feeling of wellbeing
Herein previously having the intention I will give
from the time that this idea arises I will give a gift with proper effort
by acquiring the field and so on she has this thought
while giving her mind is gladdened and after giving there is delight
While giving her mind is gladdened this is said because she realises her intention at the time of giving
After giving there is delight but this is another thought she receives that comes when remembering her gift
These are the three factors for the donor
What are the three factors for the receivers
Here monastics the receivers are without passion or they are practising to remove passion
Without passion means without passion different form without pollutants
Practising to remove passion means practising the path to remove passion
This points out someone who is excellent but not completely without pollutants
at least a NonReturner a OnceReturner a StreamEnterer
one gone forth on that day a novice who carries a senior monks requisites
there is a gift given endowed with these six factors
Because he is one gone forth with the purpose of attaining Stream Entry
they are without hatred or they are practising to remove hatred
they are without delusion or they are practising to remove delusion
These are the three factors for the receivers
So the donor has three factors and the receivers have three factors
Thus monastics there is a gift endowed with six factors
Thus monastics for a gift endowed with these six factors
it is not easy to take a measure of the merit
saying So much is the accumulation of merit is the accumulation of wholesomeness
is the means of happiness leading to heaven having  a happy result conducive to heaven
which leads to what is wanted lovely attractive  beneficial and pleasant
Rather it is immeasurable unbounded
and is reckoned as a great mass of merit
Just as with the great ocean monastics
it is not easy to take a measure of the water
saying There are so many litres of water or so many hundreds of litres of water
or so many thousands of litres of water or so many hundreds of thousands of litres of water
Rather it is immeasurable unbounded
and is reckoned as a great mass of water
Just so monastics for a gift endowed with these six factors
it is not easy to take a measure of the merit
saying So much is the accumulation of merit is the accumulation of wholesomeness
is the means of happiness leading to heaven having  a happy result conducive to heaven
which leads to what is wanted lovely attractive beneficial and pleasant
Rather it is immeasurable unbounded
and is reckoned as a great mass of merit
Before giving she is happy in mind while giving her mind is gladdened
and after giving she is uplifted this is the success of her sacrifice
Without passion without hate without delusion without pollutants
the field for the sacrifice is successful being restrained in the spiritual life
Restrained restrained with the restraint of virtuous conduct etc
After rinsing oneself and giving with ones own hands
After rinsing oneself means after washing ones own hands after cleaning ones face
With ones own hands with her own hands
Sayehi ones own is another reading
for oneself and for the other the sacrifice is of great fruit
The intelligent one having made such a sacrifice faithful with her mind released
Faithful having faith in the virtues of the Three Treasures
With her mind released means with a mind freed from greed selfishness and so on
that wise one arises in a happy world free of suffering
May I be free from hatred may I be free from oppression may I be free from trouble
May I take care of myself and be happy
And like myself may my teacher preceptor mother father
Those who are benefactors those who are neutral and those who are enemies
Be free from hatred free from oppression free from trouble
In this living place in this alms village in this town
in this Island of ri Laṅkā in this RoseApple Island ie India in this Universe
May the leaders of the people the gods within these boundaries and all beings
Be free from hatred free from oppression free from trouble
In in the Eastern direction in the Southern direction in the Western direction in the Northern direction
In the SouthEastern direction in the SouthWest direction
in the NorthWest direction in the NorthEast direction
In the lower direction in the upper direction
May all creatures all breathing creatures all beings
All persons all individuals
May all women all men
All those who are Noble all those who are not yet Noble
All gods all human beings all who have fallen into the lower worlds
Be free from hatred free from oppression free from trouble
being ones who own their actions may they not lose whatever prosperity they have gained
Who found the deathless peace of the Deathless who found the Matchless nibbāna and gives the Matchless to others
Who found the Refuge and is the refuge for the world the one without passions who makes the passions fade
The one without fear who leads to that fearless place I will revere Lord Buddha the Leader
Having body and limbs lovely to the eyes
Endowed with a noble and sweet voice
The receptacle of many measureless virtues

He who is Buddha the bearer of steadfast knowledge

Superior like the sky firm like Mount Meru
Cool like the lotus endowed with morality
who endures like the Earth I bow down to the Victor
He who is the wise Buddha like the sun shining in the day
 Resplendent producing delight while sitting on his stone throne
Taught the Abhidhamma which gives the happiness of safety
to the gods I always revere Him who is Matchless
He who has tender skin on his lotus feet
Who is unconfused not lacking in knowledge about the three worlds
Who has attained the incomparable
Who is unequalled and honoured by the whole world I revere Him the Lord
The Buddha with steady mind who brought together men and gods
Who with the lustre of the light of wisdom destroyed the darkness of ignorance
He who greatly desires the welfare and benefit of men and gods Him
I worship the great compassionate Buddha with infinite knowledge
The deposit of all virtues the Lord of Sages who after approaching
The Wood called Isipatana the abode of those restrained
And rolling the DhammaWheel which cut off unwholesomeness in that place
I revere Him of incomparable beauty who should be worshipped
Surrounded by the pure brilliant with beautiful radiance
The abode of many glories endowed with guarded
And beautiful marks beginning with the disk of the sun and the moon
I revere with respect the Happy One worshipped by gods and men
 With the raft of the Path he crossed over the waves and currents of delusion anger and desire
 The ocean of existences the fearless one fully crossed over and he established humanitys
Shelter safety and unequalled refuge the one true haven
I revere the King of the Dhamma that field of merit who gives the ultimate bliss
The Lord of Sages sitting at the root of the Kaṇḍamba tree seeking the benefit of others
 Quickly wrought a wonder by scattering water and fire that was pleasing to the eyes
Destroying the false net of views this miracle was not left undone by the Sage
I worship Him the praised origin of supreme delight endowed with psychic power
That clever Sage who is the rising dawn of compassion having extensive knowledge
Who leads over the watery ocean what are called lotuses with the noble rays of his Dhamma
And Awakens the pure of heart in the pit of the three worlds widelyrenowned
The one wisdom eye of the three worlds who endured suffering
 That Victor who in countless lives gave both his children and wife his limbs and life
Without a clinging mind for love of Awakening to he who desired it
And after the perfection of generosity fulfilled the others like the perfection of virtue and so on
And reached the Highest through their inherent power I revere Him the one true Island
The Great God above all gods bearing his last body having broken the five killers unbroken himself
Who spread the light of wisdom on people and attained Awakening on the noble victory seat
Surrounded by brahmas and others speaking with a noble voice
Greatly delighting the worlds I always greatly revere Him the Lord of Sages the Lord of the five Sages
The Buddha having a form like the banyan tree soft hands and feet a voice like brahma calves like an antelope
And a foreskin that covers the organ the Happy One with steady feet
Soft hair between the brows the Happy One straightlimbed like a brahma
Having blue eyes long heels exquisite skin whose taste buds are the very best
Having forty of the best teeth even teeth a full back between the shoulders
Wheelmarked feet unflawed teeth He who defeated the killers having high ankles
Who while standing without bending with both his soft hands can touch his knees
Whose body is round the Victor having eyelashes like an ox the upper half of whose body is like a lion
Having seven fat areas long fingers the Happy One with one hair to a vesicle
Full white teeth smooth golden skin with black hair on the top of his head
The Sambuddha having a broad tongue then a lionlike jaw webbed feet and hands
Whose head has a crown the Lord endowed with these thirtytwo qualities I revere Him the Great Sage
 The sound Buddha Buddha is extremely rare in the world what to say of Buddhahood
Therefore the wise and good wishing for various sorts of benefit and happiness
 Desiring their true welfare should always revere Him who is fearless worthy honoured by gods and men
The incomparable One of Ten Powers who increases the happiness of the world
May I through this merit
Clever with wise and upright view not lacking in energy wealthy generous

The Simile of the Vipers
The Simile of the Tortoise
Once upon a time mendicants a tortoise was grazing along the bank of a river in the afternoon
At the same time a jackal was also hunting along the river bank
The tortoise saw the jackal off in the distance hunting
so it drew its limbs and neck inside its shell and kept passive and silent
But the jackal also saw the tortoise off in the distance grazing
So it went up to the tortoise and waiting nearby thinking
When that tortoise sticks one or other of its limbs or neck out from its shell Ill grab it right there rip it out and eat it
But when that tortoise didnt stick one or other of its limbs or neck out from its shell the jackal left disappointed since it couldnt find a vulnerability
In the same way Māra the Wicked is always waiting nearby thinking
Hopefully I can find a vulnerability in the eye
ear nose tongue body or
Thats why you should live with sense doors guarded
When you see a sight with your eyes dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraint
When you hear a sound with your ears 
When you smell an odor with your nose 
When you taste a flavor with your tongue 
When you feel a touch with your body 
When you know a thought with your mind dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraint
When you live with your sense doors restrained Māra will leave you disappointed since he cant find a vulnerability
just like the jackal left the tortoise
A mendicant should collect their thoughts
as a tortoise draws its limbs into its shell
Independent not disturbing others
someone whos extinguished wouldnt blame anyone

Sāriputta and the Pupil
At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to him
Reverend Sāriputta a mendicant pupil of mine has resigned the training and returned to a lesser life
Thats how it is reverend when someone doesnt guard the sense doors eats too much and is not committed to wakefulness
Its not possible for such a mendicant to maintain the full and pure spiritual life for the rest of their life
But it is possible for a mendicant to maintain the full and pure spiritual life for the rest of their life if they guard the sense doors eat in moderation and are committed to wakefulness
And how does someone guard the sense doors
When a mendicant sees a sight with the eyes they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraint
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue 
When they feel a touch with their body 
When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraint
Thats how someone guards the sense doors
And how does someone eat in moderation
Its when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat
Not for fun indulgence adornment or decoration but only to sustain this body to avoid harm and to support spiritual practice
In this way I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and I will live blamelessly and at ease
Thats how someone eats in moderation
And how is someone committed to wakefulness
Its when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day purifying their mind from obstacles
In the evening they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation
In the middle of the night they lie down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware and focused on the time of getting up
In the last part of the night they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation purifying their mind from obstacles
Thats how someone is committed to wakefulness
So you should train like this
We will guard the sense doors eat in moderation and be committed to wakefulness

Entailing Suffering
Mendicants when a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of all things that entail suffering
then theyve seen sensual pleasures in such a way that they have no underlying tendency for desire affection infatuation and passion for sensual pleasures
And theyve awakened to a way of conduct and a way of living such that when they live in that way bad unskillful qualities of desire and grief dont overwhelm them
And how does a mendicant truly understand the origin and ending of all things that entail suffering
Such is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of form
Such is feeling 
perception 
consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousness
Thats how a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of all things that entail suffering
And how has a mendicant seen sensual pleasures in such a way that they have no underlying tendency for desire affection infatuation and passion for sensual pleasures
Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a mans height filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from pain
Then two strong men grab would grab each arm and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals
Theyd writhe and struggle to and fro
Why is that
For that person knows If I fall in that pit of glowing coals that will result in my death or deadly pain
In the same way when a mendicant has seen sensual pleasures as like a pit of glowing coals they have no underlying tendency for desire affection infatuation and passion for sensual pleasures
And how has a mendicant awakened to a way of conduct and a way of living such that when they live in that way bad unskillful qualities of desire and grief dont overwhelm them
Suppose a person was to enter a thicket full of thorns
Theyd have thorns in front and behind to the left and right below and above
So theyd go forward mindfully and come back mindfully thinking May I not get any thorns
In the same way whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant is called a thorn in the training of the Noble One
When they understand what a thorn is they should understand restraint and lack of restraint
And how is someone unrestrained
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye If its pleasant they hold on to it but if its unpleasant they dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted
And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
They hear a sound  smell an odor  taste a flavor  feel a touch 
know a thought with the mind If its pleasant they hold on to it but if its unpleasant they dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart
And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
This is how someone is unrestrained
And how is someone restrained
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye If its pleasant they dont hold on to it and if its unpleasant they dont dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
They hear a sound  smell an odor  taste a flavor  feel a touch 
know a thought with the mind If its pleasant they dont hold on to it and if its unpleasant they dont dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
This is how someone is restrained
Though that mendicant conducts themselves and lives in this way every so often they might lose mindfulness and bad unskillful memories and thoughts prone to fetters arise
If this happens their mindfulness is slow to come up but they quickly give them up get rid of eliminate and obliterate those thoughts
Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day and a person let two or three drops of water fall onto it
The drops would be slow to fall but theyd quickly dry up and evaporate
In the same way though that mendicant conducts themselves and lives in this way every so often they might lose mindfulness and bad unskillful memories and thoughts prone to fetters arise
If this happens their mindfulness is slow to come up but they quickly give them up get rid of eliminate and obliterate those thoughts
This is how a mendicant has awakened to a way of conduct and a way of living such that when they live in that way bad unskillful qualities of desire and grief dont overwhelm them
While that mendicant conducts themselves in this way and lives in this way it may be that rulers or their ministers friends or colleagues relatives or family would invite them to accept wealth saying
Please mister why let these ocher robes torment you
Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl
Come return to a lesser life enjoy wealth and make merit
But its simply impossible for a mendicant who conducts themselves in this way and lives in this way to resign the training and return to a lesser life
Suppose that although the Ganges river slants slopes and inclines to the east a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket saying
Well make this Ganges river slant slope and incline to the west

Would they still succeed
Why is that
The Ganges river slants slopes and inclines to the east
Its not easy to make it slant slope and incline to the west
That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated

Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl
Come return to a lesser life enjoy wealth and make merit
But its simply impossible for a mendicant who conducts themselves in this way and lives in this way to resign the training and return to a lesser life

Because for a long time that mendicants mind has slanted sloped and inclined to seclusion So its impossible for them to return to a lesser life

With Lohicca
At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis in a wilderness hut near Makkarakaṭa
Then several youths students of the brahmin Lohicca approached Mahākaccānas wilderness hut while collecting firewood They walked and wandered all around the hut making a dreadful racket and all kinds of jeers
These shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman the Lord Theyre honored respected esteemed revered and venerated by those who pretend to inherit Vedic culture
And then Mahākaccāna left his dwelling and said to those brahmin students
Students stop being so noisy
I will speak to you on the teaching
When this was said the students fell silent
Then Mahākaccāna recited these verses for them
The brahmins of old excelled in ethics
and remembered the ancient traditions
Their sense doors were guarded well protected
and they had mastered anger
Those brahmins who remembered the ancient traditions
enjoyed virtue and absorption
But these have lost their way Claiming to recite
they live out of balance judging everyone by their clan
Mastered by anger they take up many arms
attacking both the strong and the weak
All is vain for someone who doesnt guard the sense doors
like the wealth a person finds in a dream
Fasting sleeping on bare ground
bathing at dawn the three Vedas
rough hides dreadlocks and dirt
hymns precepts and observances and selfmortification
those fake bent staffs
and rinsing with water
These emblems of the brahmins
are only used to generate profits
A mind thats serene
clear and undisturbed
kind to all creatures
thats the path to attainment of Brahmā
Then those students offended and upset went to the brahmin Lohicca and said to him
Please master you should know this The ascetic Mahākaccāna condemns and rejects outright the hymns of the brahmins
When they said this Lohicca was offended and upset
Then he thought
But it wouldnt be appropriate for me to abuse or insult the ascetic Mahākaccāna solely because of what Ive heard from these students
Why dont I go and ask him about it
Then the brahmin Lohicca together with those students went to Venerable Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to him
Master Kaccāna did several young students of mine come by here collecting firewood
They did brahmin
But did you have some discussion with them
But what kind of discussion did you have with them
This is the discussion I had with these students
Mahākaccāna repeats the verses
Master Kaccāna spoke of someone who doesnt guard the sense doors
How do you define someone who doesnt guard the sense doors
Brahmin take someone who sees a sight with their eyes If its pleasant they hold on to it but if its unpleasant they dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted
And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over

And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over

How do you define someone who does guard the sense doors

Excellent Master Kaccāna Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Kaccāna has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Please come to my family just as you go to the families of the lay followers in Makkarakaṭa
The brahmin boys and girls there will bow to you rise in your presence and give you a seat and water That will be for their lasting welfare and happiness

Second Giving Up Ignorance
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha  and asked him
Sir is there one thing such that by giving it up a mendicant gives up ignorance and gives rise to knowledge
There is mendicant
But what is that one thing
Ignorance is one thing such that by giving it up a mendicant gives up ignorance and gives rise to knowledge
But how does a mendicant know and see so as to give up ignorance and give rise to knowledge
Its when a mendicant has heard
Nothing is worth insisting on
When a mendicant has heard that

Suppose the crops have ripened
but the caretaker is negligent If an ox fond of crops invades the crops theyd indulge themselves as much as they like
In the same way when an uneducated ordinary person doesnt exercise restraint when it comes to the six fields of contact they indulge themselves in the five kinds of sensual stimulation as much as they like
Suppose the crops have ripened and the caretaker is diligent If an ox fond of crops invades the crops
the caretaker would grab them firmly by the muzzle
Then theyd grab them above the hump and hold them fast there
Then theyd give them a good thrashing
before driving them away
For a second time
and even a third time the same thing might happen
As a result no matter how long they stand or sit in a village or wilderness that ox fond of crops would never invade that crop again
remembering the beating they got earlier
In the same way when a mendicants mind is subdued well subdued when it comes to the six fields of contact becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi

So theyd fetch it
This sir is that arched harp
Ive had enough of that arched harp Just fetch me the sound
Theyd say
Sir this arched harp is made of many components assembled together
which make a sound when theyre played That is
it depends on the body the skin the neck the head the strings the plectrum and a person to play it properly Thats how an arched harp is made of many components assembled together
which make a sound when theyre played
But hed split that harp into ten pieces or a hundred pieces then splinter it up
Hed burn the splinters with fire and reduce them to ashes
Then hed sweep away the ashes in a strong wind or float them away down a swift stream
Then hed say
It seems that theres nothing to this thing called an arched harp or whatevers called an arched harp But people waste their time with it negligent and heedless

Is the ear  nose  tongue  body

The yoke there is the single harness or yoke that theyre yoked by

The ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind is not the fetter of thoughts nor are thoughts the fetter of the mind
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them
If the eye were the fetter of sights or if sights were the fetter of the eye this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering would not be found
However since this is not the case but
the fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering is found

There are sounds  smells  tastes  touches 
thoughts known by the mind that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
If a mendicant approves welcomes and keeps clinging to them
their consciousness relies on that and grasps it
A mendicant with grasping does not become extinguished
Thats the cause thats the reason why some sentient beings arent fully extinguished in the present life
There are sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
If a mendicant doesnt approve welcome and keep clinging to them
their consciousness doesnt rely on that and grasp it
A mendicant free of grasping becomes extinguished
There are sounds  smells  tastes  touches 
thoughts known by the mind that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
If a mendicant doesnt approve welcome and keep clinging to them
their consciousness doesnt rely on that and grasp it
A mendicant free of grasping becomes extinguished

Second Not Yours
Mendicants give up whats not yours
Giving it up will be for your welfare and happiness
And what isnt yours
Sights arent yours give them up
Giving them up will be for your welfare and happiness
thoughts arent yours give them up
Giving it up will be for your welfare and happiness
Suppose a person was to carry off the grass sticks branches and leaves in this Jetas Grove 
In the same way sights arent yours give them up
Giving them up will be for your welfare and happiness
