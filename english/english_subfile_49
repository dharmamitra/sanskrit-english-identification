The country of Mathurā is more than ve thousand li in circuit and the capital city is over twenty li in circuit The land is fertile and agriculture is the main occupation Mango trees are grown by the

rows the smoke of incense pervades the air like clouds and owers are scattered in such abundance that they obscure the sun and moon and cause great tumult in the valleys The king and his ministers perform good deeds as their bound duty Going east for ve or six li from the city I came to a hill monastery of which the chambers are carved on the precipice of a mountain with an entrance facing the valley It was built by Venerable Upagupta known as Jinhu Near Protection in Chinese In the monastery is a stupa preserving the ngernails of the Tathāgata On the steep rock to the north of the monastery there is a cave more than twenty feet in height and over thirty feet in breadth Fine chips four inches long are accumulated in the cave When Venerable Upagupta was preaching the Dharma to convert the people every married couple that attained arhatship put down a counter here but single members of a family were not counted even though they had become arhats Going twentyfour or ve li to the southeast from the cave I came to a large driedup pond with a stupa beside it Formerly when the Tathāgata was once going across this place a monkey offered him some honey The Buddha had it mixed with water and distributed the beverage to the assembly of monks The monkey was so delighted that it gamboled with joy fell into a pit and died By the merits of this offering it was reborn as a human being Not far away to the north of the pond there is a large wood in which are traces left by the four past buddhas when they walked up and down Beside it are the places where the one thousand two hundred and fty great arhats āriputra Maudgalyāyana and so on practiced meditation and stupas have been built to mark the traces When the Tathāgata was living in the world he frequently visited this country and trees have been planted at the places where he preached the Dharma From here going to the northeast for more than ve hundred li I reached the country of Sthāneśvara  The country of Sthāneśvara is more than seven thousand li in circuit the capital city is over twenty li in circuit The land is fertile and crops grow in abundance The climate is hot and the people are unkind and ignoble by custom The householders are wealthy and vie with each other in showing extravagance The people are learned in art of magic and they highly esteem unusual capabilities Most of them engage in trade in pursuit of prot while a few are farmers Exceptional goods of various places are collected in this country There are three monasteries with over seven hundred monks all of whom study the teachings of the Hinayana schools Deva temples amount to over one hundred and have numerous heretics Around the great city within a radius of two hundred li the district is called by the people of the country the Land of Blessedness I heard some old people say that the ve parts of India were formerly ruled separately by two kings Their territories were adjacent to each other and the two kings carried out mutual invasions in endless wars Then they agreed to ght a nal battle to see who would be the master so as to establish peace for their subjects But all the common people bore a grudge against war and would not obey the kings orders  Thinking that it was difcult to discuss the matter with his subjects the king considered that the gods might be able to arouse his people and their power might help him achieve his exploits There was then a brahman who was known for his high talents secretly sent him a roll of silk and invited him to the back chambers of the palace to compose a Dharma book which was then hidden in a rock cave After a long lapse of many years the cave was covered over by the trees growing at the place One day at an audience in the morning the king said to his ministers As a man of no virtue I have unworthily occupied the throne The Lord of Heaven has favored me with a dream in which he granted me a spiritual book which is now hidden under a certain peak on a certain mountain Then he gave orders to search for the book and to the delight of the ministers as well as the pleasure of the common people the book was found in a forest on a mountain The contents of the book were made known to all people far and near It reads briey as follows The life and death is endless and rotates incessantly without limit Those who are submerged in the sea of rebirth cannot save themselves I have a wonderful device to release you from all kinds of suffering The region two hundred li wide around the royal city is the Land of Blessedness handed down by former kings from generation to generation but in the long lapse of time the inscriptions have been obliterated What would people say if we failed to rescue those who are being drowned You people will be reborn among humans if you die ghting your enemies and if you slaughter many innocent people you will enjoy happiness in heaven Obedient grandsons and lial sons serving their parents in touring this region will gain innite blessedness Why should you lose the chance to obtain much blessedness by performing a small meritorious deed Once the human body is lost you will suffer in the darkness of the three evil states of rebirth Therefore every one of you should cultivate good karma Thereafter all the people practiced the military arts and looked upon death as going home The king then ordered that brave and highspirited warriors be enlisted and in the war that took place between the two counties the numerous corpses of those killed on the battleeld piled up high so that even now skeletons are scattered about in the wilderness This region is known as the Land of Blessedness by tradition of the country Four or ve li to the northwest of the city is a stupa more than two hundred feet high built by King Aśoka The bricks are all yellowishred in color very lustrous and clean It contains one sheng of the Tathāgatas relic bones which often emit a light with many divine manifestations Going south for over one hundred li from the city I came to Govinda Monastery which consists of storied pavilions with the ridges of the roofs connected together and terraces of many tiers standing one higher than another The monks lead a pure and strict life and comport themselves in a calm and rened manner From here going northeast for more than four hundred li I reached the country of rughna  The country of rughna is more than six thousand li in circuit bordering the Ganges River on the east with big mountains lying at its back in the north and the Yamunā River owing through the middle of its territory The capital city is over twenty li in circuit and borders the Yamunā River on the east Although the city is in a desolate condition the foundations are still strong The native products and customs and habits are the same as in the country of Sthāneśvara The people are honest by nature and believe in heretical theories They esteem the learning of arts and crafts and advocate the cultivation of blessedness and wisdom There are ve monasteries with over one thousand monks most of whom study Hinayana teachings but a few learn the tenets of other schools They discuss the subtle teachings and deliberate on the abstruse doctrines Talented scholars of different places come to hold discussions with them in order to resolve their doubts There are one hundred deva temples with numerous heretics To the southeast of the great city outside the eastern gate of a big monastery at the west of the Yamunā River there is a stupa built by King Aśoka at a place where the Tathāgata once preached the Dharma to convert the people in olden times Beside it another stupa contains hair and ngernail relics of the Tathāgata Hair and ngernail relics of āriputra Maudgalyāyana and other arhats are preserved in several tens of stupas built around here After the nirvana of the Tathāgata the country was led astray by heretics and the people abandoned the right views The ve monasteries now in existence were built by foreign śāstra masters who had defeated the heretics and brahmans in debates at the sites where the monasteries were subsequently built Going east from the Yamunā River for over eight hundred li I came to the Ganges River the source of which is three or four li wide owing southeast to the sea it is over ten li at its mouth The water is dark blue in color with great waves rising in it Although there are many strange monsters in the river they do not harm people The water is sweet and ne grains of sand come down with the current According to local popular records this river is known as the Water of Blessedness and ones accumulated sins can be expiated by taking a bath in it Those who drown themselves in the river will be reborn in heaven to enjoy happiness and a recently deceased person whose corpse is thrown into the river will not fall into the evil states of existence in his next rebirth By raising waves and blockading the current the souls of the dead will be saved Deva Bodhisattva of the country of Siṃhala was a man learned in the theory of reality he understood the nature of all dharmas Having pity for ignorant people he came here to enlighten them At the time when all the people men and women old and young assembled at the banks of the river raised waves and blockaded the current Deva Bodhisattva mingled with them to draw up the water and lowered his head to push the current in the reverse direction counter to the efforts of the other people A heretic said to him Why are you doing it in a strange way Deva Bodhisattva said My parents and other kinsfolk are in the country of Siṃhala and I fear that they may be suffering from hunger and thirst You did not consider the matter well and behaved erroneously Your home country is far away separated by big mountains and rivers To agitate the water here with the hope of saving those who are hungry there is like someone who goes backward in order to advance This is unthinkable  Deva Bodhisattva said If sinners in the nether world can be beneted by this water why could it not also save the people separated by mountains and rivers The heretics then realized their fault and acknowledged defeat They renounced their erroneous views accepted the right Dharma corrected their mistakes and made a fresh start by wishing to listen to the instructions  Crossing the river to the east bank I reached the country of Matipura in the domain of Central India The country of Matipura is more than six thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over twenty li in circuit It yields rice and wheat and has plenty of owers and fruit The climate is temperate and the people are honest by custom They esteem the learning of arts and crafts and are learned in the art of sorcery Half of the population believes in heterodox religions and the other half in the right teachings  The king is a śūdra by caste who does not believe in the buddhadharma but worships the devas There are over ten monasteries with more than eight hundred monks most of whom study the teachings of the Sarvāstivāda school of Hinayana Buddhism There are over fty deva temples where heretics live together Four or ve li to the south of the great city is a small monastery with over fty monks Formerly the śāstra master Guṇaprabha known as Deguang Virtue Light in Chinese composed at this place the Tattvasatyaśāstra and other treatises totaling over one hundred books The śāstra master was eminently smart when he was young and when he had grown up he became an intelligent vastly learned and versatile scholar possessing a good memory and erudite learning At rst Guṇaprabha studied Mahayana teachings but before he could thoroughly understand these profound teachings he came upon the Vibhāṣāśāstra and he changed his course of study and devoted himself to learning Hinayana theories He wrote several tens of treatises to refute the principles of the Mahayana teachings and to promote Hinayana theories He also wrote several tens of secular books to denounce the classical works written by his predecessors He pondered the Buddhist scriptures and found more than ten dubious points that he could not solve and despite his studies for a long time his doubts were not resolved There was then the arhat Devasena known as Tianjun Heavenly Army in Chinese who used to frequent Tuṣita Heaven where Maitreya Bodhisattva resided Guṇaprabha wished to see Maitreya to seek instructions for the solution of his doubts and Devasena brought him to the heavenly palace by his supernatural powers Upon seeing Maitreya would not salute him in the proper way Devasena said to him Maitreya Bodhisattva is next only to the Buddha in position Why are you so conceited as to not worship him Since you desire to study under his guidance how can you be so unruly toward him Guṇaprabha said in reply What you Venerable Sir have said is truly a good admonition but I am a fully ordained bhikṣu a homeless disciple while Maitreya Bodhisattva is enjoying the bliss of heaven and is not a renunciant monk I am afraid that it is unbetting of me to worship him The bodhisattva knowing that conceited mind was so stubborn that he was not a competent person to hear the Dharma would not resolve his doubts even though Guṇaprabha came up to heaven three times Having not satised his wish Guṇaprabha retired to a forest holding a grudge to practice meditation for the development of supernatural powers but as he did not eliminate his conceit he could not attain sainthood Three or four li to the north of Guṇaprabhas monastery there is a big monastery with more than two hundred monks all of whom study Hinayana teachings This is the place where the śāstra master Saṃghabhadra passed away A native of the country of Kaśmīra the śāstra master was an intelligent and learned man who enjoyed a good reputation from the time of his youth and made a profound study of the Vibhāṣāśāstra of the Sarvāstivāda school There was then Vasubandhu Bodhisattva whose mind was xed on the abstruse Way seeking implications beyond words In order to refute the Vibhā ṣā masters he composed the Abhidharmakośaśāstra a work written in ne and dexterous language that explains the meanings in a pure and sublime manner When Saṃghabhadra read this work he made up his mind to probe into its contents After making a profound study of the work for twelve years he composed the Kośakarakāśāstra in twentyve thousand stanzas and eight hundred thousand words This book consists of words of farreaching import seeking the depths of abstruse and subtle theories He said to his disciples With my outstanding competence and correct reasoning go and refute Vasubandhu to frustrate his sharpness and break the old mans monopoly on eminent fame Three or four of his prominent disciples took Saṃgha bhadras treatise and went to visit Vasubandhu At that time Vasubandhu was in ākula City in the country of akka When the news arrived that Saṃghabhadra was coming Vasubandhu packed up his things His bewildered disciples came forward to remonstrate with him saying Great Master your virtue surpasses that of former sages and your unique fame spreads far in the present world Why are you so alarmed at the news of Saṃghabhadras arrival Even if he is coming to humiliate us we will boldly face him Vasubandhu said It is not because I wish to avoid this man that I am going far away Looking around this country I nd no one skillful and competent enough to decide the case Saṃghabhadra is a young man eloquent in debate while I am advanced in years and could not hold a discussion with him I wish to defeat his heterodox views with one word and I intend to lure him to Central India to meet venerable and learned scholars who can discern truth from falsehood and nd out right and wrong He then asked his companion to carry his bookcase for him and soon started on the long journey The śāstra master Saṃghabhadra arrived at the monastery one day after and suddenly found himself short of breath So he wrote a letter of apology to Vasubandhu in which he said After the nirvana of the Tathāgata his disciples split into different sects and schools each propagating his own theories in specic ways They defended those who belonged to their own sects and despised those who were afliated with other groups Being an ignorant man of shallow learning I had the opportunity to pursue knowledge under my teachers and read the Abhidharmakośaśāstra composed by you for the refutation of the principles of the Vibhāṣā masters I overrated my abilities and worked for many years on a treatise with the intention of making it a support for the correct theories My scheme was great but my wisdom too small and the time of my death is approaching You are a bodhisattva who expounds the subtle sayings and propagates the supreme truth I would be happy if you would not deny what opinions I hold so that my treatise might be preserved Then I can die without regret He selected some of his disciples who were eloquent in debate and said to them I am really a man of the younger generation and despised the sages of older times You should take this letter together with my treatise to apologize to that bodhisattva and show repentance on my behalf As soon as he nished these words he passed away His disciples took the letter and went to Vasubandhu and said to him Our teacher Saṃghabhadra has passed away He left word for us to send this letter to express his selfreproach and apologize to you for his mistakes hoping that you would not bring down his reputation though this may be beyond our expectation Vasubandhu Bodhisattva read the letter and looked over the treatise for a long while before he spoke to the disciples saying The śāstra master Saṃgha bhadra was a young scholar of intelligence If I wish to confute this treatise it would be as easy as pointing at my palm Considering the he request made on his deathbed and having noticed the words he spoke after realizing the difculties in his attempt I shall comply out of the principle of righteousness with his longcherished ambition moreover the views of my school are also expounded in his treatise Then he changed the title of the treatise to the Nyāyānusāraśāstra disciples remonstrated with him saying Before Saṃgha badras death you a great teacher went far away from him and now after having obtained his treatise you changed its title How will any of your disciples be able to bear the shame In order to clear up their doubt Vasubandhu Bodhisattva uttered the following stanza When a king of lions Runs away from a pig The wise should know Which is the winner in strength After Saṃghabhadras death his body was cremated and his ashes were preserved in a stupa which is still in existence built in a mango grove over two hundred paces to the northwest of the monastery Beside the mango grove there is a stupa containing the remains of śāstra master Vimalamitra  This śāstra master was a native of the country of Kaśmīra and became a monk of the Sarvāstivāda school He was widely learned in various scriptures and studied the treatises of diverse sects and he traveled throughout the ve parts of India to learn the abstruse texts of the Tripiṭaka After he had gained fame and completed his studies he started on his homeward journey and on the way he came across the stupa of Saṃghabhadra He patted the stupa and said with a sigh You śāstra master were a man of magnanimity and eminence and extolled the great teachings Why did you live such a short life and die at the time when you were just about to defeat the heterodox schools and establish your own sect I Vimalamitra am a man of shallow learning and although we have lived in different times I admire your righteousness and have always remembered your virtue for many years I shall exhaust my knowledge to write treatises for all the scholars in Jambudvīpa to efface the fame of the Mahayana teachings and the name of Vasubandhu This will be an unending task but I shall do my best to fulll it After having said these words suddenly became delirious and ve tongues stuck out of his mouth which oozed hot blood Knowing that he would surely die he wrote a letter of repentance saying The Mahayana doctrines are the ultimate truth of the buddhadharma which is beyond the scope of both conception and substance and has deep and abstruse principles I have been so imprudent as to denounce an advanced teacher in my ignorance Karmic retribution is apparent and it is just and right that I should lose my life Be careful in making your aspirations and do not cherish doubt At the moment of Vimalamitras death the earth quaked and a pit formed at the place where he died His traveling companions cremated his corpse and collected the ashes over which a memorial was built At that time an arhat witnessed the event and said with a sigh What a pity how sorrowful it is This śāstra master waywardly grasped his own views and vilied the Mahayana doctrines and he fell into the hell of incessant suffering In the northwest of this country of  on the east bank of the Ganges is the city of Mayūra which is more than twenty li in circuit and has a dense population there are many watercourses that interow with one another Not far away from the city on the bank of the

their houses beside the monastery Inside the great wall of the monastery there are three stairways made of precious substances standing in a row from south to north and sloping down to the east This was the place where the Tathāgata descended from Trayastriṃśa Heaven and returned to earth Formerly the Tathāgata set out from Jetavana Garden and ascended to Devapura  he stayed in the Hall of the Good Dharma where he preached the Dharma for his mother At the end of three months he wished to descend so Indra employed his divine power to construct the stairways The middle ight of stairs was made of gold the left one of crystal and the right one of silver The Tathāgata started from the Hall of the Good Dharma and accompanied by a multitude of heavenly beings he walked down the middle ight of stairs Brahmā holding a white ywhisk walked down the silver stairs attending the Buddha at his right while Indra carrying a precious canopy walked down the crystal stairs attending the Buddha at his

sunk down The kings of various countries regretting that they had not seen the holy structures piled up bricks and stones on the old base ornamented with gems and jewels to the height of seventy feet

appeared in the form of a universal monarch  When the Tathāgata returned from Devapura to Jambudvīpa Subhūti known as Shanxian Good Manifestation in Chinese formerly transcribed as Xufuti or Xuputi and translated as Good Auspices all erroneously was sitting in meditation in a cave He reected Now the Buddha attended by human and heavenly beings is returning to earth Being such as I am what should I do I have heard the Buddha say that knowing the emptiness of all things and understanding the nature of all things are to see the Buddhas spiritual body with the eye of wisdom At that time the bhikṣuṇī Utpalavarṇā wishing to be the rst to see the Buddha appeared in the form of a universal monarch accompanied by attendants holding the seven kinds of precious objects and guarded by the four divisions of troops The Tathāgata told her You are not the rst person to see me Subhūti who has insight into the emptiness of all things has already seen my spiritual body Within the enclosure of the holy traces divine manifestations occurred in succession To the southeast of the great stupa there is a pond in which a dragon always protected the holy traces and under its divine protection they were not easily violated The stup and pond became dilapidated through erosion over time but no human effort could destroy them From here going southeast for less than two hundred li I reached the country of Kanyākubja known as Qunchengguo Country of Hunchbacked Maidens in the domain of Central India End of Fascicle IV of The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions Six Countries from Kanyākubja to Viṣaka The country of Kanyākubja is more than four thousand li in circuit and the capital city with the Ganges River at the west is over twenty li in length and four or ve li in breadth

goods of different places are collected here The inhabitants live happily in abundance and their families are rich and prosperous There are many kinds of owers and fruit and crops are sown and reaped in good time The climate is mild and pleasant and the people are simple and honest by custom Their features are handsome and graceful and their clothes and adornments are bright and resplendent They earnestly study arts and literature and talk in a lucid and farsighted manner Heterodoxy and orthodoxy are each each by half of the population and both Mahayana and Hinayana teachings are studied by the people There are more than two hundred deva temples with several thousand heretics In the age when the human life span was very long the old capital city of the country of Kanyākubja was called Kusumapura known as Huagong Flowery Palace in Chinese The king named Brahmadatta was a person endowed with both bliss and wisdom he was well versed in literature and the arts of war His prestige kept Jambudvīpa in awe of him and his renown spread to the neighboring countries He had one thousand sons all of whom possessed the qualities of wisdom and bravery as well as magnanimity and resoluteness He also had one thousand daughters who were beautiful in features and had rened manners There was then a ṛṣi who lived by the banks of the Ganges He concentrated his mind in meditation for several myriads of years and his form became like that of a driedup tree Some migratory birds alighted upon him and dropped a fruit of the nyagrodha tree on his shoulder With the passage of many hot and cold seasons the fruit grew into a big tree with branches growing downward to form a vault After many years the ṛṣi rose from his meditation and wished to shake off the tree but he feared that he might overturn the nests of the birds The people appreciated his virtue and called him the ṣi of the Big Tree One day as the ṛṣi was enjoying the view of the riverside he made a pleasure trip into the dense wood where he saw the kings daughters playing and frolicking merrily His sexual passion was aroused and his mind became stained So he went to Kusumapura to ask to marry one of the kings daughters On hearing of the ṛṣis arrival the king received him in person and greeted him saying As Your Reverence lives outside the scope of the human world why do you condescend to pay me a visit The ṛṣi said I have lived in the woods and near the lakes for many long years I have come from afar to propose marriage On hearing these words the king did not know what to do and said to the ṛṣi Return to your place and wait for an auspicious time Heeding the kings order the ṛṣi went back to the woods The king then consulted with his daughters about the matter but none of them would consent to accept the offer Fearing the ṛṣis divine power he became heavyhearted and weighed down with worry One day when the king was at leisure his youngest daughter calmly asked him Father you have a thousand sons and you are admired by all countries Why do you look so worried as if you have fear in your mind The king said The ṣi of the Big Tree has come to propose marriage but none of your sisters consented to be married to him The ṛṣi has divine power and could cause either disaster or bliss If I cannot fulll his desire he will certainly become angry with me and destroy our country and terminate our ancestral line causing insult to our forefathers This is why I am deeply worried this is really my fear The kings youngest daughter said apologetically It is our sin to have caused you such deep worry I wish to offer my humble self to lengthen the transmission of the royal line The king was delighted to hear this and ordered a carriage to take his youngest daughter to her home Upon arriving at the ṛṣis hermitage the king apologized to him saying Great ṣi you comply with supramundane sentiments and you also stoop to care for worldly affection I venture to offer my youngest daughter to be at your service The ṛṣi displeased at the sight of the girl said to the king You must despise me as an old man to give me such an illlooking girl in marriage The king said I have asked all my other daughters but none of them would obey my order Only this youngest one consented to serve you The ṛṣi was enraged and called down evil on the kings other daughters saying Let all ninetynine girls immediately become hunchbacked With their disgured shapes let them remain unmarried their whole lives long The kings messenger went back to check the efcacy of the curse and found that the girls had actually become hunchbacked Thereafter the place was called the City of Hunchbacked Maidens The present king named Harṣavardhana known as Xizeng Increment of Happiness is a descendant of the vaiśya caste His family had three kings that ruled over the country for two generations His father was named Pra bhā karavardhana and his elder brother was Rājyavardhana known as Wangzeng Increment of the Kingdom As Rājyavardhana was the senior prince he succeeded to the throne and administered state affairs in a virtuous manner At that time King aśāṅka of the country of Karṇasuvarṇa in East India often said to his ministers A sagacious king in a neighboring country might be the cause of disaster to our own country So he lured Rājyavardhana to his country and murdered him Since the people lost their lord the country of fell into a chaos At that time the minister Bhaṇḍi a man of high position and good repute said to his colleagues Today we should make a decision about a matter of fundamental importance for the nation The son of the former king and younger brother of the late monarch is a kind and benevolent man who has lial piety toward his parents and an affectionate mind he respects the sages and treats his subordinates with equality I wish to propose him for the throne What do you think of this Please state your views The ministers all admired the virtue of the late kings younger brother and had no objection to him Thus the assistant ministers and other ofcials exhorted him to be king saying May the prince listen to us By accumulating merits and cultivating virtues the former king possessed the throne and ruled over the country extensively This is a great shame to our country and it is also the fault of the humble ministers Current public opinion and folk rhymes say that you a sagacious prince should succeed to the throne in order to avenge your deceased brother and wipe out the national humiliation as well as glorify the deeds of your father This is really a great exploit so we hope you will not decline the offer The prince said From ancient times up to the present it has always been an important affair for one to succeed to the throne so we should be prudent in establishing a man in the position of a monarch I am indeed poor in virtue and both my father and my elder brother have departed Although you recommend me to succeed to the throne do you think I am a competent candidate for the position Despite public opinion I dare not forget my own unsubstantiality and shallowness Now on the bank of the Ganges River there is an image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva that has shown many spiritual manifestations I wish to go there to consult the oracle of the bodhisattva So he went to the image of the bodhisattva and prayed before it after having observed the appropriate fast Mmoved by his sincerity the bodhisattva revealed his true features and inquired of him For what do you seek with such sincerity and earnestness The prince said My accumulated ill fortune caused the death of my father and the murder of my elder brother was a heavy punishment inicted upon me I am aware of my own lack of virtue but the people wish to elect me to succeed to the throne to glorify the deeds of my departed father Being ignorant of what to do I hope to hear your holy mandate The bodhisattva told him In your previous life you were a forestdwelling bhikṣu in this wood and practiced the Way diligently By the power of this meritorious action you are now a prince in this life Since the king of the country of Karṇasuvarṇa destroyed the buddhadharma you should ascend the throne to work for its revival With a mind of great compassion and sympathy for the people you will soon become king of all the ve parts of India If you wish to prolong the sovereignty of your country you should follow my advice and then you will be blessed by the gods and have no powerful enemy in neighboring countries You should not ascend the lion seat nor should you assume the title of king With this instruction the prince left the image and ascended the throne with the appellation of prince and the name īlāditya  Prince īlāditya said to his ministers For as long as my elder brother is not avenged and neighboring countries have not pledged allegiance to me I will not take food with my right hand I hope you court ofcials will work together with one heart Then he took command of all his troops in the whole country and trained the ghters who consisted of ve thousand elephantmounted soldiers twenty thousand cavalrymen and fty thousand infantrymen He marched from west to east to attack those who refused to acknowledge allegiance to him With his elephants unreleased and his men fully armed for six years he subjugated all the ve parts of India He not only expanded his territory but also enlarged his military forces having increased his elephant corps to sixty thousand men and his cavalrymen to one hundred thousand strong For thirty years no weapon was raised for ghting and the prince administered the country in peace and practiced frugality He sought blessedness and performed good deeds so sedulously that he forgot about eating and sleeping He ordered that within the ve parts of India no was allowed to eat meat and if anyone killed any living creature the culprit would be executed without pardon Alongside the Ganges River he built several thousand stupas each over one hundred feet high Temples were constructed in towns and villages and at thoroughfares and crossroads in the ve parts of India where food and drink were stored and medicines laid in to be distributed as alms to wayfarers and the poor without negligence Monasteries were constructed at sacred sites and once every ve years a great congregation was convened in which everything in the royal treasury except weaponry was given away as alms Every year śramaṇas of different countries were invited to attend a meeting for twentyone days during which time they were provided with the four monastic requisites and seats were prepared on welldecorated mats so that they might carry out debates and arguments about the teachings of Buddhism to see who was superior and who inferior in learning The good ones were praised and the bad ones censured while the ignorant were dismissed and the brilliant ones promoted Those who strictly observed the disciplinary rules and were pure in morality were selected to ascend the lion seat and the king received the Dharma from them in person Those who were pure in observing the disciplinary rules but lacked learning were merely saluted to show respect to them Those who violated the disciplinary rules and whose immorality was obvious were banished from the country never to be seen or heard of again If the lords and their assistant ministers of the small neighboring countries performed meritorious deeds tirelessly and sought goodness without weariness the king would take them by the hand to sit together with him and call them good friends He never spoke to those kings who were different in character and if a negotiation was required to settle a matter an envoy was sent to deal with it Whenever he went on an inspection tour he would not stay at any one place but would have a hut made for his lodging wherever he stopped on the way During the three months of the rainy season he would not travel about because of the rain At his temporary residence he always had delicious food prepared every day to feed one thousand monks of different schools and ve hundred brahmans He always divided a day into three periods one was spent attending to state affairs and two were devoted to performing meritorious deeds and doing good work He lived assiduously and the day was too short for him At rst I was invited by King Kumāra to proceed from the country of Magadha to the country of Kāmarūpa At that time King īlāditya was making an inspection tour in the country of Kajuṅghira and he sent an order to King Kumāra saying It bets you to come promptly with the śramaṇa a guest from a distant land to Nālandā to attend an assembly Thus I went together with King Kumāra to meet him After exchanging greetings King īlāditya inquired of me Which country do you come from What is the purpose of your journey I said in reply I come from the country of Great Tang to seek the buddhadharma The king said Where is the country of Great Tang located by what route did you travel and how far is it from here I replied It is situated to the northeast at a distance of several myriads of li and it is the country known in India as Mahācīna The king remarked I have heard that in the country of Mahācīna the Prince of Qin has been an intelligent man since his youth and that now that he has grown up he is a man of unusual bravery Out of gratitude for his edication and maintenance all the common people chant the Music of Prince Qins Victory in praise of him It has been a long time since we heard this elegant eulogy bestowed on him Is the good repute heaped on him for his great virtue true to the facts Is such the actual condition of the country of Great Tang I said in reply Yes Cīna is the name of the country now and during the reign of the former king while Great Tang is the national title of the reigning sovereign Before his accession to the throne he was called the Prince of Qin and after ascending the throne he is now entitled the Son of Heaven When the fortune of the previous monarch came to an end the people lost their lord and the country fell into a chaos caused by war and cruel harm and injuries were inicted on the people The Prince of Qin endowed with innate ambition had the mind of compassion and by exerting the inuence of his prestige he annihilated all his enemies Peace prevailed over all the eight quarters and various countries presented tributes He loves and tends creatures of the four kinds of birth and respects the Triple Gem with veneration He has reduced taxation and mitigated penalties yet he has surplus funds in the state treasury and no one attempts to violate the law Concerning his moral inuence and his profound edication of the people it is difcult for me to narrate all of this in detail King īlāditya remarked How grand it is The people of that land have performed good deeds that caused them to have a saintly lord When King īlāditya was about to return to the city of Kanyākubja to convoke a religious assembly hundreds of thousands of his followers gathered on the southern bank of the Ganges while King Kumāra followed by a multitude of tens of thousands of people was on the northern bank of the river Divided by the stream the two retinue groups proceeded by land and water simultaneously with the two kings leading their four divisions of troops who sailed in boats and rode elephants beating drums and blowing conches plucking strings and playing pipes After traveling for ninety days they reached the city of Kanyākubja In a great owery wood to the west of the Ganges more than twenty kings of various countries who had been informed beforehand came with intelligent śramaṇas and brahmans as well as ofcials and soldiers of their respective countries to attend the great assembly King had previously constructed a large monastery on the west bank of the river with a precious terrace erected at the east to the height of over one hundred feet on which was placed a golden image of the Buddha of the same size as the king At the south of the terrace was erected a precious altar which was the place for bathing the Buddhas image At a distance of fourteen or fteen li to the northeast from here a temporary palace was built It was in the second month of spring and from the rst day up to the twentyrst of the month the śramaṇas and brahmans were feted with delicious food From the temporary palace up to the monastery pavilions adorned with countless jewels were erected along the road on both sides and musicians standing motionless performed elegant music uninterruptedly From the temporary palace the king with a concentrated mind took out a dimly visible golden image that was more than three feet tall It was carried on a big elephant screened by a precious curtain King īlāditya dressed as Indra held a precious canopy and attended on the left side while King Kumāra dressed as Brahmā carried a white ywhisk and attended on the right side On each side there were ve hundred elephantmounted soldiers clad in armor and guarding the buddha image before and behind and on each side were one hundred elephants that carried musicians to perform music As he walked King īlāditya scattered pearls and miscellaneous jewels as well as pieces of gold and silver and owers as offerings to the Triple Gem He rst bathed the image with perfumed water on the precious altar Then the king personally carried the image to the west terrace and offered hundreds and thousands of jewels and gems and pieces of kauśeya cloth to it At that time there were only about twenty śramaṇas participating in the function with the king while the kings of other countries acted as attendant guards After the meal was over the monks of different schools assembled to discuss the subtle theories and deliberate on the ultimate truth When the sun was about to set the king returned to the temporary palace In this manner the golden image was taken out every day in the same kind of procession as on the rst day until the convocation was dispersed Sudenly the great terrace caught re and the monastery and its entrance arch were set ablaze The king said I have spent all the valuables of the national treasury to construct this monastery in the name of my late father in order to glorify his superior deeds Owing to my lack of virtue I could not evoke spiritual protection but caused this calamity Unlucky man that I am what use is it for me to live any longer Then he burned incense to worship and made a pledge saying Due to my good deeds in the past I became a king ruling over all parts of India May the power of my blessedness extinguish this disastrous conagration If no spiritual response arises I will give up my life right now While saying this he jumped down and landed on the doorsill The re was immediately extinguished just as if someone had put it out and the smoke vanished The various kings witnessing this strange event felt increased awe and respect for him Without changing his countenance and speaking in his normal tone King īlāditya inquired of the various kings What would you think if this disaster had actually consumed all that I had achieved The kings prostrated themselves on the ground weeping piteously and said We expected that this superior site achieved by you would be handed down to posterity Only the heretics would have felt delighted and rejoiced over the disaster The king said In view of this accident what the Tathāgata has taught is true The heretical and heterodox schools persist in the view of permanence but our great teacher alone inculcated the theory of impermanence is a great benecence and there is no reason to be deeply regretful about it He the followed the various kings and went up to the great stupa in the east to have a view of the scenery When he was descending the steps after having viewed the environs a stranger suddenly appeared and attempted to attack him with a knife The king cornered by the assailant retreated to a higher step and bending down backward he got ahold of the man and handed him over to his ofcials At that time the ofcials were so alarmed with fright that they failed to come to the kings rescue The various kings demanded that the man be put to death but King īlāditya without any resentment ordered that he not be killed and personally interrogated him asking What wrong did I do to you that you attempted to commit such a violent atrocity The man said in reply Your Majestys virtuous benevolence is impartial and all people both in your country and abroad are the recipients of your benecence At the instigation in one word from the heretics I acted as an assassin and attempted to murder you The king said Why did the heretics cherish such an evil intention In reply the man said Your Majesty assembled of different countries emptied the treasury for their maintenance and cast images of the Buddha while the heretics summoned from distant places were not properly cared for Thus they felt humiliated and ordered me a wild idiot to commit this malicious act in a deceitful way Through further investigation into the heretical adherents it was found that ve hundred brahmans and other people of high talent who were assembled under the kings order felt envious of the hospitality and veneration enjoyed by the śramaṇas and they had shot a burning arrow to set re to the precious terrace in the hope of murdering the great king amid the turmoil of people trying to put out the re At that time the various kings and ministers proposed to put the heretics to death but the king punished only the chief criminals while the rest of the party were pardoned and the ve hundred brahmans were banished from the domain of India Afterward the king returned to his capital city The stupa at the northwest of the city was constructed by King Aśoka at the site where the Tathāgata had once spoken on various wonderful doctrines for seven days Beside it were places where the four past buddhas used to sit and walk up and down There is also a small stupa containing hair and nail relics of the Tathāgata The stupa built at the place where the Tathāgata preached the Dharma faces the Ganges River on the south There are three monasteries built in one enclosure with separate entrances The images of the Buddha are magnicent and beautiful and the monks are quiet and austere There are several thousand families of monastic servitors In a precious casket in the temple there is a tooth relic of the Buddha about one and a half inches long with a special luster that changes color between morning and evening Hundreds and thousands of people both ofcials and commoners come every day from far and near to see it and pay homage to it Its guardians who did not like the din and hubbub caused by the crowd started demanding a heavy entrance fee from the worshipers and announced far and near that those who wished to see the Buddhas tooth relic would have to pay a large amount of money Worshipers were displeased with these monks thinking that they delighted in collecting money in the form of the entrance fee On each fast day the relic was exposed on a high cushion and hundreds and thousands of people burned incense and scattered owers No matter how many owers were piled up high  the relic casket was never covered over At each side and in front of the monasteries there is a temple more than one hundred feet high built with brick on stone bases The buddha images in them cast either in gold and silver or brass were adorned with various kinds of gems In front of each of the two temples there is a small monastery Not far to the southeast of the monasteries there is a large temple more than two hundred feet high built out of brick on stone bases housing a standing statue of the Buddha over thirty feet tall which was cast in brass and adorned with various kinds of gems On the stone walls of the temple there are carvings depicting in full detail the acts of the Tathāgata when he was practicing the way of a bodhisattva Not far to the south of the stone temple is a temple of Sūrya  and not far further to the south there is another temple dedicated to Maheśvara  both of which were built with bluestone and fully carved with sculptures They are the same size as the Buddhist temple and each has one thousand families to serve as scavengers to keep the place clean Music from drums and voices is performed day and night without cease At a distance of six or seven li to the southeast of the great city there is a stupa over two hundred feet high built by King Aśoka at the site where the Tathāgata once preached on the doctrine that the physical body is impermanent sorrowful empty and impure Beside it is a site where the four past buddhas used to sit and walk up and down There is also a small stupa containing hair and nail relics of the Tathāgata Anyone who suffers from an illness can surely be cured and beneted if he or she circumambulates the stupa with a pious mind Going southeast from the great city for more than one hundred li I reached the city of Navadevakula which is situated on the eastern bank of the Ganges River and is over twenty li in circuit with and pure ponds surrounded by owery woods that are reected in the water To the northwest of the city of Navadevakula at the east of the Ganges is a deva temple consisting of storied pavilions and multitiered terraces which were exquisitely constructed Five li to the east of the city there are three monasteries built in one enclosure but with separate gates There are over ve hundred monks all of whom study the teachings of the Hinayana Sarvāstivāda school More than two hundred paces in front of the monasteries there is a stupa built by King Aśoka Although the foundations have collapsed the structure is still more than one hundred feet high It was built at the site where the Tathāgata preached the Dharma for seven days In the monasteries there is a piece of a śarīra that emits a light from time to time Beside them are places where the four past buddhas used to sit and walk up and down Three or four li to the north of the monasteries and on the bank of the Ganges is a stupa more than two hundred feet high that was built by King Aśoka at the site where the Tathāgata preached the Dharma for seven days Five hundred hungry ghosts then came to the Buddha and became awakened after hearing the Dharma having been released from the realm of hungry ghosts they were reborn in the heavens Beside the stupa at the place where the Buddha preached the Dharma is a site where the four past buddhas used to sit and walk up and down Beside it is a stupa containing the Tathāgatas hair and nail relics From here going to the southeast for over six hundred li I crossed the Ganges to the south and reached the country of Ayodhyā in the domain of Central India The country of Ayodhyā is more than ve thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over twenty li in circuit This country abounds in cereal crops and has plenty of owers and fruit The climate is mild and the people are benign by custom They have an inclination for performing meritorious deeds and are diligent in learning the arts and crafts There are more than one hundred monasteries with over three thousand monks who study both Mahayana and Hinayana doctrines There are ten deva temples with a few heretics In the great city there is an old monastery that was the place where Vasubandhu Bodhisattva known as Shiqin in Chinese and formerly called Poshubandu wrongly translated as Heavenly Kinsman spent several decades composing various treatises on both Mahayana and Hinayana doctrines The old foundations beside it are the ruins of a hall in which Vasubandhu Bodhisattva expounded Buddhist theories and spoke on the Dharma for the kings of different countries as well as for prominent śramaṇas and brahmans coming from the four quarters Four or ve li to the north of the city in a great monastery on the bank of the Ganges is a stupa over two hundred feet high built by King Aśoka marking the place where the Tathāgata spoke on the various wonderful doctrines to heavenly and human beings for three months The stupa beside it marks a place where the four past buddhas used to sit and walk up and down Four or ve li to the west of the monastery is a stupa containing the Tathāgatas hair and nail relics To the north of the stupa containing hair and nail relics are the ruins of a monastery in which the śāstra master rīlabdha known as Shengshou Received in Victory in Chinese of yore composed the Vi bhāṣāśāstra of the Sautrāntika school In a great mango grove ve or six li to the southwest of the city there is an old monastery where Asaṅga Bodhisattva known as Wushuo No Attachment in Chinese received instructions and guided the common people At night he ascended to the place of Maitreya Bodhisattva in Heaven to learn the Yogācārabhūmiśāstra the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāraśāstra the Madhyānta vibhāgaśāstra  in the daytime he lectured on the marvelous principles to a large audience More than one hundred paces to the northwest of the mango grove is a stupa containing hair and nail relics of the Tathāgata The old foundations beside it mark the place where Vasu bandhu Bodhisattva descended from Tuṣita Heaven to see Asaṅga Bodhisattva Asaṅga Bodhisattva a native of the country of Gandhāra was a man of virtue born one thousand years after the demise of the Buddha and realized the Way after receiving edication He became a monk of the Mahīśāsaka school to learn its teachings but soon afterward he turned his mind toward the Mahayana doctrines His younger brother Vasubandhu Bodhisattva became a monk of the Sarvāstivāda school to receive an education He was a man of wide learning with a retentive memory and he possessed comprehensive knowledge and probed into its essence Asaṅgas disciple Buddhasiṃha was a monk who observed the disciplinary rules immaculately and was well known for his high talents These two or three sagely persons often said among themselves that since the purpose of their spiritual cultivation was to see Maitreya in person in their next rebirth whoever among them died rst and fullled his longcherished wish should come back to inform the others where he had been reborn Buddha siṃha died rst but he did not come back to report his whereabouts for three years Later Vasubandhu passed away but he too did not report back after six months The heretics sneered at them deeming that Vasubandhu Bodhi sattva and Buddhasiṃha had been reborn in an evil state and so they could not show any spiritual response Asaṅga Bodhisattva was instructing his disciples in the methods of practicing meditation one night when the lamplight suddenly faded out and a great brightness appeared in the sky A heavenly being descended from the air and entered the courtyard to worship Asaṅga who asked him Why do you come so late What is your name now said in reply After my death here I repaired to Tuṣita Heaven where I was born from a lotus ower in the inner department of the heaven Welcome Guanghui As soon as I had just nished circumambulating him once I descended to report this to you Asaṅga Bodhisattva asked Where is Buddhasiṃha now The reply was When I was circumambulating I saw Buddhasiṃha in the outer department indulging himself in sensual pleasures and he was so busy that he had scarcely any time to look at me nmuch less come down to report to you Asaṅga Bodhisattva said Let it be so Now what does Maitreya look like What Dharma does he preach The reply was His features are so beautiful that they are beyond description He preached on the wonderful Dharma of which the purports were the same as you have explained here The bodhisattva has a melodious voice so uent and elegant that those who hear it forget about fatigue and his students never feel bored More than forty li to the northwest of the old foundations of Asaṅgas lecture hall I came to an old monastery with the Ganges River at its north where there is a brick stupa over one hundred feet high When he was traveling here from North India Asaṅga Bodhisattva sent a disciple to greet him at the midway point and it was at this monastery where they met each other Asaṅgas disciple stayed outside the house and at night he recited the Daśabhūmisūtra Upon hearing the recitation Vasubandhu became awakened and repented that he had not before heard the very profound and wonderful Dharma Thinking that the source of the fault of slander is the tongue he intended to cut off  As he grasped a scraping knife to slice off his tongue he saw Asaṅga appearing before him who told him The system of Mahayana teachings is the ultimate truth praised by all the buddhas and regarded as the orthodox school by various saints I intended to admonish you but now you have become awakened by yourself Nothing is better than a timely awakening According to the teachings of the buddhas cutting off ones tongue is not a way of repentance In bygone days you insulted the Mahayana teachings with your tongue so it would be better for you to amend your ways by praising the Mahayana teachings also with your tongue What would be the benet of becoming mute After having said this disappeared Following this advice Vasubandhu did not cut off his tongue and went to Asaṅga to study the Mahayana teachings with him He engaged in careful learning with profound speculation and wrote more than a hundred treatises on Mahayana theories all of which are very popular works From here going to the east for more than three hundred li I crossed the Ganges to the north and reached the country of Ayamukha in the domain of Central India The country of Ayamukha is two thousand four hundred or ve hundred li in circuit The capital city borders on the Ganges River and is more than twenty li in circuit The climate and local products of this country are the same as in the country of Ayodhyā The people are honest and their custom is plain and simple They are diligent in learning and like to perform meritorious deeds There are ve monasteries with over one thousand monks who study the Hinayana teachings of the Saṃmitīya school There are more than ten deva temples where heretics live together Not far away to the southwest of the city there is a stupa at the bank of the Ganges Built by King Aśoka it is two hundred feet high marking the place where in olden times the Tathāgata preached the Dharma for three months Beside it there is a place where the four past buddhas used to sit and walk up and down and there is also a stupa containing the Tathāgatas hair and nail relics Over two hundred monks live in the monastery beside the stupa The Buddhas image is well adorned and has an austere appearance as if he were still alive This was the place where in olden times the śāstra master Buddhadāsa known as Jueshi Buddha Servant composed the Mahāvibhāṣāśāstra of the Sarvāstivāda school From here going to the southeast for more than seven hundred li I crossed the Ganges to the south and reached the country of Prayāga north of the Jumna River  The country of Prayāga is more than ve thousand li in circuit and its capital city situated at the conuence of the two rivers is over twenty li in circuit It abounds in cereal crops and fruit trees are luxuriant The climate is temperate and the people are kind and agreeable by custom They take pleasure in learning arts and crafts and believe in heretical religions There are two monasteries with few monks all of whom study Hinayana teachings Deva temples amount to several hundreds and they have a large number of heretics In the wood of campaka owers to the south of the great city is a stupa built by King Aśoka which is still more than one hundred feet high though the foundations have collapsed Formerly the Tathāgata subdued heretics at this place Beside it is a stupa containing hair and nail relics and there is also a site where he used to walk up and down Beside the stupa of hair and nail relics is an old monastery where Deva Bodhisattva composed the ataśāstravaipulya to frustrate Hinayana adherents and conquer heretics When Deva Bodhisattva rst came to this monastery from South India there was in the city a heretical brahman who was learned in debate and eloquent in discussion without impediment He insisted on the identication of names and facts and he would refute his opponents to their wits end Knowing that Deva was widely learned in profound doctrines and wishing to break his spirit the brahman started a conversation by inquiring his name saying What is your name Deva said Deva The heretic said Who is Deva Deva said I am The heretic said Who is I Deva said A dog The heretic said Who is the dog Deva said You The heretic said Who are you Deva said Deva The heretic said Who is Deva I am The heretic said Who is I Deva said A dog The heretic said Who is the dog Deva said You The heretic said Who are you Deva said Deva In this manner they argued in a circle and the heretic began to understand  Since then he deeply respected Devas moralizing edication In the city there is a deva temple consisting of many lofty and beautifully decorated buildings which showed spiritual signs in various ways The merit of donating one coin at this temple is greater than that of giving one thousand pieces of gold in alms at other places and it is believed that someone who commits suicide and dies in this temple will enjoy eternal bliss in the heavens In front of the temple is a big tree with luxuriant branches and leaves that cast dark shadows on the ground A maneating ghost made his abode in the tree and skeletons were scattered about to the left and right sides People coming to this temple are liable to give up their lives as they are simultaneously frightened by the horrible tradition and allured by the evil spirits This absurd practice has been carried out without alteration from ancient times up to the present Recently there was a young man of the brahman caste who was intelligent and magnanimous in character and endowed with brilliant wisdom and high talent He came to the temple and said to the people Crooked customs and corrupt desires are hard to mend by dissuasion and guidance I must practice the same in order to correct them He climbed up into the tree and said to his friends gathered below I am going to die to testify to the truth of what is deceitful I shall forsake this humble body of mine at the best place for doing so When he was about to throw himself down to end his life his relatives and friends tried to dissuade him from doing so but he would not change his mind They spread their garments on the ground below the tree and saved his life when he dropped to the ground After a long while he came to his senses and said I only saw some evil spirits in the air beckoning to me and there was nothing of heavenly bliss To the east of the great city and at the junction of the two rivers there is a dune more than ten li wide dry and covered with ne sand From ancient times up to now various kings and people of great wealth have always come here whenever they wished to give alms This place is called the Grand Place of Almsgiving where gifts are distributed without counting At present King īlāditya follows the example of his predecessors in practicing almsgiving He spends all the wealth he has accumulated in ve years on almsgiving in a single day and piles up precious things at the Place of Almsgiving On the rst day he installed a large image of the Buddha adorned with various gems to which he offered the best rare jewels Various kinds of precious objects and the best delicious food were distributed to them all in a perfect manner according to their grades and ranks When the treasury was emptied and the clothing and other objects were exhausted lustrous pearl in his topknot and the necklace on his body were given away one after the other without the least reluctance When King īlāditya had completed the almsgiving he said How happy I am I have placed all I had in the adamantine and indestructible storehouse After that the lords and kings of various countries offered precious jewels and garments to him and in less than ten days his treasury was replenished Several hundred people drown themselves every day at the conuence of the two rivers to the east of the Grand Place of Almsgiving It is popular custom as the people believe that in order to be reborn in the heavens they should starve and drown in the river at this spot The people bathe in midstream to wash away their sins and delements Thus people from different countries come to this place from distant regions to starve for seven days and die Even mountain apes and wild monkeys come in groups to the riverside Some of them take a bath and go back while others starve themselves to death When King īlāditya was performing the great almsgiving a monkey stayed alone under a tree at the riverside without going anywhere and fasted After a few days it died of starvation Some heretical ascetics plant long poles in the river at dawn they climb up the poles and stand with one hand holding the top of the pole and one foot on a peg while stretching out the other hand and foot into the air Craning their necks with eyes wide open they gaze at the sun moving to the right and do not come down until dusk There are several scores of such ascetics who hope to escape the wheel of rebirth by practicing such rigorous austerities Some of them have never relaxed their selfmortication for several decades From here I entered a great forest in the southwest where ferocious animals and wild elephants in groups attack wayfarers Unless accompanied by a large number of companions it is difcult for a traveler to cross this region alone After going for more than ve hundred li I came to the country of Kauśāmbī  The country of Kauśāmbī is over six thousand li in circuit and its capital city is more than thirty li in circuit The land is fertile and good for agricultural production The country abounds in nonglutinous rice and yields plenty of sugar cane The climate is hot and the people are bold and furious by custom They love to learn classical texts and arts and advocate the performance of good and meritorious deeds There are about ten monasteries lying in a dilapidated and deserted condition with more than three hundred monks who study the Hinayana teachings There are over fty deva temples with numerous heretics In the old palace in the city there is a great temple more than sixty feet in height that houses an image of the Buddha carved in sandalwood with a stone canopy suspended over it It was made by King Udayana known as Chuai Release from Passion formerly mistranslated as King Youtian The image often shows spiritual signs and emits a divine light from time to time The kings of various countries relying on their might wanted to take it but when they tried to lift it up they could not move it even though a large number of people were employed to do so Then they had pictures of the image produced for worship and each claimed that his picture was the most true to life Speaking of the images origin it is said that when the Tathāgata after having realized full enlightenment ascended to Trayastriṃśa Heaven to preach the Dharma to his mother the king was eager to see him and wished to make a likeness of him He requested Venerable Maudgalyāyana to use his supernatural power to transport an artisan to the heavenly palace to observe the Buddhas ne features and the artisan carved an image of him in sandalwood When the Tathāgata returned to earth from heaven the sandalwood image stood up to greet the Worldhonored One who said to it sympathetically Are you tired from teaching the people You are what we hope will enlighten the people in the last period of the buddhadharma More than a hundred paces to the east of the temple are places where the four past buddhas used to sit and walk up and down A well and bathhouse used by the Tathāgata are not far away The well still supplies water but the bathhouse has fallen into ruins At the southeast corner inside the city are the ruins of the old residence of Elder Ghoṣila formerly transcribed as Jushiluo incorrectly where there is a Buddhist temple and a stupa containing hair and nail relics Another old foundation is that of the Buddhas bathhouse Not far to the southeast of the city is an old monastery built in the garden of Elder Ghoṣila in which is a stupa more than two hundred feet high built by King Aśoka The Tathāgata stayed here preaching the Dharma for several years Beside it are sites where the four past buddhas used to sit and walk up and down There are also stupas containing the Tathāgatas hair and nail relics On the storied pavilion to the southeast of the monastery is an old brick chamber in which Vasubandhu Bodhisattva stayed and composed the Vijñapti mātratāsiddhiśāstra to refute Hinayana teachings and defeat heretics In a mango grove to the east of the monastery is the old foundation of a house in which Asaṅga Bodhisattva composed the Prakaraṇāryavācāśāstra Eight or nine li to the southwest of the city is the cave of a venomous dragon Formerly the Tathāgata subdued this dragon and left his own shadow in the cave Although this is recorded in books nothing more of it can be seen now Beside the cave is a stupa more than two hundred feet high built by King Aśoka At its side are sites where the Tathāgata used to sit and walk up and down and a stupa containing his hair and nail relics Those who suffer from illness come here to pray for health and most of them are cured As this is be the country where ākyamunis Dharma will nally come to an end all the people from kings down to commoners naturally feel sad when they come to this land and shed tears before returning home with sighs of regret Going for more than seven hundred li through a great forest to the northeast of the dragons cave I crossed the Ganges to the north and reached the city of Kāśapura It is over ten li in circuit and the inhabitants are rich and happy Beside it there are the ruins of a monastery where Dharmapāla Bodhisattva subdued heretics in the old days A previous king of this country who supported heterodox views intended to destroy the buddhadharma in order to uphold the heretics He invited from among them a śāstra master who was intelligent had great talent and understood subtle theories to compose a fallacious book of thirtytwo thousand words in one thousand stanzas to denounce the buddhadharma and make his own sect the orthodox one The king then summoned the monks to hold a debate on the condition that if the heretical śāstra master won the contest the buddhadharma would be destroyed and if the monks were undefeated then the śāstra master would cut off his tongue At that time the monks fearing that they might be defeated assembled to discuss the matter saying The Sun of Wisdom has sunk and the Bridge of the Dharma is about to be destroyed How can we compete with the heretics who have the king standing by their side Under these circumstances what should we do The assembly remained silent and no one ventured to raise a proposal Dharmapāla Bodhisattva then a young man who was eloquent intelligent and learned and who enjoyed a widespread reputation declared to the assembly Although I am an ignorant person I venture to make a brief statement It would truly bet you to send me promptly to answer the kings order If I win the debate it will be due to spiritual protection and if I fail my youthfulness can be blamed In this way we can give an explanation in either case and no censure will be incurred upon the Dharma or the community of monks The whole assembly consented to his proposal and according to his suggestion Dharmapāla was sent to answer the kings order He mounted the seat of discussion and the heretical recited his book in a rhythmic voice brought out all the essentials of his work and waited for a refutation Dharmapāla listened to his recitation and said with a smile I have won Shall I recite your book backward or shall I recite it with the phrases transposed in order The heretic was dismayed and said You should not be selfimportant One who can fully understand the meanings of my book is the winner First recite it in its proper sequence and then give an explanation of the text Dharmapāla then imitated the heretics rhythmic voice recited the text and expounded the meanings of its contents with no fault either in phraseology or in principles nor was there any deviation in the intonation After hearing this the heretic made ready to cut off his tongue Dharma pāla said to him Cutting off your tongue is not a way to amend yourself The king gave up the erroneous way and embraced the Dharma in adoration Beside the place where Dharmapāla subdued the heretic is a stupa built by King Aśoka Though the foundations have collapsed it is still more than two hundred feet high Formerly the Tathāgata preached the Dharma for six months at this place Beside it is a place where walked up and down and a stupa containing his hair and nail relics Going northward from here for one hundred seventy or eighty li I reached the country of Viṣaka  The country of Viṣaka is more than four thousand li in circuit and its capital city is sixteen li in circuit It abounds in cereal crops and yields plenty of owers and fruit The climate is moderate and the people are sincere and honest by custom They are fond of learning without getting tired and they never regress in performing good deeds There are more than twenty monasteries with over three thousand monks all of whom study the teachings of the Saṃmitīya sect of the Hinayana school There are over fty deva temples with a great many heretics To the south of the city there is a large monastery on the left side of the road in which the arhat Devaśarman composed the Vijñānakāyaśāstra to advocate the theory of the nonself in the human body while the arhat Gopa wrote the Treatise on the Essential Truth of the Holy Teachings Sheng jiao yao shi lun to maintain the doctrine of the existence of the self in the human body These incompatible views about the Dharma caused much controversy It was also in this monastery that Dharmapāla Bodhisattva subdued one hundred Hinayana śāstra masters in seven days Beside the monastery is a stupa more than two hundred feet high built by King Aśoka Formerly the Tathāgata preached the Dharma for six years at this place to edify the people There is a marvelous tree about six or seven feet tall which neither sprouts leaves in springtime nor withers in autumn Formerly the Tathāgata cast down a tooth twig he had used for cleaning his teeth which took root and grew into the luxuriant tree that it there now People holding heterodox views and heretics have tried to cut the tree down but it grows back as before Not far away from the tree are places where the four past buddhas used to sit and walk up and down and there is also a stupa containing the Tathāgatas hair and nail relics The foundations of the holy sites are connected with one another in a wood with ponds in which the shapes of the trees are reected Going from here to the northeast for over ve hundred li I reached the country of rāvastī formerly known as Shewei erroneously in the domain of Central India End of Fascicle V of The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions Four Countries from rāvastī to Kuśinagara The country of rāvastī is over six thousand li in circuit Its capital city is in desolation and there is nothing to mark its boundaries The old foundations of the palace city are more than twenty li in circuit Although mostly in ruins it is still inhabited It abounds in cereal crops and the climate is temperate The people are sincere and honest by custom diligent in study and like to perform meritorious deeds There are several hundred monasteries most of which are dilapidated with few monks who are followers of the Saṃmitīya school Deva temples amount to a hundred and they have many heretics This was the capital of the country ruled by King Prasenajit known as Shengjun Victorious Army formerly called Bosini erroneously in abbreviation when the Tathāgata was living in the world The old foundations in the palace city are the remnant bases of King Prasenajits palace Not far to the east is another old foundation on which a small stupa has been built to mark the site of the Great Dharma Hall constructed by King Prasenajit for the Tathāgata in olden times Not far from the Dharma Hall a stupa was built on the old foundations of the temple of the Buddhas maternal aunt Prajāpatī known as Shengzhu Protectress of Creatures formerly mistranscribed as Bosheboti Bhikṣuṇī constructed for her by King Prasenajit Next to the east a stupa marks the site of the old residence of Sudatta known as Shanshi Good Almsgiver formerly mistranscribed as Xuda Beside the residence of Sudatta is a great stupa built at the spot where Aṅgulimāla gave up his evil ways Aṅgulimāla was a wicked man of rāvastī who harmed living beings and committed atrocities in the city and throughout the country He murdered people in order to collect their nger bones to make a mala Just as he was about to kill his mother to get her nger bone to complete the number of bones required for the mala the Worldhonored One with a mind of compassion was making a tour of edication Seeing the Worldhonored One from a distance Aṅgulimāla felt glad and thought I am sure to be reborn in the heavens as my late teacher taught me that anyone who hurts the Buddha and kills his own mother will be reborn in Brahmā Heaven He said to his mother Old lady you may stay here for a while As the Tathāgata slowly retreated the wicked Aṅgulimāla could not catch up with him even though he walked very fast The Worldhonored One said to him Why do you hold on to your ignoble ideas You have abandoned the root of goodness and aroused the source of wickedness On hearing this admonition Aṅgulimāla became aware that his behavior was wrong He took refuge in the Buddha and sought to learn the Dharma and as he studied diligently he attained arhatship Five or six li to the south of the city is Jetavana  the garden of Anāthapiṇḍika where King Prasenajits minister Sudatta constructed a temple for the Buddha In the old days it was a monastery but now it lies in ruins There are two stone pillars over seventy feet high one at each side of the east gate On top of the left pillar a wheel sign is carved and a gure of a bull is engraved on top of the right pillar Both pillars were erected by King Aśoka The buildings are dilapidated and only the remains of the old foundations still stand with the exception of a brick chamber that stands alone In this chamber there is an image of the Buddha After the Tathāgata preached the Dharma for his mother in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven King Prasenajit made this image after hearing that King Udayana had carved a sandalwood image of the Buddha Elder Sudatta was a kind and intelligent man who knew how to accumulate wealth and how to spend money to help the poor and needy and provide alms to kinless and aged people Hearing about the Buddhas virtues he cherished a deep adoration for him and wished to build a temple to which to invite the Buddha The Worldhonored One sent āriputra to go to survey the location and they found that only Prince Jetas garden was a suitably high and dry site They went to see the prince and told him their intention The prince said in jest I will sell my garden for as many pieces of gold as it takes to completely cover the ground On hearing this Sudatta was exhilarated and took gold coins from his treasury to pave the ground of the garden as Prince Jeta had suggested When only a small portion of the land remained uncovered the prince begged to retain it for himself saying The Buddha is really like a plot of good land and I too should sow good seeds in it He built a temple on the remaining portion of the ground The Worldhonored One went there and said to nanda As the ground of the garden has been purchased by Sudatta and the trees have been given by Prince Jeta these two have the same purpose in mind and their merits should be equally esteemed Henceforward this place should be called the Garden of JetavanaAnāthapiṇḍika To the northeast of the Garden of Anāthapiṇḍika is a stupa at the place where the Tathāgata once bathed a sick bhikṣu Once when the Tathāgata was living in the world there was a sick bhikṣu suffering from pain who lived alone in solitude Seeing him the Worldhonored One asked What is your malady and why are you living alone The bhikṣu said in reply I am indolent by nature and cannot endure medical treatment That is why I am sick and without anyone to attend me With a mind of compassion the Tathāgata said to him Good man now I am here to attend you Saying this he stroked the sick bhikṣu with his hand completely curing him and then helped then bhikṣu to go out through the door The Buddha said to him You should always be diligent and exert yourself Hearing this instruction the bhikṣu felt grateful and was happy in mind and comfortable in body To the northwest of the Garden of Anāthapiṇḍika is a small stupa at the place where Maudgalyāyana could not lift the belt of āriputras robe with his supernatural powers The Buddha was once at Anavatapta Lake with a congregation of human and heavenly beings Only āriputra was absent from the meeting and the Buddha asked Maudgalyāyana to summon him to the congregation When Maudgalyāyana went by the Buddhas order to the place of āriputra the latter was mending his clerical robe Maudgal yā yana said to him The Worldhonored One is now at Anavatapta Lake and has ordered me to summon you āriputra said Wait a moment When I have nished mending my robe I will go with you Maudgalyāyana said If you do not go with me immediately I will exercise my supernatural powers and carry you and your rock chamber to the congregation āriputra then untied his belt and put it on the ground saying If you can pick up my belt I will go with you immediately Maudgalyāyana exercised his great supernatural powers but he could not pick the belt up even though his strength caused an earthquake Then he returned to the Buddha through the air by the power of his magic feet and found that āriputra was already seated in the congregation Maudgalyāyana remarked with a sigh Now I have realized that the power of divine capabilities is inferior to that of transcendental wisdom Not far from the stupa of beltlifting is a well from which water was drawn for the Tathāgatas use when he was living in the world Beside it is another stupa built by King Aśoka in which are preserved the relics of the Tathāgata Indicative emblems were raised and stupas constructed at the sites where he walked up and down and preached the Dharma All of these places are protected by deities who occasionally show spiritual manifestations in the form of celestial music or divine fragrance Other auspicious signs of great blessedness are difcult for me to relate in detail Not far behind the monastery is the place where some young brahmanical students killed a prostitute in order to slander the Buddha The Tathāgata was in possession of the ten powers as well as fearlessness and omniscient wisdom and he was honored by human and heavenly beings and respected by saints and sages The heretics discussed the matter together saying We should contrive a devious scheme to slander and publicly insult him Then they hired a prostitute to pretend to be a hearer of the Dharma After she had became known as such to all the heretics killed her in secret buried the corpse beside a tree and appealed to the king for redress The king ordered an investigation and discovered the corpse in Jetavana Garden The heretics exclaimed The great śramaṇa Gautama often preached disciplinary rules and chastity But now he has had illicit intercourse with this woman and killed her in order to shut her up What disciplinary rules and austerities has he practiced At that moment heavenly beings in the air cried out The wicked heretics are merely making up a slander More than a hundred paces to the east of the monastery there is a large and deep pit which was the place where Devadatta who intended to poison the Buddha fell into hell alive Devadatta known as Tianshou Given by Heaven was the son of King Droṇodana Through twelve years study with zealous perseverance he mastered all the eighty thousand Dharma piṭakas Afterward he sought to learn supernatural powers for the sake of gaining material advantage and he associated with evil friends to whom he said in a discussion I have as many as thirty of the physical marks of a great person almost as many as the Buddha  and I also have a great following surrounding me By the Buddhas order and with the aid of his spiritual power āriputra and Maudgalyāyana preached the Dharma and exhorted the monks who had gone astray to return to the harmonious community of monks But Devadatta did not relinquish his evil mind and put poison on his ngernails intending to harm the Buddha when he went to pay homage to him He came from a great distance to carry out his plot but when he reached this spot the earth cracked open and he fell into hell alive To the south of the pit is another one which was the place where Kokālika Bhikṣu fell into hell alive because he had slandered the Buddha More than eight hundred paces to the south of the pit of Kokālika there is another large and deep pit which was the place where the brahman woman Ciñcā fell into hell alive because she had slandered the Buddha Once when the Buddha was preaching the essentials of the Dharma to human and heavenly beings a disciple of a heretical religion saw him from a distance in the assembly of respectful people thought Today I must insult Gautama to spoil his fame so that only my teacher will enjoy a good reputation She hid a wooden basin inside her clothes and came to Anāthapiṇḍika Garden where she declared aloud in the assembly This preacher had illicit intercourse with me and the child in my womb is a ākya The heretics believed in her words but the staunch followers of the Buddha knew that she was committing slander At that moment Indra wishing to clear up their doubts transformed himself into a white rat and gnawed through the cord that bound the basin which dropped down with a thud and startled the assembly All those who witnessed this event were greatly delighted A man in the assembly picked up the wooden basin and showed it to the woman saying Is this your child At that time the earth cracked open and the woman fell alive into the hell of uninterrupted pain to suffer retribution All these three pits are bottomless and during the autumn and summer seasons when torrential rains inundate the ditches and pools water never collects in them Sixty or seventy paces to the east of the monastery is a temple over sixty feet high in which there is an image of the seated Buddha facing toward the east The Tathāgata once held a discussion with the heretics at this place Further to the east is a deva temple of the same size as the Buddhist temple At sunrise the shadow of the deva temple does not fall on the Buddhist temple but at sunset the shadow of the Buddhist temple covers the deva temple Three or four li to the east of the overshadowing temple is a stupa built at the place where Venerable āriputra had a discussion with the heretics At the time Elder Sudatta rst purchased Prince Jetas garden with the intention of building a temple for the Tathāgata Venerable āriputra went together with the elder to make a survey of the plot The teachers of the six heretical schools challenged him to a contest in demonstrating supernatural powers Acting according to circumstances in carrying out edication āriputra subdued the heretics in conformity with their propensities In front of the temple and beside the stupa there is another stupa built at the spot where the Tathāgata defeated various heretics and also accepted the invitation of Mother Viśākhā To the south of the stupa of accepting the invitation is the place where King Virūḍhaka  on his way to invade the ākyas saw the Buddha and turned back his army After ascending the throne King Virūḍhaka raised an army and mobilized his people to avenge a former insult When his troops were deployed he ordered them to march A bhikṣu got wind of this and informed the Buddha about it The Worldhonored One then went to sit under a withered tree When King Virūḍhaka saw the Worldhonored One from a distance he dismounted to worship him and stood to one side asking Why do you not sit under a tree with luxuriant branches and rich foliage but instead stay under this tree with dead branches and withered leaves The Worldhonored One said in reply My clansmen are like branches and leaves to me Now that they are in danger where can I nd shelter The king remarked The Worldhonored One is speaking for his clanspeople I should go back He looked at the Buddha and moved by his compassion he recalled his army Near the place of withdrawing troops is a stupa marking the spot where the ākya maidens were slaughtered After King Virūḍhaka won the battle against the ākyas he selected ve hundred ākya maidens for his harem The ākya maidens indignantly uttered resentful words and insolently disparaged the king as the son of a slave When the king heard about this he was enraged and ordered that the ākya maidens be slaughtered By the kings order the executioners severed hands and feet and threw them into a pit The ākya maidens suffering bitter pain called on the Buddha The Worldhonored One saw the sad plight of the maidens with his eye of discernmen and ordered a bhikṣu to send some clothes to the maidens He then went to preach the wonderful Dharma to them such as the bondage of the ve desires the three ways of transmigration and the long and distant course of rebirth with the pain of separation from loved ones On hearing the Buddhas teachings the ākya maidens got rid of delements and gained the pure eye of the Dharma They all died at the same time and were reborn in heaven Indra appeared as a brahman and had their bodies collected and cremated People of later times recorded this event Not far from the stupa of the slaughter of the ākya maidens is a large driedup pool where King Virūḍhaka fell into hell After visiting the ākya maidens the Worldhonored One returned to Anāthapiṇḍika Garden and told the bhikṣus  King Virūḍhaka will be burned to death after seven days Hearing the Buddhas prediction the king became very frightened on the seventh day the king was as happy as ever and had no danger To celebrate he ordered the ladies of his harem to accompany him on an outing to the riverside for merrymaking But he still feared that a re might occur so he sailed in a boat and drifted with the waves of the river A blazing re suddenly broke out and burned the light boat and the king was thrown alive into the hell of uninterrupted torture Going three or four li to the northwest of the monastery I reached the Wood of Regaining Eyes There are places where the Tathāgata walked up and down and various saints practiced meditation and stupas were built to mark the sites In this country there was a band of ve hundred brigands that ran amok in the villages and plundered the cities King Prasenajit arrested them put out their eyes and threw them into a great forest Suffering the painful torture of this punishment the bandits sorrowfully called on the Buddha The Tathāgata was at Jetavana Temple and he heard their pitiful voices and had compassion on them A cooling breeze blew mildly and wafted some medicine down from the Snow Mountains which lled their eyes and they recovered their eyesight On seeing the Worldhonored One standing before them they cherished the mind of enlightenment  worshiped him with happiness and departed after throwing down their staves which then took root in the ground More than sixty li to the northwest of the great city is an ancient city that was the birthplace of Kāśyapa Buddha who was born in the bhadrakalpa at the time when the human life span was twenty thousand years To the south of the city is a stupa marking the spot where he rst met his father after having realized full enlightenment The stupa to the north of the city contains the entire body of Kāśyapa Buddha and all of these stupas were erected by King Aśoka Going from here to the southeast for over ve hundred li I reached the country of Kapilavastu formerly mistranscribed as Jialuowei in the domain of Central India The country of Kapilavastu is more than four thousand li in circuit and there are two palace cities which are completely deserted The wall of the royal city is dilapidated and its circumference is unknown The inner palace city is fourteen or fteen li in circuit and its wall is built of bricks the foundation is thick and strong The country has been deserted for a long time and is sparsely populated There is no grand ruler and each city has its own lord The soil is rich and crops are sown and reaped in season The climate is never abnormal and the people are genial by custom There are more than one thousand ruined foundations of old monasteries and beside the palace city is a monastery inhabited by over three thousand monks who study the Hinayana teachings of the Saṃmitīya school There are two deva temples with heretics living together Inside the palace city is the old foundation of the main audience hall of King uddhodana A statue of the king is placed in a shrine built on the old foundation Not far from this is the old foundation of Lady Mahāmāyās bedchamber A statue of the lady is kept in a shrine built on the old foundation Beside it is another shrine marking the place where ākya Bodhisattvas spirit descended to incarnate in his mothers womb and in this shrine there is a likeness depicting the Bodhisattvas spirit  According to the tradition of the Sthavira sect the Bodhisattvas spirit entered his mothers womb on the night of the thirtieth day of the month of Uttarāṣāḍhā corresponding to the fteenth day of the fth month in our country The tradition of the other sects holds that this event took place on the night of the twentythird day of that month corresponding to the eighth day of the fth month in our land To the northeast of the place of the descent of the Bodhisattvas spirit there is a stupa marking the place where the ṛṣi Asita read the princes physiognomy On the day when the Bodhisattva was born many fortunate and auspicious signs appeared simultaneously King uddhodana summoned various physiognomists and said to them Now a son has been born to me What is his future good or evil Tell me straight in plain words They said According to the records of ancient sages and the appearance of good signs the prince will be a universal monarch if he remains at home and if he renounces home he will become a fully enlightened person At that time the ṛṣi Asita came from a distance and knocked on the door requesting an audience The king greatly delighted greeted the ṛṣi and paid him due salutation He invited the ṛṣi to sit on a precious seat and said to him I did not expect that you Great ṣi would condescend to favor me with your presence today The ṛṣi said When I was sitting at ease in the heavenly palace I suddenly saw the heavenly beings dancing for joy I asked them why they were so exhilarated They said We should inform you Great ṣi that the rst lady of King uddhodana of the ākya clan in Jambudvīpa has given birth to a son today who will attain perfect enlightenment and omniscient wisdom Because I have heard this information I have come to see him I regret that I am getting old and I will not be able to hear his holy teachings At the south gate of the city there is a stupa marking the place where the Prince Siddhārtha wrestled with other ākyas in a contest and threw an elephant  A versatile youth the prince was peerless and had no equal When King uddhodana was on his way back home in a cheerful mood he asked his mahout to drive an elephant out of the city to greet him Devadatta always boastful of his strength was then coming into the city and asked the mahout You have caparisoned the elephant nicely who is going to ride it The mahout said Prince Siddhārtha is coming home I am going out to serve him Devadatta irritated by these words drew up next to the elephant struck its forehead and kicked its abdomen The animal fell to the ground and its body obstructed the road creating a hindrance in the way but nobody could remove it Later Nanda came and inquired Who killed this elephant Devadatta was the reply When the prince arrived he also asked Who is so wicked as to have killed this elephant to which was replied It was Devadatta who killed this elephant to blockade the city gate and Nanda pulled it aside to clear the way The prince then lifted up the dead elephant and ung it across the moat In the shrine beside the pit is a statue of the prince Another shrine beside it marks the site of the bedchamber of the princes consort where statues of Yaśodharā and Rāhula are kept In the shrine beside the palace is a statue in the posture of learning this was the old site of the princes schoolroom At the southeast corner of the city there is a shrine in which is a picture of the prince riding on a white horse galloping in the air This is the place where he went out over the city wall Outside the four gates of the city there are four shrines separately keeping the statues of an aged man a sick man a dead man and a śramaṇa These were the places where the prince witnessed on a pleasure trip the sorrowful sights by which he was moved to disgust at worldly life at which awakening he ordered the driver to turn his carriage back and head for home Going southward for more than fty li from the city I reached an old city with a stupa This was the natal city of Krakucchanda Buddha at the time of the bhadrakalpa when the human life span was sixty thousand years Not far to the south is a stupa marking the place where this buddha met his father after attaining full enlightenment Inside the stupa at the southeast of the city the remains of Krakucchanda are contained and in front of the stupa is a stone pillar over thirty feet high with a carving of a lion on top the events of his nirvana are inscribed on its sides This pillar was erected by King Aśoka Going northeast for more than thirty li from the city of Krakucchanda Buddha I reached a great ancient city with a stupa This was the city where Kanakamuni Buddha was born in the bhadrakalpa at the time when the human life span was forty thousand years Not far to the northeast is a stupa marking the place where this buddha converted his father after attaining full enlightenment Further to the north is a stupa containing Kanakamunis remains In front of the stupa is a stone pillar over twenty feet high with the carving of a lion on top the events of his nirvana are inscribed on its sides This pillar was erected by King Aśoka More than forty li to the northeast of the city is a stupa that marks the spot where Prince once sat under the shade of a tree watching farmers plowing the land and practiced meditation through which he became free of the passions King uddhodana saw the prince sitting in meditation under the shade of the tree and he noticed that the shadow of the tree never moved even as the sunlight changed the direction Reminded that the prince was a saintly person the king treasured and respected him all the more In the northwest of the city are hundreds and thousands of stupas built at the place where the ākyas were slaughtered After overcoming the ākyas King Virūḍhaka captured ninetynine million nine hundred thousand ākya people and massacred them all The corpses were piled up like haystacks and blood owed into a pool The corpses were collected and buried amid the panic of heavenly beings and the terror in human minds To the southwest of the place where the ākyas were slaughtered are four small stupas built at the spots where four ākya men resisted the army When King Prasenajit rst succeeded to the throne he sought a matrimonial alliance with the ākya clan The ākyas despised him as someone who was not of the same caste and with pompous ceremony they deceitfully gave him a slave girl to be his bride King Prasenajit made the girl his chief queen and their son was King Virūḍhaka Virūḍhaka wished to pursue his studies under the guidance of his maternal uncle When he came to the south of the city he saw a new lecture hall and went in to take a rest Hearing this the ākyas chased him while out chastising him How dare you the son of a slave woman stay in this hall The hall had been built by the ākyas for the Buddhas use After ascending the throne Virūḍhaka made up his mind to avenge the previous insult and stationed an army at this place There were four ākya men there who were plowing the land and they resisted and dispersed the invading army Then the four men entered the city but their clanspeople thought that as the descendants of a universal monarch and the offspring of a dharmarāja should not have dared to commit violence and so complacently kill others Because they had blemished the clans good name they were expelled from the clan and banished exiled to the Snow Mountains in the north One of the four ākyas became the king of Udyāna one the king of Bāmīyāna one the king of Himatala and one the king of Shangmi Three or four li to the south of the city in a banyan wood is a stupa built by King Aśoka This was the place where ākya Tathāgata returning home after having gained full enlightenment saw his father and preached the Dharma for him Knowing that the Tathāgata had subdued the army of Māra the Evil One and was traveling around to edify the people King uddho dana was eager to see him and pay homage to him So he dispatched a messenger to invite the Tathāgata with these words Formerly you promised to return to your native country after becoming a buddha Your words are still ringing in my ears and it is time now for you to turn your steps toward home The messenger came into the Buddhas presence and related the kings message The Tathāgata told him After seven days I will return to my home country The messenger returned and reported this message to the king So King uddhodana ordered his ministers and the people to sprinkle water and sweep the roads and streets and prepare owers and incense ready for use Accompanied by his ministers he went out to a distance of forty li to wait for the Buddhas arrival At that time the Tathāgata and his retinue of disciples protected by the eight diamond guardians and with the four heavenly kings as vanguards with Indra and the celestial beings of the kāmadhātu realm of sensual desire attending on his left and Brahmā and the celestial beings of the rūpa dhātu attending on his right and with all the bhikṣus following behind walked through the air to his home country In the assembly the Buddha was like the moon among the stars his austerity moved all the three realms of the world and his radiance surpassed the light of the seven luminaries After the king and his ministers had worshiped the Buddha they all returned to the capital city and the Buddha stayed at Banyan Monastery Not far from the monastery is a stupa marking the place where the Tathāgata once sat under a big tree facing east and accepted the gift of a robe sewn with golden thread offered by his aunt There is another stupa nearby built at the place where the Tathāgata converted eight princes and ve hundred ākya clanspeople Inside the east gate of the city on the left side of the road is a stupa at the place where Prince Siddhārtha practiced various skills and attainments Outside the gate is an śvara deva temple in which a stone image of śvara in the posture of standing up is enshrined This was the temple that the prince entered when he was in his swaddling clothes When King uddhodana brought the prince home from Lumbinī he passed by this temple on the way and said This deva temple often manifests spiritual responses and is sure to answer the prayers of ākya children The prince should be sent in to worship the deva The nurse brought the prince into the temple and the stone image of the deva stood up to greet him when the prince left the deva image resumed its seat Outside the south gate of the city on the left side of the road is a stupa at the place where the prince competing with other ākyas in the arts of war shot at iron drums At a distance of more than thirty li to the southeast from here is a small stupa beside which is a spring owing with clear water While competing with other ākyas in the skill of archery the prince drew his bow and as the arrow left the bow it pierced through the surface of the drums and hit the ground sinking into the earth up to its etching The spring of pure water formed at that spot by tradition called Arrow Spring When people are sick they drink the water or bathe in it and in most cases they are cured People travel from distant places to collect the clay of the spring and make it into a paste which is applied on on the forehead whenever they have any ailment As the clay is protected by spirits and deities it has a healing effect in most cases Going northeast from the Arrow Spring for eighty or ninety li I reached Lumbinī Wood where there is a bathing pool full of transparent water with owers of different descriptions spreading all over the place Twentyfour or twentyve paces to the north of the pool is an aśoka tree now withered this was the place where the Bodhisattva was born into the world The Bodhisattva was born on the eighth day of the second half of the month of Vaiśākha corresponding to the eighth day of the third month in our calendar though the Sthavira sect holds that it was on the fteenth day of the second half of the month of Vaiśākha corresponding to the fteenth day of the third month in our calendar Further east is a stupa built by King Aśoka at the place where two dragons bathed the prince After he had been born the Bodhisattva walked seven steps unaided to each of the four quarters and announced In the heavens above and on the earth below I am the sole Honored One From now on I shall have no more rebirth Under each step a large lotus ower sprang up from the earth Two dragons appeared in the air one emitting cool water and the other warm water to bathe him To the east of the stupa of bathing the prince are two lucid springs beside which are two stupas built at the place where two dragons emerged from the earth After the Bodhisattva was born his relatives and clanspeople hurried to get the water to wash themselves and in front of Lady Mahāmāyā two springs one cold and one hot gushed out water for them bathe in A stupa at the south marks the place where Indra received the Bodhisattva with both hands when the Bodhisattva was born Indra knelt down to catch him in a piece of wondrous celestial cloth Next are four stupas marking the place where the four heavenly kings carried the Bodhisattva When the Bodhisattva was born from the right side of his mother the four heavenly kings caught him in a piece of goldencolored ne cotton and placed him on a small gold table which they carried into the presence of his mother saying It is truly a joyous event for celebration that Your Ladyship has given birth to such a blessed son Even the heavenly beings are delighted not to speak of the human beings of the earth Not far from the stupa where the four heavenly kings carried the prince there used to be a great stone pillar erected by King Aśoka with the gure of a horse on top It was later broken in the middle by a thunderbolt caused by an evil dragon and half of it fell onto the ground Beside the broken pillar is a rivulet owing toward the east called Oil River by the local people After Lady Mahāmāyā had given birth the heavenly beings produced a pool of lucent and pure water at this place for the lady to bathe herself so as to wash off the soil and dust It has now become water From here going eastward for more than two hundred li through a wild jungle I reached the country of Rāma  The country of Rāma has been deserted for many years and it has no boundary marks The towns and villages are in ruins and are sparsely populated To the southeast of the old capital city is a brick stupa less than one hundred feet high built by a former king of this country When the Tathāgata had entered nirvana the king of this country obtained a portion of his relic bones which he brought back to his own country he built this stupa for paying homage to his share of the relics It shows spiritual manifestations from time to time and often emits a divine light Beside the stupa is a clear pool from which a dragon often emerges in the shape of a snake to worship the stupa circumambulating it from left to right Wild elephants come in groups to pick owers and scatter them on the stupa which has been under spiritual protection without cease When King Aśoka was constructing more stupas for the dissemination of the Buddhas relic bones he opened up the stupas formerly built in seven countries to take out the relic bones  When he came to this country and was about to start working  the dragon of the pool fearing that he might be deprived of the relics appeared as a brahman and halted the kings elephant saying Your Majestys goodwill extends to the buddhadharma and you have widely cultivated the eld of blessedness I venture to invite you to deign to visit my abode The king said Where is your home Is it far away or nearby The brahman said I am the dragon king of this pool As Your Majesty wishes to perform superior deeds of blessedness I have ventured to come and beg for an interview At his invitation the king entered the dragons palace and after sitting for a while the dragon said Due to my past evil deeds I have been born in the shape of a dragon I wish for you to come see and worship the relics in person Seeing the dragons paraphernalia for worshiping the relics the king was awed by their splendor and said These utensils for making offerings are not to be seen in the human world The dragon said If that is so I pray that you will not demolish them Thinking that he was not equal to the dragon in power King Aśoka relinquished the idea of opening up that stupa A mound marks the spot where he came out of the pool Not far from the stupa is a monastery with few monks It is a quiet and clean place under the management of a śrāmaṇera  Monks coming from distant places are well received with hospitality and invited to stay for three days to receive offerings of the four monastic requisites The local people say that once a bhikṣu came with some fellow monks from a distant place to worship the stupa and they saw a group of elephants bustling about weeding grass with their tusks and sprinkling water with their trunks each of them holding different kinds of owers to make offerings At this sight the monks were deeply moved and sighed with pity One of the bhikṣus relinguished his position as a fully ordained monk in order to stay behind as a śrāmaṇera to attend the stupa He said farewell to the other monks saying I am lucky to have become a member though an incompetent one of the community of monks Through the passage of time I have made no achievement in my spiritual practice As this stupa contains the Buddhas relics the elephants are inspired by his holy virtues to come to keep the place clean If I can spend the rest of my life here I will be very fortunate indeed The other monks told him It is a good idea and we are so ignorant as not to have thought of it ourselves Please take care of yourself and do not fail in your superior deed Having parted from his companions the śrāmaṇera repeated his sincere vow and lived alone happily with the intention of living in this manner until the end of his life He plucked seasonal owers and kept the place clean by sprinkling water and sweeping the ground dong this for many years in succession without changing his mind The kings of the neighboring countries heard about him deep respect they vied with one another to donate money and valuables for the construction of a monastery and invited the śrāmaṇera to supervise the monastic affairs Since then the abbot of this monastery has always been a śrāmaṇera in memory of the original institution Going east from rāmaṇera Monastery for more than a hundred li through a big forest I reached a great stupa built by King Aśoka at the place where Prince Siddhārtha halted after he had gone out over the city wall taken off his precious garments untied his necklace and asked his servant Chandaka to return to the palace The prince went over the city wall at midnight and reached this place at daybreak and having fullled his cherished desire he said to himself This is the place where I escape from prison unfasten the fetters and unyoke myself at last He removed the maṇi pearl from his crown and said to his servant Take this pearl and go home to inform my father the king that my present retirement to a distant place is not an inconsiderate departure from home I have done so because I wish to cut off what is impermanent and abandon all that causes pain and distress Chandaka said How can I have the mind to drive the empty carriage home The prince consoled the servant with good words and Chandaka became awakened and returned home On the east of the stupa where the carriage was sent home there is a jambu tree whose branches and leaves have withered but the decayed trunk is still there Beside the tree is a small stupa marking the place where the prince changed his remaining precious garments for a deerskin robe Although he had already cut off his hair changed his clothes and taken off his pearl necklace the prince still had his royal robe with him He thought This robe is too luxurious what shall I do for a change  At that moment a heavenly being of uddhavāsa appeared as a hunter wearing a deerskin robe holding a bow and carrying some arrows The prince holding out his robe said to the hunter I wish to exchange this for yours Will you kindly consent The hunter agreed The prince then took off his upper garment and handed it to the hunter who resumed his heavenly form and ew away through the air with the garment he had bartered Not far away from the place where Prince Siddhārtha changed his clothes is a stupa built by King Aśoka at the spot where the prince had his hair shaved off The prince asked for a razor from Chandaka and cut off his own locks which Indra received and brought to his heavenly palace for worship At that time a celestial being of the Heaven of Pure Abode appeared as a barber approaching slowly with a razor in his hand The prince asked him Can you shave my head Please give me the tonsure Accordingly the transformed gure shaved his head Some say it was when the Bodhisattva was nineteen years old others say he was twentynine years old at the time It is said that Prince Siddhārtha renounced home on the eighth day of the second half of the month of Vaiśākha corresponding to the eighth day of the third month of our calendar or that it was on the fteenth day of the second half of the month of Vaiśākha corresponding to the fteenth day of the third month of our calendar From the stupa where the prince had his head shaved going southeast for one hundred eighty or ninety li through a wilderness I reached a banyan grove in which there is a stupa over thirty feet high When the Tathāgata entered nirvana and his relics were distributed the brahmans who had not obtained a share of the relics collected the ashes and charcoal from the ground of the niṣṭapana and brought them home they built this holy reliquary for worship Since then it has manifested many miracls and most of the sick people who have prayed for recovery here have received a response In the old monastery beside the ash and charcoal stupa are places where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down On both sides of the old monastery are several hundred stupas among which a large one was built by King Aśoka Although its lofty foundation has collapsed it is still over one hundred feet in height From here going northeast I proceeded through a great forest along a rough and dangerous road with perilous obstacles all along the way Mountain oxen and wild elephants as well as brigands and hunters watch for travelers and constantly do harm to them Coming out of this forest I reached the country of Kuśinagara in the domain of Central India The city wall of the capital of the country of Kuśinagara is in ruins and the towns and villages are deserted The brick foundations of the city wall are more than ten li in circuit there are very few inhabitants and the streets and lanes are in desolation At the northeast corner of the original city is a stupa built by King Aśoka at the old residence of Cunda formerly mistranscribed as Xuntuo In the residence there is a well that was dug at the time when a meal was prepared for the Buddha Although the well has been there for many long years the water is still clear and sweet At a place three or four li to the northwest of the city I crossed the Ajitavatī River Unsurpassed the name in common use mistaken for the Airāvatī River in olden times in the texts it is known as Hiraṇyavatī Possessing Gold River Not far from the west bank of the river is āla Grove The śāla tree is similar to an oak with a greenishwhite bark and very glossy leaves Four of the trees in the grove are unusually tall and mark the place where the Tathāgata entered nirvana In a large brick temple there is a statue of the Tathāgata in the posture of entering nirvana lying down with his head toward the north Beside the temple is a stupa built by King Aśoka Although the foundation has collapsed it is still over two hundred feet high In front of it is a stone pillar on which is inscribed a a record of the event of the Tathāgatas nirvana but no date is mentioned in the record It is said in previous record however that the Buddha entered parinirvāṇa at the age of eighty on the fteenth day of the second half of the month of Vaiśākha corresponding to the fteenth day of the third month in our calendar According to the tradition of the Sarvāstivāda school the Buddha entered parinirvāṇa on the eighth day of the second half of the month of Kārttika corresponding to the eighth day of the ninth month in our calendar The different schools hold variant views concerning the time elapsed since the Buddhas nirvana some say it has been more than one thousand two hundred years others say one thousand three hundred or one thousand ve hundred or more than nine hundred but less than one thousand Not far from the temple is a stupa marking the place where the Tathāgata put out a re when in a previous life in the course of cultivating the bodhisattva deeds he was born as a pheasant There once was a great forest at this place and the animals and birds lived in caves and nests One day a gale blew hard just as a re broke out and burned ercely A pheasant having pity on the other creatures apped its wings in a stream and ew up into the air to sprinkle water over the re At that moment Indra lowered his head and said to the pheasant Why are you so foolishly working so hard with your wings to no avail The great re has just broken out and the whole forest is ablaze The re burns ercely I cannot talk with you any more The bird then ew vigorously to the stream to fetch more water Indra then scooped up water with his hands and sprinkled it over the forest The re was quenched the smoke vanished and the animals were saved from the ames Therefore it is called the Stupa of Fireghting Not far from the place where the pheasant put out a re is a stupa marking the spot where the Tathāgata born as a deer in a previous life when in the course of cultivating the bodhisattva deeds saved creatures In the remote past there was a great forest at this place A conagration spread in the wilderness and the birds and animals were trapped and in a dangerous plight with the impediments of a rapid stream in front and a violent re pressing hard from the back A few of them were not drowned in the stream and escaped death A deer having pity on the other animals strained itself to stretch its body across the stream in order to save the others from drowning Despite the pain caused by its injured skin and broken bones the deer endured its fatigue and pain until the last animal a lame hare had crossed over and been rescued Exhausted the deer fell into the stream and drowned The heavenly beings collected its carcass and built a stupa for it Not far to the west of the place where the deer rescued creatures from drowning is a stupa marking the spot where Subhadra known as Shanxian Good Sage formerly mistranscribed as Subatuoluo entered nirvana Subha dra originally a brahmanical teacher was a wise man of one hundred and twenty years of age When he heard that the Buddha was about to enter nirvana he came to the twin trees and asked nanda As the Buddha the Worldhonored One is about to enter nirvana may I ask him to solve the doubts I have in my mind nanda said The Buddha is about to enter nirvana please do not disturb him said I have heard that we rarely have a chance to be born at a time when a buddha is living in the world and that we cannot often hear the right Dharma I am afraid I will have no one else to resolve my deep doubts Subhadra then came into the Buddhas presence and asked him There are different groups of selfstyled teachers who have variant Dharmas to guide the world here below Do you know them all Gautama formerly known as Qutan in an erroneous and abridged form The Buddha said I have made a profound study of them all and he then gave a description  After having heard the Buddhas words Subhadra puried his mind with faith and understanding and asked for permission to become a fully ordained Buddhist monk The Tathāgata asked him Are you able to become a Buddhist monk The heterodox disciples who wish to lead the life of purity have to go through probation for four years during which their demeanor and character are observed If they are found to be quiet in behavior and honest in speech they can then be admitted into my order to lead a life of purity Through four years probation the three sorts of deeds may be straightened in good order The Buddha said As I have already said it all depends on ones effort Subhadra then became a monk and received full ordination A moment later he cleared his mind of doubts concerning the Dharma and tried to achieve personal realization Shortly after dusk he actually attained arhatship with all the passions extirpated and the pure life established Because he could not bear seeing the Buddha enter mahānirvāṇa he entered the samādhi of the element of re and manifested supernatural powers and then he hinself entered nirvana before the Buddha He became the Tathāgatas last disciple but died before him In a previous life Subhadra was the lame hare the last animal to be rescued  Beside the spot where Subhadra entered nirvana is a stupa at the place where Vajrapāṇi fell into a swoon The great sympathetic Worldhonored One having completed his task of edifying living beings according to their capacities and for their benet entered the blissful state of nirvana at the twin trees lying down with his head toward the north The deity Vajrapāṇi the warrior Guhyapati  having seen the Buddha enter nirvana cried sorrowfully The Tathāgata has forsaken me and entered mahānirvāṇa I have no place in which to take refuge and no one to protect me It is just as if a poisoned arrow has deeply struck me and a re of distress ercely burns me He dropped his diamond club and fell into a swoon After a long while he stood up and said to the others In the great sea of birth and death who will be our boat and oars In the long night of ignorance who will be our lamp and torch Beside the place where Vajrapāṇi fell into a swoon there is a stupa where the Tathāgata were venerated for seven days after his nirvana When the Tathāgata was about to enter nirvana a bright light shone everywhere and human and heavenly beings gathered together in grief They said to one another The great enlightened Worldhonored One is now about to enter nirvana Living beings will come to the end of blessedness and the world will have no one on whom to depend The Tathāgata lying on his right side on a lion bed told the gathering Do not say that the Tathāgata has eventually entered nirvana as the dharma body is immutable and free from all changes You should ward off indolence and try to gain liberation as quickly as possible The bhikṣus and others wept sadly At that time Aniruddha told the bhikṣus Stop stop Grieve no more The heavenly beings will reproach you and ridicule you After the Malla people had made offerings to the remains they wished to carry the golden cofn to the fumeral ghat for burning Aniruddha said to them Wait a moment The heavenly beings wish to keep it here for seven days in order to make offerings to it The heavenly beings holding exquisite celestial owers ew through the air and chanted praise of the Buddhas holy virtues Beside the place where the cofn was lodged is a stupa at the place where Lady Mahāmāyā lamented the Buddhas demise After the Tathāgata had entered nirvana and his remains had been laid in the cofn Aniruddha ascended to the heaven to inform Lady Mahāmāyā saying The great holy King of the Dharma has entered nirvana Hearing this news Mahāmāyā was choked with sobs and fainted she went with the heavenly beings to the twin trees where she saw saṃghāṭi  almsbowl and pewter staff She stroked these articles weeping piteously until she fainted again and when she regained her voice she said Human and heavenly beings have come to the end of their blessedness and the Eye of the World has disappeared Now these things are without an owner By the Tathāgatas saintly power the cofn opened by itself The Buddha emitted a bright light sat up with his hands joined palm to palm and consoled his compassionate mother for having come down from a far distance  saying Such is the law of all things Please do not be overwhelmed by excessive grief With a sorrowful mind nanda asked the Buddha What shall I say when people in the future ask me about todays events You may say that after the Buddhas nirvana his compassionate mother came down from the heavenly palace to the twin trees As a lesson to unlial people the Tathāgata sat up in the golden cofn and preached the Dharma with his hands joined palm to palm More than three hundred paces across the river at the north of the city there was a stupa at the place where the Tathāgatas body was cremated The earth is a dark yellow color and the soil is mixed with ashes and charcoal If one prays earnestly he may obtain śarīras at this place When the people distributed the śarīras they found that the hair and nails were neatly intact Beside the place of cremation is the spot where the Tathāgata showed his feet to Mahākāśyapa After the Tathāgatas cofn had been laid down and the pyre of fragrant wood had already been piled up it could not be kindled to the astonishment of the assembly Aniruddha said It is merely waiting for Kāśyapa At that moment Mahākāśyapa and his ve hundred disciples came from the mountains to the city of Kuśinagara and he asked nanda May I have a look at the Worldhonored One nanda said His body is wrapped in a thousand layers of cotton cloth and laid in a double cofn and fragrant wood has already been piled up for the cremation At that time the body of the Tathāgata lying in the cofn stretched out its feet When Kāśyapa noticed that the wheel sign on the soles of the Buddhas feet had a strange color he asked nanda Why is this so said At the moment when the Buddha entered nirvana human and heavenly beings wept piteously and their tears dyed his soles this strange color Then Kāśyapa paid homage to the cofn by circumambulating it while chanting praises  and the fragrant wood spontaneously burst into huge ames Thus after his nirvana the Tathāgata thrice appeared from his cofn rst he stretched his arm to ask nanda to repair the road second he sat up to preach the Dharma for his mother and last he showed his feet to Mahākāśyapa Beside the spot where the Buddha showed his feet is a stupa built by King Aśoka at the place where the eight kings shared the relics In front of the stupa is a stone pillar on which the event is inscribed After the Buddhas body was cremated after his nirvana the kings of eight countries arrived with their four divisions of troops and dispatched the straightnatured brahman to tell the Mallas of Kuśinagara As the teacher of human and heavenly beings has entered nirvana in this country we have come here from afar to share his relics The Mallas said The Tathāgata was in our country when we were bereaved of the Guide of the World and lost the father of living beings so naturally we should keep the relics of the Tathāgata for worship You will receive nothing despite the weariness you endured on your journey Since the kings solicitation was not granted they said again If you do not comply with our polite request we wil consider using force The straightnatured brahman warned them Just think it over The great sympathetic Worldhonored One patiently cultivated blessedness and good deeds for numerous kalpas in the past I think that all of you have heard this It is inappropriate for you to ght each other Since the relics are in this country they should be divided into eight equal portions and each of you can have a share for worship What is the use of resorting to force The Mallas listened to his words but when they were about to divide the relics into eight equal portions Indra said to the kings The heavenly beings also have a right to share a portion of the relics Do not compete for a share on the strength of your might Then the nāga kings Anavatapta Mucilinda and Elāpattra also made a proposal saying Do not forget about us As far as strength is concerned none of you is our equal The straightnatured brahman said Do not quarrel We should all share the relics The relics were then divided into three portions one for the heavenly beings one for the nāgas and one for the human world and the third portion was further subdivided into eight parts and allotted to the eight kings The heavenly beings nāgas and kings were all deeply moved Going southwest for more than two hundred li from the stupa of the division of the relics I reached a great town There was a brahman of enormous wealth who was quite different from other brahmans He was learned in the ve vidyās and venerated the Triple Gem Whenever monks traveled by way of this monastery he always earnestly invited them to stay and receive offerings for one night or up to seven days Later when King aśāṅka persecuted the buddhadharma no groups of monks came this way for many years and the brahman regretfully cherished the memory of them One day he was taking a walk and saw a śrāmaṇa with heavy eyebrows and white hair approaching with a pewter staff in hand He hurried to greet the monk and inquired where he had come from and where he was going and invited him to the monastery to receive various kinds of offerings The following morning he offered the monk some gruel cooked in pure milk As soon as the monk tasted the gruel he put down the bowl and sighed heavily The brahman who was serving the monk with food knelt down and said You grant benet to the people according to circumstances and have come to favor me with your presence Did you not sleep well last night Or is the gruel unpalatable The monk said with regret I am sorry that the blessedness of living beings is decreasing I shall tell you something after the meal When breakfast was over the monk tidied his robe and made ready to depart The brahman said You promised that you would say something It might cause suspicion If you insist on hearing what I have to say I shall tell you in brief I sighed not because I disliked the gruel but because for several hundred years I have not tasted such a avor When the Tathāgata was living in the world I used to follow him serving as an attendant at Jetavana Temple in the city of Rājagṛha to wash his eating bowl in a pure stream I also bathed rinsed my mouth and washed my hands and face  What a pity that the pure milk of today is less tasty than the plain water of yore This is because the blessedness of human and heavenly beings is decreasing The brahman said In that case great virtuous one you must have seen the Buddha in person The monk said Yes Have you heard about Rāhula the son of the Buddha I am Rāhula In order to protect the right Dharma I did not enter nirvana Having said this the monk suddenly disappeared The brahman then daubed the room where the monk had spent the night with incense and swept it clean An image of the monk was installed in the room in a solemn manner and was worshiped just as if the monk was present Going through a great forest for more than ve hundred li I reached the country of Bārāṇasī formerly called the country of Boluonai by mistake in the domain of Central India End of Fascicle VI of The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions Five Countries from Bārāṇasī to Nepāla The country of Bārāṇasī is more than four thousand li in circuit and the capital city with the Ganges River on the west is eighteen or nineteen li long and ve or six li wide The inhabitants are enormously wealthy and their houses are full of valuable goods The people are mild and courteous in nature and esteem learning by custom Most of them believe in heretical theories and few people venerate the buddhadharma The climate is temperate and the cereal crops are abundant The fruit trees grow luxuriantly and the vegetation is rich There are over thirty monasteries with more than three thousand monks all of whom study the teachings of the Hinayana Saṃmitīya school There are more than one hundred deva temples with over ten thousand heretical followers Most of them worship Maheśvara Some of them cut their hair while others keep it in a topknot They go naked without any dress and smear their bodies with ash They rigorously practice austerities seeking freedom from birth and death Inside the great city there are twenty deva temples of which the sanctuaries are built with carved stone and ornamental wood on terraces arranged in tiers Luxuriant trees cast shade over each other and clear streams ow throughout There is a brass statue of the deity less than one hundred feet tall depicted in a solemn manner with a stately appearance as if it were alive To the northeast of the great city and on the west bank of the Varaṇā River is a stupa more than one hundred feet high that was built by King Aśoka In front of it is a pillar of green stone as smooth as a mirror and the Tathāgatas image is often visible on the lustrous surface Going to the northeast of the Varaṇā River for more than ten li I reached Deer Park Monastery which consists of eight divisions all within one enclosing wall There are lofty halls and storied pavilions most splendidly constructed with one thousand ve hundred monks all of whom study the teachings of the Hinayana Saṃmitīya school Within the great enclosure there is a temple over two hundred feet high with a gilt āmra fruit carved in relief on top The foundation and steps are made of stone while the niches arranged in rows are of brick Around the niches there are one hundred steps and in each niche is enshrined a gilt image of the Buddha Inside the temple there is a lifesize brass image of the Buddha in the posture of turning the wheel of the Dharma To the northeast of the temple is a stone stupa built by King Aśoka Although the foundation has collapsed the remaining trunk is still one hundred feet high In front is a stone pillar more than seventy feet tall as smooth as jade and as reective as a mirror With earnest prayer one may see various shadowy pictures in the surface and sometimes good or evil omens can also be seen This was the place where the Tathāgata after having attained full enlightenment rst turned the wheel of the Dharma Not far from here a stupa marks the spot where jñātaKauṇḍinya and the others went when they saw that the Bodhisattva had abandoned the practice of austerities They refused to be his attendants and guards and came to this place to practice meditation by themselves The stupa beside it was the place where ve hundred pratyekabuddhas entered nirvana together There are also three other stupas marking sites where the three past buddhas sat and walked up and down The stupa located beside the place where the three past buddhas walked up and down marks the spot where Maitreya being a surname meaning Compassion in Chinese formerly called Mile in erroneous abbreviation Bodhisattva received the prediction of his attainment of buddhahood Once on Vulture Peak near the city of Rājagṛha the Tathāgata told the bhikṣus In the future when the human life span will be eighty thousand years there will be in this at land of Jambudvīpa a son of a brahman of the Maitreya family with a goldencolored body shining brightly He will relinquish his home to achieve full enlightenment and preach the Dharma widely for the living beings in three assemblies Those who will be saved by him are beings who have cultivated the deeds of blessedness according to the teachings I will have left to them Beacuse they deeply and wholeheartedly venerate the Triple Gem they will receive edication and guidance and attain sainthood and emancipation whether they are laypeople or monks and whether they observe or violate the disciplinary rules In the three preaching assemblies those who have followed my bequeathed Dharma will be saved rst and then good friends who have the cause to be saved will be edied When Maitreya Bodhisattva heard what the Buddha had said he stood up from his seat and said to the Buddha I wish to be that Maitreya the Worldhonored One The Tathāgata told him As you have said you will achieve that fruit What I have said above is intended for your edication To the west of the place where Maitreya Bodhisattva received his prediction is a stupa marking the spot where ākya Bodhisattva received his prophecy At the time when the human life span was twenty thousand years in the bhadra kalpa Kāśyapa Buddha emerged in the world and turned the wonderful wheel of the Dharma to edify living beings He prophesied the future of Prabhā pāla Bodhisattva saying This bodhisattva will become a buddha with the name of ākyamuni in the future when the human life span is one hundred years Not far to the south of the place where ākya Bodhisattva received his prediction is a site where the four past buddhas walked up and down It is over fty paces long and about seven feet high built of piliedup bluestone on which there is an image of the Tathāgata in the posture of walking It is unusually exquisite with an appearance of solemnity and with a tuft of hair specially growing on the eshy protuberance Inside the enclosure there are numerous sacred sites and the temples and stupas number in the several hundreds I have only cited two or three of them it is difcult for me to give a detailed description of them all To the west of the enclosure of the monastery is a pond of pure water more than two hundred paces in circuit in which the Tathāgata often bathed Further to the west is another big pond one hundred eighty paces in circuit where the Tathāgata used to wash his almsbowl Further to the north is a pond one hundred fty paces in circuit where the Tathāgata used to wash his robes There are dragons living in all three ponds The water is deep and tastes sweet It is clear and limpid neither increasing nor decreasing If one washes in these ponds with an arrogant mind he will usually be harmed by a kumbhīra  but it is safe for one to use the water with a mind of deep respect Beside the pond for washing robes is a big square rock on which are the traces of the Tathāgatas robes with the lines as distinct as if they were carved Pure believers often come here to make offerings If heretics and evil people tread contemptuously on the rock the dragon king in the pond raises a storm Not far from the pond is a stupa at the place where the Tathāgata in the course of practicing the deeds of a bodhisattva was a sixtusked elephant king A hunter who wished to obtain its tusks disguised himself in a monks robe and drew his bow to kill the elephant Out of respect for the robe the elephant king extracted its tusks and gave them to the hunter Not far from the place of the tusk extraction is a stupa at the place where the Tathāgata in the course of practicing the deeds of a bodhisattva manifested as a bird Out of pity for the lack of kindness in the world he asked a monkey and a white elephant which of them was the rst to see the banyan tree under which they were sitting Each gave an account and according to their statements who was senior and who was junior was established Their inuence gradually spread far and near and the people began to know the order of superiority and inferiority and both monks and laypeople followed their example Not far away is a great forest in which there is a stupa at the spot where in the past the Tathāgata and Devadatta both as deer kings settled a dispute Formerly in this great forest there were two herds of deer each of which had more than ve hundred animals The king of this country once came to hunt in the plain and marshland The Bodhisattva deer king came forward and said to the king Your Majesty is hunting with stout dogs in the plain using burning torches and ying arrows All my followers will lose their lives this morning and in a few days will become putrid and stinking and will be unt for food I wish to supply you with a live deer every day in rotation so that you may have fresh venison and my followers will be able to lengthen their lives to some extent The king pleased by these words turned back his carriage Thus each of the two herds provided the king with a deer on alternate days When it was her turn to be killed she said to the king of her herd Although it is my turn to die my child has nothing to do with this The deer king Devadatta said angrily Who does not value his life The doe remarked sighing Our king is not kindly and I may die at any moment So she asked for emergency help from the Bodhisattva deer king The Bodhisattva said How compassionate is the mind of a benign mother showing kindness to her child that has not yet taken shape I shall go in your place Then he went to the gate of the kings palace and the people in the street exclaimed The great deer king has entered the town The ofcials and common people in the capital rushed out to have a look When the king heard about this he did not believe it but after the doorkeeper informed the king he understood that it was true and said Deer king why have you come here so abruptly The deer said A doe was going to die in her turn but she is about to give birth to a fawn and I cannot bear the sight of her death I venture to substitute myself for her Hearing this the king said with a sigh I am a human being in form but I behave like a deer and you are a deer yet you have the heart of a human being The king then set free all the deer and asked for no more sacrices from them The forest was allotted as a preserve for the deer and therefore was called the Forest Given to the Deer hence the name Deer Park Two or three li to the southwest of the monastery is a stupa more than three hundred feet high The base of the stupa is broad and high and it is adorned with rare and brilliant valuables There are no niches arranged in rows but instead a dome in the shape of an inverted almsbowl was constructed on the base Although a stone emblematic pillar was erected it has no decorative wheels or bells Beside it is a small stupa built at the place where the ve people jñātaKauṇḍinya and the others gave up their restraint and greeted the Buddha When Prince Sarvārthasiddha known as Yiqie yicheng Accomplishment of All Purposes in Chinese formerly called Xidaduo in erroneous abbreviation crossed over the city wall to live in seclusion in the mountains and valleys forgetting about himself to seek the Dharma King uddho dana gave orders to three clanspeople and two relatives saying My son Sarvārthasiddha has left home to pursue his studies and is traveling alone in the mountains and marshlands sojourning in woods and forests I order you to follow him so I will know where he is staying Inwardly you are his paternal and maternal uncles but outwardly he is your lord and you are his subjects You should know what to do in whatever circumstances Under the kings order the ve men served the prince as his guards and at the same time they also sought the way of emancipation They often discussed among themselves whether they should cultivate the way to attain liberation by practicing asceticism or by living in a pleasant manner Two of them said that one should cultivate the way in comfort while the other three held that one should cultivate the way in an arduous ascetic manner They argued about the matter without coming to a clear decision The prince pondered the ultimate truth and in order to convince the heretics who led a life of severe hardship he took only gruel to sustain his life Seeing this the two men said What the prince is doing is not the true Dharma The way is something that should be realized in a comfortable manner After practicing asceticism for six years the prince did not achieve enlightenment and wishing to prove that asceticism was not the true method he accepted milk gruel and attained the fruit of sainthood Hearing this the three men said with a sigh At the last moment to gain success he has retrogressed All the effort he put forth in practicing asceticism for six years is abandoned in a single day Then they went together to visit the two men who had left before When they saw one another having seated themselves they started to talk bombastically saying Formerly we saw that Prince Sarvārthasiddha left the palace and went to the wilds he took off his precious garments and put on a deerskin working hard and persevering to seek the deep and wonderful Dharma wholeheartedly and painstakingly in order to win the supreme fruit of sainthood But now he has accepted milk gruel offered by some milkmaids and is morally ruined contrary to his original intention We know all about this but we could do nothing The two men said How is it that you see it so late He is merely a capricious person When he was living in the palace with honor and dignity he could not keep his mind in peace but went far away to the forests and he abandoned his position as universal monarch to lead the life of a low and vulgar person Why should we remember him The mention of him merely distresses us After having bathed in the Nairañjanā River the Tathāgata sat under the bodhi tree and attained full enlightenment and the title Teacher of Gods and Humans He sat quietly meditating on who should be converted by him thinking Udraka Rāmaputra who has achieved the mental state of no thought and no nonthought  is competent to receive the wonderful Dharma The heavenly beings in the air said in reply Udraka Rāmaputra passed away seven days ago The Tathāgata regretted that he had not been able to meet that man who had died suddenly and so could not hear the wonderful Dharma He again observed the world in search of a suitable man and recollected rāḍakālāma who had achieved the mental state of nothingness  to whom he should impart the ultimate truth The heavenly beings again said He has been dead ve days The Tathāgata regretted once more and had pity on that man for not having had the good luck to hear the Dharma He again pondered the matter of to whom he should impart his teachings and found that no others but the ve men at Deer Park should be taught rst At that time the Tathāgata rose from his seat under the bodhi tree and repaired to Deer Park His deportment was quiet and calm and he gave off a dazzling divine light His white eyebrows had the luster of jade and his body was of the color of genuine gold He proceeded with composure in order to instruct the ve men When they saw the Tathāgata coming from a distance they said among themselves The man who is coming is Sarvārthasiddha Even after such a long time he has not achieved the fruit of sainthood He must have given up what he expected in his mind and so he has come to look for us We should remain silent and not stand up to greet or salute him As the Tathāgata approached them his divine inuence affected them all and the ve men forgetting their restraint saluted him with greetings and waited upon him according to etiquette The Tathāgata gradually taught them the ultimate truth and at the conclusion of the summer retreat during the rainy season they attained the fruit of sainthood Going to the east of Deer Park for two or three li I came to a stupa beside which was a driedup pond more than eighty paces in circumference with the name Lifesaving Pond or Heros Pond I heard the local people say that several hundred years ago there was a hermit living in seclusion in a hut beside the pond He was learned in arts and crafts and had thoroughly mastered the divine principles and was able to turn rubble into gems and interchange the forms of humans and animals But he could not ride on the wind and clouds to accompany the spirits so he searched into ancient books for the art of becoming a spirit It was said in the method The art of the spirits is the art of longevity One who wishes to learn it should rst of all make up ones mind An altar should be built more than ten feet in circumference Ask a hero of outstanding truthfulness and bravery to hold a long knife and stand at a corner of the altar holding his breath and keeping silent from dusk to the next morning One who seeks to be a spirit should sit at the center of the altar while putting his hand on a long knife repeating an incantation with a concentrated mind neither seeing nor hearing anything Before dawn he will become a spirit and the sharp knife will turn into a precious sword Wielding his sword as a commander he will obtain whatever he desires and never become old or feeble or suffer illness or death Having acquired the method of becoming a spirit the hermit began looking for a hero but for a year he could not nd a suitable person to his satisfaction Later he met a man in the town wailing piteously as he walked along the road Seeing him the hermit was pleased with his features and asked him sympathetically why he was so sorrowful The man said I am a poor man and I worked as a servant to sustain myself My employer was appreciative of my ability and had condence in me He promised to pay me good wages if I served him for ve years Thus I toiled diligently and ignored hardships But when the term of ve years was nearly concluded I committed a fault for which not only was I shamefully ogged but I also lost my pay This is why I feel so sorrowful and no one shows me sympathy The hermit asked the man to come with him to the hut and through magical power he produced delicious food  After that he invited him to take a bath in the pond and clothed him in new garments Then he presented him with ve hundred gold coins and said to him When you have spent all the money come again to get more Please dont make a stranger of yourself He presented rich gifts to the man on several occasions with the unspoken intention of winning his heart The hero repeatedly offered to render a service to the hermit as repayment for his kindness The hermit said I sought a hero for a year and I am lucky to have met you as your features answer the description of the ancient books I shall not trouble you with anything else but I do request that you keep silent for one night The hero said I am not afraid even of death to say nothing of keeping silent Then an altar was prepared for the performance of the rite of becoming a spirit They acted in accordance with the method and sat down to wait for dusk After dusk each of them did his duty the hermit repeating the incantation while the hero held the sharp knife At the approach of dawn suddenly shrieked aloud and consequently a re fell from the air and smoke and ames covered the place like a cloud The hermit hastily led the man to seek refuge in the pond and asked him I told you to keep silent so why did you make such a shrill noise The hero said After receiving your instructions I had a nightmare at midnight in which many strange things appeared I saw my former employer coming to make a personal apology to me and out of my deep gratitude to you I refrained from speaking to him Enraged that man killed me and I then existed in the state of intermediate existence between death and reincarnation  I looked back at my own corpse with a sigh of regret and by way of repaying your deep kindness I decided not to speak a word in my future life Then I saw I was reborn to a great brahman family in South India and I never uttered a sound in the course of conception and birth and other painful experiences always bearing in mind the benet and kindnessyou extended to me When I reached the age of schooling became an adult got married lost my parents and begat a son I always remembered your kindness and refrained from speaking All my clanspeople and relatives wondered about me When I was over sixtyve years old my wife said to me You must speak now otherwise I will kill your son Considering that I was getting old in my second life and had only one child I stopped my wife from killing him and thus I uttered that sound The hermit said It is my fault it is a mischief caused by a demon With a feeling of gratitude and regretful for the failure of the event the hero died of chagrin Because the pond prevented the calamity of a conagration it is called Lifesaving Pond and as the hero died there it is also called Heros Pond To the west of Heros Pond is a stupa built in memory of three animals at the spot where the Tathāgata in the course of practicing the deeds of a bodhisattva burned himself At the beginning of the present kalpa there were three animals a fox a hare and an ape who lived harmoniously together in this wild forest At that time Indra wished to test the one who was cultivating the bodhisattva deeds and transformed himself into an old man He said to the three animals Are the three of you living in peace and without fear The animals said We tread on rich grass and frolic in the luxuriant wood Although we are of different species we enjoy ourselves in both safety and happiness The old man said I have heard that the three of you are good friends and on intimate terms so I have come from afar to look for you despite my old age and fatigue Now I am hungry what can you give me to eat The animals said Please wait a moment We shall go get something for you So each modestly went away on different paths with the same purpose of seeking for some edibles The fox caught a carp by the riverside while the ape plucked some strange owers and fruit in the wood They came back together to offer their ndings to the old man but the hare returned emptyhanded frisking about the old man The old man said As far as I can see you are not living in harmony The ape and fox had the same purpose and worked with one mind but the hare came back emptyhanded and has nothing to give me From this I can understand the situation Having heard this derisive remark the hare said to the fox and ape Gather a large amount of rewood I am going to do something The fox and ape went speedily to gather hay and haul wood and when they had piled up a huge heap of fuel it was ignited into raging ames The hare said Kind sir I am a lower creature and could not get what I wished for I venture to offer my humble body to be served as a meal to you Having said this the hare jumped into the re and died in the ames At that time the old man resumed his form as Indra and collected the ashes of the hare from among the embers with a long sigh of regret Then he said to the fox and ape Since the event has turned out as it has I am deeply moved by the hares goodheartedness and I shall perpetuate its good deed by sending it to the moon to be known to posterity Therefore the local people say that since then a hare has appeared in the moon People of later times built a stupa at this place From here going east along the Ganges for more than three hundred li I reached the country of Garjanapati  Garja na pati is more than two thousand li in circuit and its capital city which borders the Ganges River is more than ten li in circuit The inhabitants are rich and happy and the towns and villages are close to one another The soil is fertile and farming is done in accordance with the seasons The climate is temperate and the people are simple and honest by social custom and rustic and intrepid by nature They believe in both the wrong and the right religions There are over ten monasteries with less than one thousand monks all of whom follow the Hinayana teachings Deva temples amount to twenty and followers of the different faiths live together In a monastery to the northwest of the great city there is a stupa built by King Aśoka It is said in the Record of India that one liter of the Tathāgatas relic bones is preserved in this stupa In olden times the Tathāgata preached the wonderful Dharma to an assembly of devas and humans for seven days at this place Beside it are sites where the three past buddhas sat and walked up and down In the vicinity of these sites is a statue of Maitreya Bodhisattva Although small in size its divine power is manifest It has latent spirituality and works miracles from time to time Going eastward from the great city for more than two hundred li I reached Aviddhakarṇa Monastery The surrounding wall is not extensive but the decorative sculptures are very exquisite The owers are reected in the ponds and the terraces and the ridges of the pavilions are close to one another The monks are quiet and solemn in deportment and the community lives in an orderly manner I heard some elderly people say that formerly in the country of Tukhāra to the north of the Himalayas there were two or three śramaṇas who took delight in learning and often talked together at leisure times after having done religious service and recitation saying The wonderful principles and abstruse theories cannot be thoroughly mastered through empty words but the holy sites are obvious and discernible and can be visited by making the journey on foot We should inquire of some close friends about the matter and go visit the holy sites in person So the two or three friends holding their pewter staffs in hand started the journey together When they arrived in India they sought out lodgings in a monastery but the local monks despised them as frontiersmen and refused to give them accommodation As they had to stay out in the open air tired and hungry they became thin and pallid and looked haggard At that time the king of that country on a pleasure trip in the suburbs saw the visiting monks He asked them with amazement Mendicants from where and why did you come here Your ears are not pierced and you are dressed in such dirty and shabby robes The śramaṇas said in reply We are from the country of Tukhāra By our common wish we have come to pay homage to the holy sites But it is regrettable to say that due to our deciency in blessedness the Indian monks do not attend to us wayfarers As we have not completed our pilgrimage we wish to return to our native land so we will endure hardships and go home after our desire is fullled Upon hearing these words the king felt pity for the travelers and constructed a monastery at this superior place He wrote down a rule on a piece of white cotton that said It is due to the spiritual protection of the Triple Gem that I am the most honored person in the world and the noblest in rank among all people Since I am a king of people and the Buddha has entrusted me to take care of the religion I shall extend help to all monks in distress This monastery has been constructed exclusively for the entertainment of traveling monks and no monks with pierced ears shall stay in this monastery of mine in the future It is on account of this event that the monastery is called Unpierced Ears Going southeast for more than one hundred li from Aviddhakarṇa Monastery crossing the Ganges River to the south I reached the town of Mahāśāla When they meet Buddhist monks they inquire about their learning and if they nd that the monks are learned they salute them with deep respect At the north of the Ganges there is a Nārāyaṇa temple consisting of storied pavilions and terraces arranged in tiers all beautifully decorated The statues of various devas are carved from stone with the most exquisite craftsmanship Their spiritual efcacy is difcult for me to describe in detail More than thirty li to the east of the Nārāyaṇa temple is a stupa built by King Aśoka A large part of it has collapsed into the ground and in front there is a stone pillar more than twenty feet high with the gure of a lion on top Inscribed on the pillar is a record of the event of subduing demons Formerly there were some demons of the wilderness at this place who relying on their strength ate human esh and blood doing harm to living creatures in a most evil and monstrous manner Out of compassion for the living beings who would die violent deaths the Tathāgata through his supernatural powers induced the demons to take refuge with veneration and taught them to observe the precept of nonkilling The demons accepted the Buddhas teachings and circumambulated him with respect Then they raised a rock for the Buddha to sit on and wished to hear the right Dharma which they protected wholeheartedly Afterward people who did not believe in the buddhadharma tried to push and remove the rock seat set up by the demons but they could not move it even though they numbered in the thousands Around the base of the rock there are luxuriant trees and ponds of clear water and anyone who comes near the place is awestruck Not far from subduing demons there are several monasteries Although they are mostly dilapidated there are still monks  all of whom study and follow the Mahayana teachings Going from here to the southeast for over one hundred li I came to a stupa of which the base has slanted and sunk to one side the remaining part of it is a few scores of feet in height When the Tathāgata entered nirvana and the great kings of eight countries divided his relics the brahman who measured the relics smeared the inside of the measuring bottle with honey from which he made allotments for the kings The brahman returned with the bottle and having obtained the relics that stuck to the inside of the measuring bottle he built this stupa and enshrined the bottle in it Hence it is called  Afterward King Aśoka opened the stupa and took out the relic bottle for which he constructed a great stupa On fast days it often emits a brilliant light Crossing the Ganges at the northeast of this place and going for one hundred forty or fty li I reached the country of Vaiśālī formerly mistranscribed as Pisheli in the domain of Central India The country of Vaiśālī is more than ve thousand li in circuit The soil is fertile and there is an abundance of owers and fruit mango and plantain are plentiful and valuable The climate is temperate and the people are simple and honest by social custom They take delight in doing good works and attach importance to learning and believe in both heterodox and orthodox doctrines There are several hundred monasteries most of which are in ruins with the exception of a few that remain intact and house a few monks There are several tens of deva temples and the heretics live together The sect of the naked adherents ourishes here The city wall of the capital of Vaiśālī has badly collapsed and the original base of the wall is sixty or seventy li in circuit while the palace city is four or ve li in circuit there are few inhabitants Five or six li to the northwest of the palace city is a monastery with very few monks who study the teachings of the Hinayana Saṃmitīya school Beside the monastery is a stupa at the place where the Tathāgata delivered the Vimalakīrtinirdeśasūtra and Ratnā kāra the son of an elder and others offered a sunshade to him To the east is a stupa at the place where āriputra and others attained arhatship To the southeast of the stupa where āriputra attained arhatship is another stupa constructed by the king of Vaiśālī After the Buddhas nirvana a former king of this country obtained a portion of the Buddhas relic bones for which he respectfully constructed this stupa It is said in the Record of India that there was originally one hu of the Tathāgatas relics preserved in this stupa but King Aśoka opened it and took out nine dou of the relics leaving only one dou in the stupa Later another king wished to open the stupa again to get the remaining relics but just as he had just started to do the work there was an earthquake so he dared not open the stupa To the northwest is another stupa built by King Aśoka and beside it is a stone pillar fty or sixty feet tall with the gure of a lion on top To the south of the stone pillar is a tank that was dug by a group of monkeys for the Buddha as he once lived at this place in the old days Not far to the west of the tank is a stupa at the place where the monkeys took the Tathāgatas almsbowl and climbed into a tree to gather honey Not far to the south of the tank is a stupa at the place where the monkeys offered the honey to the Buddha Some gures of monkeys are still preserved at the northwest corner of the tank Three or four li to the northeast of the monastery is a stupa built on the foundation of the old residence of Vimalakīrti known as Stainless Reputation in Chinese formerly translated as Pure Name However pure means stainless and name is equivalent to reputation Although the meaning is the same the name is translated in different ways Formerly it was wrongly transcribed as Weimojie The stupa often reveals spiritual manifestations Not far from here is a deitys house which appears to be built out of piledup bricks but according to tradition it was made out of stone This was the place where Vimalakīrti pretended to be ill and preached the Dharma Not far from here is a stupa built at the place of the old house of Ratnākāra the son of an elder Not far from here is a stupa built at the place of the old house of the woman mra The Buddhas aunt and other bhikṣuṇīs realized nirvana at this place Three or four li to the north of the monastery is a stupa at the place where human and nonhuman beings stood and waited while following the Tathāgata who was proceeding to the country of Kuśinagara to enter parinirvāṇa Next not far to the northwest is another stupa at the place where the Buddha stopped and took a last look at the city of Vaiśālī Not far to the south of this stupa is a temple in front of which is a stupa at the place where mra offered her garden to the Buddha Beside mra Garden is a stupa at the place where the Tathāgata announced the time of his nirvana Formerly the Buddha told nanda at this place One who has achieved the four constituent parts of supernatural power can live for one kalpa Now how long should the Tathāgata live He repeated the question three times but nanda having been stupeed by Māra remained silent and rising from his seat he went to sit quietly in the wood At this moment Māra came to the Buddha and said to him The Tathāgata has been edifying the people in the world for a long time and those who have been saved by you from the round of rebirth are as numerous as grains of dust and sand It is now the time for you to enjoy the bliss of nirvana The Worldhonored One then took up a pinch of soil with his nail and said to Māra Which is more the amount of soil on the earth or that on my ngernail Māra said in reply There is more soil on the earth The Buddha said Those I have converted may be compared to the amount of soil on my nail while those not yet converted are as numerous as the amount of soil of the great earth Nonetheless I shall enter nirvana in three months On hearing this Māra was pleased and departed In the wood nanda had a strange dream and he came to tell the Buddha saying In the wood I dreamed that a big tree with luxuriant branches and leaves casting a dense shade suddenly fell down in a gale Does this indicate that the Worldhonored One intends to enter nirvana My heart is full of fear so I have come to make this inquiry The Buddha said to nanda I told you previously but you were stupeed by Māra and you did not promptly invite me to stay  Māra urged me to enter nirvana soon and I have given him the date That is what your dream presaged Not far from the place where the Buddha announced the time of his entering nirvana is a stupa at the spot where one thousand sons saw their parents Formerly a ṛṣi lived in seclusion in a rocky valley One day in midspring he was rowing a boat in a clear stream and a doe followed him to drink water Through inspiration the doe gave birth to a girl who was exceedingly beautiful but had feet similar to the hooves of a deer Later when she was asked to go get some live coals from another ṛṣis hermitage her steps left traces of lotus owers on the ground The other ṛṣi was deeply surprised by the sight and asked the girl to walk around his hermitage before she would be allowed to get the re The deer girl did so then obtained the re and returned home At that time King Brahmānanda was on a hunting expedition and saw the ower traces Following the traces he found the girl Pleased by her unusual appearance the king carried her back in his carriage A physiognomist foretold that she would give birth to one thousand sons When the other ladies heard the prediction they contrived to take action against her At the end of her period of gestation she gave birth to a lotus ower with one thousand leaves with one son sitting on each of the leaves The other ladies criticized her and saying that it was an inauspicious object they threw it into the Ganges River to be carried away by the current King Ujjayana out on a sightseeing trip in the lower reaches of the river saw a yellow canopy embroidered with a pattern of clouds owing down the river He took it up and found one thousand sons wrapped in it He fed them with milk and raised them into men of great strength With the help of these one thousand sons the king expanded his kingdom to the four quarters and he was about to encroach on this country with his triumphant army When King Brahmānanda heard the news he was shocked and fearful and knowing his troops were not strong enough to offer resistance he was at his wits end At that time the deer woman knowing that the invaders were her sons said to King  Now the invaders are approaching our territory and have caused disunity among us I your unworthy wife with a mind of loyalty can defeat these strong enemies But the king did not believe her and she was deeply worried and fearful Then the deer woman went up to the tower of the city gate to wait for the arrival of the invaders Her one thousand sons commanding their troops besieged the city The deer woman told them Do not do unlial things I am your mother and you are my sons The one thousand sons said How absurd are your words But the deer woman pressed her breasts and milk owed out and forked into one thousand streams and because of the ties of consanguinity the milk owed into the mouths of the one thousand sons Recognizing their mother they took off their armor and after disbanding their troops they returned to their own country The two countries restored friendly relations and the people lived in peace and happiness Not far from the place where the one thousand sons recognized their mother is a stupa at the old site where the Tathāgata walked up and down while he pointed at the place and told the assembly Formerly at this place I recognized my mother If you wish to know who were the thousand sons they are the one thousand buddhas of the bhadrakalpa To the east of the place where related his past life is an old foundation on which there is a stupa that often emits a brilliant light and sometimes answers the entreaties of prayers Not far from the lecture hall is a stupa in which are preserved the remains of half of nandas body Not far from this stupa there are several hundred stupas whose exact number is unknown this is the place where one thousand pratyekabuddhas entered nirvana There are numerous holy sites in and around the city of Vaiśālī and it is difcult to describe them all in detail The old ruins at commanding positions stand with each other like the scales of a sh but through the passage of time and the change of hot and cold seasons the woods have withered away and the ponds have dried up leaving behind decayed trees to bear testimony  Going to the northwest for fty or sixty li from the great city I reached a great stupa at the place where the Licchavis formerly mistranscribed as Lichezi bade farewell to the Tathāgata When the Tathāgata was proceeding to the country of Kuśinagara from the city of Vaiśālī the Licchavis having heard that the Buddha was about to enter nirvana went to see him off wailing piteously Seeing that their sorrow was so deep as to be inconsolable by words the Worldhonored One produced through his supernatural powers a big river with steep banks and a rapid current The Licchavis crying bitterly were thus prevented from following him any further The Tathāgata left his almsbowl as a memento for them Less than two hundred li to the northwest of the city of Vaiśālī is an old city that has been desolate for many years and has few inhabitants In the city there is a stupa at the place where the Buddha told an assembly of various bodhisattvas and human and heavenly beings about cultivating bodhisattva deeds in his past lives He was once a universal monarch named Mahādeva  in this city possessing the seven treasures and competently ruling over the four continents of the world But after witnessing the phenomenon of changeability and realizing the principle of impermanence he cherished a high ambition and renounced the throne He abandoned his country to become a monk and donned the dyed robe to pursue learning Going southeast for fourteen or fteen li from the city I reached a great stupa at the place where seven hundred sages and saints convened the Second Council One hundred and ten years after the Buddhas nirvana some bhikṣus in the city of Vaiśālī deviated from the buddhadharma and observed the disciplinary rules in an erroneous way At that time Elder Yaśoda was residing in Kosala Elder Sambhoga in Mathurā Elder Revata in Hanruo Elder Sālha in Vaiśālī and Elder Kubjaśobhita in Pāṭaliputra All these great arhats had gained mental liberation mastered the Tripiṭaka and possessed the three clear insights they had great reputations and were well known to all as disciples of Venerable nanda At that time Yaśoda sent a messenger to invite various sages and saints to meet in the city of Vaiśālī The number of those who attended the meeting amounted to seven hundred less one Kubjaśobhita then saw with his clairvoyance that various sages and saints were assembled to discuss matters concerning the Dharma and he came to the assembly through his supernatural power of ubiquity Consider with respect Although the great holy King of the Dharma entered nirvana as an expedient many years ago his oral teachings still exist Some negligent bhikṣus in the city of Vaiśālī observe the disciplinary rules erroneously and have raised ten points that are contrary to the teachings of the Buddha who possessed the ten powers Now you sages are conversant with the observance and violation of the disciplinary rules and all of you have studied under the instruction of Bhadanta nanda For the sake of repaying the Buddhas kindness you should reiterate his holy decrees No one among the great saints was not moved to tears They summoned the faulty bhikṣus and in accordance with the Vinaya regulations they reproached them and stopped their misdeeds Thus the wrong practices ended and the holy teachings were claried Going south for eighty or ninety li from the place where the seven hundred sages and saints held a meeting I came to vetapura Monastery which consisted of many lofty buildings and magnicent pavilions The monks are pure and solemn in manner and they all study Mahayana teachings Beside it are old sites where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down The stupa beside it was built by King Aśoka at the place where the Tathāgata halted to rest on his way to the country of Magadha in the south and looked back at the city of Vaiśālī in the north More than thirty li away to the south of vetapura Monastery there are two stupas one built on the southern bank and the other on the northern bank of the Ganges River This was the place where Venerable nanda divided his bodily relics between two countries nanda was a cousin of the Tathāgata and was a man of wide learning and comprehensive intelligence who had an extensive range of knowledge and a retentive memory After the Buddhas demise he succeeded Mahākāśyapa in upholding the right Dharma and guiding the learners Once when he was taking a walk in a wood in the country of Magadha he saw a novice reciting the scriptures incorrectly with passages and sentences in disorder and the wording in confusion Having heard the recitation nanda recalled the Buddha with a deep feeling of sorrow and went slowly to the novice to point out his mistakes The novice said with a smile Great Virtuous One you have become senile and whatb you say is wrong My teacher is a wise man in the prime of life I have personally learned from him and there is no mistake in his instructions nanda withdrew quietly with a sigh saying Even though I am getting old I still wish to live longer to uphold the right Dharma for the benet of living beings But living beings are laden with delement and are difcult to admonish It is useless for me to live any longer While nanda was crossing the Ganges in a boat sailing midstream the king of Magadha heard that nanda was going away and out of deep affection and in admiration of his virtue he urgently dispatched his military carriages to go quickly in pursuit of him Hundreds and thousands of troops camped on the southern bank the king of Vaiśālī feeling both grief and joy at the news that nanda was coming  also sent his troops to march speedily to welcome him Hundreds and thousands of soldiers were stationed on the northern bank The two armies faced each other and obscured the sun Fearing that they might start a war and kill each other nanda ascended into the air from the boat and entered nirvana amid the manifestation of supernatural powers A re burned his body which fell down in two parts one dropping on the southern bank and the other on the northern bank So each of the two kings obtained a portion of the relics as their armies wept sorrowfully After returning to their respective countries they erected stupas to pay homage to the relics Going from here to the northeast for more than ve hundred li I reached the country of Vṛji called by the northerners the country of Saṃvṛji in the domain of North India The country of Vṛji is more than four thousand li in circuit long from east to west and narrow from south to north The soil is fertile and abounds in owers and fruit The climate is somewhat cold and the people are impetuous by nature Most of them venerate the heretics and a few believe in the buddhadharma There are over ten monasteries with less than a thousand monks who study both the Mahayana and Hinayana teachings There are several tens of deva temples with a great number of heretics The capital city of the country is called Cañśuma of which the greater part is in ruins Inside the old palace city there are still more than three thousand families of inhabitants living together like in a village or town To the northeast of a big river there is a monastery with a few monks who are pure and lofty in learning West of here there is a stupa more than thirty feet high on the bank of the river which ows like a belt to the south This was the place where with his great compassion the Buddha once converted some shermen In the distant past at the time of the Buddha there were ve hundred shermen who worked in groups to catch sh One day they caught in this river a large sh with eighteen heads each having two eyes As the shermen were getting ready to kill the sh the Tathāgata in the country of Vaiśālī saw it with his divine eye and felt pity for it He intended to take this opportunity to edify the sh and to enlighten the shermen at the same time He told the assembly of monks In the country of Vṛji there is a big sh that I intend to convert so as to enlighten the shermen You should know that it is now time to do so Then the Buddha surrounded by the assembly of monks ascended into the air through his power of divine feet and ew to the riverside He laid down his sitting cloth as usual and said to the shermen Do not kill the sh Through his supernatural power and in an expedient way he endowed the big sh with the faculties of knowing its previous life speaking human language and understanding human sentiment Then the Tathāgata purposely asked the sh though he alreday knew the answer What sins did you commit in your previous life so that you are now in an evil state of rebirth with such an unfortunate form The sh said By the effect of good deeds I had done in a former life I was born to a noble family and I was known as the great brahman Kapittha in my previous life Due to the inuence of my caste I despised and bullied other people and considering myself learned I scorned the scriptures and the Dharma I disrespectfully slandered the buddhas and reproached the monks with abusive language comparing them to camels donkeys elephants horses and other ugly animals Because of these evil deeds I am now suffering in this unfortunate form The Tathāgata taught the sh in accordance with its capacity and enlightened it as was suitable to the occasion After hearing the Dharma the sh died and was reborn in heaven through the power of its good deeds Then he looked at his own celestial body and wondered why he had been born in heaven After recalling his past life he remembered the Buddha with gratitude and came with other heavenly beings to see him Having worshiped the Buddha he circumambulated him and stood aside to offer him valuables and fragrant owers brought from heaven The Worldhonored One related this anecdote to the shermen while pointing at the heavenly beings and preached the wonderful Dharma to them They were moved and awakened and sincerely worshiped the Buddha with repentance tore up their shing nets and burned their boats They turned their minds to truth and embraced the Dharma After donning the dyed robes of monks and having heard the ultimate teachings all of them got rid of delement and attained the fruit of sainthood More than one hundred li to the northeast of the place where the shermen were converted there is a stupa over one hundred feet high built by King Aśoka to the west of an old city This was the place where the Buddha once preached the Dharma for six months to convert celestial and human beings At a distance of one hundred forty or fty paces to the north of this stupa there is a smaller stupa marking the place where the Tathāgata laid down the disciplinary rules for the bhikṣus Not far to the west there is another stupa in which are enshrined the Tathāgatas hair and nail relics People coming far and near converge at this place to burn incense scatter owers and light lamps and candles without interruption Going from here to the northwest for one thousand four hundred or ve hundred li crossing over mountains and passing through valleys I reached the country of Nepāla  The country of Nepāla is over four thousand li in circuit and it is situated among the Snow Mountains The capital city of the country is more than twenty li in circuit and there are hills and valleys in close connection The soil is suitable for growing cereals and yields many owers and fruit The country produces red copper yaks and jīvaṃjīvas  Red copper coins are used as the medium of exchange The climate is piercingly cold The people are sinister and iniquitous by social custom and are rude and unrestrained by nature and disparage good faith and righteousness They have no learning but are skillful in craftsmanship They are ugly in appearance and believe in both wrong and right doctrines The monasteries and deva temples are so close together that they touch each other and there are more than two thousand monks who study both Mahayana and Hinayana teachings the number of heretics is unknown The king being a Licchavi of the kṣatriya caste is an upright man with good learning and is a pure Buddhist In recent years there was a king named Aṃśuvarman  a learned scholar of intelligence and sagacity who wrote a treatise on śabdavidyā  He esteemed learning and honored the virtuous and his fame spread far and near To the southeast of the capital city there is a small pool When re is thrown into it the water burns and when other things are cast into it they also become ery From here I returned to the country of Vaiśālī and crossing the Ganges River to the south I reached the country of Magadha formerly mistranscribed as Mojiatuo or Mojieti in the domain of Central India End of Fascicle VII of The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions The Country of Magadha The country of Magadha is more than ve thousand li in circuit and the capital city is sparsely populated while in the towns there are many registered families The soil is fertile and good for farming There is a special kind of rice of large grain with an unusual fragrance whose luster and color are extraordinary The people call it the rice for great personages The land is low and humid and the towns are located on tablelands After the beginning of summer and before midautumn the plains are ooded and boats can be used The people are simple and honest by social custom and the climate is moderately hot The inhabitants esteem learning and revere the buddhadharma There are over fty monasteries with more than ten thousand monks most of whom study Mahayana teachings There are several tens of deva temples with numerous heretics To the south of the Ganges River there is an old city over seventy li in circuit Although it has been deserted for a long time the old foundations are still there In the past when the human life span was innumerable years this city was called Kusumapura known as Xianghuagongcheng Palace City of Fragrant Flowers in Chinese The royal city was full of owers hence the name of the city Later on when the human life span was several thousand years the name was changed to the city of Pāṭaliputra formerly mistranscribed as the city of Balianfu There was once a learned brahman of high talent who had several thousand disciples studying under him Some of the disciples went out together on a pleasure trip One of them paced up and down in a melancholy mood and his companions asked him why he was so sad He said I am in the prime of life yet I am still a vagabond with only my shadow to accompany me and moreover even though a long time has passed I have not made any achievement in learning On account of this my mind is heavily laden with sorrow His schoolmates said to him in jest In that case we shall now arrange a ceremony for you to get married They then chose two people to act as the parents of the bridegroom and two people as the parents of the bride The young man was then made to sit under a pāṭalī tree which was thus called the Tree of the SoninLaw Seasonal fruit was gathered and pure water was served as wine to make a wedding feast to celebrate the nuptials The mock father of the imaginary bride broke off a branch of the tree and handed it to the young scholar saying This is your good spouse The other disciples said to him We were merely making a mock ceremony Please return home with us now lest the erce animals in the woods hurt you The scholar lingered at the place and walked about the tree After sunset a strange light shone brightly in the wilderness and elegant music from wind and stringed instruments was heard There was also an old woman approaching with a maiden followed by a large number of splendidly dressed attendants amid the sound of music The old man said to him while pointing at the maiden This is your wife The wedding festivities lasted seven days The other disciples concerned that the scholar might be killed by wild animals came to look for him Then they saw him sitting alone under the shade of the tree as if he were accompanying some guests of honor They asked him to return with them but he refused Some time later he entered the city by himself to see his relatives and friends and told them what had happened to him Those who heard the story were amazed His friends went with him to the woods where they saw a great mansion at the place of the owering tree with servants and slaves busily walking about The old man received them politely and prepared a feast along with a performance of music to entertain them according to the etiquette between hosts and guests When they returned to the city they told everything to people far and near After a year a son was born to the couple and the young scholar said to his wife I wish to go home but I cannot bear leaving you behind If I remain here I will always make my lodging in the open wilderness Having heard this his wife told it to her father the old man who said to the young scholar For the enjoyment of life one need not go back to ones native place I shall build you a palace Do not think otherwise Through the labor of spirits the palace was promptly completed The old City of Fragrant Flowers was shifted to this place and as the city had been constructed by spirits for the son it was called the City of the Son of Pāṭali  To the north of the old royal city there is a stone pillar several tens of feet in height erected at the place where King Aśoka made a hell In the onehundredth year after the nirvana of ākya Tathāgata King Aśoka known as Wuyou Not Feeling Sorrow in Chinese formerly mistranscribed as Ayu the greatgrandson of King Bimbisāra known as Yingjian Hard Shadow in Chinese formerly mistranscribed as Pinpisuo moved his capital from the city of Rājagṛha to Pāṭaliputra After the long passage of time only some old foundations still survive Of the monasteries deva temples and stupas there are several hundred remnant sites lying in ruins only two or three remain intact Only in a small city situated to the north of the old palace and on the banks of the Ganges are there over a thousand households When King Aśoka rst succeeded to the throne he was cruel and practiced tyranny He established a hell to torture people surrounded by lofty walls with watchtowers at the corners Great furnaces of erce re and cutters with sharp points and keen edges as well as other instruments of torture were prepared in imitation of the hells and a savage and cruel man was appointed to be the jailer At rst it was used for punishing all sorts of criminals of the country regardless of the nature of their misdeeds Later on all casual passersby were captured and put to death and all who had entered the hell were killed to prevent the secret from leaking out A newly admitted śramaṇa once came to the gate of the hell in the course of making his almsround The cruel jailer caught him and intended to kill him Terrorstricken the śramaṇa asked permission to perform a confessional ceremony  He immediately saw a man who had been bound and sent into the hell where he was dismembered and cut into pieces The śramaṇa was deeply touched by the sight and he gained the insight of impermanence and realized arhatship The jailer said to him It is now time for you to die Having achieved the fruit of sainthood the śramaṇa had no discrimination between life and death Even though he was thrown into a cauldron of boiling water it was just as if he was in a pond of cool water and a huge lotus ower sprang up for his seat The jailer was surprised by the unusual spectacle and hurried to inform the king who came to see the sight for himself and highly praised the spiritual protection Then the jailer said Your Majesty must die Why said the king The jailer replied Your Majesty previously issued an order as a rule of the hell that whoever has entered the enclosure of the hell must be killed and it did not say that the king should be excepted from the regulation The king said Once a law is adopted it should not be altered But did I make an exception for you when I laid down the rule It is my fault that you have lived until now He then ordered the lictors to cast the jailer into the big furnace and after the jailers death the king came out of the hell Not far to the south of the hell there is a stupa whose foundation has collapsed on one side so that it has the shape of an overturned almsbowl It is decorated with gems and has stone balustrades As it is one of the eightyfour thousand stupas built by King Aśoka it was constructed by human labor in his palace Inside it one dou of the Tathāgatas relic bones is preserved and they occasionally show spiritual manifestations and issue a divine light from time to time Having abolished the hell King Aśoka met the great arhat Upagupta who instructed him according to his capacity in an appropriate way The king said to the arhat I am lucky to be a lord of humans as a result of good deeds I have done in the past but because of my spiritual hindrances I regretfully have not received edication from the Buddha Now I wish to construct stupas for the veneration of the Tathāgatas relic bones The arhat said With your power of bliss and virtue you can command various deities to work for you It is my wish that you should protect the Triple Gem with great determination Now is the time for you to do so Then the arhat told the king in detail about the latters cause of offering a handful of earth to the Buddha in a previous life and about the merits of building stupas as predicted by the Tathāgata King Aśoka was pleased to hear the prediction He summoned the spirits and deities and issued an order saying The King of the Dharma has instructed living beings for their happiness and due to my good deeds done in the past I am now the most honored person among humankind In order to venerate the Tathāgatas relic bones stupas must be constructed You spirits and deities should work with one heart to construct stupas for the Buddhas relics at all places in Jambudvīpa which is inhabited by a full koṭi of families Though the project has been initiated by me it depends upon you for its successful completion and I have no intention of monopolizing the advantages of performing such superior good deeds Each of you should go start the construction work and wait for further instructions Having received the edict the spirits and deities went away to start the construction work at their different places and when the work was completed they all came to ask for further instructions After having opened the stupas built in eight countries and distributed the relic bones to the spirits and deities King Aśoka said to the arhat My wish is to enshrine the relic bones in the various stupas at the same time I hope to do this but I do not know how to fulll my wish The arhat said Your Majesty can order the deities and spirits to enshrine the relics at the same instant on the appointed date when they see that the sun is eclipsed by an object in the shape of a hand The king imparted the instruction to the spirits and deities On the appointed date King Aśoka observed the sun and at midday the arhat through supernatural power stretched out his arm and covered up the sun with his hand The eclipse was seen by all everywhere the stupas were being constructed and at that moment they commenced work simultaneously Not far from the stupa is a temple containing a stone on which the Tathāgata once stood and the traces of his footprints are still in existence The two footprints have the wheel signs and the ten toes have oral ornaments The sh patterns are visible and sometimes issue a bright light In olden times when the Tathāgata was about to enter nirvana he proceeded northward to the city of Kuśinagara and looked back at the country of Magadha in the south He was standing on this stone when he told nanda I leave my last footprints here looking back at Magadha while I am going to enter nirvana One hundred years afterward there will be a King Aśoka who will rule over the world and establish his capital at this place He will protect the Triple Gem and command all kinds of deities to do him service When King Aśoka succeeded to the throne he shifted his capital to this place and built a city here and protected the footprint stone with a shelter As it was near the palace city the king always came in person to make offerings to it Afterward various kings vied with one another in trying to bring the stone home Although it was not very big they could not move it Recently King aśāṅka persecuted the buddhadharma and went to the place of the stone intending to destroy the holy object He effaced the footprints with a chisel but they reappeared with the same traces and patterns Then he threw the stone into the Ganges River but it immediately returned to its original place The stupa beside the stone marks the place where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down in olden times Not far from the temple of the Buddhas footprints there is a huge stone pillar more than thirty feet tall The inscription on it has been partially erased but it says roughly that King Aśoka was a staunch believer who offered Jambudvīpa to the Triple Gem thrice and redeemed it thrice with valuable pearls and gems Such are the fragmentary words that are still legible To the north of the palace city is a great rock chamber with the appearance of a lofty hill and a space several tens of feet wide inside It was constructed through the labor of deities and spirits by the order of King Aśoka for his younger brother who was a monk King Aśoka had a younger brother by the name of Mahendra  As he was born in a royal family he presumptuously put on the kings robe and led a luxurious and dissolute life treating people cruelly until they bore a grudge against him The prime minister and other senior ofcials exhorted the king saying Your younger brother has gone too far in riding roughshod over the people As the saying goes when the government is impartial the country will be in good order and when the people live in harmony the ruler will be at peace This precept has been handed down from ancient times We hope that the code of the country will be maintained and that he will be put on trial according to the law King Aśoka in tears said to his younger brother Since I succeeded to the throne I have put all living beings under my protection But I did not guard and guide you in time so that you have now incurred the punishment for criminals I am in fear of my ancestors above and forced by public criticism from below Mahendra bowed to the king apologetically and said I am so imprudent as to have infringed the law I hope you will grant me seven days respite He was then conned in a dark chamber under strict custody but was provided with the best delicacies without negligence the guardian announced One day has passed and there are six more days When the sixth day had passed Mahendra deeply worried and fearful made vigorous efforts both physically and mentally  and thereupon he gained the fruit of sainthood ascended into the air and manifested miracles King Aśoka went personally to see him and said I was bound by the law of the country so I had to inict a severe penalty upon you I did not think that you would elevate yourself and realize the fruit of sainthood You are now free from trouble and you may return to our country His younger brother said Formerly I was caught in the net of passions and my mind was xated on  I am now free from the city of perils and I take delight in staying in the mountains and valleys I wish to relinquish the human world and always remain in the hills and vales The king said If you wish to engage yourself in quiet meditation it is not necessary for you to live in remote mountains In compliance with your wish however I will build a cave for you The king then summoned the spirits and deities and said to them I will prepare a grand banquet of delicacies on the day after tomorrow You may all come to attend the feast but each of you should bring a large rock to serve as a seat By the kings order the deities came at the appointed time and when the feast was over the king told the deities The stone seats are in disarray so you should stack them up in proper order I mean to make use of your labor to build a hollow chamber Under the kings instruction the deities completed the work in a few days time King Aśoka then went to invite his younger brother to stay in the hill cave To the north of the old palace and south of the hell there is a large trough that was made by divine labor under the command of King Aśoka It is used for storing comestibles at the time of offering food to the monks To the southwest of the old palace there is a rocky hill around which there are several tens of caves that were excavated in the steep cliffs by divine labor under the command of King Aśoka for Upagupta and other arhats There used to be a lofty terrace beside the hill but it has collapsed leaving only a pile of stones as the remnant foundation In a pond there is rippling water as clear and reective as a mirror It is regarded as holy water by the people of neighboring and distant countries If one drinks or bathes in the water the soil will be washed away and ones sins will be expiated Some impious people discussed the matter in private saying that these stupas were constructed by King Nanda of yore to store his seven kinds of treasures Later a king of little faith heard about the rumor and covetous of the treasures he sent his troops under his personal supervision to excavate the stupas But the earth quaked the mountains collapsed clouds enshrouded the sun and the stupas issued a loud sound of thunder The soldiers fell dead and the elephants and horses ed in fear Since then no one has dared another attempt the stupas Some people have said that there were different accounts of this matter but this could not be unascertained We may get the true facts by following the records of ancient books To the southeast of the old city is Kukkuṭārāma Monastery known as Jiyuan Rooster Garden in Chinese which was built by way of performing good deeds with veneration by King Aśoka when he rst had faith in the buddhadharma He summoned one thousand monks both ordinary people and saints  offered them the four monastic requisites and provided them with other articles for daily use The monastery has been in ruins for a long time and only the foundations are still in existence Beside this monastery is a great stupa called malaka which is the name of a sort of medicinal fruit of India King Aśoka lying ill on his deathbed knew that he was incurable and he intended to give up his gems and jewels for the performance of good deeds but his inuential ministers had seized power and would not allow him to do what he desired Later he kept an āmalaka fruit from his meal and played with it until it had become half spoiled Holding the fruit in his hand he said to his ministers with a long sigh Who is now the lord of Jambudvīpa The ministers said in reply Your Majesty is the sole lord of Jambudvīpa The king said No I am not the lord now I have sovereign power only over this half a fruit What a pity Worldly wealth and nobility are more easily extinguished than a candle burning in the wind My position entitled me to control the whole country and my title is the highest of all designations yet I am poor on my deathbed under the command of powerful ministers Even though I have lost the empire I still possess half a fruit Then he ordered his attending ofcial Take this half a fruit to Kukkuṭārāma Monastery and offer it to the monks with the following message I the former lord of the whole of Jambudvīpa now the king of half an āmalaka fruit beg to pay homage in front of the monks of great virtue I hope that you will accept my last alms I have lost all that I once possessed except for this half a fruit which is somehow at my disposal Please have pity on my poverty and let my seeds of blessedness grow and increase The senior monk of the community said King Aśoka used to be generous in almsgiving but he now suffers from a serious illness and treacherous ministers have usurped his power By the kings order we will distribute the fruit to all the monks So the senior monk instructed the steward monk to cook the fruit in a thick soup and then collected the kernel for which a stupa was built In an old monastery to the northwest of malaka Stupa there is a stupa known as Bell Striking Formerly there were about a hundred monasteries in this city The monks were solemn and respectful and had great learning and they had silenced the heretical scholars  In the course of time the monks eventually died and their successors failed to maintain the tradition of learning The heretical teachers taught their students to become perfect in knowledge and they then summoned their schoolmates thousands and myriads in number to assemble at the monastic buildings shouting aloud Strike the bell to call up all your scholars Groups of ignorant monks came together and wantonly sounded the bell and they reported to the king requesting him to be the judge of the contest The heretical teachers were highly talented scholars of good learning and even though there were numerous monks their arguments were shallow and supercial The heretics announced We are the winners of the debate From now on no monastery should strike the bell to call assemblies The king sanctioned the request according to the precedent regulations of debate Having been put to shame the monks withdrew in disgrace and for twelve years they did not strike the bell At that time Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva known as Longmeng Dragon Valor in Chinese formerly mistranslated as Longshu Dragon Tree of South India had enjoyed a good reputation from his youth and he enjoyed unique fame when he had grown up he He had a great disciple named Deva a person of wisdom and cleverness with wits and good understanding Deva said to his teacher  The scholars of Pāṭaliputra were defeated in debate by the heretics and time passes so quickly that twelve years have passed since they stopped striking the bell I would venture to demolish the hill of erroneous views and light the torch of the Dharma Nāgārjuna said The heretics of Pāṭaliputra are erudite scholars and you are no match for them I must go in person Deva said To cut off rotten grass is it necessary to overturn the whole mountain Under your instruction I venture to refute the heterodox scholars May you my great teacher raise an argument in favor of the heretical theories and let me analyze the points against them and we shall see who will be the winner before we plan our action Nāgārjuna then proposed a thesis of the heretical theories and Deva refuted his teacher as the latter tried to maintain his viewpoints At the end of seven days Nāgārjuna had failed to uphold his proposition He said with a sigh Erroneous views can be easily refuted and it is difcult to defend wrong theories You may now go you can surely defeat them Deva Bodhisattva had always been a man of high renown When the heretics of Pāṭaliputra heard about his arrival they assembled and hurriedly went to report to the king saying Your Majesty has formerly condescended to hear our suggestion that a rule be made to prevent the monks from striking the bell We pray that a decree be issued to order the guardians of the city gates not to allow a foreign monk from a neighboring country to enter the city lest he conspire to recklessly overturn the former rule The king consented to their proposal and ordered the guardians to keep strict watch Thus when Deva arrived he was barred from entering the city Hearing about he restriction he changed his clothes folded his saṃghāṭi robe and wrapped it in a bundle of straw Holding the front piece of his long gown in hand he hastily went into the city carrying the straw bundle on his head After entering the city and having cast away the straw he put on his religious robe and came to this monastery to ask for lodging but as he had no acquaintance there no one would provide him with a room So he spent the night on the terrace of the bell and early next morning he struck the bell loudly When the monks heard the sound of the bell they came out to see and found that the traveling monk  as the other monasteries did the same in response to the call of this monastery The king having heard the sound inquired into the matter but could not nd out who was the rst to strike the bell If you do not strike it what is the use of hanging it there The kings man said Formerly the monks were defeated in a debate so twelve years ago a rule was laid down to prohibit them from striking the bell Deva said Is that so I wish to beat the drum of the Dharma again today The messenger reported to the king saying A foreign śramaṇa wishes to avenge a former shame The king then summoned the scholars and made a rule that one who loses an argument should pay with his life for the failure Then the heretics displayed their ags set out their drums and boisterously talked on different theories showing off their talent for eloquence Having sat on the seat of discussion Deva listened to their disputations and aiming at their different views he refuted them through analysis In less than twelve days he vanquished all the heretics to the delight of the king and his ministers who built this spiritual stupa in memory of Devas supreme virtue To the north of Bell Striking Stupa is the old site of the dwelling place of the demoneloquent brahman Formerly there was a brahman of the city of Pāṭaliputra who lived in a thatched hut in a desolate place dissociating himself from the world None of the learned scholars with high talent could excel him and the common people unanimously respected him as a saint There was a bodhisattva named Aśvaghoṣa  whose wisdom comprehended everything and whose way extended to the three vehicles He often remarked on the matter saying This brahman has no teacher to teach him and his arts are groundless and without ancient basis He lives in seclusion enjoying great renown all by himself How could he be what he is unless he depends on deities and ghosts and is obsessed with evil spirits One whose ability of eloquence is endowed by a demon cannot speak face to face with another person and he cannot reiterate what he has said once I must go there and see how he will behave So he went to the hut and said to him I have heard of your great fame with admiration for quite a long time I hope you will lift the curtain so that I may express what is on my mind The brahman remained arrogant talking from behind his curtain and would not speak face to face  After the conversation ended he left and told the people I have come to know what is what and I am sure to defeat him Then he went to see the king and asked for permission to hold a sharp debate with the hermit The king was surprised to hear this and said What sort of man are you Unless you have gained the three clear insights or obtained the six supernatural powers how could you contest with him Nevertheless he ordered that his carriage be prepared and went in person to see the details of the controversy At that time Aśvaghoṣa Bodhisattva discussed the subtle words of the Tripi ṭaka and elucidated the general meanings of the ve branches of knowledge He talked eloquently and with great ease and his brilliant views were lucid and farsighted After the brahman had stated his opinion Aśvaghoṣa said In your statement you lost the gist of my argument Please repeat what you have said The brahman remained silent and became tonguetied however Aśvaghoṣa rebuked him saying Why do you not resolve my interrogation The demon you serve should hasten to give you words While saying this he hurriedly lifted the curtain trying to get a look at the demon but the brahman said in a ustered and fearful manner Stop Stop Aśvaghoṣa withdrew and remarked That fellow has lost his fame this morning As the saying goes false fame cannot last long The king said If not for your great virtue who could have seen through his sinister fraudulence According to the regular tradition of the country someone who has an unprecedented and unique capability of discernment should be commended for his perspicacity More than two hundred li away from the southwest corner of the city there are the remnant foundations of a monastery beside which is a stupa that often issues a divine light and manifests spiritual signs People come here from far and near to say prayers This was a site where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down in ancient times Going southwest for more than one hundred li from the old monastery I reached Tilaḍhāka Monastery It consists of four courts threestoried pavilions lofty terraces and gates that open wide leading from one to another All of these were built by the last descendant of King Bimbisāra Scholars of foreign countries and wise people from distant lands one after another came in groups of the same caliber and stayed  There are thousands of monks all of whom study Mahayana teachings At the end of the path facing the middle gate are three shrines that are adorned with wheel signs on the roofs and have bells and chimes suspended in the air On the terrace below there are spacious balustrades all around The doors windows beams outer walls and stairs are embellished with gilt or copper ornaments in relief In the middle shrine there is a standing statue of the Buddha thirty feet in height while in the left one is a statue of Tārā Bodhisattva and in the right one a statue of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva All three statues cast in brass are austere in appearance and spread farreaching divine precepts In each of the three shrines there is one sheng of relic bones which sometimes emit a divine light and show signs of unusual auspiciousness from time to time At a distance of over ninety li to the southwest of Tilaḍhāka Monastery I reached a great mountain where spirits and immortals dwell among the dense clouds and rocks lie in seclusion venomous snakes and violent dragons lurk in the hollows of the marshes erce animals hide in the woods and birds of prey perch on the trees On the summit of the mountain is a large at rock on which is built a stupa over ten feet high This was a place where the Buddha once sat in samādhi Formerly the Tathāgata once came here through supernatural power and sat on this rock in the samādhi of complete cessation for an entire night The devas spiritual beings and saints made offerings to him performed celestial music and heavenly owers rained down After the Tathāgata had emerged from the state of samādhi the heavenly beings out of feelings of respect and admiration constructed a stupa with gems gold and silver but over the course of time the precious substances have turned into stone Since ancient times nobody has ever visited the stupa Looking from afar at the high mountain one can see strange beings long snakes and erce animals circumambulating to the right around the stupa and devas immortals spirits and saints coming one after another to sing praise On a hillock to the east of the mountain is a stupa built at the place where the Tathāgata once walked and stopped to look back at the country of Magadha At a spur of a hill over thirty li to the northwest of the mountain there is a monastery built on an elevated place backed by a ridge with lofty pavilions excavated on the precipices There are more than fty monks all of whom study the Mahayana teachings This was the place where Guṇamati known as Dehui Virtuewisdom in Chinese Bodhisattva subdued the heretics There was once on this mountain a brahman named Mādhava who was a follower of the theories of the Sāṃkhya school and practiced the same accordingly He was an expert in both Buddhist and heretical doctrines and could speak well on the principles of nonexistence and existence His fame excelled that of his predecessors and his virtue won the respect of his contemporaries The king esteemed him as national treasure and the ministers and common people honored him as their personal teacher Scholars of neighboring countries accepted his style of learning respected him for his virtue and regarded him as a pioneer He lived on the ef of two cities in an abode surrounded by feudal lands At that time Guṇamati Bodhisattva of South India had been a person of intelligence since his childhood He was exquisite in learning in his early days had thoroughly mastered the Tripiṭaka and perfectly understood the Four Noble Truths He sent a disciple to the brahman with the following message I respectfully inquire after Mādha vas health and hope you are living in peace and happiness In three years I shall put an end to your good repute In the second and third years he repeated the message to the brahman When he was about to start out on the journey he wrote another letter to him saying The time is drawing to an end How is the progress of your studies You should know that I am coming soon Greatly worried and afraid Mādhava warned his disciples and feudal tenants that from then on they should not take in any śramaṇa or heathen and he told them to pass the notice to all others and to not infringe the admonition At that time Guṇamati Bodhisattva came with his pewter staff to of Mā dhavas ef but the tenants in keeping with the prearrangement refused to give him lodging The brahman reproached him saying With a tonsured poll and dressed in a unusual costume what a strange gure you are Since we all are pure ascetics why do you reject me The brahman would not speak with him but instead drove him away Having been driven out of the feudal land Guṇamati entered a great forest in which packs of erce animals wrought havoc A pure believer fearing that Guṇamati might be hurt by the animals came with a torch and a staff in hand and said to the bodhisattva A Guṇamati Bodhisattva of South India whose fame has spread far is coming to hold a debate Fearing that he may be harmed by wild animals I have come here to help him He may go his way in safety without worry Guṇamati said I must tell you pure believer that I am Guṇamati Having heard these words the pure believer showed still deeper respect to Guṇamati and said to him If that is the case you should quickly leave here So they came out of the dense forest and halted in an open marshland where the pure believer built a re When the night had passed he said to Guṇamati You should go now lest people get wind of you and come to injure you Guṇamati said with thanks I will never forget your kindness He then went to the palace and said to the gatekeeper A śramaṇa coming from a great distance wishes to obtain the permission of the king to hold a debate with Mādhava Having heard this announcement the king was amazed and said This man must be crazy Then he ordered a messenger to go to the place of Mādhava to declare his edict saying A strange śramaṇa has come and begged to hold a debate  I hope you will kindly attend the meeting with your gracious presence Mādhava asked the messenger Is the man the śāstra master Guṇamati of South India The messenger said Yes Mādhava was greatly displeased to hear this but he could not decline the invitation so he went to the venue of contention The king and his ministers as well as scholars common people and nobles gathered at the meeting wishing to listen to the learned discussion Guṇamati put forward his proposition rst but up until sunset Mādhava refused to offer a retort on the excuse that because of his his advanced age he could not give a prompt reply but had to leave and quietly ponder the question before returning to give his refutation The next morning after he had taken his seat in the discussion he could not utter a word in refutation and on the sixth day he died vomiting blood On his deathbed he said to his wife You are a woman of great talent and you must not forget the shame I have suffered Mādhavas death was kept secret and his wife attired in gorgeous dress came to the meeting The people in the assembly made a hubbub and said among themselves Mā dhava is selfconceited and is too shy to face Guṇamati so he has sent his wife to come to the meeting It is apparent who is superior and who is inferior Guṇamati Bodhisattva said to Mādhavas wife The one who can subjugate you has been subjugated by me The woman then beat a hasty retreat in the face of these difculties The king said  What secret words did you say that made the woman go away in silence Guṇamati said What a pity Mādhava is dead His wife came with the intention of holding the debate with me The king said How do you know this Please tell me Guṇamati said in reply When she came she had a sorrowful look of mourning and her voice betrayed her feelings of grief and sadness That is how I knew that Mādhava had died By saying the one who can subjugate you I was referring to her husband The king then sent someone to see what had happened and he found that the situation was just as had been described The king said in selfreproach The buddhadharma is abstruse and wonderful and has brilliant sages coming forth in succession nonaction is the way that benets living beings According to the original institutions and regulations of our country I shall praise and honor people of virtue in the usual manner Guṇamati said Stupid as I am I practice the Way and abide by chastity I observe the precepts of contentment and selfrestraint and study the means to help others Now it is time for me to request Your Majesty to assign all the tenants of Mādhavas efs to become in the monastery for innumerable generations so as to leave an example for people in the future and transmit the fame of these good deeds forever As for the pure believer who gave me protection I hope he will live blissfully in the world and enjoy the same provisions that are given to the monks in order to persuade people to have pure faith as well as to exalt his profound goodness Thus this monastery was constructed for the glorication of this superior event When Mādhava was rst vanguished in the debate dozens of brahmans ed to take refuge in a neighboring country and they informed the brahmans of that land about the shameful affair As the king respected Guṇamati he went in person to invite the latter saying Some heretics who overrate their own abilities have organized a party formed cliques and ventured to sound the drum to demand that a debate be held I hope that you Venerable Sir will crush these heretics Guṇamati said The debaters may be called to an assembly The heretical scholars were delighted to hear this and said among themselves in consolation We shall certainly win the case today Then the heretics expounded their theoretical principles Guṇamati Bodhisattva said These heretics here have taken refuge in a distant land and according to the kings former ordinance they have become contemptible How can I debate with them face to face At that time Guṇamati had a page to serve him as a seat carrier and that man often heard his masters supererogatory disputations and had become adept in discussing the gist of subtle teachings As he stood by the side of his master listening to his eloquent talk Guṇamati clapped his seat and said Seat carrier you may debate with them All the people in the assembly were surprised by this His words of deep meaning owed like a spring and his clear eloquence echoed in the air In three rounds the heretics were vanquished in the disputation the sharpness of their tongues blunted and the shafts of the etching of their arrows broken Because they had been defeated in the debate they were made feudal tenants of the monastery More than twenty li to the southwest of Guṇamati Monastery is an isolated hill with a monastery built by the śāstra master īlabhadra known as Jiexian Preceptvirtue in Chinese with the revenue of a city that was donated to him as a reward for a successful discussion The shape of the isolated hill resembled a stupa for the preservation of the Buddhas relics The śāstra master a brahman by caste was the scion of the royal family of the country of Samataṭa When he was young he was fond of learning and had a good character He traveled to various parts of India in search of people of wisdom When he came to Nālandā Monastery in this country he met with Dharmapāla Bodhisattva from whom he heard about the Dharma with faith and understanding and under whose guidance he donned the dyed robe of a monk He inquired into the consummate principles and sought the way of emancipation He mastered both the ultimate truth and the subtle theories He was well known in his own time and his fame was high in foreign regions There was then in South India a heretic who sought into profound teachings and delved into what was kept secret having a thorough comprehension of abstruse knowledge and a keen insight into subtle tenets Hearing of Dharmapālas high repute he became deeply jealous and resentful Despite the obstacles of mountains and rivers he came to beat the drum and demanded to hold a discussion with him He said  I am a man from South India I have heard that in your kingdom there is a great śāstra master Although I am not clever I wish to have a full discussion with him The king said Yes we have such a person as you say Then he sent a messenger to invite Dharmapāla saying A heretic of South India has come from a distance of no less than one thousand li wishing to hold a competitive discussion with you I hope you will condescend to come to the debate ground Having heard this message Dharmapāla tidied his robe and made ready to go His disciple īlabhadra an outstanding young man stepped forward and said Why are you going in such a hurry Dharmapāla said Since the Sun of Wisdom ceased to shine and the Lamp of Transmitting the Dharma became extinct heretics have massed like ants and heterodox views have spread like wasps ying in swarms Therefore I must go crush that debater īlabhadra said I have heard with respect your supererogatory discussions with which I dare to defeat the heterodox follower Knowing that he was a man of outstanding talent Dharmapāla gave his consent to the request īla bhadra was then just thirty years old and the assembly slighted him as being too young fearing that it would be difcult for him to combat his opponent by himself Knowing that the assembly was not content with the choice Dharmapāla said in explanation What is valued in a person is his good learning and intelligence not his age In view of the present situation is sure to defeat the heretic On the day of the discussion young and old people coming from far and near gathered together The heretic widely expounded his theories to the utmost extent but īla bhadra refuted him through reasoning in a most profound and abstruse way Having exhausted his words the heretic departed in shame As a reward for virtue the king wished to give him this city as a ef The śāstra master declined the offer saying I am a monk dressed in the dyed robe living in contentment and keeping myself in purity What is the use of a ef for me The king said The King of the Dharma has disappeared and the Ships of Wisdom have sunk one after another If there is no distinction how can we encourage scholars of the younger generation In order to spread the right Dharma I hope you will kindly accept the gift Unable to decline the offer śāstra master īlabhadra accepted the city as his ef He constructed a monastery according to the regulations and provided daily necessities for the monks with the revenue from the city Going southwest for forty or fty li from īlabhadra Monastery I crossed the Nairañjanā River and reached the city of Gayā This city is strongly built but only sparsely populated having only some one thousand brahman families the descendants of a great ṛṣi The king did not make them his subjects and the people honor them respectfully More than thirty li to the north of the city is a clear spring which is regarded in Indian tradition as holy water It is believed that when one drinks the water or washes in it his or her sinful delements are puried Five or six li to the southwest of the city is Gayā Mountain with deep valleys and farreaching streams among steep peaks and high cliffs In India it is traditionally called Spiritual Mountain Since ancient times whenever kings and monarchs ascended the throne exerted inuence on distant peoples or excelled their predecessors in virtue they all came to this mountain to make an announcement of their achievements On top of the mountain is a stone stupa more than one hundred feet high built by King Aśoka It has latent spiritual power and emits a divine light from time to time This is the place where the Tathāgata formerly preached the Ratnameghasūtra and other scriptures To the southeast of Gayā Mountain is a stupa built at the birthplace of Kāśyapa and to the south are two stupas built at the places where GayāKāśyapa and NadīKāśyapa worshiped re At the place where GayāKāśyapa worshiped re crossing a big river to the east one reaches Prāgbodhi Mountain known as Qianzhengjueshan Preenlightenment Mountain in Chinese as the Tathāgata ascended this mountain prior to his realization of perfect enlightenment After striving hard for six years he had not yet attained perfect enlightenment so he gave up austerities and accepted milk gruel When the Tathāgata came from the northeast to this mountain he saw that it was a quiet place and wished to gain enlightenment there From the northeast ridge he climbed up to the summit of the mountain and the earth quaked and the mountain trembled The mountain god was frightened and told the Bodhisattva This mountain is not a blessed place for you to achieve enlightenment If you stay here and enter the diamond samādhi the earth will sink and the mountain will topple over The Bodhisattva came down by the southwest side of the mountain Halfway down the mountain there was a large cave with its back to the crag and its mouth opening on a brook in front The Bodhisattva went in and sat crosslegged The earth quaked again and the mountain trembled for a second time At that time beings of the Heaven of Pure Abode chanted in the air This is not the place for the Tathāgata to achieve enlightenment Fourteen or fteen li southwest from here not far from the place where you practiced austerities there is a pipal tree under which is a diamond seat It is on this seat that all the buddhas of the past and future sit to achieve perfect enlightenment Please go there But the dragon of the cave said This cave is a quiet and suitable place for you to attain sainthood May you have compassion and not relinquish it Knowing that this was not the place for him to realize buddhahood the Bodhisattva left his shadow in the cave to satisfy the dragons wishes and departed This shadow was formerly visible to both the wise and the ignorant but now only some people are able to see it Preceded by heavenly beings the Bodhisattva went to the bodhi tree Later after King Aśoka rose to power he built monuments and stupas at the sites where the Bodhisattva ascended and descended the mountain Though these monuments differ in size they are the same in showing spiritual signs either raining celestial owers or emitting a light that illuminates the deep valleys Every year at the end of the summer retreat monks and laypeople from different places come here to make offerings and spend two nights before going home Going southwest from Prāgbodhi Mountain for fourteen or fteen li I reached the bodhi tree The surrounding walls are built high and strong out of brick they are long from east to west and narrow from south to north and are about ve hundred paces in circuit Exotic trees and famous owers cast continuous shade on the ground and ne sand and strange plants cover the earth with a green quilt The main gate opens east toward the Nairañjanā River and the southern gate is near a large ower pool The west side is an inaccessible natural barrier while the northern gate leads to a big monastery Inside the enclosure the sacred sites are connected with one another The stupas or shrines were all built by monarchs ministerial ofcials and nobles of various countries of Jambudvīpa as memorials to their acceptance of the bequeathed teachings of the Buddha At the center of the enclosure of the bodhi tree is the diamond seat which came into existence together with the great earth at the beginning of the bhadrakalpa It is in the middle of the threethousand great chiliocosm reaching down to the golden wheel below the surface of the earth It is made of diamond and is over a hundred paces in circuit Because the one thousand buddhas of the bhadrakalpa all sit on it to enter the diamond samādhi it is called the diamond seat and because it is the place for realizing the sacred Way it is also called the bodhimaṇḍa  Whenever the earth quakes this spot alone remains stable Thus when the Tathāgata was about to attain enlightenment the four corners of this seat trembled in the directions of where he had traveled to but when he came here it was calm and quiet without agitation Since the beginning of the period of decline at the end of the kalpa when the right Dharma started to deteriorate this site was covered by sand and earth and was lost to view After the Buddhas nirvana the monarchs of various countries set up two sitting statues of Avalokiteśvara facing east at the southern and northern limits of the enclosure according to the Buddhas description as they had heard from the tradition Some old people said that when the statues of disappear and become invisible the buddhadharma will come to an end The statue at the south corner has already sunk down up to the chest The bodhi tree at the diamond seat is a pipal tree which was several hundred feet tall in the time of the Buddha and although it has been cut down or damaged several times it still remains forty or fty feet high Because the Buddha attained full enlightenment while sitting under this tree it is called the bodhi tree  The trunk of the tree is yellowishwhite in color and its branches and leaves are always green they never wither nor does their luster decrease whether in winter or summer Each year on the day of the Tathāgatas nirvana the leaves fade and fall but they grow out again very soon On that day the monarchs of various countries and monks and laypeople from different places thousands and myriads in number gather here of their own will to water and bathe the tree with scented water and milk accompanied by music With arrays of fragrant owers and lamps burning uninterruptedly the devotees vie with each other in making offerings to the tree After the Tathāgatas demise when King Aśoka rst ascended the throne he believed in heretical doctrines and he destroyed the sites left by the Buddha He sent his troops and came in person to cut down the bodhi tree He chopped the roots stalks branches and leaves into small pieces and had them heaped up at a spot a few tens of paces to the west where reworshiping brahmans were ordered to burn the pile as a sacrice to their god Before the smoke and ames had dissipated however two trees with luxuriant and verdant leaves grew out of the furious re these trees were thus called ash bodhi trees On seeing this strange sight King Aśoka repented his misdeeds and water the remnant roots with sweet milk When it was nearly dawn the tree grew up as before The king greatly exhilarated to have seen this spiritual wonder made offerings to the tree in person with such delight that he forgot to return home The queen a heretical believer secretly sent someone to cut down the tree after nightfall When King Aśoka went to worship the tree at dawn he was very sad to see only the stump of the tree He prayed earnestly and watered the stump with sweet milk and in a few days the tree grew up once again With deep respect and astonishment the king built a stone enclosure to the height of more than ten feet around the tree which is still in existence Recently King aśāṅka a heretical believer denounced the buddhadharma out of jealousy destroyed monasteries and cut down the bodhi tree  He dug the ground so deep as to reach spring water but he could not get at the ends of the roots so he set re to burn it and soaked it with sugarcane juice with the intention of making it rotten and prevent it from sprouting Several months later King Pūrṇavarman known as Manzhou Full Armor in Chinese of Magadha the last descendant of King Aśoka heard about the event and said with a sigh of regret The Sun of Wisdom has sunk and only the Buddhas tree remained in the world now that the tree has been destroyed what else is there for living beings to see He prostrated himself on the ground and wept piteously He watered the tree with milk obtained from several thousand cows and it grew up to some ten feet high in one night Fearing that people of later times might cut it down  he surrounded it with a stone enclosure to the height of twentyfour feet Thus the bodhi tree at present is behind the stone wall and more than ten feet of branches grow out above the wall To the east of the bodhi tree is a shrine one hundred and sixty or seventy feet high built on a base whose front side is more than twenty paces wide It was built with brick and plastered with lime In all the niches arranged in tiers there are golden images and on the four walls are marvelous carvings in the shapes of strings of pearls or gures of spirits On top is installed a gilded copper āmalaka fruit also said to be a precious bottle or a precious pot It is connected with a storied pavilion at the east the eaves of which are in three layers The rafters pillars ridgepoles beams doors and windows are adorned with gold and silver carvings and studded with a mixture of pearls and jade The innermost chamber of the shrine has three doors connecting with the other parts of the structure On each side of the outer door there is a niche containing an image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva on the left side and one of Maitreya Bodhisattva on the right side both cast in silver and more than ten feet in height Formerly King Aśoka built a small shrine at the site of the shrine and a brahman later extended it There was once a brahman who did not believe in the buddhadharma but worshiped the deity Maheśvara He heard that the deity was living in the Snow Mountains so he went with his younger brother to seek the fulllment of his wishes from the deity The deity said Your wishes can be fullled only when you have done meritorious deeds It is not that you can get things by merely saying prayers nor can I make you satised The brahman said What meritorious deed should I do so that my mind can be satised The deity said If you wish to plant the seed of goodness you should nd the eld of blessedness The bodhi tree is the place where the Buddha attained buddhahood so you should quickly go back to the bodhi tree and build a great shrine dig out a large pond and make various offerings Then your wishes will be fullled Under the deitys injunction the brahman cherishing a mind of great faith returned with his younger brother The elder one built the shrine and the younger one excavated the pond Then they made rich offerings to seek the fulllment of their wishes They nally realized their wishes and became cabinet ministers to the king When the shrine was completed artists were invited to make an image of the Tathāgata as he appeared at the time of attaining buddhahood but for a long time no one answered the call for the job At last a brahman came and said to the monks I am good at making ne images of the Tathāgata The monks said What do you need for making the image The brahman said I only need some scented clay and a lamp to be placed inside the shrine After I have entered the shrine the door should be tightly closed and only opened again after six months The monks did as they were told but just four days short of six months they opened the door out of curiosity to see  They saw that the image inside the shrine was in the posture of sitting crosslegged facing the east with the right foot upon the left thigh the left hand was drawn back and the right one pointed downward It was just as if the gure was alive The pedestal was four feet two inches high and twelve feet ve inches wide and the image was eleven feet ve inches tall The two knees were eight feet eight inches apart and the width from one shoulder to another measured six feet two inches All the auspicious physical symbols of a buddha were complete and the compassionate features were true to reality except that a little spot above the right breast was unnished The monks saw no one in the shrine and realized that a divine hand was at work They were all lled with amazement and eagerly wished to know about the affair One of the śramaṇas a simple man of honest mind had a dream in which he saw the brahman who said to him I am Maitreya Bodhisattva Concerned that artists could not imagine the holy features of the Buddha I came in person to make the image It is made with the right hand pointing downward because just as the Tathāgata was about to attain buddhahood Māra came to disturb him but the earth gods informed him of Māras arrival One of the earth gods came out rst to assist the Buddha in subjugating Māra but the Tathāgata said to the god Do not worry I can surely subjugate him with my power of forbearance Māra said Who will bear you witness The Tathāgata then pointed his hand to the earth saying This one here will bear me witness At that moment the second earth god emerged to bear witness Therefore the image is made with the right hand pointing downward The monks came to know that this was a divine manifestation and they were all moved to tears The unnished spot above the breast was nished with various gems and the image was adorned with a necklace of pearls crowned with a coronet and embellished with other valuable ornaments When King aśāṅka felled the bodhi tree he also wished to destroy this image But when he looked at the compassionate features of the image he did not have the heart to do so On returning home he told his attendant minister You should remove this image of the Buddha and replace it with that of Maheśvara Having received the kings edict the attendant minister was afraid and said with a sigh If I destroy the Buddhas image I will suffer disaster for many kalpas but if I disobey the kings order I will not only lose my own life but also bring about the extermination of my entire family What should I do in this awkward plight He then called some Buddhist believers to work as his servants and had them build a brick wall in front of the Buddhas image When this was done he made a report to the king On hearing the report the king dreaded the consequences He suffered from blisters all over his body his skin became cracked and before long he died The attendant minister hurriedly went back to the image and demolished the brick wall  Though many days had passed the lamp still burned without extinction The image is still in existence and because it is in a deep inner chamber lamps and torches burn continually The compassionate features cannot be clearly seen unless earlymorning sunlight is reected into the chamber with a big mirror to illuminate the divine statue Those who have the chance to see the image are struck with emotion The Tathāgata attained perfect enlightenment on the eighth day of the second half of the month of Vaiśākha in the Indian calendar corresponding to the eighth day of the third month in our calendar but according to the tradition of the Sthavira school the event occurred on the fteenth day of the second half of the month of Vaiśākha corresponding to the fteenth day of the third month in our calendar He was then around thirty or thirtyve years old To the north of the bodhi tree is a place where the Buddha walked up and down After achieving perfect enlightenment the Tathāgata did not rise from his seat but sat in meditation for seven days When he rose to his feet he went to the north of the bodhi tree where he walked to and fro east and west for seven days When he had walked over ten paces signs of wondrous owers followed his footprints at eighteen points People of later times built a brick promenade about three feet high at this place It is said in a previous record that this sacred site can foretell the length of ones life One should make a sincere vow before taking the measure The length of the promenade varies according to the possible life spans of those who measure it To the north of the promenade on a huge rock on the right side of the road is a big shrine in which there is an image of the Buddha with its eyes gazing upward Formerly the Tathāgata looked at the bodhi tree from this place for seven days without blinking gazing at the tree attentively with a feeling of gratitude Not far to the west of the bodhi tree is a great shrine with a brass image of the Buddha in the standing posture facing east adorned with rare jewels In front of the image is a blue stone with wonderful veins of various hues This is the place where Brahmā built a hall out of the seven precious substances and Indra made a seat also with the seven precious substances at the time when the Tathāgata rst attained enlightenment On this seat he sat in meditation for seven days and emitted an unusual light that shone upon the bodhi tree The precious substances have since turned into stone because the event occurred in the remote past Not far to the south of the bodhi tree is a stupa more than one hundred feet high built by King Aśoka After having bathed himself in the Nairañjanā River the Bodhisattva was going to the bodhi tree and pondered what he should use for a seat He got the idea of using some clean grass to make a seat Meanwhile Indra transformed himself into a grass cutter carrying a bundle of grass going on his way The Bodhisattva said to him Can you favor me with some of your grass The transformed gure respectfully offered him some grass and after receiving the grass the Bodhisattva proceeded on his way Not far to the northeast of the spot of receiving grass is a stupa built at the place where some bluebirds and a herd of deer came as a good omen when the Bodhisattva was about to achieve buddhahood Among the signs of auspiciousness in India their presence is considered to be the most lucky symbol Thus in compliance with the custom of the human world the celestial beings of the Heaven of Pure Abode made the bluebirds y around the Bodhisattva to indicate his spirituality and holiness To the east of the bodhi tree are two stupas one on the left and the other on the right side of the main road This is the place where the King of Māras disturbed the Bodhisattva When the Bodhisattva was about to attain buddha hood the King of Māras exhorted him to become a supreme ruler instead of a buddha As this device was ineffective the King of Māras withdrew in deep sadness His daughters volunteered to go to seduce the Bodhisattva but with his divine power he changed the beautiful girls into decrepit old women They retreated clinging to each other holding sticks to support their slender frames In a shrine to the northwest of the bodhi tree there is an image of Kāśyapa Buddha Well known for its spirituality and sanctity it often emits a bright light It is said in a previous record that if a person walks around the image seven times with utmost sincerity he may gain the wisdom of knowing where he was born in his past life To the northwest of the shrine of Kāśyapa Buddha there are two brick chambers each housing an image of an earth god One informed the Buddha of the arrival of Māra and the other bore witness for the Buddha People of later times made these images of the gods in memory of their merits Not far to the west of the bodhi tree enclosure is a stupa more than forty feet high known as Saffron Stupa built by a merchant lord of the country of Jāguḍa Formerly in the country of Jāguḍa there was a great merchant lord who worshiped heavenly gods to pray for wealth and he despised the buddhadharma and did not believe in the law of causality He once led a group of fellow traders to do business and sailed to the South Sea where they encountered a typhoon and lost their way They drifted along with the roaring waves and sailed on the sea for three years until their rations were exhausted and they had nothing more to eat All those who were aboard the ship were in a precarious situation and they earnestly prayed to the gods they worshiped with one mind They become quite fatigued with their laborious prayers and had failed to receive divine rescue when they suddenly saw a huge mountain with lofty cliffs and steep peaks under the light of two bright suns The merchants said to comfort one another We are lucky to have come across this huge mountain We should stop here to get peace and happiness The merchant lord said It is not a mountain but a makara sh  The lofty cliffs and steep peaks are its ns and whiskers and the two bright suns are its eyes Just as they had barely nished talking the ship oated toward the monster The merchant lord told his fellow traders I have heard that Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva will bestow peace and happiness on those who are in peril and adversity Let us call his name with a mind of complete sincerity Then they all repeated the name of Bodhisattva in unison and sought refuge under his spiritual protection The lofty mountain disappeared and the two suns submerged In a moment they saw a śramaṇa with a quiet and peaceful manner coming through the air religious staff in hand to rescue them from being drowned Very soon they returned to their own country Thereafter they cherished minds of resolute faith and tried to perform good deeds indefatigably They built a stupa for making offerings and plastered the whole structure with saffron clay Having cherished the mind of faith the merchant lord led his fellow traders to worship the holy sites and visit the bodhi tree They spent a whole month in pilgrimage before they thought of returning home The traders while traveling together said among themselves We are far away from our homeland separated by mountains and rivers Since we are here who will sweep and clean the stupa we have built Having said this they came in a roundabout way to this place and suddenly saw a stupa Surprised at the sight they went up to have a close look at the stupa and found that it was the one they had built at home Thus it was named the Saffron Stupa in India At the southeast corner of the bodhi tree enclosure there is a banyan tree and next to it are a stupa and temple A statue of the seated Buddha is enshrined in the temple Formerly when the Tathāgata had just attained buddhahood Mahābrahmā came here and entreated him to turn the wonderful wheel of the Dharma At each of the four corners inside the bodhi tree enclosure there is a great stupa Formerly when the Tathāgata had received the auspicious grass he went to the bodhi tree He went rst to the four corners and the earth quaked but it became quiet and calm when he reached the diamond seat Inside the enclosure are many sacred sites located as closely together as the scales of a sh and it is difcult to describe them all in full detail At the southwest corner outside the bodhi tree enclosure is a stupa that marks the site of the old house of the two milkmaids who offered milk gruel to the Buddha Beside it is another stupa marking the place where the milkmaids cooked the gruel and next to this stupa is the place where the Tathāgata received the gruel Outside the south gate of the bodhi tree enclosure is a big pond more than seven hundred paces in circuit with clear and lucid water in which dragons and sh dwell It was dug by the younger brother of a brahman under the order of Maheśvara Next to the south is a pool that was magically produced by Indra when the Tathāgata wished to wash his clothes after having attained enlightenment At the west of the pool is a big rock that was brought here by Indra from the Great Snow Mountains when the Buddha wished to dry his washed clothes in the sun Beside the rock is a stupa where the Tathāgata mended his old clothes Next to the south is a stupa in a wood which was the place where the Tathāgata accepted the old clothes offered by a poor old woman as alms To the east of the pool produced by Indra there is a wood in which the pond of the dragon king Mucilinda is located the water is clear dark and sweettasting On the west bank is a small shrine in which is installed an image of the Buddha Formerly after the Tathāgata had just attained enlightenment he sat in meditation for seven days in this place The dragon king protected the Tathāgata by surrounding him with his body in seven coils while its many heads reached over him to serve as a canopy On the east bank of the old pool is the chamber of the dragon king In a wood to the east of the dragon Mucilindas pool is a shrine with an image of the Buddha in an emaciated condition Beside the shrine is the place where he walked up and down more than seventy paces long and there are two pipal trees one at the south and the other at the north side of the promenade In the past and at present it is the custom of the local people to anoint the image with fragrant oil when they are aficted with a disease and in most cases they are cured of their illness This was the place where the Buddha practiced austerities In order to subdue the heretics and also at Māras request he practiced asceticism for six years eating only one grain of sesame and one grain of rice each day reducing himself to a mere skeleton and becoming so feeble that he had to hold onto the branch of a tree to stand up to take a walk Beside the pipal tree where the Bodhisattva practiced austerities is a stupa at the place where jñātaKauṇḍinya and his four companions made their abode After Prince renounced his home to wander in the mountains and marshlands and dwell in woods or by springs King uddhodana sent these ve men to look after and serve him Because the prince practiced austerities jñātaKauṇḍinya and the others also diligently did the same To the southeast of the abode of jñātaKauṇḍinya and the others is a stupa where the Bodhisattva entered the Nairañjanā River to bathe Not far from the river is the spot where the Bodhisattva accepted and ate the milk gruel The stupa beside the spot is the place where two elders offered baked barley and honey  The Buddha was sitting crosslegged in silent meditation under a tree enjoying the bliss of emancipation for seven days before he emerged from the state of tranquility when two merchants passed by outside the wood The god of the wood told the merchants The prince of the ākya clan is now in this wood He has just attained buddhahood and has been sitting in silent concentration with a xed mind for fortynine days without taking any food If you offer him whatever food you may have with you you will receive great benet Each merchant then took out from his ration bag some baked barley and honey to give as offerings which the Worldhonored One accepted Beside the place where the elders offered baked barley is a stupa where the four devarājas offered almsbowls  When the merchants had offered the baked barley and honey to him the Worldhonored One considered what vessels he should use to hold the food At that time the four devarājas came from the four quarters and each offered him a golden bowl but the Worldhonored One declined the offer by keeping silent thinking that it was unsuitable for a mendicant to use such an bowl The four deva rājas took away the golden bowls and offered silver ones and in succession they presented bowls of crystal lapis lazuli agate coral and pearl but the Worldhonored One declined them all The four devarājas then returned to their respective palaces and brought back stone bowls of a dark violet color with a brilliant luster In order to avoid showing partiality the Worldhonored One accepted all four bowls which he stacked and pressed together into one bowl That is why his almsbowl has four rims on the outside Not far from the place where the four devarājas offered almsbowls is a stupa where the Tathāgata preached the Dharma for his mother After the Tathāgata had attained perfect enlightenment with the title of Teacher of Heavenly and Human Beings his mother Lady Mahāmāyā descended from her heavenly palace and the Worldhonored One taught her according to her capacity for her benet and happiness Beside this place on the bank of a driedup pond is a stupa where the Tathāgata once manifested supernatural powers to convert those who had the good causes to be present on the occasion Beside the place of showing supernatural powers is a stupa where the Tathāgata converted UruvilvāKāśyapa and his two younger brothers along with their one thousand disciples As time passed the Tathāgata spread the good Way to conquer people UruvilvāKāśyapas ve hundred disciples wished to accept the Buddhas teachings Kāśyapa said to them I shall also go with you to give up the erroneous way So all of them came to the place where the Buddha was and the Tathāgata told them Throw away your deerskin garb and relinquish the utensils for re worship In accord with the Buddhas holy instruction the brahmans cast their garments and utensils into the Nairañjanā River Seeing the sacricial utensils drifting away on the current NadīKāśyapa and his disciples waited to see what measures his elder brother would take next When they saw that his elder brother had changed his religion they also followed his example and donned the dyed robes to become Buddhist monks When GayāKāśyapa and his two hundred disciples heard that his elder brothers had given up their practice they also came to where the Buddha was and wished to lead the life of purity To the northwest of the place where the Kāśyapa brothers were converted is a stupa where the Tathāgata subdued the re dragon worshiped by the Kāśyapas Whenever the Tathāgata wished to convert someone he rst subdued the object of that persons worship So he went to stay in the cave of the brahmans re dragon Late in the night the dragon spouted smoke and ames and the Buddha who was sitting in meditation also issued a bright light illuminating the cave with the light of furious ames and blazing re The brahman teachers fearing that the re might hurt the Buddha hurried to the spot wailing piteously UruvilvāKāśyapa said to his disciples In view of the present situation it may not be a re The śramaṇa may be subjugating the re dragon The Tathāgata then put the re dragon into his almsbowl and showed it to the heretical disciples at dawn The stupa beside this spot was the place where ve hundred pratyekabuddhas entered nirvana simultaneously To the south of the pool of the dragon Mucilinda is a stupa where the Kāśyapas went to rescue the Tathāgata from drowning The Kāśyapa brothers were highly esteemed for their supernatural powers and were respected for their virtue by people from far and near who had faith in them In the course of exerting his great power in an appropriate way to guide and convert those who had gone astray the Worldhonored One caused a dense cloud that poured down torrential rains only the Buddhas lodging remained dry Seeing the clouds and rain the Kāśyapas said to their disciples Might the lodging of the śramaṇa not be ooded They sailed in a boat to rescue the Worldhonored One but saw that he was walking on the surface of the water just as if walking on earth and when he walked into the river the water gave way to him and the sand on the bottom appeared  At this sight the Kāśyapas were reassured and departed Two or three li outside the enclosure of the bodhi tree is the cave of a blind dragon Because this dragon had done evil deeds in its previous lives it had been reborn blind as its retribution As the Tathāgata was proceeding from Prāgbodhi Mountain to the bodhi tree he passed by the cave of the blind dragon The dragon suddenly recovered its sight and saw that the Bodhisattva was on his way to the bodhi tree said to the Bodhisattva Kind sir you will soon gain perfect enlightenment I have been blind for quite a long time but whenever a buddha emerges in the world I regain my eyesight When the past three buddhas of the bhadrakalpa appeared in the world I recovered my sight on each occasion Now you have come here and my eyes suddenly regained perception From this I know that you will become a buddha Beside the east gate of the enclosure of the bodhi tree is a stupa where the King of Māras frighten the Bodhisattva Knowing that the Bodhisattva was going to achieve enlightenment and having failed to tempt him the King of Māras did not know what to do Worried he called various gods to a meeting and arrayed his demon troops arranging them in proper order to menace the Bodhisattva A storm rose up thunder and lightning ashed in the dark night re blazed and smoke rose high and sand and stones were churned up and blown into the air Spears and shields were fully prepared and bows and arrows employed to the utmost but the Bodhisattva remained in the meditation of great compassion and all the weapons turned into lotus owers Māras troops became terried and retreated in disorder Not far from this place are two stupas built by Indra and Brahmā Outside the north gate of the bodhi tree is Mahābodhi Monastery built by a former king of the country of Siṃhala The buildings consist of six courtyards and threestoried pavilions surrounded by walls thirty or forty feet high The workmanship is most wonderful and the decorative paintings are exquisitely done The Buddhas image is made of gold and silver and all the ornaments are embedded with gems and jewels The stupas are lofty and spacious with wonderful adornments and they contain relics of the Tathāgata The bone relics are of the size of a nger joint lustrous and pure white in color and semitransparent The esh relics as big as pearls are of a pinkishblue color Every year on the full moon day of the month of showing the Tathāgatas divine power of ubiquity ie on the thirtieth day of the twelfth month in the Indian calendar corresponding to the fteenth day of the rst month in China these relics are shown to the public and a light is emitted or owers rain down in showers There are fewer than a thousand monks who study the teachings of both the Mahayana and Sthavira schools They rigorously observe the Vinaya rules are pure in conduct and have moral integrity Formerly the king of the country of Siṃhala in the South Sea was a devout Buddhist by birth He had a cousin who had become a monk and desired to visit the holy traces of the Buddha So he traveled far to India and sought lodging in various monasteries but all the local monks despised him as a frontiersman He returned to his homeland and the king went out some distance to welcome him The śramaṇa sobbed piteously and could not speak properly The king said What is wrong with you why are you so sad The śramaṇa said Depending upon the prestige of our country I traveled far to seek the Way I sojourned in a foreign land and experienced the discomfort of cold and hot weather How is it that I hear of it so late The king then offered all the treasures of his country to the king of India who after accepting the tribute and wishing to foster friendship with a distant ruler said to the envoy What shall I give you to take back as a return gift The envoy said The king of Siṃhala pays homage to the King of Great Auspiciousness of India Your prestige and virtue extend far and your kindness and benevolence cover all living beings A śramaṇa of our humble land out of respect and admiration for the morals and manners of your country ventured to travel to your esteemed land to pay veneration to the holy sites He sought lodging in various monasteries but none would house him After undergoing extreme difculties he returned home in shame to build a monastery in India in order to provide a resting place for traveling monks to promote good relations between our two countries and to allow envoys to be exchanged without lapse The king said The tradition of the Tathāgatas subtle edication is still extant You may choose any of the holy sites  Bearing this message the envoy returned home to report to the king of Siṃhala The kings ministers prostrated themselves before him in congratulation The śramaṇas were then convened to discuss the matter of constructing a monastery and they said As the bodhi tree is the place where the past buddhas attained and future buddhas will attain buddhahood there is no better place among all the suggestions The treasures of the country were donated for the construction of this monastery and monks from the country were sent to look after it I this humble person after having succeeded to the throne have built this monastery to glorify the holy site and to render blessedness to my ancestors as well as to benet the common people The monks of my country may have free access to it and the people of the country where it stands may also enjoy the same privilege as the monks This tradition is to be transmitted to posterity into the indenite future Thus most of the monks in this monastery come from the Land of Lions More than ten li to the south of the bodhi tree the sacred sites are located so closely to each other that it is difcult to tell of them all in detail Each year when the bhikṣus end the rains retreat monks and laypeople hundreds and thousands in number come here from the four quarters holding owers playing music and wandering in the woods to perform acts of veneration and make offerings for seven days and nights According to the Buddhas holy teachings the monks of India commence the rains retreat on the rst day of the rst half of the month of rāvaṇa corresponding to the sixteenth day of the fth month in China and the retreat ends on the fteenth day of the second half of the month of Aśvayuja corresponding to the fteenth day of the eighth month in China In India as the months are named after the constellations the course of time has not changed from ancient times to the present and it is invariably accepted by all schools Probably due to misunderstanding or mistranslation from the foreign language differences in the calculations for the division of time and the xation of the months arose Thus the rains retreat begins on the sixteenth day of the fourth month and ends on the fteenth day of the seventh month one month earlier than in India End of Fascicle VIII of The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions The Country of Magadha To the east of the bodhi tree and across the Nairañjanā River there is a stupa in a great wood and to the north of the stupa is a pond where a fragrant elephant attended his mother In the past when the Tathāgata was practicing the deeds of a bodhisattva he was born as the son of a fragrant elephant living on North Mountain and he came to the pond for pleasure As his mother was blind he drew pure water and fetched lotus roots to feed her with respect and lial piety this he did for a long time A man once lost his way while traveling through the wood and walked back and forth weeping piteously Hearing the sound the young elephant felt pity for the man guided him out of the wood and showed him the way home After the man returned home he reported to the king I know that a fragrant elephant is wandering about the pond in the wood This is a rare animal and you can go capture it The king agreed and sent soldiers to capture the elephant The man accompanied them as a guide but at the very moment he pointed out the young elephant for the king both his arms fell off as if they had been severed Even though the king was surprised by the sight he still captured the young elephant and brought him home The young elephant refused to eat grass or drink water for a long time after he was caught The stable keeper informed the king who went personally to inquire into the matter The young elephant said My mother is blind and is starving all day long As I am now a captive how can I enjoy delicious food Moved by the elephants lial sentiment the king released him In front of the stupa beside the pond is a stone pillar where Kāśyapa Buddha sat in meditation in the past Beside it are places where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down After crossing the Mahā River to the east of the seats of the four past buddhas I reached a great wood in which there is a stone pillar marking the place where a heretic sat in meditation and made an evil vow In the past the heretic Udraka Rāmaputra was someone who aspired to spiritual attainment and made his abode in the wilderness He engaged his mind in meditation and lived in seclusion in this wood of religious practice As he had gained the ve supernormal powers and achieved the samādhi of neither thought nor nonthought the king of Magadha highly respected him and invited the hermit to the palace for a meal every day at noon Udraka Rāmaputra traveled through the air to and fro without interruption and the king of Magadha would look into the air and wait for him On his arrival the king received him and gave him a seat Once the king was about to go out on a pleasure trip and intended to entrust someone to serve the hermit The king of Magadha summoned his daughter and ordered her I am traveling to a distant place and have something to entrust to you When he comes at mealtimes you should serve him as I do Having given this instruction the king started on his journey Under the king order the young maid waited for the hermit as usual and upon his arrival she received him and took him to his seat Due to having been in contact with a woman Udraka Rāmaputra felt an impulse of desire and lost his supernormal powers After the meal was over and he was about to return the hermit found that he was no longer able to y Ashamed he said deceitfully to the maid I have been practicing the Way and sitting in meditation with a peaceful mind for many years and I am used to ying through the air without any leisure moments Previous teachers taught us that we should work for the benet of others as our duty How can one work only for ones own good and forget about altruistic considerations I now wish to depart through the door and walk on the earth so that those who see me may gain bliss and benet On hearing these words the princess made a public announcement Thereupon the people hurriedly sprinkled water and swept the thoroughfare clean and hundreds and thousands of people stood still for a long time waiting for the appearance of the hermit Udraka Rāmaputra walked from the palace to the religious wood and sat down to practice meditation but his mind was disturbed by the external environment When he stayed in the wood he heard the crowing and chirping of crows and other birds and when he was near the pond the splashing of sh and turtles annoyed him His attention was distracted and his mind confused and he lost his spirit and was unable to practice meditation He became enraged and made an evil vow saying Let me be in the future a erce and wicked animal with the body of a leopard and the wings of a bird preying on living creatures My body will be three thousand li in width and each of the wings fteen hundred li in length I shall haunt the forests to devour the feathered tribes and enter the waters to eat aquatic animals After he made this vow his anger gradually abated and through hard work he regained his original meditative state soon afterward Before long he died and was reborn in the Heaven of Neither Thought Nor Nonthought enjoying a life span of eighty thousand kalpas The Tathāgata predicted that after the conclusion of his heavenly life the hermit would realize his original vow and be reborn as the ugly creature From that time on he would cycle in the evil states of transmigration without a xed time for his release To the east of the Mahā River I entered a great jungle and going for more than one hundred li I reached Kukkuṭapāda known as Jizu Cocks Foot in Chinese Mountain also called Gurupāda known as Zunzu Sages Foot in Chinese Mountain Because Venerable Mahākāśyapa entered nirvana on this mountain people of later times not wishing to mention his name inappropriately called it Gurus Foot Mountain Mahākāśyapa was a śrāvaka disciple who achieved the six supernatural powers and possessed the eight forms of liberation When the Tathāgata had completed his career of edication and was about to enter nirvana he told Kāśyapa For innumerable kalpas I diligently practiced austerities seeking the supreme Dharma for the benet of all living beings As I have now fullled my desire and expectation that I wished for in the past I am going to enter mahānirvāṇa I entrust to you the Dharma piṭaka and you should preserve and spread it and never let it degrade I will leave behind the goldenthread kaṣāya that my aunt offered to me to be transmitted to Maitreya when he becomes a buddha in the future All those who cultivate themselves in my bequeathed teaching whether bhikṣus bhikṣunīs upāsakas or upāsikās  should rst be delivered from the cycle of transmigration Having received the Buddhas instructions Kāśyapa upheld the right Dharma In the twentieth year after the conclusion of the Great Council he grew tired of the impermanent world and wished to enter nirvana He went to Kukkuṭa Mountain and climbed the north side of the mountain going by a roundabout route he reached the southwest ridge The peaks are dangerous and difcult to ascend and the paths are tortuous and overgrown with weeds He cleared the way with his pewter staff and cut down the weeds as if he were using a knife After he had opened the mountain path he proceeded along the roundabout route in a crisscross manner On reaching the summit he faced the northeast Standing amid the three peaks he held the Buddhas kaśāya in both hands and by the power of his vow the three peaks closed together leaving behind the three protuberant ridges we see now When Maitreya comes to the world as a Worldhonored One he will preach the Dharma in three assemblies After that there will still be numerous arrogant people who will ascend this mountain and come to the place of Kāśyapa Maitreya will snap his ngers and the mountain peaks will open by themselves and seeing Kāśyapa the people will become all the more arrogant At this moment Mahākāśyapa will hand over the kaṣāya  After making a speech and paying homage Kāśyapa will rise into the air and manifest various divine transformations A re will burst forth to cremate his body and in this manner he will enter nirvana Having seen this sight the people will abandon their pride and then will be awakened and realize sainthood Therefore a stupa has been built on the mountain On quiet nights a burning torch can be seen from a distance but if one goes up the mountain nothing can be seen Going more than one hundred li northeast from Kukkuṭapāda Mountain I reached Buddhavana Mountain with its lofty peaks and steep cliffs Among the rocks is a cave where the Buddha once stayed Beside the cave is a huge rock on which Indra and Brahmā pulverized oxhead sandalwood and rubbed the body of the Tathāgata with the powder Even now the rock retains a strong fragrance The latent spirits of the ve hundred arhats remain here Those who have the chance to meet them may see them appearing as śrāmaṇeras going to the villages to collect alms Their miraculous deeds whether secret or manifest are difcult to relate in detail Going east for more than thirty li in the deep valleys of Buddhavana Mountain I reached Yaṣṭi Wood  full of bamboo that covers the mountain and valleys Formerly there was a brahman who heard that ākya Buddha was sixteen feet tall but he doubted this and did not believe it So he used a sixteenfootlong long bamboo stick to measure the height of the Buddha but each time he did so the Buddhas height always exceeded the length of the stick by sixteen feet In this manner the brahman found the Buddhas height becoming higher and higher and he could not ascertain his actual height He cast off the stick and went away the stick took root  In the wood there is a great stupa built by King Aśoka Formerly the Tathāgata showed great supernatural powers and preached the deep and subtle Dharma for various heavenly and human beings at this place for seven days In Yaṣṭi Wood there was recently an upāsaka named Jayasena known as Shengjun Victorious Army in Chinese a man of the kṣatriya caste of West India He preferred to live a plain and simple life in the mountains and forests and while he stayed in the world of illusion his mind dwelled in the state of reality He was learned in the subtle meanings of both Buddhist and heretical texts eloquent in discussion and perspicuous in thinking Various śramaṇas brahmans heretical and heterodox scholars kings ministers elders and wealthy and powerful people approached him to seek his instructions with full conviction His disciples could be found in six families out of ten When he was nearly seventy years old he still devoted himself to arduous study without fatigue He gave up all other subjects of learning and engaged himself solely in the study of Buddhist scriptures exerting himself mentally and physically day and night In India it is the custom to make miniature stupas ve or six inches high out of scented clay Copies of scriptures are put inside these stupas which are known as Dharma relics When a large number of such stupas has been accumulated a great stupa is constructed to contain them all for perpetual veneration Whenever Jayasena was teaching his disciples as he orally inculcated them with the wonderful Dharma his hands were busy making small stupas in order to accumulate supreme bliss At night he walked to and fro or worshiped and recited scriptures or sat in quiet meditation taking no time to sleep or eat and he never relaxed in the daytime or at night Even when he was a hundred years old he did not lessen his effort and over a period of thirty years he made seven koṭis of Dharma relic stupas Each time he completed one koṭi of stupas he constructed a great stupa to contain all the small ones for people to make offerings to and monks were invited to celebrate religious functions On each occasion a divine light shone brightly an apparent spiritual manifestation and after that a light was emitted from time to time More than ten li to the southwest of Yaṣṭi Wood there are two hot springs to the south of a great mountain The water is very hot and after the Buddha had caused these springs he bathed in them They are still in existence and the ow of clear water has never diminished People come here from far and near to bathe and the springs may effect a cure for those who suffer from chronic illness Beside the springs is a stupa built at a place where the Tathāgata walked up and down Going southeast for six or seven li from Yaṣṭi Wood I reached a great mountain In front of a ridge of the mountain there is a stone stupa In the past the Tathāgata once preached the Dharma at this place for the three months of the rains retreat At that time King Bimbisāra wished to come to listen to the Dharma so a passageway through the mountain with stone steps more than twenty paces wide and three or four li in length was built to the site Three or four li to the north of the great mountain is an isolated hill where the hermit Vyāsa once dwelled The cave he excavated in the rock is still in existence He imparted his teachings to his disciples and the system of his learning is still prevalent Four or ve li to the northeast of this isolated hill is a smaller isolated hill The size of the cave excavated in the rock of the hill is large enough to provide seats for over one thousand people In the past the Tathāgata once preached the Dharma at this place for three months Above the cave is a big rock on which Indra and Brahmā ground oxhead sandalwood to rub the powder on the Buddhas body The fragrance lingering on the rock is still very strong At the southwest corner of the cave there is a grotto known in India as Asuras Palace A mischievous man skillful in the art of sorcery once invited close friends who shared the same interests and the group of fourteen went together into the grotto After going for thirty or forty li they came out into an open bright place and saw city walls terraces and pavilions all made of gold silver and lapis lazuli When they approached the city some young maidens standing by the city gate pleasntly and cordially welcomed them Then they proceeded and eventually arrived at the inner city where two maidservants standing by the gate each holding a golden tray full of owers and incense greeted them and said You must bathe yourselves in the pool rub your bodies with incense and put on garlands before you can be admitted in the proper manner The sorcerer may go in right away however The thirteen friends went to bathe but as soon as they entered the bathing pool they forgot everything and found themselves sitting in a paddy eld on a plain thirty or forty li to the north of the grotto Beside the grotto there is a viaduct more than ten paces wide and four or ve li in length In the past when King Bimbisāra was about to go to the place of the Buddha rocks were cleared from the valley precipices were leveled to dredge the stream and stones were piled up and cliffs excavated to make steps leading to the place of the Buddha From this great mountain going east for more than sixty li I reached the city of Kuśāgrapura known as Shangmaogongcheng Superior Reed Palace City in Chinese Kuśāgrapura in the center of the country of Magadha was the capital of previous kings in ancient times It is so called because it abounds in superior and lucky fragrant reeds The surrounding hills serve as its outer walls with a narrow path leading to the west and a passage opening to the north It is long from east to west narrow from south to north and more than one hundred fty li in circuit Karṇikāra trees grow everywhere on the mountain paths The owers have a special fragrance and are golden in color Late in spring the whole wood becomes goldencolored Outside the north gate of the palace city is a stupa built at the place where Devadatta who was on intimate terms with Ajātaśatru loosed the intoxicated elephant Dhanapāla in an attempt to hurt the Tathāgata The Tathāgata produced ve lions from the tips of ve ngers to tame the drunken elephant before going on his way To the northeast of the place where the drunken elephant was subdued was the spot where āriputra attained sainthood on hearing the Dharma preached by Aśvajit Bhikṣu When āriputra was a layman he was well known for his high talents and broadmindedness and he had disciples and pupils studying under his instruction He was once going to the great city of Rājagṛha when Aśvajit Bhikṣu was on almsround Seeing Aśvajit from a distance āriputra said to his disciples That man over there looks very graceful and rened in deportment He could not be so calm and quiet in demeanor unless he has attained sainthood Let us wait here a moment and see where he is going Being an arhat Aśvajit Bhikṣu was free from mental delements and carried himself in a gentle and peaceful manner holding a religious staff in hand āriputra said to him Elder Sir are you living in good health and happiness Who is your teacher and what Dharma have you realized that you look so happy and contented Aśvajit said Do you not know that the prince of King uddhodana relinquished his position as a wheelturning monarch and out of pity for all beings in the six paths of transmigration he practiced austerities for six years and attained perfect enlightenment and now possesses allknowing wisdom He is my teacher As regards the Dharma it is neither real nor empty and it is difcult to give a systematic exposition of it It can be fully explained only by the buddhas How could I an ignorant person discuss the matter in detail Aśvajit then uttered a stanza in praise of the buddhadharma and āriputra attained sainthood on hearing the stanza Not far to the north of the place where āriputra attained sainthood there is a large deep pit beside which a stupa has been built This was the place where rīgupta attempted to kill the Buddha in a re pit and with poisoned rice rīgupta had faith in the heretics and held fast to erroneous views Some brahmans said to him Gautama is respected by the people of the country so we have lost our supporters Invite him to a meal at your home At the gate of your house dig a big pit light a re in it then cover the pit with some rotten timber and camouage it with dry earth Poison should be put into all food and drink you serve him Even if he escapes the re pit he will be poisoned to death Following this suggestion rīgupta prepared a meal and poisoned the food All the people in the city knew that rīgupta plotted against the Worldhonored One with an evil intention and they all exhorted the Buddha not to go to his house for the meal The Worldhonored One told them Do not worry Nothing can harm the body of a tathāgata He accepted the invitation and went and as soon as his foot touched the doorsill the re pit turned into a pool full of lotus owers growing out of clear lucid water rīgupta was panicstricken at this but said to his disciples Even if the Buddha has escaped the re pit through magical power there is still poisoned food for him After the Worldhonored One had taken the meal he preached the wonderful Dharma and on hearing the Dharma rīgupta apologized for his misdeeds and took refuge in the Buddha At a bend of the mountain city to the northeast of rīguptas re pit is a stupa where the great physician Jīvaka built a preaching hall for the Buddha Flowers and fruit trees were planted at the open spaces around the building and remains of the structure and new sprouts from the old plants can still be seen When the Tathāgata was living in the world he stayed mostly in this hall Beside it is the site of Jīvakas private residence the remnant foundations and an old well still exist in ruins Going northeast for fourteen or fteen li from the palace city I reached Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain  It links with the south side of North Mountain protruding all alone to a great height where vultures perch it also resembles a high terrace The verdant mountain presents a distinct color in contrast with the sky During the fty years of his missionary career the Tathāgata stayed on this mountain on many occasions to preach the wonderful Dharma In order to hear the Buddhas preaching King Bimbisāra sent men to build a road leading from the foot of the mountain to the summit more than ten paces wide and ve or six li in length across valleys and over rocks with stones piled up into steps There are two small stupas on the way One is known as the place of alighting where the king to walk on foot proceeding on his way the other stupa is the place of where ordinary people were barred from going farther  The summit is oblong from east to west and narrow from south to north On the brink of the west side of the precipice is a brick shrine high and spacious built in a marvelous style with its door opening to the east The Tathāgata preached the Dharma at this place many times There is now a lifesize statue of the Tathāgata in the posture of delivering a sermon To the east of the shrine is an oblong stone on which the Tathāgata walked to and fro Beside it is a great rock fourteen or fteen feet high and more than thirty paces in circumference This was the place where Devadatta hurled a stone from a distance to strike the Buddha To the south and below the cliff was the place where the Tathāgata preached the Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra in olden times To the south of the shrine and beside a steep rock is a cave where the Tathāgata sat in meditation in days of yore To the northwest of the Buddhas cave there is another cave in front of which is a huge rock where nanda was frightened by Māra Once when Venerable nanda was sitting in meditation at this place Māra transformed himself into a vulture and occupied the huge rock one night in the black half of the month apping his wings violently and shrieking terrically to frighten nanda The venerable monk was alarmed and terrorstricken The Tathāgata seeing him in trouble stretched out a comforting hand through the stone wall of the cave stroked nandas head and said to him with great compassion It is merely a phantom of Māra Do not be frightened Reassured nanda felt at ease and happy both physically and mentally The traces left by the bird on the rock and the hole made in the stone wall in the cave still exist despite the long passage of time Beside the shrine there are several caves in which āriputra and other great arhats practiced meditation In front of āriputras cave is a big well it is now dried up but the mouth of the well still exists in the ruins A huge at rock in the stony gully to the northeast of the shrine is the place where the Tathāgata dried his kaṣāya The stripes of the robe left on the rock are as distinct as if they were carved on it Beside the rock are the footprints of the Buddha Although the traces are obscure their size and shape are still discernible On top of North Mountain is a stupa at the place where the Tathāgata gazed at the city of Magadha and preached the Dharma for seven days To the west of the north gate of the mountain city is Vipula Hill I heard the local people say that on the north side of the cliff southwest of the hill there used to be ve hundred hot springs but now there are only a few score Not all of them are hot springs as some are cold and others are warm The source of these springs is Anavatapta Lake to the south of the Snow Mountains the water ows underground to this place It is nice and clear and tastes the same as the water in its lake of origin The water ows out in ve hundred streams through the small hot hells and as the re of the hells rises up it makes the water of the springs lukewarm All the mouths of the springs have stone carvings in the shapes of the heads of lions or white elephants aqueducts lead the water below into tanks made of slabs of stone People come from various places in different regions to bathe in the tanks and they can often wash away their old maladies On both the right and the left sides of the hot springs stupas and shrines were built with their foundations laid as closely together as the scales of a sh and all of these are sites where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down in ancient times This place of mountains and streams is an ideal hermitage for wise and benevolent people to take up their abodes and there must be many recluses living in seclusion in this locality To the west of the hot springs is Pippala Cave in which the Worldhonored One always made his abode The cavern behind the back wall of the cave is Asuras Palace Bhikṣus who practiced meditation mostly resided in this cave Strange phantoms in the shapes of dragons snakes and lions often appeared in this cave and those who saw them were driven insane But because this is a wellknown place where holy and spiritual people stayed others in admiration of their edication braved the danger and came here one after another Recently a bhikṣu who was pure in observing the disciplinary rules and took delight in lodging at quiet and peaceful places desired to live in this cave to practice meditation Someone advised him Do not go to that caveit is full of disasters and many people have been killed Heed the warnings from previous accidents and not cause yourself regret in the future The bhikṣu said No it is not so I am aiming my efforts at attaining buddhahood in order to subjugate the heavenly Māra What mischief could be worth mentioning He shook his pewter staff and went to the cave where he prepared an altar and recited mantras After ten days a young woman came out of the cavern and said to the bhikṣu Venerable Sir you wear the dyed robe and keep the disciplinary rules so that living beings may take refuge under you and you cultivate wisdom and practice meditation to be a good guide for living creatures But now you are staying here and we are frightened Is this what the Tathāgata has taught you to do The bhikṣu said I observe the pure rules in accordance with the Buddhas holy teachings and live in seclusion in the mountains in order to avoid the hubbub and excitement of social life What is wrong with my being here that causes you to accuse me The woman said When you utter mantras the sound of your voice causes a re burn from the outside into my dwelling and causes trouble for my kinsfolk Will you have pity on us and not repeat mantras any more The bhikṣu said I recite mantras for selfprotection not to do harm to others In the past when monks stayed here to practice meditation in the hope of gaining sainthood so as to save those who were suffering in the dark path of transmigration they were scared to death by the sight of your terriffying appearance What do you say to this The woman said in reply Heavy is my sin and shallow my wisdom From now on I will live in seclusion and keep myself within bounds But I also hope that you Venerable Sir will not repeat mantras So the bhikṣu practiced meditation in peace and was not harmed On Vipula Mountain is a stupa where the Tathāgata formerly preached the Dharma Now many naked heretics stay at this place practicing austerities without negligence day and night and from dawn to dusk they turn round to watch movement Going east for two or three li from the north side of the south cliff on the left side of the north gate of the mountain city I came to a great cave in which Devadatta sat in meditation in olden times On a at rock not far to the east of this cave there are traces resembling bloodstains Beside it is a stupa built at the spot where a bhikṣu who practiced meditation committed suicide and attained sainthood This bhikṣu exerted mental and physical effort in practicing meditation in seclusion but he failed to attain sainthood after long time had passed He blamed himself and said regretfully I could not attain the perfect stage of sainthood with nothing more to learn in a timely way What is the use of keeping this body of mine which is really a burden to me So he came to this rock and cut his throat At that very moment he realized arhatship ascended into the air performed miraculous transformations produced a re to cremate his body and entered nirvana This stupa was built in memory of his merits and to extol his sublime character On the cliff to the east of the place where the bhikṣu committed suicide and attained sainthood is a stone stupa at the spot where another bhikṣu practiced meditation threw himself down the cliff and gained sainthood At the time of the Buddha there was once a bhikṣu who sat in the woods and mountains practicing meditation in order to achieve sainthood He worked hard for a long time but could not realize his wish Day and night he never forgot to x his mind in tranquil meditation Knowing that the fundamental ability of the bhikṣu was about to be fully developed the Tathāgata went to render assistance to him He came from the Bamboo Grove to the foot of the cliff snapped his ngers to call the bhikṣu and stood there waiting for him Seeing the holy monks from a distance the bhikṣu was encouraged and jumped down the cliff with delight As his mind was pure and he had faith in the Buddhas words he gained sainthood before his body reached the ground The Worldhonored One told him You should know it isn ow the time The bhikṣu then ascended into the air and showed divine manifestations In order to exalt the bhikṣus pure faith this stupa was built as a memorial Going out of the north gate of the mountain city for about one li I reached Kalandaka Bamboo Garden in which there is now a temple a brick chamber built on stone bases with a door opening to the east When the Tathāgata was living in the world he spent much time in this temple preaching the Dharma for the edication and guidance of the common people and converting the secular folk There is a lifesize image of the Tathāgata of recent origin At the beginning there was an eminent elder named Kalandaka well known for his nobility and enormous wealth He presented this great Bamboo Garden to the heretics but after he saw the Tathāgata and heard the Dharma with pure faith he regretted that he had given his garden as a lodging for the heterodox believers and now did not have a place to house the Teacher of Human and Heavenly Beings At that time various gods and spirits moved by the elders sincerity expelled the heretics and told them Elder Kalandaka wishes to build a temple for the Buddha in Bamboo Garden You should quickly go away so as to avoid mishap and disaster The heretics left the garden in anger and resentment The elder built a temple in the garden and when the construction was completed he went in person to invite the Buddha who then accepted the gift To the east of Kalandaka Bamboo Garden is a stupa built by King Ajāta śatru known in Chinese as Weishengyuan Enemy Before Birth formerly abridged wrongly as Asheshi After the Tathāgatas nirvana the various kings shared his relic bones and King Ajātaśatru obtained his portion for which he built this stupa with veneration to make offerings to the relics There are still some remnant relics in the stupa which often emits a bright light In another stupa beside the one built by Ajātaśatru are entombed the relics of Venerable nandas halfbody When Venerable nanda was about to enter nirvana he left the country of Magadha and proceeded to the city of Vaiśālī The two countries contended with each other to keep nandas body and were on the brink of war Out of pity for them nanda divided his body When the king of Magadha got his portion he brought it back and built a stupa for it at this superior place Beside it is the spot where the Tathāgata formerly walked up and down Not far from here is a stupa built at the place where āriputra and Maudgalaputra stayed to observe the summer retreat during the rainy season Five or six li to the southwest from the Bamboo Garden and to the north of South Mountain there is a large cave in a great bamboo grove Mahā kāśyapa and nine hundred and ninetynine great arhats stayed here to collect the Tripi ṭaka after the nirvana of the Tathāgata In front of the cave are the old foundations of a hall built by King Ajātaśatru for the great arhats who took part in collecting the Dharma piṭaka In the beginning Mahā kāśyapa was sitting at leisure in a mountain forest when he suddenly saw a brilliant light and the earth quaked He said What does this strange phenomenon augur He observed with his divine eye and saw that the Buddha the Worldhonored One had entered nirvana at the twin trees He ordered his disciples to go with him to the city of Kuśinagara and on the road they met a brahman holding some celestial owers in his hand Kāśyapa asked him Where do you come from Do you know where my great teacher is The brahman said I have just come from the city of Kuśinagara and I have seen that your great teacher has entered nirvana Human and heavenly beings in a great assembly are making offerings to him These owers in my hand were obtained from them Hearing these words Kāśyapa said to his disciples The Sun of Wisdom has sunk and the world is enveloped in darkness The Good Guide has abandoned us and living beings will stumble and fall The indolent bhikṣus however felt happy and said to each other gleefully Since the Tathāgata has entered nirvana we will be able to live an easy life No one will reproach or restrain us if we commit any fault Having heard these words Kāśyapa felt all the more sorrowful and thought about collecting the Dharma piṭaka as a guiding principle to prevent the violation of moral regulations taught by the Buddha He then went to the twin trees to see and worship the Buddha After the demise of the King of the Dharma human and heavenly beings lost their guide and various great arhats also entered nirvana At that time Mahākāśyapa considered that the Dharma piṭaka should be collected in obedience to the Buddhas teachings So he ascended Mount Sumeru struck a big bell and made an announcement saying A Dharma event is to be conducted in the city of Rājagṛha All those who have attained sainthood should promptly assemble Kāśyapas summons was carried by the sound of the bell to all the threethousand great chiliocosmsand on hearing the summons all those who had acquired supernatural powers came to the assembly At that time Kāśyapa told the congregation The Tathāgata has entered nirvana and the world is now empty We should collect the Dharma piṭaka in order to repay the Buddhas kindness Only a select number of people may take part in collecting the Dharma so that they may work in peace We should not ock into a crowd and upset this sublime task Only superior people who possess the three kinds of knowledge and the six supernatural powers who have heard and practiced what is not erroneous and who are eloquent without hindrance are invited to take part in the collection while those who have more to learn should return to their respective abodes A total of nine hundred and ninetynine persons was selected Mahākāśyapa called to him and said Because you have not become spiritually perfect it is tting for you to leave the holy assembly said I attended the Tathāgata for many consecutive years The King of the Dharma has entered nirvana and I have lost what I relied on Kāśyapa told him Do not be vexed It is true that you have been the Buddhas personal attendant and heard most of his utterances but you are not free from the delusion of passion and your bonds of habitual illusion have not yet been cut off nanda was tonguetied and departed He went to a solitary place desiring to gain the perfect stage of having nothing more to learn Although he worked hard he could not realize his ambition Feeling tired he went to take a nap and at the moment just before his head touched the pillow he instantly attained arhatship He returned to the assembly hall and knocked at the door to announce his arrival Kāśyapa inquired Have you cleared off all your bonds You should be able to utilize your supernatural powers and come in without opening the door Accordingly nanda entered through the keyhole After paying homage to the monks he withdrew and resumed his seat This event occurred on the rst fullmoon day of the summer retreat Then Kāśyapa made a declaration Please listen to me attentively nanda was praised by the Tathāgata for his allaround knowledgelet him collect the Sutra piṭaka Upāli is well known to all for his clear understanding of the monastic ruleslet him collect the Vinaya piṭaka And I Kāśyapa shall collect the Abhidharma piṭaka When the three months of the rainy season came to an end the collection of the Tripiṭaka was completed Because Mahākāśyapa was the elder among the monks and presided over the assembly it became known as the Assembly of the Elder To the northwest of the place where Mahākāśyapa collected the Tripiṭaka is the spot where nanda came and sat in meditation and attained arhatship after he had been criticized by the monks and not allowed to take part in the gathering He was permitted to join in the work after realizing sainthood More than twenty li to the northwest of the spot where nanda attained sainthood is a stupa constructed by King Aśoka at the place where the great assembly of monks made their collection of the Buddhas teachings Hundreds and thousands of arhats and ordinary monks who were not admitted to the assembly headed by Mahākāśyapa gathered here They said among themselves When the Tathāgata was living in the world we all studied under one teacher Now that the King of the Dharma has entered nirvana we have been discriminated against In order to repay the Buddhas kindness we should collect the Dharma piṭaka So the ordinary and saintly monks gathered together and sages and wise people joined the meeting They collected the Sutra piṭaka the Vinaya piṭaka the Abhidharma piṭaka the Miscellaneous piṭaka and the Dhāraṇī piṭaka as a separate vefold piṭaka Because this collection was done by both ordinary and saintly monks in the assembly it is called the Collection of the Great Congregation Going north for more than two hundred paces from Bamboo Temple I reached Kalandaka Pool Formerly the Tathāgata preached the Dharma at this place The water was clear and clean and possessed the eight virtues After the Buddhas nirvana the pool dried up completely Two or three li to the northwest of Kalandaka Pool is a stupa built by King Aśoka more than sixty feet high Beside it is a stone pillar carved with an inscription narrating the events of stupas construction which is more than fty feet tall and has the gure of an elephant on top Not far to the northeast of the stone pillar is the city of Rājagṛha known in Chinese as Wangshe Royal House The outer walls have been destroyed and there is no trace of them left the inner walls though ruined still have foundations of some height It is more than twenty li in circuit with a gate on each side After King Bimbisāra made the city of Kuśāgrapura his capital the registered inhabitants frequently suffered the calamity of re If one family was careless the neighbors on all four sides would also be involved in the disaster The people were busily engaged in preventing res and had no leisure to manage their properties So they harbored a grudge about the situation and lived uneasily in their abodes The king said It is due to my lack of virtue that my subjects suffer adversities Such places are regarded by the people as inauspicious so no one would wilingly visit them After someone has been banished to a śītavana he will be nothing other than a discarded corpse The people will be more cautious and protect themselves in order to avoid living in such a shameful spot The king said Good Make an announcement to notify all the inhabitants Soon after the palace itself caught re and the king said to his ministers I must move my lodgings He ordered the prince to act as regent to attend to state affairs and for the sake of upholding the impartiality of the national law he made up his mind to go live  At that time hearing that King Bimbisāra was living in a cemetery in the wilderness the king of Vaiśālī mustered his troops and made ready to launch a surprise attack According to information sent back by his frontier guards a city had been built  called the City of the Royal House and the king had moved there Government ofcials and common people had also moved to live in the new city It is also said that this city was built at the time of King Ajātaśatru When Prince Ajātaśatru ascended the throne he made this city his capital but after King Aśoka moved the capital to Pāṭaliputra he gave Rājagṛha to the brahmans Hence there are no ordinary inhabitants in this city only less than a thousand brahman families At the southwest corner of the palace city there are two small monasteries where guest monks from different countries may make stay in the course of their travels This was a place where the Buddha once preached the Dharma Further to the northwest is a stupa built at the native place of Elder Jyotiṣka known in Chinese as Xingli Heavenly Body formerly mistranscribed as Shutijia On the left side of the road outside the south gate of the city is a stupa at the spot where the Tathāgata preached the Dharma and ordained Rāhula From here going north for more than thirty li I reached Nālandā Monastery  I heard some old people say that in the mango grove to the south of the monastery there was a pond where a dragon named Nālandā lived hence the name of the monastery built beside the pond In facts when the Tathāgata was practicing bodhisattva deeds in a former life he was a great king who founded his capital at this place Because he had compassion for living beings and took delight in almsgiving the people called him Insatiable in Almsgiving in praise of his virtue and this monastery was named after this appellation The land for building the monastery was originally a mango grove ve hundred merchants purchased it with ten koṭis of gold coins and presented it to the Buddha The Buddha preached the Dharma at this place for three months and thereupon the merchants attained sainthood Not long after the Buddhas nirvana akrāditya  a former king of this country who esteemed the One Vehicle and honored the Triple Gem selected this propitious spot by divination and constructed the monastery here When the construction work began the dragons body was pierced and a nirgrantha who was a good diviner saw this and predicted This is a propitious site The monastery built on it will certainly be prosperous and become the standard for all the ve parts of India It will continue to thrive for more than a thousand years Students of future generations in this monastery will easily gain achievements in their studies but most of them will spit blood because the dragon has been injured akrādityas son King Buddhagupta known as Juehu Buddhaprotected in Chinese succeeded to the throne to continue the good works and built another monastery to the south of the original one King Tathāgatagupta earnestly followed the example of his predecessors and built another monastery to the east After ascending the throne King Bālāditya built a fourth one to the northeast After the construction work was completed a festive meeting was held to celebrate the occasion at which both prominent and obscure persons were entertained with sincerity and holy as well as ordinary monks were invited Monks from the ve parts of India traveled long distances to attend the meeting Two monks arrived late after all the participants had been seated and they were led to the third story Someone asked them When the king prepared the feast he rst sent invitations to the holy and ordinary monks But we were invited by the king and we have come to attend the meeting from a great distance The inquirer was surprised to hear this and promptly made a report to the king who knowing that the two monks were saints went in person to greet them He arrived at the storied pavilion too late however and the two monks had already gone somewhere unknown to the others The kings faith was deepened and he eventually relinquished the monarchy to become a homeless monk He thought When I was a king I used to occupy the uppermost position but now as a monk I am relegated to a humble position behind all the other monks He went to tell the monks how he felt and they then called a meeting and made a rule that those who were not yet fully ordained could establish their seniority according to age which became a tradition peculiar to this monastery This kings son Vajra  was a man of rm faith After his succession to the throne he built a monastery to the west Later a king of Central India built another great monastery to the north and constructed a lofty enclosure with one gate for all the monasteries Because the entire complex was constructed by kings of successive dynasties the buildings were erected by the most exquisitely skilled carpenters employing such tools as burins and curved chisels to make the architectural complex a really magnicent sight In the great monastery built by King akrāditya there is an image of the Buddha Forty monks are assigned to take their meal every day in this monastery in honor of the almsgivers kindness There are several thousand monks all of whom are brilliant scholars of high learning those whose virtue is esteemed by their contemporaries and whose reputation is known in foreign lands number in the several hundreds They are pure in observing the monastic regulations and faultless in conduct according to the Vinaya rules The monks have strict restrictions and they are all chaste and spotless so that they are looked up to as exemplars in the various countries in India They admonish each other day and night and extend mutual help between old and young Anyone who did not engage in discussion of the profound teachings of the Tripi ṭaka would be ashamed of themselves Thus foreign scholars who wish to win fame come here to clarify the dubious points they found in their learning before they can join the ranks of the wellreputed Some travel about citing the name of this monastery to fraudulently gain honor and consideration Most of the people from different regions and countries who desire to enter this monastery to hold discussions are barred from entering the establishment after a preliminary interrogation by the gatekeeper Only those who are well versed in both ancient and contemporary learning can gain admittance The visiting students carry on debates with the resident monks but seven or eight out of ten ee in defeat The remaining two or three learned scholars may also be deated of their arrogance since their reputation can be damaged by questions raised later by the resident monks Highly talented and versatile sages endowed with retentive memory and good virtue maintain the glory of the monastery and follow in the wake of their predecessors They are well versed in ancient learning each having composed more than ten widely popular treatises that are highly valued even today The sacred traces around the monastery are counted by the hundreds of which I shall cite just two or three as brief examples Not far to the west of the monastery is a temple where the Tathāgata once stayed for three months and spoke extensively on the wonderful Dharma for various devas and people More than a hundred paces to the south is a small stupa at the place where a bhikṣu coming from a distance saw the Buddha Once a bhikṣu approached from a distance and met the Tathāgata and the holy monks at this place With a mind of veneration the bhikṣu prostrated himself and wished to be a universal monarch Seeing him the Tathāgata told the assembly of monks This bhikṣu is very pitiful He is a man of great bliss and deep virtue with a mind of rm faith and he would have realized buddhahood very soon if he had aimed at  But he wishes only to become a universal monarch and he will surely get the reward in his future lives and be a universal monarch for as many lifetimes as atoms of dust from the place wher he now prostrates down to the gold wheel beneath the earth Because of his addiction to worldly pleasure he is far removed from the realization of sainthood To the south is a standing statue of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva Sometimes it has been seen proceeding to the Buddhas temple and circumambulating it to the right with a censer in its hand In the stupa to the south of the statue of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva are kept hair and ngernail s of the Buddha shaven and clipped over a threemonth period Sick people are often cured of their illnesses by circumambulating the stupa The stupa beside the tank at the outside of the west wall of the enclosure was the place where a heretic holding a small bird in his hand asked the Buddha about the problem of life and death More than fty paces further to the southeast inside the enclosure is an extraordinary tree eight or nine feet high with two branches The Tathāgata once chewed a piece of willow twig and threw the used twig to the ground where it took root and grew into this tree Although a long time has passed the branches never increase or decrease in number Next to the east is a great temple more than two hundred feet in height The Tathāgata once spoke on various wonderful Dharmas at this place for four months More than one hundred paces further to the north is a temple in which is enshrined an image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva When pure devotees come to make offerings they see it at various places either standing beside the gate or under the eaves outside the temple as it has no xed position Both monks and laypeople from different countries come to make offerings to the image To the north of the temple of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva is a great temple more than three hundred feet high built by King Bālāditya Its size and ornamentation and the Buddhas image within are similar to those of the great temple at the bodhi tree The stupa to the northeast is the place where the Tathāgata once expounded the wonderful Dharma for seven days while to the northwest is a sitting place of the four past buddhas To the south is Brass Temple constructed by King īlāditya though the work is unnished According to the drawing of the building when completed it will be one hundred feet in height Further to the east more than two hundred paces outside the enclosure is a copper image of the Buddha in the standing posture over eighty feet tall and sheltered by a pavilion as high as six stories It was made by King Pūrṇavarman in olden times Two or three li north of the copper image of the Buddha made by King Pūrṇavarman is a brick temple in which is enshrined an image of Tārā Bodhisattva tall in size with an obvious spiritual manifestation Profuse offerings are made to the image every New Years Day and the kings ministers and wealthy people of neighboring regions holding fragrant incense and owers as well as precious canopies and parasols come to join the sevenday ceremony performed amid the harmonious music of bells stone chimes and string and wind instruments Inside the south gate of the enclosure is a large well Formerly when the Buddha was living in the world a group of merchants who were suffering from heat and thirst came to this place and the Worldhonored One pointed at the earth and said that water might be obtained there The lord of the merchants dug into the ground with the axle of a cart and water gushed out from the depression in the earth All those who drank the water and heard the Dharma became enlightened and attained sainthood Going southwest for eight or nine li from the monastery I reached the town of Kolika in which there is a stupa built by King Aśoka This was the birthplace of Venerable Maudgalaputra Beside it is another stupa built at the spot where the venerable monk entered nal nirvana his relic bones were entombed in it Maudgalaputra was born into a great brahman family and was a close friend of āriputra since their youth āriputra was noted for his brilliant talent while Venerable Maudgalaputra was reputed for his ne discernment They were equals in genius and wisdom and were always together whether traveling or staying at a place having forged a lifelong friendship and they vowed to take similar actions in their activities Both of them grew disgusted with the world and renounced their homes together serving Sañjaya as their teacher When āriputra met with the arhat Aśvajit he heard the Dharma from the latter and attained sainthood He immediately repeated what he had heard from the arhat to Venerable Maudgalaputra who upon hearing the Dharma became enlightened and realized the rst stage of sainthood Maudgalaputra came to the place of the Buddha with his two hundred and fty disciples When the Worldhonored One saw him from a distance he pointed at the newcomer and told the assembly of monks That person coming from over there will become the disciple most notable for his miraculous powers After arriving at the Buddhas place Maudgalaputra requested that he be admitted into the brotherhood of the Dharma The Worldhonored One replied to him Welcome bhikṣu By living a pure life you will be free from the bondage of suffering At the sound of these words Maudgalaputras beard and hair fell off and his secular garments changed He observed the disciplinary rules in a pure manner and behaved in the proper way After seven days he became free from the bondage of rebirth attained arhatship and gained miraculous powers Three or four li to the east of the Maudgalaputras birthplace is a stupa at the spot where King Bimbisāra welcomed the Buddha After the Tathāgata rst realized buddhahood he sensed that the people of Magadha longed to meet him At King Bimbisāras invitation he dressed himself properly took up his almsbowl one morning and went to the city of Rājagṛha accompanied by a thousand bhikṣus These bhikṣus had formerly been brahmans who wore their hair in the shape of a conch on the top of their heads but in admiration of the Dharma they had donned the dyed robes to follow the Buddha At that time Indra transformed himself into a māṇava wearing a topknot in the shape of a conch he held a golden vase in his left hand carried a precious staff in his right hand and walked in the air four ngers above the ground leading the way for the Buddha among the congregation King Bimbisāra of the country of Magadha together with the brahmans elders and laypeople of his country hundreds and thousands in number came out of the city of Rājagṛha to greet the group of holy monks Going southeast for more than twenty li from the place where King Bimbi sāra welcomed the Buddha I reached the town of Kālapināka in which there is a stupa built by King Aśoka This was the birthplace of Venerable āriputra The well is still in existenceand beside it is a stupa built at the spot where the venerable monk entered nirvanad his relic bones are preserved in the stupa Venerable āriputra was born in a great brahmans family His father was a highly talented scholar of extensive knowledge with deep insight into what was subtle and abstruse and well read in various texts His wife once had a dream and told it to her husband saying Last night I had a dream in which I saw a strange man clad in armor holding a diamond club in his hand He demolished all the mountains except the one by which he calmly stood Her husband said It is a good dream You will give birth to a son who will be a learned scholar in the world and defeat all śāstra masters and refute their theories He will be inferior to only one person and will become that persons disciple In the course of her pregnancy the woman suddenly became wise and intelligent and could carry on a discussion eloquently without faltering in her speech When Venerable āriputra was eight years old his name spread far to the four quarters He was honest and guileless by nature and had a mind of compassion He destroyed the bondage of rebirth and achieved wisdom He was Maudgalaputras friend since their youth So they went to the place of the heretic Sañjaya for spiritual practice and cultivation but they told each other What we are learning here is not the ultimate truth it cannot free us from the scope of suffering Whichever of us tastes the sweet dew rst must tell the other so that he may also enjoy it At that time the arhat Aśvajit almsbowl in hand was going to the city on almsround Seeing that he was peaceful and elegant in demeanor āriputra asked him Who is your teacher The prince of the ākya clan who weary of the world renounced his home and achieved full enlightenment is my teacher āriputra said What Dharma did he preach Can I hear of it I have just started receiving instructions and I have not yet mastered the profound teachings āriputra said Please tell me just as much as you have heard Aśvajit then expounded the Dharma as was suitable for the occasion On hearing the Dharma āriputra attained the rst stage of sainthood and together with his two hundred and fty disciples he came to the place of the Buddha When the Worldhonored One saw him from a distance he pointed at him and told the assembly of monks  will be the foremost in wisdom among all my disciples āriputra saluted the Buddha and wished to follow the buddhadharma The Worldhonored One said to him Welcome bhikṣu Hearing these words āriputra became a fully ordained monk and half a month later when he heard the Buddha preaching the Dharma to the longnailed brahman he became enlightened and realized arhatship Later when nanda heard about the time of the Buddhas nirvana he spread the news to many people who were aggrieved and saddened āriputra too was deeply saddened by the news He could not bear the idea of the Buddha entering nirvana so he asked permission of the Worldhonored One to allow him to die rst The Worldhonored One told him You should know that this is the right time for you to do so then departed from his disciples and returned to his native place His attendant śrāmaṇera informed the inhabitants in the city and the towns of āriputras intention King Ajātaśatru and the people of his country came in a great hurry and assembled together like clouds āriputra expounded the Dharma extensively for them and after hearing the Dharma the audience dispersed Late in the night he concentrated his mind and entered the samādhi of complete cessation of sensation and perception When he came out of the samādhi he passed into nirvana Four or ve li to the southeast of the town of Kālapināka is a stupa at the place where the disciples of Venerable āriputra entered nirvana It is also said that at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha the great arhat Trikoṭi koṭi meaning one hundred million in Chinese entered nal nirvana at this same place Going to the east for more than thirty li from the stupa of āriputras disciples I reached Indraśailaguhā Mountain known as Dishiku Indras Cave in Chinese The mountain valleys are deep and quiet with exuberant owers and trees There are two prominent peaks on the mountains summit On the south cliff of the west peak is a large cave wide but not high where formerly the Tathāgata often stayed In those days Indra carved marks on the rock concerning fortytwo dubious points about which he inquired of the Buddham who gave him explanations The marks are still there The present image in the cave was made in imitation of the posture of the Buddha as he was on that occasion All of those who entered the cave to worship the image was inspired with a feeling of awe and veneration On the crag of the mountain are sites where the four past buddhas sat and walked back and forth On the east peak is a monastery The local people say that at night the monks of this monastery often see lamps and candles burning brightly before the image in the cave on the east peak In front of the monastery on the east peak of Indraśailaguhā Mountain is a stupa named Haṃsa  The monks of this monastery once practiced the Hinayana teachings Because these are gradual teachings the monks were allowed to eat the three kinds of pure meat and this habit persisted Later after the three kinds of pure meat had become unobtainable a bhikṣu while taking a walk saw a ock of wild geese ying overhead He said in jest Today the monks are running short of food for their midday meal The Mahāsattva should know that this is the right time  Before he had nished speaking one of the wild geese ew back and dropped dead on the ground in front of the monk Seeing this incident the bhikṣu related it to all the monks who were sad to hear it and said among themselves The Tathāgata preached the Dharma according to the faculty of understanding of those in the audience in order to guide and induce them to enlightenment We have been stupidly following the gradual teachings The Mahayana tenets are the right principles and we should correct our former behavior and follow the holy teachings This wild goose is our clever guide and it came to admonish us Its great virtue should be gloried and the event transmitted to posterity Thus a stupa was built in memory of its spirit of sacrice and the dead goose was buried under it Going northeast for one hundred and fty or sixty li from Indraśailaguhā Mountain I reached Kapotaka Monastery where more than two hundred monks lived they study the teachings of the Sarvāstivāda school To the east of the monastery is a stupa built by King Aśoka The Buddha once preached the Dharma to the monks at this place for an entire night Meanwhile a bird catcher was catching some of the feathered tribe with a net in the wood but he failed to get any birds for a whole day He said I lack good fortune and whatever I do is always adverse for me He came to the place of the Buddha and declared Today the Tathāgata is preaching the Dharma here and I am unable to catch any birds with my net What should I do to feed my starving wife and children The Tathāgata told him Build a re I shall give you food The Tathāgata then took the form of a pigeon and burned himself to death in the re The bird catcher took the dead pigeon home and ate it with his wife and children Later he returned to the place of the Buddha who converted him in an appropriate way On hearing the Dharma the bird catcher repented of his misdeeds made a fresh start in life by relinquishing his home for spiritual cultivation and realized sainthood Thus the monastery constructed at this place was named Pigeon Monastery Two or three li to the south of Kapotaka Monastery is an isolated hill that is tall and precipitous covered by splendid owers with luxuriant trees and clear streams On the hill there are many beautifully constructed temples and shrines with most exquisite carvings and engravings In the central temple an image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva is enshrined it is small in size but august and mystical in spiritual manifestation The gure holds a lotus ower in one hand and has a small statuette on its forehead Some people once fasted and prayed earnestly for seven days a fortnight or even one month here wishing to see the bodhisattva in person Someone who had gained spiritual inuence saw Bodhisattva a majestic and stately gure with a bright radiance come out of the image to give him comfort and advice In former times the king of the country of Siṃhala in the South Sea looked in his mirror one morning but he did not see his own reection and instead saw the image of this bodhisattva in a wood of tāla trees on a small hill in the country of Magadha in Jambudvīpa Deeply delighted the king set out to seek the image When he came to this hill he found that the image here was similar to the one he had seen in his mirror so he built the temple and made various offerings to the image The kings of later times followed his example and built more temples and shrines beside it offerings of incense owers and music were made incessantly Going southeast for more than forty li from the image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva on the isolated hill I reached a monastery with more than fty monks all of whom studied the Hinayana teachings In front of the monastery is a great stupa that revealed miraculous signs many times Formerly the Buddha preached the Dharma to Brahmā and others at this place for seven days Beside it are ruins where the three past buddhas sat and walked back and forth Going northeast for more than seventy li from the monastery I reached a big village south of the Ganges River with a dense population of prosperous villagers There are several deva temples all beautifully adorned with engravings Not far to the southeast is a great stupa at the place where the Buddha once preached the Dharma for one night Going east from here through mountains and forests for over one hundred li I reached Lāvaṇīla Village The great stupa in front of the monastery here was built by King Aśoka The Buddha once preached the Dharma here for three months Two or three li to the north of this place is a large lake more than thirty li in circuit with lotus owers in four colors blooming all four seasons of the year Going east from here through great mountains and forests for more than two hundred li I reached the country of raṇaparvata in the domain of Central India End of Fascicle IX of The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions Seventeen Countries from raṇaparvata to Malakūṭa The country of raṇaparvata is more than three thousand li in circuit and its capital city is more than twenty li in circuit Agriculture is prosperous and both owers and fruit thrive The climate is mild and pleasant and the people are simple and honest by social custom There are more than ten monasteries with over four thousand monks most of whom study the Dharma of the Hina yana Saṃmitīya school There are more than twenty deva temples and heretics live together Recently the king of a neighboring country deposed the ruler of this country and presented the capital city as a gift to the monks Two monasteries have been built in this city with less than a thousand monks living in each they study the Hinayana teachings of the Sarvāstivāda school Beside the capital city and near the Ganges River is raṇa Mountain enshrouded in mist and clouds casting the sun and moon into shade Both ancient and contemporary anchorites and holy persons come here one after another to practice meditation Now there is a deva temple that still follows the rules handed down from past generations The Tathāgata once also lived at this place and widely spoke on the wonderful Dharma for various devas and people To the south of the capital city is a stupa where the Tathāgata preached the Dharma for three months Beside the stupa are ruins where the three past buddhas sat and walked up and down Not far to the west of the ruins where the three buddhas walked up and down is a stupa built at the place where the bhikṣu rutaviṃśatikoṭi Hearing Two Hundred Koṭi formerly mistranslated as Koṭi Ears was born In the old days in this city there was an elder who was enormously wealthy and powerful In his old age a son was born to him and when someone brought him the news he gave the messenger two hundred koṭis of gold coins as a reward so his son was named Two Hundred Koṭis on Hearing  When the child was growing up his feet never touched the earth and thus hair grew out of his soles to a length of about one foot soft lustrous and golden in color The child was dearly beloved and all kinds of toys were provided for him From his residence up to the Snow Mountains posts were set up in a chain with pages and servants stationed all along the way Whenever any good medicine was needed a message was passed on by the servants to get the required material which was then relayed back through the posts in good time Such was the wealth of this family The Tathāgata knowing that the good roots of the young man were about to sprout instructed Maudgalaputra to convert him But on arriving at the gate of the elders house he had no pretext for making an announcement Tthe members of the elders family were sunworshipers and paid homage toward the east in the morning every day At that moment the venerable monk employing his supernatural powers descended from the disk of the sun and stood before them Assuming that was the sun god the elders son offered him some fragrant rice The monk took the rice back home and its fragrance permeated the city of Rājagṛha King Bimbisāra surprised by the strange scent ordered a messenger to nd out the cause and it was discovered that it came from the rice brought back from the elders house by Maud gala putra of Bamboo Grove Temple The king thus came to know that the elders son had such a marvelous foodstuff and summoned him On receiving the kings order the elder considered what was the safe way for his son to go There might be the danger of a storm if he sailed in a boat and if he went in a cart or riding an elephant the cart might be overturned or the elephant might stumble So the elder had a canal cut leading from his house up to the city of Rājagṛha which was lled with mustard seeds and a boat was placed in the canal and towed by a long rope the elders son reached the city of Rājagṛha He rst went to pay homage to the Worldhonored One who told him King Bimbisāra summoned you because he wished to see the hair growing from the soles of your feet When you sit you should cross your legs to allow the king see the hair Stretching out ones legs toward a king would incur the death penalty according to the law of the country With this instruction the elders son left and when the king wished to see the hair was ushered into his presence The young man sat down with crossed legs The king was pleased by his proper etiquette and became deeply fond of him On his way back home the young man went to the Buddhas place again The Tathāgata was preaching the Dharma for the edication of the listeners Hearing the Dharma the elders son was awakened and became a monk on the spot The Worldhonored One told him Good man when you were a layman at home did you know how to play the zither Yes he replied If that is so I shall cite it in a parable When the strings are too tight the sound will not harmonize well but if they are too loose the sound will be inharmonious and ungraceful Only when the strings are neither too tight nor too loose can one produce melodious music It is the same with spiritual cultivation When you are too strenuous in your practice you will become fatigued and dispirited but if you are too relaxed you will become sluggish in disposition and forget your ambition The young man accepted the Buddhas advice and worshiped him by circumambulating him To the west side of the country is the Ganges River Proceeding to the south from here I reached a small isolated hill with lofty peaks The Buddha once stayed here three months during the rainy season and subjugated the yakṣa Bakula On a big rock below the cliff southeast of the hill is the trace where the Buddha once sat It is incised into the rock about one inch deep and is ve feet two inches long and two feet one inch wide A stupa was built there On a rock further to the south is the trace where the Buddha placed his kuṇḍikā  The trace is about one inch deep in the pattern of an eightpetaled ower Not far to the southeast of the trace of the Buddhas seat is a footprint of the yakṣa Bakula one foot ve or six inches long seven or eight inches wide and less than two inches deep Behind the footprint is a stone image of the seated Buddha six or seven feet in height Next not far to the west is a place where the Buddha once walked up and down At the top of the hill is the old chamber where the yakṣa once lived Next to the south is a footprint of the Buddha one foot eight inches long more than six inches wide and about half an inch deep There is a stupa built over the footprint Formerly the Tathāgata subjugated the yakṣa and bade him not to kill people to eat their esh respectfully accepted the Buddhas admonition and was later reborn in heaven West of here there are six or seven hot springs the water of which is extremely hot In the mountains and forests in the southern part of the country there are many wild elephants with enormous bodies From here going east for more than three hundred li along the southern bank of the Ganges I reached the country of Campā in the domain of Central India The country of Campā is over four thousand li in circuit and its capital city with the Ganges River owing at its back in the north is more than forty li in circuit The land is low and humid and produces rich crops The climate is moderately warm and the people are simple and honest by social custom There are several score of monasteries most of which are dilapidated and the monks numbering over two hundred study the Hinayana teachings There are more than twenty deva temples and the heretics live together The city wall of the capital was built with bricks to the height of several tens of feet The foundation of the wall is raised above the ground and defenders can repulse an enemy from high and perilous positions When human beings rst appeared in the world at the beginning of the kalpa they lived in the wilderness or in caves as they did not know how to build palaces or houses Later an apsara descended from the heavens and dwelled among humankind and after bathing in the Ganges River with selfadmiration she became pregnant through spiritual inuence and gave birth to four sons They divided Jambudvīpa each occupying a district built capital cities and established towns and drew demarcations over their territories The city was the capital of one of the four sons and it was the rst city ever built in Jambudvīpa One hundred forty or fty li to the east of the city is a solitary islet with lofty peaks in the southern part of the Ganges On top of a peak is a deva temple where a deity often gives spiritual responses to prayers Caves are excavated in the cliffs and water ows into ponds There are owery woods and exotic trees With its huge rocks and perilous peaks this islet is the abode of wise and benign dwellers It is so attractive that visitors sometimes forget to go home There are thousands of wild elephants and other erce animals roaming about in packs in the mountains and jungles in the southern region of the country From here going east for more than four hundred li I reached the country of Kajaṅgala  The country of Kajaṅgala is more than two thousand li in circuit The land irrigated by subterranean water produces rich crops The climate is humid and the social customs are agreeable Brilliant talent is highly valued and learning is greatly esteemed There are six or seven monasteries with more than three hundred monks There are ten deva temples and the heretics live together A few hundred years ago the royal clan died out and the country fell under the control of a neighboring state Thus the capital city has been lying in ruins and most of the inhabitants live in villages and towns This is why when King īlāditya traveled to East India on his arrival he built a palace out of thatch for the management of state affairs and when he left the place he set a re to burn down the thatched house In the southern region of the country there are many wild elephants In the northern region not far from the Ganges River is a great high terrace built out of bricks and stone The foundation of the terrace is broad and tall and is adorned with exquisite engravings All around the terrace are carved statues of various holy persons and the buddha images are different from the gures of heavenly beings From here crossing the Ganges to the east and after traveling for six hundred li I reached the country of Puṇḍravardhana  The country of Puṇḍravardhana is more than four thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over thirty li in circuit Water tanks guesthouses and owery woods are interspersed The land is low and moist and crops are abundant Breadfruit is plentiful but nevertheless expensive This fruit is as large as a white gourd and is yellowishred in color when ripe When it is cut open one can see several tens of smaller fruits inside each as large as a cranes egg When cut the fruit oozes yellowishred juice with a sweet and delicious taste The fruit is borne on branches just like other kinds of fruit and it also grows on the roots of the tree just as fuling does The climate is mild and pleasant and the people are fond of learning by custom There are over twenty monasteries with more than three thousand monks who study both the Mahayana and Hinayana teachings Deva temples are one hundred in number and the heretics live together There are numerous naked nirgranthas More than twenty li to the west of the capital city is Vāśibhā Monastery consisting of spacious courtyards and halls and lofty terraces and pavilions There are more than seven hundred monks all of whom study the Mahayana teachings Most of the great scholars and renowned monks of East India reside here Not far from it is a stupa built by King Aśoka In olden times the Tathāgata once preached the Dharma at this place to heavenly and human beings for three months and the stupa often emits a brilliant light on fast days Beside the stupa are traces where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down Not far from here is a temple in which is enshrined an image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva Its divine inuence extends to all without omission and its spiritual response is evident People come here from far and near to fast and say prayers From here going east for more than nine hundred li I crossed a large river and reached the country of Kāmarūpa  The country of Kāmarūpa is more than ten thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over thirty li in circuit The land is irrigated by subterranean water and the seeds of crops are sown in the proper seasons Breadfruit and coconut are plentiful but they are nevertheless expensive The towns and villages are libnked by rivers and lakes The climate is mild and pleasant and the people are simple and honest by social custom They are short in stature with dark complexions and their language differs slightly from that of Central India They are very hottempered but rigorous and diligent in study They worship gods and do not believe in the buddhadharma Therefore since the rise of Buddhism up to the present day no monastery has been built to host Buddhist monks and those who follow the pure faith do so in private There are several hundred deva temples and several myriads of heretics The reigning king the offspring of Nārāyaṇa is a brahman by caste He is named Bhāskaravarman  with the title of Kumāra  The royal family has occupied the territory and ruled this country from generation to generation Bhāskaravarman is the onethousandth monarch He is fond of learning and his subjects follow his example People of high talent in admiration of the kings righteousness come from distant places to visit him as guests Although he does not earnestly believe in the buddhadharma he treats learned monks with respect The king having heard that a Chinese monk had come from a great distance to Nālandā Monastery in Magadha to study the profound Dharma of the Buddha repeatedly sent messengers cordially to invite the Chinese monk but the monk did not accept the invitation At that time the śāstra master īlabhadra said to him If you wish to repay the kindness of the Buddha you should disseminate the right Dharma King Kumāra professes the heretical religion by family tradition and it is good of him to invite a Buddhist monk You cherished a great mind and made a solemn vow to come to a foreign land all by yourself and at the risk of your own life to seek the Dharma for the salvation of all living beings Do you now think only of your home country Forget about gain and loss and do not care about honor or disgrace when spreading the holy teachings and enlightening those who have gone astray King Kumāra said Although I am not a person of talentI always pay respect to those who are learned Hearing of your fame as a person of learning and noble character I ventured to extend an invitation to you I said I am a person of little ability and lack wisdom It is a great honor to me that my humble name has reached your ears King Kumāra said Excellent You admired the Dharma and were fond of learning and you regarded your body as nothing more than a oating cloud traveling through dangerous places to a distant foreign country This was due to the edication of your king and the result of the general mood of advocating learning in your country Now in the various states of India most people eulogize the Song of Triumph of the Prince of Qin in Mahācīna I heard about this country long ago is it your homeland I said Yes That song praises the virtues of our monarch when he was the Prince of Qin King Kumara said I did not know that you were from that country I always admired the morals and manners of your country and have looked toward the East for a long time but as the way is blocked by mountains and rivers I have had no means by which to pay my respects I said The virtues of our great lord spread far and his benevolence extends widely Many people of different regions with diverse customs and habits come to the imperial palace to acknowledge his suzerainty King Kumāra said Since such is the case with many countries in the world I also wish to offer my tributary gifts Now King īlāditya is going to conduct a great almsgiving convocation in the country of Kajuṅghira to achieve bliss and wisdom All Buddhist monks brahmans and learned scholars from the ve parts of India are invited to take part in the meeting A messenger has come to invite me and I hope we can go together Thus I went with him In the eastern part of the country there is a chain of mountains and hills without a big city It borders on the territory of the Yi tribe in southwest  the inhabitants are akin to the Man and Lao minorities I made a detailed inquiry to the local people who told me that a journey of about two months would take one into the southwest region of the state of Shu  but that the mountains and rivers were difcult to pass a miasmal vapor permeates the air and poisonous snakes and noxious plants would cause drastic harm In the southeast part of the country wild elephants trample about in herds so the elephantmounted troops of this counry are particularly strong Going south from here for one thousand two hundred or three hundred li I reached the country of Samataṭa  The country of Samataṭa is more than three thousand li in circuit and because it borders on the sea the land is low and humid The capital city is over twenty li in circuit Crops grow profusely and owers and fruit are abundant The climate is pleasant and the social customs are agreeable The people are upright and unyielding by nature They are short in stature with dark complexions They are fond of learning and are diligent of their own accord They believe in both heterodox faiths and the right religion There are more than thirty monasteries with over two thousand monks all of whom study the teachings of the Sthavira school Deva temples are one hundred in number and the heretics live together Naked nirgranthas are very numerous Not far from the capital city is a stupa constructed by King Aśoka at the spot where the Tathāgata once preached the deep and wonderful Dharma to various human and heavenly beings for seven days Beside it are traces where the four past buddhas sat and walked back and forth In a monastery not far from here is a green jade image of the Buddha eight feet high with all the perfect features and which shows timely spiritual responses To the northeast in the valleys beside the great sea is the country of rīkṣetra farther to the southeast at the edge of the great sea is the country of Kāmalaṅka farther east is the country of Dvārapatī farther east is the country of śānapura farther east is the country of Mahācampā which in our country is known as Linyi and farther to the southwest is the country of Yamanadvīpa The routes to these six countries are obstructed by mountains and rivers so I did not go into these territories but I collected information about the peoples customs and habits and the demarcations of their lands From the country of Samataṭa going west for more than nine hundred li I reached the country of Tāmraliptī  The country of Tāmraliptī is one thousand and four or ve hundred li in circuit and its capital city is over ten li in circuit Because it is situated near the sea the land is low and moist Crops are planted in the proper seasons and owers and fruit are plentiful The climate is mild and warm The people are hottempered by custom and bold and courageous by nature They believe in both heterodox religions and the correct one There are more than ten monasteries with over one thousand monks Deva temples are over fty in number and heretics live together The country borders on a bay and is a center of commerce by land and water Rare and precious goods are collected here so the inhabitants are generally wealthy and prosperous The stupa beside the city was built by King Aśoka Next to it are traces where the four past buddhas sat and walked back and forth From here going northwest for more than seven hundred li I reached the country of Karṇasuvarṇa  The country of Karṇasuvarṇa is four thousand four hundred or ve hundred li in circuit and its capital city is over twenty li in circuit The inhabitants are wealthy and their families are wealthy and prosperous The land is low and moist and crops are planted in the proper seasons Different kinds of owers are abundant and there is a multitude of precious fruit The climate is mild and pleasant and the customs are honest and peaceful The people are fond of learning and craftsmanship and they believe in heterodox religions as well as the correct one There are more than ten monasteries with over two thousand monks who study the Hinayana teachings of the Saṃmitīya school Deva temples are over fty in number and the heretics are quite numerous In three other monasteries milk curd is not taken as food in accordance with the teaching of Devadatta Beside the capital city is Raktamṛttikā Monastery whose spacious courtyards and houses are noteworthy with lofty and sublime terraces and pavilions All the talented and learned scholars and intelligent and wellinformed people have assembled here in this monastery to help each other in the cultivation of morality At rst before the buddhadharma was professed in this country a heretic of South India wearing a copper belt around his waist with a lamp on his head and holding a staff in his hand walked proudly into the city beating the drum of contention and demanding a debate Out of pity for those who are in the darkness of ignorance I wear a lamp for their illumination After ten days had passsed no one had accepted the challenge and there was no suitable person even among the most talented scholars The king said How is it possible that there is no brilliant scholar to be found in the whole country It will be a deep shame upon the nation if the guests questions are not answered We should seek a competent scholar among the hermits living in seclusion Someone said In the great forest there is a strange man claiming to be a śramaṇa who has earnestly engaged himself in study in seclusion for a long time The śramaṇa said I am a native of South India and in the course of my travels I have come to stay in this place Being a person of shallow learning I fear that I am not as good as you have heard I am honored by your invitation however sp I will not insistently decline it If I am not defeated in the debate I request that you build a monastery and summon monks to glorify the buddhadharma The king said I have heard your words with respect and I will not forget your virtue At the kings invitation the śramaṇa went to the place of discussion where the heretic proclaimed his theories in thirty thousand words with deep meanings expounded in a concise manner including all the names and substances of visible and audible objects in the world Having heard the exposition only once the śramaṇa grasped the essence of the statements without misunderstanding and refuted them in a few hundred words Then he proposed his own theories and the heretic dumbfounded was at his wits end and could not utter a word in reply Frustrated the heretic retired in shame With deep respect for the śramaṇa the king built this monastery and after that the buddhadharma began to be spread in this country Not far from the monastery is a stupa built by King Aśoka The Tathāgata once preached the Dharma at this spot for seven days to enlighten the audience Beside it is a temple and there are traces where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down as well as some more stupas all built by King Aśoka to mark spots where the Tathāgata preached the Dharma Going southwest from here for more than seven hundred li I reached the country of Uḍa  The country of Uḍa is more than seven thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over twenty li in circuit The land is fertile and the crops are abundant with all kinds of fruit that is bigger in size than that of other countries Marvelous plants and famous owers are so rich in variety that I cannot give a full description The climate is temperate and the customs are tough and intrepid The people

more than a hundred monasteries with over ten thousand monks all of whom study the Mahayana teachings Deva temples are fty in number and the heretics live together There are over ten stupas built by King Aśoka at different places to mark the spots where the Tathāgata preached the Dharma Among the big mountains in the southwest part of the country is Puṣpagiri Monastery The stone stupa of this monastery shows many spiritual signs and on fast days it often emits a brilliant light Pure believers come here from far and near to offer garlands of owers in competition with each other If the handle of a canopy is placed under the dew basin or on the main structure of the stupa to resemble the shape of an inverted almsbowl the canopy will stick to the stupa just as a needle is attracted by a magnet The stupa in another monastery in the mountains to the northwest of this one shows the same strange phenomenon It is because these two stupas were built by deities and spirits that they possess such wonderful manifestations In the southeast part of this country is the city of Caritra by the seaside Over twenty li in circuit it is a passageway and stopping place for seagoing merchants and travelers The city wall is strong and high and within it there are many rare valuables Outside the city there are ve monasteries standing in a row The terraces and pavilions of the monasteries are lofty and the respected images are beautifully made The country of Siṃhala is over twenty thousand li away to the south When I looked into the distanc on a calm night I could see the precious pearl shining on top of the buddhatooth stupa in that country just as if a bright torch were burning in the sky From this city traveling through a great forest to the southwest for more than one thousand two hundred li I reached the country of Koṅgoda in the domain of East India The country of Koṅgoda is more than one thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over twenty li in circuit It borders

India though they speak in a quite different way They respect the heretics and do not believe in the buddhadharma There are over one hundred deva temples with more than ten thousand adherents In the whole country there are several tens of small towns located close to the mountains or on the routes that lead to the sea The city walls are strong and tall The soldiers are valorous and because the country is powerful and has inuence over neighboring countries they do not have a strong enemy Being situated on the coast the country stores many rare and valuable goods cowries and pearls are used as money It produces large darkish elephants that are capable of carrying heavy loads for long distances From here going southwest for one thousand and four or ve hundred li through a great wild jungle dense with tall trees that obscured the sun I reached the country of Kaliṅga  The country of Kaliṅga is more than ve thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over twenty li in circuit The crops are sown in the proper seasons and both owers and fruit thrive Woods and marshes extend to several hundred li at a stretch Iit produces darkish wild elephants that are valued by neighboring countries The climate is hot and the people are irascible and violent by custom most of them are rash and impetuous by nature though they are trustworthy and faithful They speak in a quick and uent manner with correct pronunciation but their phraseology is quite different from that of Central India A few of them believe in the right Dharma but the majority follow the heretics There are more than ten monasteries with over ve hundred monks who study the teachings of both the Mahayana and the Sthavira schools There are over one hundred deva temples and the heretics are numerous most of them are nirgranthas In olden times Kaliṅga was a rich and prosperous country with such a dense population that pedestrians jostled in the paths and carts collided on the highways if all the people were to raise their arms the sleeves of their clothing would form a curtain Recently it has been gradually reinhabited but it is still sparsely populated Not far to the south of the capital city is a stupa more than one hundred feet high built by King Aśoka Beside it are traces where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down On the great ridge of a mountain in the north frontier of the country is a stone stupa more than a hundred feet high This is the place where a pratyekabuddha entered nirvana at the beginning of the present kalpa when the human life span was countless years From here going northwest through mountains and forests for over a thousand eight hundred li I reached the country of Kosala in the domain of Central India The country of Kosala is more than six thousand li in circuit and is surrounded by mountains and ridges woods and marshes link with each other The capital city is over forty li in circuit The land is fertile and the soil productive The towns and villages are situated within sight of each other and the inhabitants are wealthy They are physically substantial stout and dark in complexion The social custom is indomitable and erce and the people are bold

and his benevolence is deep and farreaching There are over one hundred monasteries with nearly ten thousand monks all of whom study the Mahayana teachings Deva temples amount to over seventy and the heretics live together Not far to the south of the city is an old monastery beside it is a stupa built by King Aśoka In olden times the Tathāgata employing his great divine powers subjugated the heretics at this place and Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva later stayed in this monastery At that time Deva Bodhisattva came from the country of Siṃhala in hopes of holding a discussion He said to the guard Please announce my arrival The guard did so accordingly Nāgārjuna knowing well the name of Deva lled a bowl with water and said to a disciple Take this water and show it to Deva On seeing the bowl of water Deva silently dropped a needle into it He understands the deep meanings of things as cleverly as a divine being and his perception of subtle theories is second only to that of a saint Is this the wonderful eloquence of reticence Nāgārjuna said Water is something that may be either round or square depending on the vessel that contains it and it can carry away anything whether clean or deled It ows everywhere without interruption and it is limpid but unfathomable I showed him a bowlful of water to signify that my allaround wisdom and he dropped a needle into the water to hint that he could get to the bottom of my knowledge Usher him in quickly Now Nāgārjuna was a man of austere deportment with a stern appearance and whoever talked with him always lowered his head Please come closer so that we may discuss the deep and abstruse teachings Hearing these words Deva felt selfconceit and before starting the exposition of the profound theories he rst put forward an argument in a plausible and lengthy manner When he raised his head to look at his opponent he suddenly saw aweinspiring features which rendered him dumbfounded and unable to speak I shall teach you the supreme and wonderful truth the real teachings of the King of the Dharma Deva then prostrated himself before Nāgārjuna and promised to devote his life and his whole mind to him saying From now on I will listen to your instructions Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva was skilled in pharmacology By taking medicated nourishment he lived to be several hundred years of age with unfading mental and physical faculties With the aid of such miraculous potions King ātavāha also reached the age of several centuries His youngest son said to his mother When will I be able to succeed to the throne The princes mother said In view of the present situation there is no xed date Your father the king is several hundred years old and many of his offspring have predeceased him This is all due to the power of bliss of Nāgārjuna as well as his skill in the medical arts When the bodhisattva is no more the king will certainly fall into extinction Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva is a person of great wisdom and profound compassion He renders service to all living beings and regards his own body as excrement You may approach him and beg him to cutt off his head If you succeed in the attempt you will be able to fulll your wishes Under his mothers instruction the prince came to the monastery The guard had ed in fear so the prince had free admittance to the premises Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva was walking up and down reciting a eulogistic stanza when he suddenly saw the prince He stopped walking and asked him Why have you come to the monastery this evening in such a hurry as if some urgent and fearful thing has happened The prince said in reply I had a discussion with my compassionate mother and I said that the scriptures and proverbs mention that almsgivers give alms to others for sustaining their precious lives but no one would give up his own body to someone who asked for it My compassionate mother said It is not so The Sugatas of the ten directions and the tathāgatas of the three periods diligently seek the Buddhas way from their mental initiation up to their attainment of buddhahood They acquire forbearance by observing the disciplinary rules they lie down to feed animals or they cut their own esh to ransom doves King Candraprabha gave his head as alms to a brahman and King Maitrībala fed hungry yakṣas with his own blood Such instances are too numerous to cite and examples can be found among the enlightened ones of all generations Now Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva you are a man cherishing high ambitions I am in need of a human head but for many years I could not nd anyone who would voluntarily give his head to me If I kill someone by force I would be deeply sinful and to slaughter an innocent person is notoriously immoral But you a bodhisattva have practiced the sacred Way in expectation of attaining buddhahood in the future your kindness has benetted all sentient beings without limit You slight your body as a bit of shifting cloud and treat it with contempt as if it were a rotten log I seek the fruition of buddhahood and in imitation of the Buddha I can forsake anything This body of mine is as an echo or a bubble It rotates in the four forms of birth and transmigrates in the six ways of reincarnation I have made a great vow that I should never go against others wishes But my dear prince there is one thing we should not do When I am dead your father will also perish Please consider the matter and see who can save him Then Nāgārjuna walked around to see what could be used to take his own life He took up a blade of dry cogon grass to cut his throat and severed his head just as if it had been cut by a sharp sword Seeing this sight the prince was terried and ed The palace gatekeeper reported to the king and informed him of everything The king was greatly aggrieved to hear the evil tidings that Nāgārjuna died More than three hundred li to the southwest of the country is Bhrāmaragiri Mountain which is lofty and has precipitous peaks and cliffs and because it has no slopes to form a valley it seems to be composed entirely of rock King ātavāha chiseled the rocky mountain to build a monastery for Nāgārjuna At a point more than ten li away from the mountain a passageway was cut leading up to the foot of the mountain and then continuing upward through excavation of the rocks The pavilions are arranged in ve tiers on each tier there are four courtyards with shrines and each shrine has a golden lifesize image of the Buddha carved with perfect workmanship The other places are decorated with gold and jewels Water is channeled from the high peaks of the mountain to ow down around the pavilions to link them with the corridors Windows have been cut in the rocky walls to illuminate the chambers In the course of constructing this monastery King ātavāha ran short of laborers and the treasury was exhausted when the work was not yet half done Nāgārjuna said to him Why does Your Majesty seem to be heavyhearted The king said I cherished a great mind and ventured to establish a deed of blessedness hoping it would be everlasting up to the advent of Maitreya Buddha A sublime deed of supreme bliss will produce endless advantages With a great mind no worrisome problem is insoluble Be merry and happy when you return to your palace today On the morning of the day after tomorrow you may go out sightseeing in the countryside and then come here to talk about the construction work Having received this guidance the king worshiped Nāgārjuna by circumambulating him Nāgārjuna dropped mystical potions onto the big rocks and all of them turned into gold While on the excursion the king was delighted to see the gold He drove his carriage to the place of Nāgārjuna to whom he said Today while on a pleasure trip I was beguiled by deities and spirits into seeing heaps of gold in the mountains and woods Nāgārjuna said The gold has come into existence not through beguilement by spirits but due to your sincere devotion You should make use of it to accomplish your superior work The king then used the gold for the construction of the monastery and when the work was completed there was still surplus gold from which four large golden images were made on each of the ve tiers The remaining gold was used to replenish the treasury so that a thousand monks could be invited to live and carry out religious activities in the monastery Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva collected and classied the teachings of the Buddha and the treatises composed by various bodhisattvas and stored them in the monastery In the top tier only the buddha images and various scriptures and treatises were placed The lowest tier was used as dormitories for the monastic servants and storerooms for keeping property and miscellaneous things while the three middle tiers served as the monks lodgings I heard some old people say that after King ātavāha had completed the construction it was estimated that the amount of salt consumed by the workers cost nine koṭis of gold coins Afterward the monks had contention among themselves and they went to the king for a settlement The monastic servants said to one another While the monks are quarreling with each other in contradictory words some evil people are taking this opportunity to subvert the monastery So they locked the doors from the inside to repulse the monks Since then no monks have ever lived in this monastery When one looks at the rocky mountain from afar the path leading to the gate cannot be seen Whenever physicians were summoned to cure sick inmates they were taken in and out blindfolded so that they would not know the way Going southwest from here for more than nine hundred li through a large forest I reached the country of Andhra  The country of Andhra is more than three thousand li in circuit and its capital city Veṅgīpura is over twenty li in circuit The land is good and fertile yielding abundant crops The climate is warm and hot and the people are violent by custom Their spoken language is different from that of Central India but they follow the same rules of writing There are more than twenty monasteries with over three thousand monks Deva temples are more than thirty in number with numerous heretics Not far from Veṅgīpura is a great monastery consisting of storied pavilions and multitiered terraces beautifully decorated with engravings the images of the Buddha are most exquisitely made In front of the monastery is a stone stupa several hundred feet high built by the arhat cāra  Not far to the southwest of the monastery of the arhat cāra is a stupa built by King Aśoka The Tathāgata once preached the Dharma and showed great supernatural powers at this place and converted innumerable people Going southwest for more than twenty li from the monastery of the arhat cāra I reached a solitary hill On the peak of the hill is a stone stupa built at the place where Dignāga Bodhisattva composed the Hetuvidyāśāstra Dignāga Bodhisattva became a monk clad and donned the dyed robe after the Buddhas demise He was endowed with great intelligence and resolve and his power of wisdom was rm and strong Having pity for the helpless world he thought of propagating the holy teachings Considering the theories of hetuvidyā were so profound in wording and extensive in reasoning that no student could complete the study of it without great effort he retired to a secluded place in the mountains He xed his mind in meditation pondered the advantages and disadvantages of his writings and thought about the verbosity and concision of the textual meanings At that time as a sound echoed in the valley and the mist and clouds changed color the mountain god raised the bodhisattva to a height of several hundred feet and made an announcement saying Formerly the Buddha the Worldhonored One who guided the people appropriately spoke on the Hetuvidyāśāstra with a mind of compassion comprehending all wonderful systems of reasoning and delving into the meanings of subtle sayings After the demise of the Tathāgata the great teachings became extinct Now Dignāga Bodhisattva long endowed with bliss and intelligence and deeply understanding the gist of the sacred teachings will today propagate the Hetuvidyāśāstra again Bodhisattva emitted a brilliant light that shined on those who were in darkness At that moment the king seeing the light suspected with a mind of deep respect had entered the diamond samādhi and asked him to realize the fruition of birthlessness Dignāga said I sit in meditation to think about how to shed light on a profound text I expect to attain is the perfect enlightenment  I am not aiming at gaining the fruition of birthlessness  The king said The fruition of birthlessness is appreciated and admired by all holy persons because it cuts off the desires of the three realms of the world and makes one thoroughly master the three systems of learning this is a great event Please realize it without delay At that time Dignāga was pleased with the kings request When he was about to realize the sacred fruition of having nothing more to learn Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva knew his intention and had pity on him Wishing to admonish him Mañjuśrī said with a snap of his ngers What a pity Why should you give up the broad mind to adopt a narrow and inferior ambition and follow the line of selshness instead of an altruistic intention If you wish to perform benevolent deeds for others you should widely propagate the Yogācāra bhūmiśāstra composed by Maitreya Bodhisattva to guide younger scholars this would be of great advantage Dignāga Bodhisattva respectfully accepted the instruction and worshiped by circumambulating him Then he engaged himself in making a profound study to popularize the knowledge of hetuvidyā Because he feared that the meaning was too subtle and the wording too terse for students he wrote the Hetuvidyāśāstra to explain the principal gist and the subtle meanings in a comprehensive way for the guidance of younger students After that he propagated the Yogā cārabhūmiśāstra extensively His disciples were well known by their contemporaries Going south through forests and wilderness for more than one thousand li I reached the country of Dhānakaṭaka also known as Great Andhra in the domain of South India The country of Dhānakaṭaka is more than six thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over forty li in circuit The soil is fertile and produces rich crops There is much wasteland and few inhabited towns The climate is humid and hot and the people are dark in complexion violent by nature and fond of learning arts There are numerous monasteries crowded as closely together as the scales of a sh but most are deserted only about ten are still in use and they have more than a thousand monks who mostly study the teachings of the Mahāsāṃghika school There are over a hundred deva temples with innumerable heretics On the hillside to the east of the capital city is Pūrvaśaila Monastery and on the hillside to the west of the city is Avaraśaila West Mountain Monastery These were built for the Buddha by a former king of this country who reclaimed the river to make a path and cut the rocks to build tall pavilions with corridors and passageways in the steeps leading up to the peaks Spirits and deities guarded these monasteries which were frequented by saints and sages During the millennium after the Buddhas nirvana one thousand ordinary monks came here to spend the rainy season every year and on the day of dissolving the summer retreat they all attained arhatship and ew away through supernatural power At the end of the millennium ordinary and holy monks lived here together but no monks have resided at these monasteries for the last one hundred years The mountain gods changed themselves into the forms of jackals and wolves or apes and monkeys to scare off wayfarers and that is why the monasteries became deserted of resident monks Not far to the south of the city is a great mountain cliff which was the place where the śāstra master Bhāvaviveka stayed at Asuras Palace to wait for the advent of Maitreya Bodhisattva as a buddha The śāstra master was a person of magnanimous disposition with deep and sublime virtues Although he was outwardly clad in the garb of the Sāṃkhya sect he inwardly gloried the theories of Nāgārjuna When he heard that Dharmapāla Bodhisattva of the country of Magadha was spreading the teachings of the Dharma with a following of several thousand disciples he cherished the thought of having a discussion with him and holding his pewter staff went to see him On arriving in the city of Pāṭaliputra he came to know that Dharmapāla Bodhisattva was at the bodhi tree The śāstra master said to his disciple Go to the bodhi tree where Dharmapāla Bodhisattva is staying and convey my message to him The bodhisattva is preaching the bequeathed teachings of the Buddha to guide those who have gone astray I have admired your virtue with an open mind for a long time Owing to the nonfulllment of my former resolve however I failed to come to pay respect to you I vowed not to see the bodhi tree until I realized buddhahood and became a teacher of human and heavenly beings Dharmapāla Bodhisattva said to the messenger The human world is illusory and life is ephemeral As I practice religion with diligence and sincerity all day long I do not have time to hold a discussion The messenger went back and forth to convey the message but no interview was held The śāstra master returned to his own country and pondered quietly Until Maitreya Bodhisattva becomes a buddha who can solve my doubts Then he recited the Mahākāruṇikacittadhāraṇī before an image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva For three years he refrained from taking food and drank only water Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva then appeared in a beautiful body and said to the śāstra master What is your aspiration I wish to keep this body of mine so as to wait and see Maitreya Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva said As human life is fragile and the world is illusory you should cultivate superior good deeds in order to be reborn in Tuṣita Heaven where you can speedily see and pay homage  The śāstra master said I shall not give up my idea nor shall I change my mind The bodhisattva said If that is the case you should go to the country of Dhānakaṭaka where you can get your wish fullled by reciting the Vajrapāṇidhāraṇī at the place of the deity Vajrapāṇi on the mountain cliff to the south of the capital city The śāstra master then went there accordingly and recited the incantation After three years the deity said to him What is your wish for which you have worked so hard and vigorously The śāstra master said I wish to preserve this body of mine to wait and see Maitreya It was Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva who directed me to come here Are you the deity who will help me fulll my desire The deity then told him the secret and said to him Inside the cliff is Asuras Palace and if you act in accordance with my directive the cliff will open Once it is open you should immediately go in and you may wait there to see  The śāstra master said If I am conned inside how can I know when a buddha has come into the world Vajrapāṇi said I will inform you when Maitreya is born in the world The śāstra master did as he was instructed and devoted himself to reciting the incantation for three more years Hundreds and thousands of people witnessed the miracle and forgot to return home Standing at the entrance of the cave the śāstra master said to the crowd I have prayed for a long time wishing to wait and see Maitreya and now my great desire is to be fullled through the spiritual assistance of holy deities You may also come into the cave together with me to see the advent of a buddha Saying that the cavern of venomous snakes and fearing that they might lose their lives the people were frightened and no one dared to step through the door Only after repeated exhortation did six men follow Bhāvaviveka into the cave The śāstra master turned back to wave farewell to the crowd and in a composed manner he entered the cave and the cliff closed behind him The crowd felt sorry and repented of the faulty remarks they had made From here going southwest for more than one thousand li I reached the country of Cola  The country of Cola is two thousand and four or ve hundred li in circuit and its capital city is over ten li in circuit The empty land and elds lie in waste amid desolate marshes There are few inhabitants and bands of robbers openly run amok The climate is mild and warm The people are fraudulent by custom and erce by nature they believe in heretical religions The monasteries are dilapidated and have very few monks There are several tens of deva temples with many naked heretics Not far to the southeast of the city is a stupa built by King Aśoka The Tathāgata once manifested great supernatural powers preached the profound Dharma subjugated the heretics and converted many human and heavenly beings at this place Not far to the west of the city is an old monastery where Deva Bodhisattva held a discussion with an arhat Deva had heard that the arhat Uttara  who possessed the six supernatural powers and had attained the eight emancipations lived in this monastery He came from afar to visit this arhat When he arrived at the monastery he asked for lodging The arhat was content with few desires and had only one bed Because he had no spare bed for Deva he gathered a heap of withered leaves and invited Deva to sit on it The arhat then entered samādhi Maitreya gave him the relevant explanations and told him This was not known to you but Deva has cultivated himself in right practice for many kalpas in the past and he will achieve buddhahood during the present bhadrakalpa You should revere him with deep respect In the time it takes to snap ones ngers the arhat returned to his seat and continued to talk with Deva about the wonderful theories and analyze the subtle sayings Deva said to him What you have said is the exposition of the holy wisdom of Maitreya Bodhisattva Is that why you can make a full elucidation The arhat said What you have said is true He then arose from his seat to worship Deva with respect and praise Going south through jungles and wilderness for one thousand and ve or six hundred li I reached the country of Draviḍa  The country of Draviḍa is more than six thousand li in circuit and its capital city Kāñcīpura is over thirty li in circuit The soil is fertile and crops are plentiful It abounds in owers and fruit and yields precious substances The climate is hot The people are courageous and erce by custom and are entirely trustworthy They are nobleminded and have broad learning ITheir written and spoken language is slightly different from that of Central India There are more than a hundred monasteries with over ten thousand monks all of whom study and practice the teachings of the Sthavira school There are over eighty deva temples and most of the worshipers are naked heretics When the Tathāgata was living in the world he visited this country on several occasions to preach the Dharma for converting the people and King Aśoka built stupas at all the holy sites The city of Kāñcīpura was the birthplace of Dharmapāla Bodhisattva who was the eldest son of a minister of this country Since his childhood he had a magnanimous disposition and he was broadminded as an adult When he was twenty years old one of the kings daughters was betrothed to him but on the evening a banquet was held in celebration of the marriage he felt distressed and prayed before an image of the Buddha Moved by his sincerity a deity carried him off to a mountain monastery several hundred li away from his home As he sat in the buddha hall a monk opened the door and discovered the young man suspecting that he was a thief Upon interrogation Bodhisattva told the monk everything and asked to become a monk The community of monks amazed by his career gave him permission to satisfy his wish Meanwhile the king gave orders to search for him far and near and subsequently came to know that the bodhisattva had been carried away from the world by a deity Having been informed of this fact the king was most respectful and amazed After he donned the dyed robe as a monk Dharmapāla studied hard and well his reputation and character have been narrated in a previous passage Not far to the south of the capital city is a great monastery in which the wise and intelligent people of the country assembled There is a stupa more than a hundred feet high built by King Aśoka Formerly the Tathāgata preached the Dharma subjugated heretics and widely converted human and heavenly beings at this place Beside it are sites where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down From here going south for more than three thousand li I reached the country of Malakūṭa  The country of Malakūṭa is more than ve thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over forty li in circuit The land has saline soil and agricultural yields are poor Most of the precious products from the islands in the sea are collected in this country The climate is very hot and the people are mostly dark in complexion They are upright and indomitable in disposition and follow both the erroneous faiths and the right one They do not uphold the learning of the arts but they are good at  There are many ruined foundations of old monasteries but very few existing ones and the monks are also few in number There are several hundred deva temples with many heretics most of whom are naked ascetics Not far to the east of the city is an old monastery whose buildings are dilapidated but the foundations are still in existence It was constructed by Mahendra a younger brother of King Aśoka At the east side is a stupa whose the high foundation has collapsed but the dome which is in the shape of an inverted almsbowl still exists It was built by King Aśoka The Tathāgata once preached the Dharma showed great supernatural powers and converted innumerable people at this place so the stupa was built to mark the holy site Even after such a long time has passed it is all the more divine and can answer whatever prayer is said to it Near the sea in the south of the country is Malaya Mountain with its lofty cliffs and ridges and deep valleys and gullies On the mountain there are white sandal trees and candaneva trees which similar to white sandal trees indeed the two are indistinguishable At the height of summer if one goes to a high place to look out and sees a tree entwined by a large snake one knows that it is a candaneva tree This species of tree is cool by nature so snakes like to entwine themselves upon it Having seen the tree one should shoot an arrow to mark the place and then come to cut it down after the winter solstice The trunk of the karpūra tree is similar to that of the pine tree but the leaves owers and fruit differ from those of the pine The freshly cut wood has no fragrance but when it is dried and split along the grain an aromatic substance in a form like mica and the color of ice or snow is found This is what is known as camphor To the east of Malaya Mountain is Potalaka Mountain which has perilous paths and precipitous cliffs and valleys On top of the mountain is a lake of clear water owing into a large river that courses twenty times around the mountain before entering the South Sea Beside the lake is a stone heavenly palace frequented by Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva Those who wish to see the bodhisattva risk their lives to cross the river and climb the mountain regardless of hardship and danger but only a few of them reach their destination When the inhabitants living at the foot of the mountain pray to see the bodhisattva he appears either in the form of Maheśvara or as an ashsmearing heretic to console them and answer their prayers On the seaside northeast of the mountain is a city located on the way to the country of Siṃhala in the South Sea I heard the local people say that from here going southeast over the sea for more than three thousand li one can reach the country of Siṃhala known in China as the Country of Lions not in the domain of India End of Fascicle X of The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions Twentythree Countries from Siṃhala to Varṇu Though it is not a country in the domain of India I passed by it and put it here as an appendix Though it is not a country in the domain of India I passed by it and put it here as an appendix Formerly known as Persia Note on Siṃhala by Zeng He The country of Siṃhala is more than seven thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over forty li in circuit The soil is fertile and the climate is warm and hot The crops are sown and planted in the proper seasons and owers and fruit are plentiful The country is densely populated with wealthy families The people are short in stature and black in complexion with a rustic and ery disposition but they are fond of learning advocate virtue and promote the performance of good deeds in order to gain bliss This country is a precious island producing many valuable gems it was originally occupied by spirits and deities The daughter of a king of South India was once betrothed to a neighboring country When the girl was sent to get married on an auspicious day she encountered a lion on the way when the guards deserted her and ed the girl remained in her palanquin awaiting certain death but the lion king carried her away to the remote mountains and provided her with venison and fruit daily After some years she gave birth to a son and a daughter with human bodies but of animal extraction When the boy grew up he was so strong that he could wrestle with a erce animal At the age of twenty his human intelligence was developed and he said to his mother What am I with an animal as my father and a human being as my mother Since you are not of the same genus how could you have lived with him His mother then told him about the past and he said Human beings and animals go on different ways We should escape at once His mother said I have tried to escape but I have failed in the attempt Her son then followed the tracks of his lionfather over mountains and ridges to nd a way to ee from the calamity When his father was away he carried his mother and sister down to the region of human habitation His mother said You two should be prudent and not say anything about our origins If the people get wind of it they will despise us Then she and her children proceeded to her fathers country but it was no longer under the rule of her family and her relatives had all gone So she took lodging in the house of a townsman who asked her Where do you come from She said I am a native of this country and have been wandering about in alien lands without a home I have come back with my children to our homeland The people felt sorry for them and provided them with sustenance When the lion king came back and found his dwelling empty he was enraged by the loss of his family He went out of the valley to roam about the villages and towns roaring with fury wreaking havoc for the people and causing harm to living creatures When the townsfolk came out he would catch and kill them They beat drums blew conches armed themselves with crossbows and spears and traveled in groups to avoid being injured Fearing that the situation might jeopardize his sovereignty the king sent hunters to capture the lion and the king himself commanding myriads of soldiers of the four divisions of his troops lay in ambush in the dense forests and covered the valleys But the lion roared furiously and both men and horses ed in terror Having failed to seize the lion the king posted a proclamation saying that anyone who could capture the lion and rid the country of him would be handsomely rewarded in appreciation of his merit Hearing the kings order the lions son said to his mother We are suffering very much from hunger and cold Although he is an animal he is still your father How can we do him harm simply because we are living a hard life The son said Humans and animals belong to different species so what principle of morality exists between the two Since we have departed from him what may we anticipate in our minds He put a dagger into his sleeve and went to answer the call At that time hundreds and thousands of men and horses were assembled but no one dared to approach the lion who was crouching in the forest When his son came into his presence howver he became tame and docile and his parental affection appeased his anger His son then stabbed him in the abdomen with the dagger Even then the lion remained affectionate to his son and had no feeling of resentment His abdomen burst open and he died in pain The king said What sort of person is this who has done such a strange thing Enticed by promises of a reward and threatened by severe punishment the lions son told the whole story in full detail The king said How treacherous you are If you can kill even your own father what about unrelated people A person of animal blood is hard to tame and his brutal sentiment is easily aroused You have done a meritorious deed by ridding the people of the animal but because you killed your father your heart is treacherous indeed I shall grant you a rich reward as payment for your merit but I will banish you to a faroff place as punishment for your cruelty In this way the code of the country is maintained and I do not break my promise Then two big ships were prepared and furnished with a large amount of food and rations The mother was kept in this country and well looked after in reward of her merit while her son and daughter each embarked on a different ship drifting away with the waves The sons ship sailed over the sea to this precious island where he saw plenty of pearls and gems and so he settled down here When some merchants later came to the island to collect gems he killed the chief of the merchants and kept his daughter The populace multiplied gradually as a large number of offspring were produced They then established the system of king and subjects in superior and inferior positions They constructed a capital city built up villages and towns and occupied the territory of the country Because their forefather was the seizer of a lion they named the country by that title in commemoration of the merit of their origins The daughters ship oated to the west of Pārsa where she was bewitched by a spirit and gave birth to several daughters who then formed what is now called the Womens Country in the West The inhabitants of the country of Siṃhala are short in stature and black in complexion with square cheeks and big foreheads They are rustic and ery by temperament and cruel and malignant in disposition features inherited from the erce animal Therefore the people are mostly brave and stout This is one of the traditions According to the Buddhist tradition it is said that in the great iron city of this precious island there lived ve hundred rākṣasīs  On the tower over the city gate two pennants were hoisted high to signify good or ill luck When something good was going to happen the auspicious pennant uttered in the air and when something evil was going to occur the inauspicious one quivered The rākṣasīs always waited for merchants coming to the precious island they would change themselves into beautiful maidens to welcome and console the travelers with fragrant owers and music and lure them into the iron city After the merriment and feasting were over the merchants would be conned in an iron prison to be eventually eaten up At that time in Jambudvīpa there was a great merchant lord named Siṃha whose son was named Siṃhala As his father was getting old Siṃhala assumed responsibility for family affairs He led ve hundred merchants to sail the seas to collect valuables and they were driven to this precious island by the wind and waves When the rākṣasīs saw the auspicious pennant uttering in the air they held fragrant owers and played music to receive the guests and entice them into the iron city The young merchant lord joined with the queen of the rākṣasīs in happiness and merry enjoyment and each of the other merchants found a spouse for himself After a year each of them had a son born to him The rākṣasīs were unfaithful to their paramours and intended to cast them into the iron prison and wait for other merchants to come Then Siṃhala had an evil dream and knew that it was an ill omen He secretly sought a way of returning home When he approached the iron prison he heard the sound of pitiful wailing So he climbed up a tree and asked Who imprisoned you that you are crying so sorrowfully The prisoners said Do you not know that all the women in the city are rākṣasīs Formerly they lured us into the city to make merry with us but just before your arrival they put us into this prison and began eating us as their food Before long you will suffer the same calamity Siṃhala asked By what means can I escape from such a disaster The prisoners said We have heard that on the seaside there is a heavenly horse If you say prayers with sincerity it will surely rescue you Having heard this warning Siṃhala secretly told it to his merchant companions and so they faced the seaside and prayed earnestly for help At that time the heavenly horse came and told them All of you should grasp my mane rmly and do not look back I will carry you across the sea to save you from disaster and send you home to Jambudvīpa The merchants did as they were told and gripped the mane of the horse intently When the rākṣasīs found that their husbands were gone they related the news to one another wondering where they had gone They brought their infant sons with them and ew to and fro in the air When they learned that the merchants were about to go across the sea they called to each other to y the long distance together In a short time they met the company of merchants with mixed feelings of grief and joy shedding tears of emotion Each of them covered her face and sobbed saying to her husband I am lucky to have been acquainted with you my good man and we lived together happily in conjugal affection for a long time But now you are trying to go away leaving your wife and child to live in solitude and long for you in despair How can you be so hardhearted I hope you will stay and return with us to the city The merchants would not listen to their entreaties however Since the rākṣasīs had failed in their tactful solicitation they resorted to coquetry to seduce them with bewitchment and the merchants could not withstand their amorous fascination Just at the moment they hesitated about whether to go or stay they dropped from the air The rākṣasīs were overjoyed and returned home with the merchants Siṃhala was a person of deep wisdom with no attachment in his mind so he succeeded in crossing the great sea and was spared from the disaster The queen of the rākṣasīs returned to the iron city emptyhanded The other rākṣasīs said to her Since you are devoid of wisdom and tact you should not stay here The queen with her son then ew to where Siṃhala was and tried all means of feminine charm to persuade him to return with her Brandishing a sword Siṃhala recited an incantation and shouted at her You are a rākṣasī but I am a man We go on different ways and are not compatible If you importune me to go with you I will kill you at once Knowing that she could not prevail upon him the rākṣasī ew away to Siṃhalas home There she lied to his father Siṃha saying I am a princess of a certain country and I married Siṃhala and had a son In the course of traveling over the obstacles of mountains and rivers we suffered the hardships of cold and hunger Because one word was uncongenial to Siṃhala he forsook me and using insolent language he slandered me as a rākṣasī It is too far away to return to my own country and if I stay here I will have to live in solitude Because I am in such a dilemma I have come to state my case to you Siṃha said If what you have said is true then come in and live in my house Siṃhala returned shortly after the rākṣasī took up her abode and his father said to him How is it that you value wealth but slight your wife and son Siṃhala said She is but a rākṣasī and then told everything to his father His clanspeople and relatives all came to expel her but the rākṣasī lodged an accusation against them before the king The king was ready to mete out punishment to Siṃhala who said She is a rākṣasī full of feminine bewitchment Tthe king was already attracted by the beauty of the rākṣasī and believeing that his words untrue he said to Siṃhala If you insist on deserting this woman leave her in my harem Siṃhala said I am afraid it will cause you disaster The rākṣasīs are maneaters Tthe king would not listen to Siṃhalas advice however and took the rākṣasī as his wife In the latter half of the night she ew back to the precious island and summoned the ve hundred rākṣasīs to come with her to the palace There they repeated evil incantations and committed cruelties eating the esh and drinking the blood of the people and animals in the palace Afterward they brought the remains of the corpses back to the precious island At dawn the following morning the ministers came to have an audience with the king but they found the palace gate tightly closed and though they waited for a long time they heard no one speaking So they broke the door open entered the palace and found it empty except for heaps of skeletons Startled at the sight they looked at each other helplessly crying and wailing in grief not knowing the cause of the calamity When Siṃhala told them the story the ministers realized that the king had suffered from his own actions The state assistants and old ministers as well as senior ofcials and veteran generals then went in search of a virtuous and talented person of sublime character to serve as king They all esteemed Siṃhala as a person of blessedness and wisdom They discussed the matter saying The nomination of a king should not be done at random Without blessedness and wisdom he cannot enjoy the throne and without sensitivity and sagacity how can he manage state affairs Siṃhala is someone who is endowed with such qualities He foresaw in a dream a presage of disaster and inspired the heavenly horse  Out of loyalty he pleaded with the king against the rākṣasī and through his cleverness he preserved his own life It is destined by heaven that he should start a new dynasty Siṃhala declined the honor but his refusal was not accepted So he agreed to hold sway according to the principle of the golden mean and after paying due respect to the ministers he ascended the throne He corrected former corrupt practices and commended sages and good people He issued an order saying My former merchant companions are still in the country of the rākṣasīs I do not know whether they are alive or dead and their fate is unknown In order to rescue them we must reorganize our troops It is a blessing of the country to succor those who are in trouble and sympathize with those who are loyal As for the collection of gems and valuables this will also be to the nations advantage Then he arrayed his troops and sent them across the sea At that time the pennant of evil omen on the gate of the iron city quivered The rākṣasīs frightened by the sight came out to receive the troops intending to cheat and tempt them with seductive bewitchment Knowing their fraudulence well the king Siṃhala ordered his soldiers to recite incantations and to bravely undertake military action The rākṣasīs tumbled in retreat either escaping to hide in an islet or drowning in the great sea The iron city was destroyed and the iron prison broken all the merchants were released and a large quantity of pearls and gems was obtained Common people were invited to immigrate to the precious island where they constructed a capital city and built villages and towns Consequently the country was established called Siṃhala after the name of their king This tale of Siṃhala is a story of ākya Tathāgata in one of his previous incarnations Formerly the inhabitants of the country of Siṃhala worshiped only inappropriate gods During the rst century after the Buddhas demise King Aśokas younger brother Mahendra relinquished the secular life of passionate desire and aimed at the fruition of sainthood he attained the six supernatural powers and possessed the eight emancipations He walked through the air and came to this country to propagate the right Dharma and spread the Buddhas bequeathed teachings Since then the people have followed the pure faith There are several hundred monasteries with more than twenty thousand monks who follow the teachings of both the Mahayana and Sthavira schools More than two hundred years after the arrival of the buddhadharma they divided into two separate sects each specializing in its own theories One was the Mahāvihāra sect which refuted the Mahayana teachings and advocated Hinayana tenets The other was the Abhayagiri sect which studied the teachings of both yānas and propagated the Tripiṭaka The monks strict and pure in practicing the disciplinary rules are experts in meditation and have brilliant wisdom Many of them have model conduct and serve as teachers of good behavior Beside the royal palace is the Temple of the Buddhas Tooth several hundred feet high and decorated with pearls and rare gems A signal post is installed on the temple with a huge padmarāga afxed to it which emits a refulgent light that when viewed from a distance shines as brightly as a star day or night The king bathes the tooth relic three times a day with scented water and burns powdered incense as an offering in an extremely opulent manner Beside the Temple of the Buddhas Tooth is a small shrine also decorated with various lustrous gems inside of whicd is a golden image of the Buddha cast after the form of a previous king of this country with a precious gem embedded in the protuberance on the head A thief once intended to steal the gem but the shrine was guarded at one door after another in enclosures of railings under close surveillance So he dug an underground passage and entered the temple through the tunnel When he attempted to take the gem however the image rose higher and higher The thief could not reach the gem and withdrew saying with a sigh When the Tathāgata was practicing the bodhisattva way he cherished a great mind and made a solemn vow that out of compassion he would give everything including his life and country to the living beings of the four forms of birth How can it be then that his image is so stingy and unwilling to part with the gem I may well say that it does not know of the past events At these words the image bent its head to allow the man to take away the gem Having obtained the gem the thief went to nd a purchaser People who saw it said This is the gem that was on the protuberance of the golden image of the Buddha made by the previous king Where did you get this Are you trying to sell it here They seized him and reported to the king When the king asked him where he got it the thief said The Buddha gave it to me I did not steal it Thinking that the thief was being dishonest the king sent people to view the image and they found its head was inclined Seeing this spiritual manifestation the king strengthened his faith He did not punish the man but redeemed the gem for a large ransom It was reset on the head of the image as an adornment for the protuberance That is why the head of the image is still bending down up to now Beside the royal palace there was a great kitchen which provided food for eighteen thousand monks every day At mealtimes the monks came with their almsbowls to receive food and after receiving their share they returned to their respective abodes Since the time Buddhism was rst introduced into this country the tradition of making offerings to the monks has been carried out from generation to generation up to the present age Owing to political turmoil and the lack of an established king in the last decade or so however this tradition has not been maintained Along the seacoast of this country pearls and gems are produced When the king came to pray to the gods they would present him with extraordinary items Townspeople come to dig for gems up and down but the output varies according to ones luck They have to pay taxes on whatever amount of gems they procure At the southeast corner of the country is Laṅkā Mountain with lofty cliffs and deep valleys that are haunted by spirits and ghosts The Tathāgata once came here and delivered the Laṅkāsūtra Sailing south of this country for several thousand li one reaches the island of Nārikela The islanders are short in stature about three feet tall Although they have human bodies their mouths are like the beaks of birds They raise no crops and live only on coconuts Sailing westward from the island of Nārikela for several thousand li one comes to a solitary islet On the eastern cliff there is a stone image of the Buddha over one hundred feet high facing east in a sedentary posture with a moonstone as the protuberance on its head When the moonlight shines upon it water ows out from the gem over the rocky slope down to the valley A company of merchants was once driven by a hurricane to this solitary islet and because the salty seawater was undrinkable they suffered thirst for a long time It happened to be a full moon day and the water owing down from the top of the image saved all the merchants Thinking that they had been saved by spirits moved by their sincerity they stayed there for a few days When the moon was overshadowed by the lofty cliffs no water owed down The chief of the merchants said It may not be for the sake of saving us that the water owed down I have heard that when a moonstone is under the shining moonlight water ows out from it Is it possible that a moonstone is on top of the Buddhas image They climbed up the cliffs to have a look and saw that the protuberance on the head of the image was made of moonstone A man who had witnessed the event related the whole story Sailing to the west from the country for several thousand li one reaches a great precious island that is not inhabited by human beings but is merely an abode of deities On a quiet night one may see from a distance the brightly illuminated mountains and rivers Many merchants visited this island but none of them obtained anything From the north of the country of Draviḍa entering a wild jungle and passing by isolated cities and small towns where evil people caused trouble to wayfarers I traveled more than two thousand li and arrived in the country of Koṅkaṇapura  The country of Koṅkaṇapura is more than ve thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over thirty li in circuit The land is fertile yielding rich crops and the climate is warm and hot The people who are impetuous by custom are dark in complexion and erce and tough in disposition but they are fond of learning and uphold virtue and arts There are more than a hundred monasteries with over ten thousand monks who study and practice the teachings of both the Mahayana and Hinayana schools Deva temples number several hundred and heretics of different faiths live together Next to the city of the royal palace is a great monastery with over three hundred monks all of whom are people of outstanding virtue and talent In the monastery there is a great temple more than a hundred feet high in which is preserved a precious crown of Prince Sarvārthasiddha less than two feet high adorned with precious jewels and kept in a precious chest On each fast day it is taken out placed on a high dais and incense and owers are offered to it It sometimes emits a bright light In the great monastery next to the city there is a temple more than fty feet high in which is enshrined a statue of Maitreya Bodhisattva over ten feet tall carved out of sandalwood On fast days it sometimes emits a divine light It was made by the arhat rutiviṃśatikoṭi Not far to the north of the city is a wood of tāla trees more than thirty li in circuit The leaves of this kind of tree are long broad and glossy and they are used as writing paper in various countries In the wood there is a stupa that marks the place where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down Beside it is another stupa in which the relics of the arhat ruti viṃ śatikoṭi are preserved Not far to the east of the city is a stupa whose base has collapsed the remaining part is about thirty feet above the ground I heard some old people say that it contains relics of the Tathāgata that occasionally emit a divine light on fast days Once the Tathāgata preached the Dharma at this place and manifested supernatural powers to convert a mass of people Not far to the southwest of the city is a stupa more than a hundred feet high built by King Aśoka at the spot where the arhat rutiviṃśatikoṭi showed great supernatural powers to convert living beings Beside it is the ruined base of a monastery constructed by the arhat From here going northwest and entering a great wild jungle infested with ferocious animals harassed by cruel bandits in gangs I journeyed for two thousand and four or ve hundred li and reached the country of Mahārāṣṭra  The country of Mahārāṣṭra is more than six thousand li in circuit and its capital city bordered by a large river on the west is over thirty li in circuit The land is fertile and yields plenty of crops The climate is warm and hot and the people simple and honest by custom are tall and sturdy in stature and are proud and carefree by nature When they are about to take vengeance they notify their opponent beforehand so that both parties can put on armor to ght a duel On the battleeld they chase after defeated enemies but they do not kill those who have surrendered No punishment is meted out to defeated soldiers and generals but they are made to put on womens clothing to shame them into committing suicide The state keeps several hundred warriors Before each decisive battle they become intoxicated with wine and a single one of them leading the vanguard of the ghters can frustrate the bellicose spirit of a host of enemies If they injure the inhabitants the state will not punish them The vanguard beats the drums each time they come out for an battle Moreover they raise several hundred violent elephants which are also fed with wine before taking part in an engagement The trample and stampede wildly and break down all resistance before them Relying on the strength of these warriors and elephants the king looks down on neighboring countries The king named Pulakeśin is a kṣatriya by caste He is an astute man of farsighted resourcefulness who extends kindness to all and his subjects serve him with perfect loyalty The great King īlāditya has invaded from the east and west and a number of countries far and near have either pledged allegiance to him or become his vassals only the country has refused to acknowledge his suzerainty On several occasions īlāditya led the armed forces of the ve parts of India and summoned heroic ghters of various countries under his personal command to invade this country but he failed to win a victory Such is the militancy of this country but its social customs are quite different The people are fond of learning and profess both heterodox and orthodox doctrines There are more than a hundred monasteries with over ve thousand monks who study comprehensively both the Maha yana and Hinayana teachings Deva temples are counted by the hundreds and the heretics are quite numerous Within and without the great city are ve stupas built by King Aśoka to mark sites where the four past buddhas sat and walked up and down The other stone and brick stupas are too numerous to be described in detail Not far to the south of the city is an old monastery in which is enshrined a stone image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva that possesses latent spiritual power and often answers prayers In the eastern part of the country there is a great mountain whose peaks join together to form a screen with steep cliffs rising in a range In the deep valley there is a monastery with lofty halls and spacious houses on the peaks at the back and storied pavilions and mulitiered terraces standing before the cliffs facing the gully This monastery was built by the arhat cāra known as Suoxing Behavior in Chinese who was a native of West India After his mother had died he observed where she had been reborn and saw that she was reborn as a girl in this country The arhat came here with the intention of guiding and taking his mother as the occasion arose He entered the village to collect alms and came to the house where his mother had been reborn When the girl came out to offer him food her breasts spontaneously yielded milk Her kinsfolk thought it was inauspicious but the arhat told them the cause of the phenomenon and thereupon the girl realized the fruition of sainthood In order to repay the kindness of his mother for giving birth to him in her previous life as a result of karmic forces the arhat built this monastery out of gratitude for her deep virtue The great temple of the monastery is more than a hundred feet high enshrined within is a stone image of the Buddha over seventy feet tall Above the image are suspended seven tiers of stone canopies that are neither attached nor supported each separated from the one above it by a space of about three feet I heard some old people say that the canopies were supported by the willpower of the arhat or by his supernatural powers or by the efcacy of drugs and magic I made an actual investigation but could not nd out the real cause All around the temple engraved on the stone walls are carvings depicting the events of the Tathāgata when he was practicing the bodhisattva way in his previous lives such as the good omens of his realization of sainthood and the spiritual signs of his entering nirvana including all major and minor items carved in full detail Outside the gate of the monastery at the south and north and to the right and left are stone elephants each standing at a point I heard some native people say that these elephants have occasionally trumpeted and caused earthquakes Formerly Dignāga Bodhisattva spent most of his time in this monastery From here going west for more than one thousand li and after crossing the Narmadā River I reached the country of Bharukacchapa in the domain of South India The country of Bharukacchapa is two thousand four hundred or ve hundred li in circuit and its capital city is over twenty li in circuit The soil is saline and plants are sparse Salt is produced by boiling seawater and the sea provides protable occupations The climate is hot with abrupt cyclones blowing violently The people are stingy by custom and deceitful in disposition They are ignorant of learning and arts and believe in both heterodox and orthodox doctrines There are over ten monasteries with more than three hundred monks who study Mahayana and Sthavira teachings Deva temples are more than ten in number and the heretics live together From here going northwest for more than two thousand li I reached the country of Mālava  The country of Mālava is more than six thousand li in circuit and its capital city over thirty li in circuit is situated on the southeast bank of the Mahī River The land is fertile producing rich crops with luxuriant vegetation and plenty of owers and fruit The soil is specially good for growing winter wheat so the inhabitants mostly eat pancakes and baked wheat our The people are benign by nature and are generally intelligent They speak a rened language and are well educated In all the ve parts of India there are two countries in which learning is emphasized one is the country of Mālava in the southwest and the other is the country of Magadha in the northeast The people prize virtue advocate lovingkindness and being diligent and clever they work hard at learning In this country both heterodox and orthodox doctrines are followed and there are several hundred monasteries with more than twenty thousand monks who study the teachings of the Hinayana Saṃmitīya school Deva temples are several hundred in number with numerous heretics mostly ashsmearing ascetics It is recorded in the local history that sixty years ago the king named īlāditya was a person of brilliant wisdom and resourcefulness with broad and profound knowledge From his birth up to his old age he was never angry with anyone and never killed living beings He was so kind that even the drinking water for elephants and horses was ltered before it was given to them lest insects in the water would be injured During his reign of more than fty years wild animals were friendly with people and in the whole country the people never killed or harmed them Beside the royal palace was a temple built by the most skilled workmen decorated with all kinds of adornments Images of the seven buddhas were kept inside the temple An unlimited assembly was held regularly every year to which monks from the four quarters were invited to receive offerings of the four monastic requisites or the three types of robes and the seven kinds of precious gems This good deed has been done from generation to generation without interruption More than twenty li to the northwest of the great city one comes to a brahman village Beside it is a pit which never overows when water ows into it from different sources even under the excessive rains that last ten days at a stretch during the autumn and summer seasons Beside the pit was a small stupa I heard some old people say that this was the place where an arrogant brahman of yore fell into hell alive In this village there was once a brahman who was a man of erudition the most prominent among his contemporaries learned in both Buddhist and heretical texts As a person of lofty character his fame spread far The king respected him appreciatively and the people venerated him as a teacher His disciples who were counted in the thousands followed his theories and admired his way of teaching He often said I was born into the world to transmit the teachings of the sages in order to guide ordinary people None of the former sages or future philosophers are my equal The people are enthusiastic in propagating the theories of Maheśvaradeva Vāsudeva Nārāyaṇadeva and the Worldhonored Buddha and they draw pictures of them for pious worship But I now surpass them all in virtue and my reputation is dominant at the present time I should be different from them all otherwise how can I distinguish myself So he carved images of Maheśvaradeva Vāsudeva Nārāyaṇadeva and the Worldhonored Buddha in red sandalwood and made a seat with four legs which was carried wherever he went Such was his attitude of overweening pride At that time in West India there was a bhikṣu called Bhadraruci known as Xianai Friendly Affection in Chinese a highly learned logician who had fully mastered the theories of heretical treatises He was pure in conduct and observed the disciplinary rules in such a perfect manner that his moral inuence affected others just like the strong fragrance of owers does He had little desire and was quite content never seeking material welfare He told his intention to the king who on seeing that he was dressed in a shabby robe did not have any feeling of veneration for him Due to his lofty ambition however the king was obliged to pay the monk due respect He prepared debating seats and invited the brahman who said with a smile Who is it that dares to cherish such an ambition He ordered his disciples to come to the debating ground and hundreds and thousands of people assembled to listen to the argumentation Bhadraruci wearing his shabby robe sat on a heap of grass spread on the ground while the brahman sat on the seat that he carried with him The brahman refuted the right Dharma and propagated erroneous theories The bhikṣu argued uently for several rounds and at last defeated the brahman  The king said  With your false repute you have cheated the king and beguiled the people for a long time It is laid down in the ancient code that the party defeated in a debate should be put to death A piece of hot iron from a stove was made ready for the brahman to sit on The brahman pressed in such an awkward predicament took refuge in Bhadraruci and pleaded for his help The bhikṣu said to the king The inuence of Your Majestys kindness spreads far and your good reputation is known to all Please be compassionate and do not resort to cruel punishment Pardon him for his mistakes and let him go wherever he wishes The king ordered the brahman to ride on a donkey to announce his defeat all around the city Put to such shame the brahman felt so gravely insulted that he spat blood Hearing this the bhikṣu went to comfort him and said You are learned in both Buddhist and heretical doctrines and your fame reaches far and near Concerning the matter of glory or insult you should know how to deal with it What is substantial in the matter of fame The brahman indignant rebuked the bhikṣu slandered the Mahayana teachings and scorned the ancient saints Before he had nished speaking his blasphemy the earth cracked open and he fell alive into the crevice The site still remains there From there rounding a cape and going northwest for two thousand four hundred or ve hundred li I reached the country of Aṭali in the domain of South India The country of Aṭali is more than six thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over twenty li

temple to seek the help of the god The priest in charge of the temple speaking on the gods behalf said that the prince would surely be cured and there was no need to worry The king was pleased to hear this On his way back home he met with a śramaṇa who had a remarkable demeanor Surprised to see the mendicants appearance and garments the king inquired where he had come from This śramaṇa who had realized sainthood wished to spread the buddhadharma and that was why he was dressed as he was He answered the king saying I am a disciple of the Tathāgata a bhikṣu as people say Feeling worried in his mind the king anxiously said to him My son is ill and in critical condition The śramaṇa said Even though the spirits of your ancestors may be brought back to life it will be difcult to save your

entanglemed in the cycle of rebirth When my son was ill I asked the god about his fate and the god lied and said that my son would certainly be cured of his illness Please have pity on me and guide this deluded disciple He invited the śramaṇa to make a plan for the construction of a monastery according to established rules The temple of the old monastery was built for the arhat and since then

country The king professed himself a descendant of Cīnadevagotra  Formerly the country was a wild valley in the ranges of the Cong Ling Mountains In the past a Persian king once obtained a Chinese lady for his queen As the bride was being taken to Persia she passed this place at a time when a rebellion was taking place The road leading from east to west was blocked so the kings bride was lodged on an isolated peak so steep and lofty that ladders had to be used for going up and down Guards were posted around the peak to keep watch day and night After three months the uprising was quelled but when the bride was about to resume the journey she was found to be pregnant The envoy who escorted her was terrorstricken and said to his followers The king ordered us to bring his bride back but we met with the revolt and remained in a precarious situation in the wilds not knowing what would befall us Thanks to the virtuous inuence of our king the insurgency has been put down Now at this moment of resuming our return journey the kings bride is found to be with child I am worried about the situation and do not know where I will die We should nd the chief culprit so that he can be put to death later They made a clamorous interrogation but could not nd out the true criminal At that moment the brides maidservant told the envoy Do not condemn anyone Tthe pregnancy is due to her union with a god Every day at noon a man emerged from the disc of the sun and came to this place on horseback The envoy said If that is so how can we free ourselves of the blame If we go back we shall be put to death but if we stay here troops will be sent to attack us What shall we do in such an awkward predicament They all said This is not a trivial matter Who would go willingly to suffer the punishment of death We sgould instead pass our days abroad So they built a palace and other houses on the top of a rocky peak more than three hundred paces in circuit They constructed a city wall around the palace and made the Chinese lady their queen Ofcials were appointed and a legal system was established When the time was came she gave birth to a son who grew up into a handsome lad He received the title of king and his mother acted as regent He could y about in the air and had control over the wind and clouds His prestige and virtue spread far and his fame and edication extended to a great distance All the neighboring regions and countries became his vassal states When at length this king died at an old age his corpse was entombed in a cave in the mountains over one hundred li southeast of the capital The corpse has become a mummy and is still intact resembling an emaciated gure that seems to be fast asleep Its garments are changed from time to time and sweet owers are always placed before it by his descendants from generation to generation up to the present time Because their maternal ancestor was a Chinese lady and on the paternal side he was the sun god they claimed to be descendants of Chinesesungod stock The facial features of the members of the royal clan are similar to those of Chinese people and they wear square caps but they dress in the attire of the Hu people Their offspring degenerated and suffered oppression from powerful countries When King Aśoka prospered in the world he built a stupa in the palace and the king went to live in the northeast corner of the palace He converted his old palace into a monastery for the venerable śāstra master Kumaralāta The terraces and pavilions were lofty and spacious and solemn images of the Buddha were installed in them The venerable monk a native of the country of Takṣaśilā was intelligent since childhood and renounced the world at an early age to engage in the study of the scriptures and x his mind on the abstruse doctrines Every day he recited thirtytwo thousand words and wrote them down as well Thus he was prominent in learning among contemporary scholars and enjoyed a high reputation in his time He upheld the right Dharma and crushed erroneous views in his brilliant discussions there was no question he could not answer He was greatly esteemed in all of the ve parts of India His writings amounted to several tens of books all of which were popular works studied by all scholars He was the founder of the Sautrāntika school In his time Aśvaghoṣa in the east Deva in the south Nāgārjuna in the west and Kumaralāta in the north were called the Four Brilliant Suns Hearing of this venerable monks great fame the king of this country mobilized his troops attacked the country of Takṣaśilā and captured him It was out of respect for him that this monastery was constructed More than three hundred li away to the southeast of the capital is a great rocky cliff with two caves In each cave an arhat entered the samādhi of complete extinction sitting erect and immovable in the shape of an emaciated man and their skin and skeletons are undecayed They have been there for more than seven hundred years Their hair continues to grow so the monks shave their hair and change their garments once a year From the great cliff going northeast over ranges by a dangerous path for more than two hundred li I reached Puṇyaśālā  located at the center of a depression about one hundred qing in area  qing   hectares It is surrounded by four mountains of the eastern ridges of the Cong Ling Mountains Snow accumulates in winter as well as in the summer season and the cold wind blows hard and strong The land is of saline soil and does not grow crops There are no trees only short grasses Even in the hot season snowstorms are likely to occur On entering this region travelers may be immediately enshrouded by clouds and mist This is a dangerous place dreaded by traveling merchants I heard some old people say that once in the past a large group of merchants with several thousand camels laden with goods to gain prot encountered a snowstorm at this place and all the people and animals lost their lives At that time a great arhat in the country of Kabhanda saw the catastrophe from a distance Having pity on the merchants caught in danger he intended to rescue them through his supernatural power but when he arrived at the spot the merchants were already dead So he collected the jewels and valuables and all their property and built a house in which he stored various commodities He also purchased a piece of land in the neighboring country to make a settle ment in the frontier city and hired people to live there to look after travelers At present all wayfarers and merchants are provided with daily necessaries at this place From here going eastward down the eastern ridges of the Cong Ling Mountains climbing over perilous ranges and across deep valleys through dangerous paths in the gorges and braving continuous wind and snow I proceeded for more than eight hundred li and emerged from the Cong Ling range arriving in the country of Wusha The country of Wusha is more than one thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over ten li in circuit It borders on the Sītā River in the south and the land is fertile producing abundant crops The trees are luxuriant with plenty of owers and fruit It yields much jade of different hues such as white jet and sapphire The climate is mild with good weather favorable for the growth of crops The people lack etiquette and righteousness and are strongwilled and rustic in disposition they are deceitful and have little sense of shame Their written and spoken language are somewhat similar to those of the country of Kasha Their features are ugly and unsightly and their clothes are made of fur and hemp They believe in and respect the buddhadharma however There are some ten monasteries with less than a thousand monks who study the Hinayana teachings of the Sarvāstivāda school The royal lineage has been extinct for several hundred year so this country has no sovereign ruler and is subject to the country of Kabhanda Going westward from the capital for more than two hundred li I reached a great mountain where the mists of the mountain rises high and turns into clouds upon touching the rocks The precipices are lofty and steep as if they were broken and they seemed likely to collapse at any moment The stupa built at the summit affords a splendid sight I heard some local people say that several hundred years ago a cliff of the mountain collapsed and exposed a bhikṣu sitting with closed eyes behind the rocks He was tall in stature but appeared to be emaciated His beard and hair covered his face and shoulders A hunter saw him and reported the case to the king The king came in person to see and worship the bhikṣu and the inhabitants and ofcials in the capital also came of their own accord to vie with one another in offering incense and owers The king asked Who is this man so tall in stature A bhikṣu said in reply This man with long beard and hair clad in religious robes is an arhat absorbed in the samādhi of mental extinction He may be aroused by the sound of a musical instrument or by the shining of sunlight with such signals he may be awakened from the abstract meditation If there is no disturbance he will remain motionless The power of samādhi sustains his body from decaying but when he has come out of the samādhi his physical body which is composed of food may become feeble and fragile We should infuse him with ghee to nurture his body before we awaken him from the mental concentration The king said Let it be so A musical instrument was then struck As soon as the instrument was sounded the arhat awakened and after looking around for awhile he said Who are you of such base appearance and wearing religious robes The monk said I am a bhikṣu The arhat said Where is my teacher Kāśyapa Tathāgata The monk said He entered mahānirvāṇa a long time ago Hearing this the arhat closed his eyes disappointed He then asked Has ākyamuni Tathāgata come into the world yet The monk said in reply He has passed away after having been born into the world to guide living beings When the arhat had heard this information he lowered his head After a long while he ascended into the air and cremated himself with re produced through his supernatural power and his ashes dropped to the ground The king collected them and built a stupa for them Going northward from here for more than ve hundred li over mountains and through deserts and wilderness I reached the country of Kasha formerly called Shule the name of the capital city To be correct it should be called rīkrītati which indicates that the name Shule is apparently wrong The country of Kasha is more than ve thousand li in circuit consisting mostly of desert with little cultivable land Crops are abundant and there are plenty of owers and fruit The climate is mild and the weather changes according to the seasons The people are rustic and violent by nature and deceitful by custom They have little sense of etiquette and righteousness and their learning is supercial It is their custom to compress the heads of their newborn babies into a at shape They are vulgar and coarse in appearance tattoo their bodies and have green eyes Their written language evolved after the fashion of the language of India Although there are deletions and aberrations the linguistic structure and function are mainly preserved The diction and accent of their dialect differ from those of other countries They piously believe in the buddhadharma and diligently perform meritorious deeds There are several hundred monasteries with over ten thousand monks who study the Sarvāstivāda school of the Hinayana teachings The monks do not delve into the doctrines but they can recite by heart most of the texts Therefore many of them are reciters of the Tripiṭaka and the Mahāvibhāṣāśāstra From here going southeast for more than ve hundred li crossing the Sītā River and a great sandy range I reached the country of Cukuka formerly called Juqu The country of Cukuka is more than one thousand li in circuit and its capital city which is over ten li in circuit is in an impregnable position with a large number of registered inhabitants There is a chain of mountains and hillocks covered with stone and gravel Two rivers wind through the country so the land is good for cultivation Such fruit as grapes pears and crabapples are abundant The seasonal wind is cold The people are rude and deceitful by custom and robbery is committed openly Their writing is similar to that of Gostana but the spoken language is different They have little sense of etiquette and righteousness and their learning is supercial but they piously believe in the Triple Gem and are fond of performing meritorious deeds There are several tens of monasteries most of which are in ruins The monks about a hundred in number study Mahayana teachings In the southern part of this country there is a great mountain with lofty peaks and ranges standing one behind the other The grass and trees are coldresistant and they are always the same whether in spring or autumn On the cliffs there are caves and rock cells scattered all over the precipices Many Indians who achieved sainthood came here from a great distance through their supernatural power of levitation and settled in this place Many of the arhats died here so a large number of stupas have been built in the mountain There are still three arhats living in the caves absorbed in the samādhi of mental extinction They look emaciated but their beards and hair continue to grow so the monks go to shave them regularly A large number of Mahayana scriptures in particular are stored in this country of all the places where Buddhism has prevailed none can surpass this country in its collection of scriptures Books consisting of a hundred thousand stanzas each amount to more than ten titles and those of fewer stanzas are widely circulated indeed Going eastward from there for more than eight hundred li over ranges and across valleys I reached the country of Gostana this name is the elegant form of the local dialect meaning earthnipple In the vulgar language it is called Huanna while the Huns call it Yudun In the other Hu language it is designated as Qidan and in India it is named Qudan Its old form Yutian is incorrect The country of Gostana is more than four thousand li in circuit and more than half the country is desert There is only a limited area of cultivable land which yields cereals and diverse kinds of fruit It also yields white and black jade The climate is pleasant but there are dust whirls The people have a sense of etiquette and righteousness and are genial and polite in disposition They are fond of learning the classics and the arts and they are conversant with various crafts The common people are wealthy and happy and the registered families live in peace and security The state promotes music and the people love singing and dancing A few of them wear woolen hempen felt or fur clothes but the majority use silk and white cotton for their clothing They are graceful in deportment and well disciplined in behavior Their system of writing follows that of India with slight alterations and some reforms their spoken language differs from that of other countries They esteem the buddhadharma and there are over a hundred monasteries with more than ve thousand monks who mostly study Mahayana teachings The king is a very brave man and holds the buddhadharma in high esteem He claims to be a descendant of the deity Vaiśravaṇa In the past the deity Vaiśravaṇa stayed here when this country was uninhabited After King Aśokas prince had his eyes gouged out in the country of Takṣaśilā the king angrily reproached his ministers and exiled some of the powerful and inuential families to settle in the desert valleys to the north of the Snow Mountains In the course of moving from place to place in search of pasture the exiled people came to the western region of this country and elected their leader as king Meanwhile one of the sons of the emperor of a land in the east was condemned to banishment and went to live in the eastern region of this country At the instigation of his followers he made himself king Once when both men were out hunting they met in the wilderness and each inquired of the other about his ancestral lineage The argument became more heated and they were soon on the brink of resorting to force Someone advised them Why should we ght a decisive battl while out hunting when we have not fully mobilized our troops We should go back to arrange our ghters in battle array and then make an appointment to meet again So the two kings returned to their respective countries had their soldiers drill and practice the arts of war and boosted their morale On the appointed day the two armies met on the battleground with colors ying and drums beating and the following day they engaged The lord from the west was defeated and while attempting to retreat he was decapitated The lord from the east comforted and assembled the inhabitants of the defeated country on his victorious march He moved his capital to the central part of the country and planned to build city walls He was concerned about not knowing where the ground was clay and feared that his plan would not succeed so he made an announcement to invite learned soil scientists from far and near An ashsmearing ascetic carrying a big calabash of water approached to recommend himself to the king saying I know the structure of soil He dripped the water to mark the ground in a roundabout way twice and then departed and disappeared The foundations of the city walls were laid down along the water marks and the city became the seat of government The present king has made his capital in this city Although it is not in a high and invulnerable position it is strong and difcult for attackers to capture Since ancient times no one has ever occupied it in a war By the time the king had moved his capital to the newly built city for the establishment of his government and the settlement of his people he was already getting old after many achievements and exploits He was childless and feared that his ancestral line would die out so he went to the place of the deity Vaiśravaṇa to pray for a son and a baby burst out from the forehead of the image of the deity The baby refused to drink milk however and the king feared that it might not live long So he went again to the temple to seek nourishment for the baby The earth in front of the deitys image suddenly bulged into the shape of a nipple from which the baby drew milk and he received nourishment in this way until he grew up He became an unprecedentedly brave and brilliant man whose inuence spread far and he renovated the temple in honor of his forefather Since then the royal lineage has continued from generation to generation without cessation That is why the temple is full of jewels and gems and ceremonies of worship and sacrice are regularly offered to the deity without neglect Because their ancestor was nursed with milk from an earthnipple the people named their country after it About ten li to the south of the royal city is a great monastery built by a previous king of this country for the arhat Vairocana Universal Shining in Chinese Formerly when the buddhadharma had not yet spread to this country the arhat came here and stayed in the wood sitting in meditation Someone saw him and was amazed by his appearance and garments He reported the matter to the king who came in person to see the arhat and said Who are you staying alone in the solitary wood The arhat said I am a disciple of the Tathāgata and I live alone practicing meditation O King you should perform meritorious deeds to propagate the Buddhas teachings and build a monastery for the assembly of monks The king said What are the virtues of the Tathāgata and what divine powers does he possess that made you dwell like a bird in the wood and practice his teachings so assiduously The arhat said in reply The Tathāgata has compassion for all creatures of the four kinds of birth and guides all living beings of the three realms either overtly or covertly in the states of existence or extinction Those who follow his Dharma will become free of birth and death while those who do not believe in it will be entangled in the net of passion The king said Truly as you have said this matter is beyond verbal discussion Once I have seen him I will build a monastery believe in him as my refuge and propagate his teachings The arhat said After you have completed the construction of a monastery you will receive his spiritual response Hopeful the king agreed to build the monastery When the construction was completed people from far and near assembled to celebrate the occasion as a religious function but they lacked the instrument to be sounded for summoning the monks The king said to the arhat Now the monastery is completed but where is the Buddha The arhat said Work with utmost sincerity the holy evidence is not far off The king then prayed and worshiped and suddenly an image of the Buddha descended from the air and handed an instrument to him More than twenty li to the southwest of the royal city is Gośṛṅga Mountain with two high eaks surrounded by precipitous cliffs In the valley a monastery was constructed in which the Buddhas image often emitted a bright light In the past the Tathāgata once came here and briey preached the essence of the Dharma to human and heavenly beings He prophesied that a country would be founded here and that the people would revere his teachings and follow Mahayana tenets Amid the rocks of Cowhorn Mountain there is a large cave in which an arhat is absorbed in the meditation of mental extinction waiting for the advent of Maitreya Buddha For several hundred years offerings have been made to him without cease Recently the rocks collapsed and blocked the entrance to the cave The king sent his soldiers to clear away the fallen stones but a swarm of black wasps ew out to sting them Thus up to now the entrance has not been reopened About ten li to the southwest of the royal city is Dīrghabhāvana Monastery in which there is a standing image of the Buddha made of ramie and lacquer that came by itself to this place from the country of Kuci A cabinet minister of this country was once banished to live in Kuci and while he was in exile he always worshiped this image After he was recalled to his own country he continued to recall and venerate the image from afar One night the image suddenly came to him The man offered his residence for the construction of this monastery Going westward from the royal city for more than three hundred li I reached the city of Bhagya In this city is an image of the seated Buddha about seven feet in height with consummate features quiet and dignied and with a precious crown on its head that occasionally emits a bright light I heard the local people say that this image was originally in the country of Kaśmīra and had been transported to its present location In the past a śrāmaṇera the disciple of an arhat once desired to eat some fermented rice cake when he was on his deathbed The arhat saw with his supernatural power of clairvoyance that this kind of cake was obtainable in the country of Gostana so he went there through his faculty of divine feet and obtained some of the cake for his disciple Having eaten the cake the śrāmaṇera wished to be reborn in that country after death His wish was actually fullled and he was reborn as a prince of  After his succession to the throne his prestige spread far and near and later he crossed the Snow Mountains to invade the country of Kaśmīra The king of Kaśmīra had concentrated his troops to resist the invaders at the frontier but the arhat exhorted him There is no need to resort to force I can repulse them The arhat then went to speak on the essence of various Dharmas to the king of Gostana At rst the king would not listen to him and still wanted to send his army to the battleground The arhat then produced the robe that the king had worn in his previous life as the śrāmaṇera At the sight of the robe the king gained the supernatural faculty of remembering past events He apologized to the king of Kaśmīra and withdrew his troops after reconciliation He also brought back with his army the Buddhas image that he had worshiped when he was a śrāmaṇera in his former life When the image was brought to this place it refused to be moved any further and so a monastery was built to enshrine the image where it stood Monks were invited to live in the monastery and the kings precious crown was placed on head of the image The present crown on the images head is the one that was offered by the previous king Along the main path in a great desert one hundred and fty or sixty li to the west of the royal city are mounds that are actually heaps of earth dug out by rats from their holes I heard the local people say that the rats in the desert were as large as hedgehogs that the ones with golden or silvery hair were the chiefs and that each time they came out of their holes the other rats always followed them as attendants The Hun people once led hundreds of thousands of troops to attack the frontier and they were stationed beside the rat mounds At that time the king of Gostana had only a few tens of thousands of soldiers under his command and he feared that his army was not strong enough to resist the enemy He always knew that the rats in the desert were marvelous animals but he did not regard them as divine beings When the invaders arrived both the monarch and his subjects were greatly surprised and did not know how to deal with the situation As a temporary expedient they tried conducting a sacricial ceremony praying to the rats in the hope that they might help strengthen the army That night the king of Gostana dreamed that a giant rat said to him I wish to assist you and I hope you will get your men ready for battle at an early hour If you engage the enemy tomorrow you will certainly win the day Knowing that he had spiritual assistance the king of Gostana mobilized his troops and ordered them to launch a surprise attack before dawn The Hun invaders were frightened when they heard of this They rushed to put on their armor and mount the horses and chariots but they found that the saddles and equipment the strings of their bows and ties for the armor and all such belts and cords had been gnawed through by the rats The defenders then arrived suddely and the Hun people were overcome and suffered capture and massacre the commanders were killed and the soldiers taken prisoner Out of gratitude toward the rats the king of Gostana built a temple to offer sacrices to them and this tradition has been carried down from generation to generation with a deep and special feeling of wonderment From the monarch on down to common citizens everyone performed sacricial ceremonies to gain blessedness Whenever they passed by the rat holes they alighted from their horses and carriages to worship the rats and offer clothing bows and arrows or fragrant owers and delicious food to them so as to pray for happiness If no sacrice was offered one might meet with calamity Five or six li to the west of the royal city is Samājñā Monastery in which there is a stupa more than a hundred feet high that shows frequent spiritual signs and occasionally emits a divine light In the past an arhat once came from a distance and stayed in the wood issuing a bright light through his supernatural power From a storied pavilion the king saw the light shining brightly in the wood at night and asked his attendants about it and they all said A śramaṇa has come from a distance and is now sitting in the wood manifesting his supernatural powers The king then ordered his driver to prepare his carriage and went in person to see the monk When he saw the sage he cherished a feeling of respect for him and in admiration of the monks demeanor the king invited him to come to the palace The śramaṇa said Everything has its own appropriate position and each person has his particular inclination A secluded wood with marshes and streams is the place I appreciate while lofty halls and grand mansions are not what I should accept The king respected him all the more and treated him with even greater honor A monastery was built with a stupa and the śramaṇa was invited to stay there Before long to his great delight the king obtained several hundred grains of relic bones through his profound devotion He regretted that the relics as a spiritual response had come a bit too late to have been enshrined in the stupa which would consequently have become a superior holy site He went to the monastery and told his idea to the monks The arhat said O King do not worry I can place the relics under the stupa for you You should put the relics in golden silver copper iron and stone cases one by one The king ordered craftsmen to make the required cases and they completed the task in a few days time The cases were sent to the monastery in precious carriages and hundreds of heralds attendants and ofcials from the palace escorted the relics while tens of thousands of people watched the procession The arhat lifted up the stupa with his right hand and placed it in his palm saying to the king You may place the relics now Then the ground was dug up for the cases and when this had been done the stupa was replaced on the site without any damage or slanting Those who witnessed the event said in admiration that they had never before seen such a sight their faith in the Buddha became even more sincere and their minds of respecting the Dharma more steadfast The king said to his group of ofcials I have heard that the Buddhas power is inconceivable and his divine faculties are unfathomable He can appear in hundreds of myriads of bodies simultaneously and take birth either in the human world or in heaven He can lift up the world in his palm without making living beings feel any agitation He expounded the nature of the Dharma in normal language to enable all creatures to reach enlightenment in different ways according to their varying capacities His divine power is incomparable and his wisdom is beyond description Although his corporeal form has vanished his teachings have been handed down so that we can enjoy the peace of his doctrine live under the inuence of his virtue taste the avor of the Way and admire his characteristic way of life Do your utmost all of you to pay deep respect to the Buddha You will then understand that the buddhadharma is abstruse and profound Five or six li to the southeast of the royal city is Maza Monastery which was established by a concubine of a former king of this country In the past neither the mulberry tree or silkworms were known in this country Hearing that a certain country in the east had mulberry trees and silkworms dispatched a messenger to seek for them but the monarch of the eastern country kept them hidden and would not grant the request He gave orders to the frontier guards to prevent mulberry seeds or silkworms from being smuggled out of the country The king of Gostana then humbly proposed to enter into a matrimonial alliance with the eastern country The king of the eastern country had ambitions to exert his inuence over distant lands through mollication so he readily agreed to the proposal The king of Gostana appointed an envoy to collect the bride and said to him Tell the daughter of the monarch of the eastern country that we have no silk thread nor do we have we mulberry trees or silkworms in our country Ask her to bring some seeds with her to make garments for her Hearing this the daughter of the monarch secretly obtained some mulberry seeds and silkworms which she hid inside the cloth of her hat When she arrived at the frontier the guards searched all her belongings but they dared not inspect her hat In this manner she entered the country of Gostana and lodged at the place where Maza Monastery now stands She was then taken to the royal palace with proper rites and ceremony and the mulberry seeds and silkworms were kept at the palace In early spring the mulberry seeds were planted and in the month of breeding silkworms the leaves of the mulberry trees were plucked to feed them In the early stages were also fed with leaves of miscellaneous trees The kings concubine made an inscription on a stone tablet to lay down a rule forbidding people from harming the silkworms Only when the silk moths had all own away could the cocoons be reeled the gods would not protect those who dared infringe this rule This monastery was built in memory of the rst group of silkworms There are several withered mulberry trees said to be the rst mulberries planted there Silkworms are not killed in this country and if anyone stealthily reels silk he will reap a poor harvest in sericulture the following year More than one hundred li to the southeast of the city is a large river owing northwest which the people use for irrigation At one time it dried up to the great surprise of the king He rode in his carriage to inquire of an arhat monk saying The water of the large river is usually drawn and used by the people what is the fault that has caused it to dry up Have I been unjust in managing state affairs have my virtuous deeds not extended to all If not then why is the punishment from above so severe The arhat said Your Majesty rules the country in peace and good order The drying up of the river is caused by the dragon  It bets Your Majesty to immediately offer sacrice and say prayers to him and then the lost advantages may be recovered The king returned to his palace and performed a sacricial ceremony for the dragon in the river Suddenly a woman came over the waves and said to the king My husband has been dead for a long time and I am unable to carry out your order That is why the river has dried up and the farmers have lost the advantage of irrigation If you will select one of your noble ministers to be my husband the rivers waters will ow as usual The king said Please do as you wish The dragon looked at the ministers and was delighted with one of them After returning to the palace the king said to his ministers My ministers are the pillars of the state and agriculture is the source of the food that sustains our lives If I lose my ministers the state will be endangered but without food all of us will die What shall I choose the endangerment of the state or death The minister chosen by the dragon woman arose from his seat and kneeled saying in reply I am an incompetent person who is unworthy of my important position and I have always thought of dedicating myself to the service of my country but have not yet had the chance If it is for the benet of the masses of people there is no need to be reluctant about sending away a minister A minister is merely an assistant of the state while the people are the foundation of the country I hope Your Majesty will hesitate no more I would be fortunate if a monastery can be constructed as a good deed done on my behalf The king consented to his request and the work was completed in no time The minister then asked permission to go to the dragons palace at an early date All the ofcials and common people in the whole country held farewell banquets in his honor accompanied by the performance of music The minister dressed in white and riding a white horse bade farewell to the king and expressed thanks to his countrymen before he rode into the river The horse walked on the surface of the water without sinking When it came to midstream the minister waved his whip to slice the water and made an opening through which he dropped into the river After a short while the white horse oated out of the river carrying a sandalwood drum on its back along with a letter which said in brief Your Majesty did not despise me as a humble person and gave me the chance to be selected by the goddess The big drum is to be hung to the southeast of the city Before the approach of invaders it will sound by itself to give warning Since then water has owed in the river and the people have made use of it up to now After such a the long lapse of time the original dragon drum is no longer in existence At the place where it was hung another drum has been put as a substitute The monastery beside the pond is deserted and in ruins and there are no monks living there More than three hundred li to the east of the royal city is a large expanse of marshland several tens of qing in area the earth of which is reddishblack in color it supports no vegetation whatsoever I heard some old people say that this was the place where the army was defeated In the past a country in the east once raised a million troops to make an invasion to the west At that time the king of Gostana prepared an army several lakhs strong to resist the enemy from the east The two armies met at this place and engaged in battle and the soldiers of the west were defeated by the troops from the east The latter advancing in the ush of victory slaughtered people cruelly captured the king  killed his generals and massacred the soldiers sparing not a single one The ground was stained with blood and the traces are still visible Going eastward for more than thirty li from the battleground I reached the city of Bhīmā in which there is a standing image of the Buddha carved out of sandalwood over twenty feet high which has shown spiritual responses many times and often emits a bright light If someone who suffers from a painful ailment pastes a piece of gold foil on the image at the part that corresponds to where his ailment is he may be instantly relieved of the pain If someone says prayers to the image with earnest devotion their wishes will be fullled in most cases I heard the local people say that this image was made by King Udayana of the country of Kauśāmbī when the Buddha was living in the world After the Buddhas demise the image came through the air from that country to the city of Araurak in the north of this country  The inhabitants of this city were living in happy and wealthy conditions and were deeply attached to erroneous views so when the image rst came to the city they did not treasure or respect it An arhat later came to worship this image and the people amazed at his strange garb hurriedly went to report this to the king who then ordered them to throw sand and earth on the strange person The arhat was covered with sand and earth and no food was provided to him At that time a man who always worshiped the image with veneration could not bear to see the arhat being starved and secretly offered him food When the arhat was about to leave he told the man Seven days from now a sandstorm will cover the entire city and no one will remain alive You should know this and prepare an esacpe for yourself That man entered the city and warned his relatives and friends but those who heard the information sneered at him On the following day a big gale swiftly arose and blew away the lthy dust while various kinds of gems and precious substances rained down all over the roads and thoroughfares The people then berated their informant all the more but the man knew that disaster was a certainty and secretly excavated a tunnel leading out of the city and made it into a cellar After midnight on the seventh day sand and earth rained from the air and lled up the city The man escaped through the tunnel and went east to this country  where he stayed in the city of Bhīmā No sooner had he arrived than the image also came to that place where it was worshiped with offerings and no one dared remove it I heard a prophet say that by the end of ākyamunis Dharma the image will enter the dragons palace The city of Araurak has now become a big mound Kings and powerful persons of many countries have attempted to excavate the precious treasure but each time they have come to the side of the mound a strong violent gale has arisen raising a shroud of dust and clouds in which they lose their way After going for more than two hundred li I reached the city of Nina which is three or four li in circuit situated in a vast marsh The marsh is hot and humid and it is difcult to pass through it This region is overgrown with reeds and wild grass and has no tracks or paths Because this is the only passageway leading to the city travelers have to go leave and depart by this way Gostana made this city a frontier station in its eastern region Going east from there I entered the Great Desert in which the shifting sand is piled up and scatters with the wind No trace of wayfarers can remain visible on the sand and travelers often lose their way in the vast wilderness and do not know which direction to go so they have collected the skeletons of the dead to serve as landmarks Water and pasture are scarce in the desert and the wind is hot whenever the hot wind blows people and animals fall into a swoon and become ill The sound of singing and shouting or wailing and crying is sometimes heard but when one looks around to locate the source of the sound no one can tell where it comes from This phenomenon often causes death as it is mischief wrought by ghosts and devils Going further for more than four hundred li I reached the old country of Tukhāra which has been deserted for a long time all the cities are in ruins From here proceeding to the east for more than six hundred li I reached the old country of Calmadana the land of Jumo The lofty city walls are still there but there is no trace of human habitation Continuing my journey toward the northeast for more than one thousand li I reached the old country of Navāp namely the land of Lulan The purpose of composing this book has been to describe the mountains and valleys  to investigate and collect data on the conditions in different lands to narrate in detail the upright and variable customs of various countries and to record the climatic and topographic situations of diverse locales As circumstances were always changing I laid emphasis on different points at different times Although it was difcult for me to trace the origin of everything I described by no means did I resort to conjecture or fabrication but I could write only in a brief manner about what I saw or heard on my journey and keep a record of the spread of the edication of Buddhism Up to the place where the sun sets all people live under the benecence of the Emperor whose ultimate virtue is admired by all within the reach of his moral inuence The entire empire is a great unity and the world is the manifestation of oneness Am I merely a solitary envoy going in a single carriage passing through travelers rest stations for a distance of ten thousand li His form and mentality disappeared in as many worlds as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River and he ceased to rise and fall for kalpas as innumerable as atoms in the world As his form and mentality have disappeared his birth has no reality of birth because as he has ceased to rise and fall his extinction has nothing of extinction Could his birth in Kapilavastu have been a real fact His passing away between the śāla trees was merely a means of his secret edication He gave up the prospect of being a universal monarch of the golden wheel and preferred to rule over the world of the Dharma from the white curl between his eyebrows he emitted a light to comfort all living beings His Way prevails in the ten directions and his wisdom comprehends everything Even though he is from the unknowable universe he provides shelter to those who are in the discernible world He turned the wheel of the Dharma of the three classications in the great chiliocosm and expounded his doctrine in one and the same voice to teach the masses His teachings are classied into eightyfour thousand gates the essence of which is summed up in the twelve divisions of the scriptures Therefore wherever they are under the protection of his teachings the people can move about freely in the eld of blessedness and wherever they are inspired by his morals and discipline all people live in the land of longevity Glorious are his saintly and sagacious deeds and perfect is his goodness toward human and heavenly beings He gave up both mobility and immobility in the grove of śāla trees and nullied the conception of coming and going in illusory existence and no one could succeed him to glorify his doctrine of emptiness In order to repay the kindness of the Buddha Venerable Mahākāśyapa selected a group of arhats to collect the precious Dharma consisting of the four gamas explaining its origin and ramications and the Tripiṭaka which gives its essential theories Although various schools and sects have arisen the essence of the great Dharma remains unchanged From his birth up to his demise showed a thousand transformations of his holy traces and manifested propitious omens in ten thousand ways His limitless spirituality became more and more apparent and his teachings of nonaction were always pure and fresh All these have been preserved in the scriptures and written down in the records and commentaries Different opinions became confused and tangled however and dissidents spread their own diverse views The original and fundamental theories are rarely interpreted in the correct way There are many variant views even in the writings that are based on concrete facts let alone in the texts that deal with the abstruse and profound right Dharma and that delve into the deep meanings of the abstract and recondite principles where there are many incomplete points in exposition This is because previous sages of virtue remained only in the track of translation and brilliant scholars of later times followed the course shown by incomplete texts Thus the great doctrine was hidden in obscurity and the subtle sayings were missing and unknown to the world Beginning with the Han dynasty and up to the present reign of the Tang the glorious task of translation has been carried on in a uent and graceful manner as splendidly as the conjoined shining of the sun and moon Tthe abstruse Way was not revealed in its entirety however and the true essence was still obscure This was not because the holy teachings were sometimes active and other times inactive but simply due to untimely royal patronage Since the Great Tang has held sway over the empire it has won the condence of foreign countries The old rules formulated by the saints have been scrutinized and the outdated codes laid down by former monarchs amended The teachings of the image period of Buddhism are exuberantly expounded as great instructions The Way does not exist in vain but its propagation depends on the illustration of virtue This is why the abstruse doctrines of the three vehicles were buried in oblivion for the last thousand years and the spiritual efcacy of the Buddhas ten powers of wisdom were shut out ten thousand li away It is true that the divine Way has no directional limitations in its spread but the holy teachings have to depend on circumstances for their appearance He is the embodiment of the good omen of superior virtue and contains the perfection of medium harmony He follows the right Way in accordance with virtue and abides by chastity to rectify his behavior Because he planted the cause of blessedness in his previous birth he was reborn into this life during a time of prosperity His conduct surpassed that of the world and he stayed quietly in learning centers to receive the correct instructions taught by former teachers and to admire the virtues of previous philosophers In the course of wandering in pursuit of his studies he traveled to the regions of Yan and Zhao and visited the states of Lu and Wei After leaving the district of the Three Rivers at his back he entered the interior of the region of Qin He proceeded from the three prefectures of Shu and arrived at the state of Wukuai He approached all learned scholars to ask for instructions and in the presence of distinguished people he repeatedly avowed his intention of going abroad to acquire the Dharma He heard the discussions of various schools and made a study of their propositions nding that they vied with each other to emphasize their own specic theories and were critical of their rivals teachings This aroused his desire to get to the root of the doctrine of Buddhism and he determined to make a thorough study of the matter At a time when the empire within the four seas was in good order and the distant lands in the eight directions were free from trouble he prepared himself and began the journey traveling staff in hand on the morning of the rst day of the eighth month in the third year of the Zhenguan reign  With the Emperors prestige he made his way and under the protection of deities he traveled in solitude He went out from the strategic passes at the Iron Gate and the Rocky Gate and climbed over the perilous Ice Mountains and Snow Mountains In the course of time he reached India where he publicized Chinese civilization in the foreign land and propagated the great teachings in the alien country He studied Sanskrit texts under the instruction of learned scholars and the dubious points he had in his mind were resolved by reading the books As regards the profound doctrines he sought the elucidation of highly talented teachers He opened his mind to understand the ultimate truth and claried his spirit to realize the Way He heard what he had never heard before and acquired what had not yet been acquired He became a benecial friend in Buddhist circles and was indeed a master in the gate of the Dharma From this we may know that his religious fame was prominent and his virtuous deeds were lofty and noble His store of knowledge was accumulated over three years and his reputation spread ten thousand li The scholars of India respected him for his great virtue calling him Basket Full of Scriptures or General of the Dharma The Hinayana disciples named him Mokṣadeva Deity of Emancipation while the Mahayana followers called him Mahāyānadeva  These were titles bestowed on him in honor of his virtue eulogistic epithets used to show respect for his personality As regards the abstruse theories of the three classications of the turning of the wheel of the Dharma and the subtle sayings spoken by the Buddha after three inquiries he conducted profound research into their roots and acquired a full understanding of the leaves and branches He promptly became intellectually enlightened and happily claried his theoretical entanglements The dubious points he had raised were recorded in certain works Having made a deep study of the theoretical principles and mastered the lore of metaphysics with his repute as an erudite scholar spreading widely and having achieved great virtue he began touring the country visiting the towns and their vicinities He left the city of Kuśāgrapura and entered the Deer Park and after visiting Yaṣṭivana he rested at Kukkuṭārāma Monastery He looked around the country of Kapilavastu and had a glimpse of the city of Kuśinagara The old site of the Buddhas birthplace had turned into a plain of fertile land and the other sites of secret spirituality lay in ruins in vast wildernesses When he looked for the divine traces his remembrance of the past glories increased and he sighed with regret while recalling the Buddhas teachings with admiration He was not merely like Jizi who sang the Ode to Flowering Wheat in sorrow over the fallen dynasty of Yin nor was he similar to the senior ofcial at the court of Zhou who composed the Lyric of the Millet Shoots lamenting the collapse of the house of Zhou He narrated in detail the stories of ākyamuni Buddha and gave an account of many historical facts of India He procured one hundred and fty grains of the Tathāgatas relic bones a golden image of the Buddha one foot six inches high including the base and halo an imitation of the shadow image in the dragons cave at Prāgbodhi Mountain in the country of Magadha a golden image of the Buddha three feet three inches high including the base and halo an imitation of the image of the Buddha in the posture of turning the wheel of the Dharma for the rst time at Deer Park in the country of Bārāṇasī a sandalwood image of the Buddha one foot ve inches high including the base and halo an imitation of the sandalwood portrait made by King Udayana of the country of Kauśāmbī when he longed to see the Tathāgata a sandalwood image of the Buddha two feet nine inches high including the base and halo an imitation of the image of the Tathāgata descending by a precious stairway from the heavenly palace to earth in the country of Kapitha a silver image of the Buddha four feet high including the base and halo an imitation of the image of the Buddha as he was preaching the Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra and other scriptures on Vulture Peak in the country of Magadha a golden image of the Buddha three feet ve inches high including the base and halo an imitation of the shadow portrait left by the Buddha when he had subdued a venomous dragon in the country of Nagarahāra a sandalwood image of the Buddha one foot three inches high including the base and halo an imitation of the Buddhas image in the posture of making a tour in the city of the country of Vaiśālī to edify the inhabitants two hundred and twentyfour Mahayana scriptures one hundred and ninetytwo Mahayana treatises fourteen scriptures disciplinary texts and treatises of the Sthavira school fteen scriptures disciplinary texts and treatises of the Mahāsāṃghika school fteen scriptures disciplinary texts and treatises of the Saṃmitīya school twentytwo scriptures disciplinary texts and treatises of the Mahī śāsaka school seventeen scriptures disciplinary texts and treatises of the Kāśyapīya school fortytwo scriptures disciplinary texts and treatises of the Dharmagupta school sixtyseven scriptures disciplinary texts and treatises of the Sarvāstivāda school thirtysix texts on hetuvidyā  and thirteen texts on śabdavidyā  altogether six hundred and ftyseven books bound in ve hundred and twenty bundles In order to propagate the supreme teachings he prepared his carriage for the return journey on the perilous way He came out of the old country of rāvastī and left the former suburbs of Gayā After ascending the dangerous path over the Cong Ling Mountains and traversing the hazardous passage through the desert he arrived in the capital in the rst month of the spring of the nineteenth year  He had an interview with the Emperor at Luoyang who ordered him to translate the Sanskrit texts into Chinese He summoned scholars to work with him to achieve this superior deed through joint effort The Cloud of the Dharma again cast shade and the Sun of Wisdom emitted brilliant light anew The edication that the Buddha taught at Vulture Peak prevailed in the Chinese capital and the teachings brought out from the dragons palace were expounded in the metropolitan district The Master is dexterously conversant with the Sanskrit language with which he praised the profound Buddhist texts He reads Sanskrit books as if they were his own compositions and his intonation still echoes in the air Strictly adhering to the Buddhas meanings he does not add any embellishments to his translations Unknown dialects and previouly untranslated Sanskrit terms have been carefully studied and weighed through research and mutual collation with passages from classical Buddhist texts lest deviations should occur A gentleman in ofcial dress approached the Master and said earnestly to him India is a country where divine beings and saints assembled and people of virtue were born Their writing is that of the gods and their language that of the deities with graceful and wellconstructed diction rhythmically pronounced with one word having many meanings and one meaning being expressed in different words There are falling and rising intonations and voiced as well as unvoiced consonants The translation of the profound Buddhist texts must depend on brilliant scholars and the abstruse essences of the scriptures must be explained by people of great virtue If deletions are made in a translation or if the words are tuned according to musical notation it is really inappropriate and cannot truly be regarded as good work The exposition of the profound essences of the scriptures must be easily understandable So long as it is not contradictory to the original meaning it may be considered well done Excessive embellishments may render a translation too owery in style if is too simple it will be inelegant Only when it is done in a plain style without ornamentation and written elegantly without being dull can a work be free of grave blunders and counted as a good translation Laozi said Florid sayings are not trustworthy and trustworthy words are not orid Hanzi said When ones reason is justiable ones speech is straightforward if one talks in ornate language he is hiding the truth From these maxims we may know that the principle is equally applicable to all things It is hoped that obscure and unintelligible points may be expurgated for the readers benet and delight It is very harmful to deviate from the original meanings in order to give place to ornamental verbiage and adherence to obsolete rules is something to which the Buddha strongly objected Both the monks and the laity said unanimously Yes What has been said is really true Formerly when Confucius was in a position to hear litigation he used to write verdicts jointly with others and never did so by himself alone In composing his Spring and Autumn Annals he wrote what should be written and deleted what should be cut out and even such learned literati among his disciples as Ziyou and Zixia could not aid him in writing a word The Master did his translation in the same way He is not like Kumārajīva who translated Buddhist texts at the Garden of Leisure and Repose allowing his disciples Daosheng Sengzhao Daorong and Sengrui to make deletions as they pleased How could we add or remove anything of the Buddhas teachings in an age when the angles of a square are cut off to make it round and when ostentation is discarded and simplicity upheld Note by Bianji I Bianji the descendant of a remote progenitor who believed in high culture cherished the ambition even as a child to lead a life of seclusion When I had just reached school age I cut my hair changed into religious robes and became a disciple of Venerable Daoyue of the Sarvāstivāda school in the great Zongchi Monastery Although I met a learned teacher my stupidity rendered me as useless as a piece of rotten wood that cannot be carved into shape I was lucky to have entered the stream of the Dharma but I failed to saturate myself in the dew of learning and I merely ate my ll all day long and did nothing but face the wall to pass the years Fortunately the time came for me to take part in this ne gathering of intellectuals where even with my ability as meager as that of a sparrow I worked at the end of a long line of brilliant scholars resembling lofty swans in writing this Record with my smattering of literary knowledge I am not a student who is well versed in ancient writings and my compositions are devoid of ornamental phrases I worked just like one who carves a piece of rotten wood with a blunt burin toiling as laboriously as a lame person I respectfully listened to the words committed them to writing and put them in proper order Under the orders of the Secretary of State I compiled the Record as it is presented here Due to my shallow wisdom and limited ability I must have made many unintentional omissions and there may be surplus words that should have been deleted Formerly when the highly talented historian Sima Zichang wrote his Historical Records succeeding to his fathers task as grand historian even he sometimes only mentioned the given name of a person and neglected the second name So it is said that even a discreet scholar when working alone on a heavy and complicated task is apt to be neglectful let alone a person of slow wits and poor capability such as myself The different topographical conditions and social customs the territorial limits and native products the temperament and intelligence of different peoples as well as the cold and warm climates of the four seasons in various regions have been ascertained and described in detail good or bad according to the actual facts Indian customs and teachings are divided into two categories namely religious and secular All these are briey narrated but a full description can be found in the preceding preface Such matters as social etiquette ceremonies household registration brave warriors and religious recluses are not described in detail The Buddha contacted people through the employment of supernatural powers and taught them with spiritual admonition and it is said that his divine Way is deep and mysterious its principles alien to the human world and that whatever profundities he exposed in his spiritual admonitions are concerned with things beyond the sky Brief accounts with succinct notes have been given for all the places where the Buddha left his auspicious traces and for the ruins connected with the good names of former sages The roads wound and zigzagged and the boundaries of different countries unevenly interlocked with one another Descriptions of the places of the Masters journey have been presented in sequence without editorial arrangement The different parts of India irrespective of national boundaries are indicated at the end of the description of each country in order to give a rough idea of its whereabouts It is variously written in a straightforward way according to facts or in a mild and roundabout way to put it in a graceful style with wellbalanced words in order to submit a trustworthy record to His Supreme Majesty the Emperor In the seventh month in the autumn of the twentieth year of the Zhenguan reign  CE However the risky journey to a distant land was actually undertaken under the prestige of the imperial court and the composition of the topographical record of foreign countries was done with curiosity under His Majestys inspiration Vulture Peak is made known in China through this Record and Deer Park is rendered as familiar as the outer garden of the imperial palace It enables one to visualize what happened a thousand years ago and see the sights along the ten thousandli journey as if one had visited the places in person All of this has not been heard of since the remote past nor was it recorded in previous books The Emperors supreme virtue covers all and different countries with diverse customs have come to offer allegiance The tradition of honesty and magnanimity has spread to far regions even wild and outoftheway locales without exception This Record may serve as a supplement to the Shanhai jing let it be published as a chronicle and distributed to the concerned authorities as a general reference He has in an absolute manner destroyed all blindness He has drawn out the world from the mire of transmigration I render homage to Him to this teacher of truth before composing the treatise called the Abhidharmakośa  Abhidharma is pure prajñā with its following  It is also prajñā and the Treatise which brings about the obtaining of pure prajñā  The present work is called the Abhidharmakośa because the Abhidharma enters into it through its meaning or because the Abhidharma constitutes its foundation Apart from the discernment of the dharmas there is no means to extinguish the defilements and it is by reason of the defilements that the world wanders in the ocean of existence So it is with a view to this discernment that the Abhidharma has been they say spoken by the Master  The dharmas are impure in a relationship with the defilements or pure with no relationship to the defilements  Conditioned dharmas with the exception of the Path are impure  They are impure because the defilements adhere to them  The undefiled truth of the Path and the three unconditioned things are pure  Space and the two types of extinctions  Space is that which does not hinder  Pratisaṃkhyānirodha is disjunction  Each disjunction occurs separately  A different type of extinction which consists of the absolute hindering of arising is called apratisaṃkhyānirodha  Conditioned things are the fivefold skandhas matter etc  Conditioned things are the paths they are the foundations of discourse they are possessed of leaving they are possessed of causes  When they are impure they are upānānaskandhas  They are called of battle  They are also suffering arising the world the locus of false opinions existence  Rūpa or matter is the five sense organs five objects and avijñapti  The points of support of the consciousness of these things namely the subtle material elements are the five organs the organ of sight etc  Visible matter is twofold  Or twentyfold  Sound is eightfold  Taste is of six types  Odor is fourfold  The tangible is of eleven types uneven The Sautrantika only admit color not shape or form as a dharma Note the Sanskrit rupa and tThere is a serial continuity also in a person whose mind is distracted or who is without mind pure or impure in dependence on the primary elements this is called the avijñapti  The primary elements are the elementary substance earth and the elementary substances water fire and wind  They are proven to exist by the actions of support etc  They are solidity humidity heat and motion  In common usage what is designated by the word earth is color and shape  The same for water and fire  Wind is either the wind element  Or else color and shape  These same organs and objects are regarded as ten āyatanas ten dhātus  Sensation is painful impression etc  Ideas consist of the grasping of characteristics  Saskāraskandha are the saskāras different from the other four skandhas  These three skandhas with avijñapti and unconditioned things are the dharmāyatana the dharmadhātu  Consciousness is the impression relative to each object  It is the mental organ  It is seven dhātus  The six consciousnesses and the manas  Of these six consciousnesses the one which continually passes away is the manas  One counts eighteen dhātus with a view to assigning a point of support to the sixth consciousness  All the dharmas are included in one skandha one āyatana and one dhātu  A dharma is included in its own nature  For it is distinct from the nature of others  The organs of sight of hearing and of smell although twofold form only in pairs one dhātu for their nature their sphere of activity and their consciousness are common  It is for beautys sake that they are twofold  Skandha signifies heap āyatana signifies gate of entry gate of arising and dhātu signifies lineage  The teachings of the skandhas etc because error faculty joy are threefold The two mental states sensation and ideas are defined as distinct skandhas because they are the causes of the roots of dispute because they are the causes of transmigration and also by reason of the causes which justify the order of skandhas  Unconditioned things are not named with respect to the skandhas because they do not correspond to the concept  The order of the skandhas is justified by their grossness their defilement the characteristic of the jug etc and also from the point of view of their spheres of influence  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The first five are the first because their object is present  The first four are the first because their object is solely derived or secondary matter  These four are arranged according to the range and speed of their activity  Or rather the organs are arranged according to their position A single āyatana is called rūpaāyatana with a view to distinguishing it from the others and by reason of its excellence A single āyatana is called dharmaāyatana with a view to distinguishing it from the others and because it includes many of the dharmas as well as the best dharma The eighty thousand dharmaskandhas that the Muni promulgated depending on whether one regards them as voice or as name are included within the rūpaskandha or the saṃskāraskandha  According to some a dharmaskandha is of the dimension of the Treatise  The exposition of the skandhas etc constitutes so many dharmaskandhas  In fact each dharmaskandha has been preached in order to heal a certain category of believer In this same way the other skandhas āyatanas and dhātus should be suitably arranged within the skandhas āyatanas and dhātus as described above by taking into account the characteristics that have been attributed to them  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Cavities are called the space element it is one says light and darkness  The consciousness element is an impure consciousness  The support of arising  Only rūpadhātu is visible  The ten dhātus which are exclusively material are capable of being struck  Eight dhātus are morally neutral  Minus visible matter and sound  The others are of three types  All exist in Kāmadhātu  Fourteen exist in Rūpadhātu  With the exception of odor taste the consciousness of odor and the consciousness of taste  In rūpyādhātu there is mental organ an object of the mental consciousness and the mental consciousness  The three dhātus which have just been named can be pure or impure  The others are impure  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Five consciousnesses always include vitarka and vicāra  The last three dhātus are of the three types  The other dhātus are free from the one and the other  The seven dhātus which are mind have an object  And also one part of the dharmadhātu  Nine are nonappropriated  The eight that have been mentioned and sound  The other nine are of two types  The tangible is of two types  The other nine material dhātus are soley secondary matter  As is the part of the dharmadhātu which is material  The ten material dhātus are agglomerations  Four external dhātus cut are cut  The same are burned and weighed  There is no agreement with respect to that which is burned and weighed  Five internal dhātus are of fruition and accumulation  Sound is not of retribution  The eight dhātus free from resistance are of outflowing and also of fruition  The others are of three types  A single dhātu is real  The last three dhātus are momentary  He can obtain the organ of sight and the visual consciousness either separately or together  Twelve are personal  With the exception of visible matter etc  The dhātu called dharmas is sabhāga  The other dhātus are also tatsabhāga  When they do not do their proper work  Ten and five are abandoned through Meditation  The last three are of three types  Neither the undefiled nor matter are abandoned by Seeing the Truths  Nor that which has arisen from the nonsixth  The organ of sight and part of the dharmadhātu are view  Eight parts  The prajñā which arises with the five sense consciousnesses is not view because it is not judgment after deliberation  It is the organ of sight which sees visible matter  When it is sabhāga  It is not the consciousness of which this organ is the point of support  For obscured visible matter is not seen Such is the opinion of the Vaibhāṣikas  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Visible matter is seen by the two eyes also as the clarity of sight demonstrates  The organ of sight the organ of hearing and the mental organ know their object without attaining it  For the other three organs the opposite  The three organs of which the organ of smell is the first grasp an object of their dimension  Relative to consciousness the point of support of the sixth consciousness is past  The point of support of the first five is also simultaneous  The point of support of a consciousness is its organ for consciousness changes according to the modality of the organ  For this reason and also because it is its own it is the organ which gives its name to the consciousness  The organ of sight is not inferior to the body  Visible matter is not higher than the organ  Nor consciousness  Visible matter in relation to consciousness and visible matter as well as consciousness through relation to the body is of all types  The same holds for the organ of hearing  Three organs belong to their own stage  The consciousness of touch is of its own stage or of a lower stage  There is no restriction with respect to the mental organ  Five external dhātus are discerned by two types of consciousness  Unconditioned things are eternal  The twelve internal dhātus and one part of the dharmadhātu are indriyas  According to the School five are predominate with regard to things  Four predominate with regard to two things  Five and eight with regard to defilement and to purification  By reason of their predominance  with regard to the perception of their special object  with regard to all objects six organs  It is by reason of their predominance in masculinity and femininity that one must distinguish two sexual organs within the body It is by reason of their predominance with regard to the duration of existence to defilement to purification that one considers the vital organ the sensations and the five the first of which is faith as indriyas By reason of their predominance with regard to ascending acquisitions with regard to Nirvāṇa etc the anājñātamājñāsyāmīndriya the ajñendriya and the ājñātāvīndriya are likewise The support of the mind that which subdivides prolongs and defiles this support that which prepares the purification and which does purify it these are all the indriyas Or rather there are fourteen indriyas support of transmigration origin duration enjoyment of this support the other indriyas have the same function with regard to Nirvāṇa  Disagreeable bodily sensation is the indriya of pain  Agreeable is the indriya of pleasure  In the Third Dhyāna agreeable mental sensation is also an indriya of pleasure  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Moreover it is satisfaction  Disagreeable mental sensation is dissatisfaction  Intermediate bodily or mental sensation is equanimity  It is both e For it has no vikalpana  Nine indriyas in the Paths of Seeing of Meditation and of the Aśaikṣa constitute three indriyas  Three are clean  The material organs the vital organ and the two painful sensations are impure  Nine are of two types  The vital organ is always retribution  Twelve are of two types  With the exception of the last eight and dissatisfaction  Only one ie dissatisfaction has retribution  Ten are twofold ie admit of retribution as well as being without retribution  The mental organ the four sensations with the exception of dissatisfaction and faith and its following  Eight are good  Dissatisfaction is of two types e The mental organ and the sensations  with the exception of dissatisfaction  are of three types f The others of one type  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  The pure indriyas are absent from Kāmadhātu  The sexual organs and the two disagreeable sensations are absent from Rūpadhātu  And all the material organs and the two agreeable sensations are absent from rūpyadhātu  The mental organ and three sensations belong to three categories  Dissatisfaction is abandoned through Seeing and Meditation  Nine are abandoned through Meditation alone  Five are either abandoned through Meditation or are not abandoned e Three are not abandoned  In the Kāmas beings possess from their origins two indriyas that are from retribution  With the exception of apparitional beings  Some possess six  Or seven e Or eight f In Rūpadhātu six  Above one  In rūpyadhātu dying destroys the vital organ the mental organ and the sensation of indifference in Rūpadhātu it destroys eight indriyas  In Kāmadhātu ten nine eight  Or four when death is gradual  In the case of a good death add all five indriyas  One obtains the two highest results through nine indriyas  The two intermediary results through seven eight or nine  It is said that the quality of Arhat is obtained through eleven indriyas because a determined person can so obtain them  He who possesses the mental organ or the vital organ or the organ of equanimity necessarily possesses three indriyas  He who possesses the organ of pleasure or the organ of touch certainly possesses four organs  He who possesses one of the organs of sense consciousness necessarily possesses five organs  The same for him who possesses the organ of satisfaction He who possesses the organ of displeasure certainly possesses seven organs d Whoever possesses the female organ etc necessarily possesses eight organs  He who possesses ājñendriya or ājñatavīndriya necessarily possesses eleven organs  He who possesses ājñāsyāmīndriya necessarily possesses thirteen organs  A being who is lacking any good at all possesses a minimum of eight organs the organ of touch sensations the vital organ and the mental organ  It is the same with an ignorant person who is born in rūpyadhātu  He possesses eight organs namely equanimity life the mental organ and the good organs  At the maximum nineteen a bisexual being with the exception of the immaculate organs  The ryan not detached can possess all the organs  With the exception of a sexual organ and two pure organs In Kāmadhātu an atom into which there is no entry of sound and into which there is no entry of any organ is made up of eight substances  When the organ of touch enters into it it is made up of nine substances  When any other organ enters into it it is made up of ten substances  The mind and its mental states are necessarily generated together  All things are necessarily generated with their characteristics  Sometimes with possession  The mental states are of five types mahābhūmikas etc Sensation volition motion desire for action contact discernment memory the act of attention approval and absorption or concentration coexist in every mind J SENSATION VOLITION NOTION DESIRE CONTACT DISCERNMENT MEMORY ATTENTION APPROPBATION Faith diligence aptitude indifference respect fear two roots nonviolence and energy are found only in a good mind and are found in all good minds  Error nondiligence idleness disbelief torpor and dissipation are always and exclusively in soiled minds  Disrespect and the absence of fear are always and exclusively found in bad minds Anger enmity dissimilation jealousy stubbornness hypocrisy greed the spirit of deception prideintoxication the spirit of violence etc are the parīttakleśabhūmikas  The mind in Kāmadhātu when it is good always consists of twentytwo mental states as it is always associated with vitarka and vicāra  A bad mind consists of twenty mental states when it is independent of or associated with views dṛṣṭi  Twentyone when it is associated with one of the four defilements with anger etc with regret  A neutral mind consists of eighteen mental states when it is defiled  In the contrary case twelve  Apathy is not in contradiction to any category wherever it is found it is added  The bad mental states regret and apathy are absent from the First Dhyāna  Further on vitarka is also missing absent from the intermediate dhyāna  Further on again vicāra etc  Disrespect is lack of veneration  Anapatrāpya or atrapā is the dharma that causes a person not to see the unpleasant consequences of his transgressions  Affection is faith  Respect is hrī  Both exist in Kāmadhātu and Rūpadhātu  Vitarka and vicāra are grossness and subtlety of the mind  Māna the error of pride is arrogance But mada prideintoxication is the abolition of the mind of one who is enamored with his own qualities  The names mind citta spirit manas and consciousness vijñāna designate the same thing  The mind and its mental states have a support have an object have an aspect and are associated  In five ways  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The dharmas not associated with the mind are prāpti aprāpti sabhāgāta āsajñika and two absorptions life characteristics nāmakāya etc  and that which is of this type  Prāpti is acquisition and possession  There is prāpti and aprāpti of dharmas that belong to the person himself  And of the two extinctions  There is threefold prāpti of the dharmas of the three periods  There is good prāpti etc of good dharmas etc  The prāptis of the dharmas belonging to the spheres of existence are of their spheres  There is fourfold prāpti of the dharmas that do not belong to the spheres of existence  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Threefold prāpti of the dharmas which are neither aikṣa nor Aśaikṣa  There is twofold prāpti of the dharmas that should not be abandoned  The prāpti of a neutral dharma is simultaneous to it  With the exception of the two supernormal faculties and apparition  The same for the prāpti of defiled rūpa  The prāpti of the rūpa of Kāmadhātu is not previous to this rūpa  Aprāpti is undefiledneutral  Aprāpti of the dharmas of the past or the future is threefold  Aprāpti of the dharmas forming part of the spheres of existence and of the immaculate dharmas is threefold  According to the School a Pṛthagjana is a person who has not acquired the Path  It is abandoned through acquisition prāpti and through passing to another stage  Sabhāgatā is that which causes resemblances between living beings  Nonconsciousness is that which among the Nonconscious Ones arrest the mind and its mental states  Retribution  They live in Bṛhatphala  The same for the nonconscious absorption  In the Fourth Dhyāna  Through desire for deliverance  Good e Solely retribution in the next existence f Not by ryas g It is obtained in one time period  In the same way the absorption that bears the name of nirodha or extinction  It is viewed as tranquility  Arisen from Bhavāgra  Good e Of two retributions and neutral f ryans g It is obtained through effort  In that which concerns the Muni it is obtained through Bodhi itself  But not previously  For the Muni conquers Bodhi in thirtyfour moments  But these two absorptions take place in persons in Kāmadhātu and Rūpadhātu e The absorption of extinction is for the first time among humans  Jīvita is life āyus  The support of warmth and consciousness  Their characteristics are arising old age duration and impermanence  They have in their turn characteristics termed arisingofarising durationofduration etc  The primary characteristic refers to eight dharmas the secondary characteristic to one dharma  Arising engenders the dharma that it should engender but not without the cooperation of causes and conditions  Nāmakāya etc are collections of sajñās vākyas and akṣaras  They exist in Kāmadhātu and Rūpadhātu they belong to living beings they are outflowing and they are neutral d The same for genre sabhāgatā which is also from retribution and which belongs to the three spheres of existence  Possession prāpti is of two types  Its characteristics also  The absorptions and nonpossession aprāpti are of outflowing The hetus are sixfold kāraṇahetu sahabhū sabhāga saṃprayutaka sarvatraga and vipāka  All dharmas are kāraṇahetu with regard to all with the exception of themselves  Sahabhūhetu coexistent causes namely the elements bhūta the mind and the companions of the mind characteristics and the thing characterized are the dharmas that are causes one of the other  The companions of the mind are the mental states the two disciplines savara and the characteristics lakṣaṇas of the mental states the two disciplines and the mind  From the point of view of time of result etc and of goodness etc  Similar dharmas are sabhāgahetu or similar causes  Belong to the same category nikāya and the same stage bhū  Arisen previously  But the Path is sabhāgahetu to the Path without distinguishing the nine stages  The Path is sabhāgahetu to an equal or superior Path  The dharmas acquired through cultivation are sabhāgahetu of the same two classes the equal and the higher  Those which arise through hearing through reflection etc  The mind and  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  its mental states are only saprayuktakahetu causes through association  Which has the same support  Former universals are sarvatragahetu or universal causes of the defiled dharmas of their own stage  Bad dharmas and impure good dharmas are retributive causes  Sarvatragahetu and sabhāgahetu are of two time periods three causes are of three time periods  Conditioned things and disconnection are results  The unconditioned has neither cause nor result  Retribution is the result of the last cause  The predominating result is the result of the first  Outflowing is the result of the similar cause and the universal cause  The pauruṣa or virile result is the result of two causes  Retribution is a neutral dharma  Belonging to living beings  They arise later than a nonneutral dharma  A result that resembles its cause is called outflowing e Extinction through intelligence is disconnection  A dharma is the result of the virile activity of the dharma through the force by which it arises  Any conditioned dharma is the predominating result adhipatiphala of conditioned dharmas with the exception of the dharmas that are later than it  Five causes grasp their result in the present  Two produce their result in the present  Two produce their result in both the past and the present  One cause produces its result in the past  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The mind and its mental states are  defiled  arisen from a retributive cause  others and  pure for the first time arising from causes that remain when one excludes in this order  the retributive cause  the universal cause  these two causes  these two causes plus the similar cause  The associated cause is further excluded with respect to the dharmas that are not mind or mental states  The pratyayas are said to be four  The pratyaya that bears the name of hetu is five hetus  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The mind and its mental states that have arisen with the exception of the last ones are an equal and immediately antecedent condition  All dharmas are the objects of consciousness  The cause termed kāraṇa is called adhipati predominant  Two causes exercise their activity with regard to a perishing dharma  Three with regard to an arising dharma  Two other conditions in reverse order  The mind and its mental states arise by reason of four conditions  The two absorptions by reason of three  The other dharmas by reason of two  Not from God or from any other cause since there is a succession etc  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The primary elements are the cause of the primary correction by CP elements in two ways  And of the derived elements in five ways  Derived elements are the cause of the derived elements in three ways  And the cause of the primary elements in one way  Good bad defiledneutral undefiledneutral minds in Kāmadhātu  Good defiledneutral undefiledneutral minds in Rūpadhātu and in rūpadhātu  And two pure minds  Nine types of minds can arise after a good mind in Kāmadhātu  Such a good mind can arise after eight types of minds  A bad mind can arise after ten types of minds  Four types of minds can arise after such a bad mind e The same for a defiledneutral mind  An undefiledneutral mind can arise after five types of mind  Seven types of mind can arise after an undefiledneutral mind  In Rūpadhātu eleven types of minds can arise after a good mind  A good mind can arise after nine types of minds  A defiledneutral mind can arise after eight types of mind  Six types of minds can arise after a defiledneutral mind  An undefiledneutral mind can arise after three types of mind  Six types of mind can arise after such a undefiledneutral CP correction mind e As above so too in rūpyadhātua for these undefiledneutral minds  Nine types of minds can arise after a good mind  Such a good mind can arise after six types of mind  Seven types of minds can arise after a defiledneutral mind  And the same  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  for it e A aikṣa mind can arise after four types of minds f But five types of minds can arise after such a aikṣa mind g An śaikṣa mind can arise after five types of minds  Four types of minds can arise after such an śaikṣa mind  The twelve types of mind make twenty  By dividing the good mind of the three Dhātus into two the acquired and the innate minds  By dividing an undefiledneutral mind in Kāmadhātu into four the retributive mind the mind of attitude the mind of application and a mind that can create fictive beings  By excluding the undefiledneutral mind of application in Rūpadhātu  With the defiled mind of each of the three spheres there is obtaining of six of six and of two minds respectively  There is the obtaining of three with a good mind of Rūpadhātu  There is an obtaining of four with a aikṣa mind  One obtains these same minds with the other minds  Kāmadhātu consists of hell the Pretas animals humans and six gods  Twenty through the division of the hells and the differences in the continents  Above is Rūpadhātu of seventeen places  made up of dhyānas which are each of three stages But the fourth is of eight stages  rūpyadhātu is not a place  It is fourfold through its mode of existence  Here the mental series exists supported by the nikāya and the vital organ  In these Dhātus there are five realms of rebirth that have been designated by their names  They are undefiledneutral they are the world of beings and they do not include intermediate existence a Seven abodes or types of consciousness vijñānasthitis namely beings different in bodies and ideas beings of different bodies but similar ideas beings similar in body but different in ideas beings similar in body and ideas and  three classes of nonmaterial beings  The rest reduce the vijñāna  With Bhavāgra and unconscious beings are the nine dwellings of beings  There are no other dwellings of beings for elsewhere one lives without desiring it  There are four other sthitis  They consist of the four impure skandhas which are of the same sphere as the vijñāna d Taken separately the consciousness is not defined as an abode of the consciousness  The correspondence admits of four cases  There are here four wombs of beings beings born from eggs etc  Humans and animals are of the four types  Beings in hell intermediate beings and the gods are apparitional too  Pretas are also born from a womb Intermediate existence which inserts itself between existence at death and existence at birth not having arrived at the location where it should go cannot be said to be born  Being similar to the series of rice existence does not reproduce itself after having been interrupted  The existence of the reflection is not proved should it be proved the reflection is not similar hence it does not serve as an example  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   For two things do not exist in the same spot  For it does not form a series  For it arises from two causes  The intermediate being is called by its name  It is the Gandharva  An intermediate being is proved by the text relative to the Five  And by the Sūtra of the gatis  Being projected by the same action that projects the pūrvakālabhava an intermediate being has the form of this being that is the being of the realm of rebirth to come after his conception  This is before death after conception  He is seen by the creatures of his class and by the divine eye  He is filled with the impetus of the supernormal power of action  His organs are complete  He cannot be turned away  It eats odors  The mind mati troubled by defilements goes through its desire for sex to the place of its realm of rebirth  Others go in their desire for odor or in their desire for residence  Beings in hell hang from their feet The first enter in full consciousness the second further dwell in full consciousness the third further leave in full consciousness the fourth accomplishes all these steps with a troubled mind Beings born from eggs are always of this last class Three garbhāvakrāntis  the Cakravartin and the two Svayabhūs  by reason of their great purity of action of knowledge and of action and knowledge  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The ātman does not exist  Only the skandhas conditioned by defilement and action go reincarnating themselves by means of the series of intermediate existences As an example the lamp  In conformity with its projecting cause the series grows gradually and by virtue of the defilements and actions it goes again to another world  In this way the circle of existence is without beginning  Pratītyasamutpāda or dependent origination has twelve parts in three sections or time periods  Two for the first two for the third and eight for the middle  At least to consider the series that has all of its parts  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Ignorance is in a previous life the state of defilement  The saskāras are in a previous life the state of action  The consciousness is the skandhas at conception d Nāmarūpa is the series from this moment on until the production of the six āyatanas  Six āyatanas before coming together of the three or contact  There is sparśa or contact until the moment when the capacity to distinguish the cause of pleasure of suffering etc is acquired  There is contact before sexual union  Desire thirst is the state of one who desires pleasure and sexual union  Upādāna or attachment is the state of one who runs around in search of the pleasures  He does actions which will have for their result future existence bhava this is bhava  Jāti is the new reincarnation  Old ageanddeath lasts until sensation  According to the School it is static pratītyasamutpāda  In order to have aberration cease with regard to the past the future and the interval in between  Three parts are defilement two are action seven are foundation and also result  In two sections cause and result are abbreviated for one can infer them from the teaching of the middle From defilement there arises defilement and action from whence foundation from whence a new foundation and defilement such is the manner of existence of the parts of existence or bhavāṇgas  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Samutpāda is the cause whereas samutpanna is the result  Avidyā is a separate entity dharma the opposite of vidyā or knowledge like a nonfriend the untrue etc  Because it is declared to be bound sayojana etc  Avidyā is not bad prajñā because this is seeing darśana  Because views are associated with ignorance  and because ignorance is defined as a defilement of prajñā  Nāman are the skandhas that are not rūpa  There are six contacts They arise from encounter  Five are contact through actual contact the sixth is socalled through denomination  Contact of knowledge nonknowledge other which are respectively pure defiled other  Contacts of antipathy and sympathy  Three contacts leading to pleasure sukhavedya etc  Six sensations arise from contact  Five are bodily sensations and one is mental  This same sensation is of eighteen types by reason of the objects of the mind manopavicāras  In Kāmadhātu all of the manopavicāras have their own Dhātu for their object  Rūpadhātu is the object of twelve  The highest Dhātu rūpydhātu is the object for three  In two Dhyānas twelve  All have Kāmadhātu for their object  Eight have their own Dhātu for their object  Two have rūpyadhātu for their object  But in the other two Dhyānas six e Kāmadhātu is the object of six f Of their own Dhātu four g The highest Dhātu rūpyadhātu is the object of one  In the preliminary stage of rūpyadhātu  four have Rūpadhātu for their object  One has the highest sphere for its object  In rūpyadhātu itself one e which has its own Dhātu for its object f All of these eighteen are impure  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The others have been explained or will be explained here  It is explained that defilement is like a seed a Nāga a root a tree a husk of grain  Action is like grain with its husk grass flower  The substantial entity vastu is like food and drink d Among the four existences existence as arising is always defiled and by all the defilements of the sphere to which it belongs  The other existences are of three types  Three in the rūpyas  Everyone lasts through food  Food by the mouthfuls exists in Kāmadhātu it consists of three āyatanas  Rūpāyatana is not food for it comforts neither its organ nor those delivered  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   In the three Dhātus contact volition and consciousness when they are impure are food c Mind created manomaya desiring reexistence sabhavaṣin Gandharva an eater of odors intermediate existence antarābhava and arising nirvṛtti Among the foods two have for their result the growth of the āśraya the body and the āśrita the mind and two have for their result the projection and the production of a new existence  Breaking taking up again detachment loss of detachment death and birth are regarded as proper to the mind consciousness  Death and birth with the sensation of indifference  Neither the one nor the other is absorption nor for one without thought  He obtains Nirvāṇa in two neutral minds c When death is gradual the manas dies in the feet at the navel in the heart accordingly as the being goes below among humans among the Suras or is not reborn  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The vital parts are split by water etc  An rya and one guilty of ānantarya transgressions are predestined the first to health the second to loss Here is how it is thought that the receptacle world is arranged at the bottom there is a circle of wind immeasurable with a height of sixteen hundred thousand leagues  The circle of water eleven hundred twenty thousand high  Then the circle of waters is no more than eight hundred thousand leagues in height the rest becomes gold a The circle of water and gold have a diameter of twelve hundred three thousand four hundred and fifty leagues triple for its perimeter b There are Meru Yugandhara ṣādhara Khadiraka Mount Sudarśana Aśvakarṇa Vinataka and Mount Nimindhara beyond are the continents on the edge is Cakravāḍa d Seven mountains are made of gold the last is made of iron and Meru is made of four jewels  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  b Meru is immersed in the water to a depth of twentyfour thousand leagues and rises above the water some eighty thousand leagues  The immersion of the eight other mountains diminishes each by a half The mountains have equal width and height  The seven Sītās of which the first is of eighty thousand leagues form the interval between the mountains  This is the inner ocean triple in circumference The other Sītās diminish by a half The rest is the great outer sea of three hundred twentytwo thousand leagues b There is Jambudvīpa three sides of two thousand in the form of a carriage and one side of three and a half  eastern Videha like a halfmoon three sides like Jambu and one side of three hundred fifty  Godānīya of seven thousand five hundred round with a diameter of two thousand five hundred and Kuru of eight thousand square parallel  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  There are eight intermediate continents Dehas Videhas Kurus Kauravas Cāmaras and Avaracāmaras āṭhas and Uttaramantrins Here to the north of the nine antMountains lie the Himavat beyond it but on this side of the Mountain of Perfume is a lake deep and wide by fifty leagues At the bottom at twenty thousand leagues is Avīci of this same dimension above the seven hells all eight have sixteen utsadas  Kukūla Kuṇapa Kṣuramārga etc and the River are located at the four cardinal points of these hells  There are eight other hells the cold hells Arbuda etc  At midMeru lie the moon and the sun  Fifty and fifty and one leagues  Midnight it sets midday it rises at the same moment c The nights grow longer after the ninth day of the second quarter of the second month of the rains and they grow shorter after the ninth day of the second quarter of the fourth month of winter Reverse for the days  The days and the nights grow longer little by little accordingly as the sun goes towards the south or towards the north  The moon is covered by its shadow by reason of its proximity to the sun and one sees it incompletely  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  There are four terraces the distance between them being ten thousand leagues extending out sixteen eight four and two thousand leagues  They are the Karoṭapāṇis the Mālādharas the Sadāmattas and the two Mahārājikas and also on the seven mountains The Thirtythree Gods are at the summit of Meru the sides of which are eighty thousand leagues At the corners four peaks which the Vajrapāṇis inhabit  In the middle with sides of two thousand five hundred with a height of one and a half is a village called Sudarśana of gold with a variegated and smooth sun  There is Vaijayanta with sides of two hundred fifty On the outside this village is adorned with Caitraratha Pāruṣya Miśra and Nandana Parks  at a distance of twenty thousand leagues from these Parks at the four sides there are excellent fields At the northeast Pārijāta in the southwest Sudharmā  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Above the gods reside in houses  There are six gods who taste pleasure they unite through coupling an embrace the touch of hands a smile and a look  Among these gods their newborn are similar to infants of five to ten years  The gods of Rūpadhātu are complete and clothed  There are three arisings of the objects of desire the gods of Kāmadhātu together with humans  There are three arisings of pleasure the nine spheres of three Dhyānas  To the extent that there is descent from one residence to this extent there is ascent towards a higher residence  The gods do not see their superiors without magic or the assistance of another  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  One thousand fourcontinents moons suns Merus dwellings of the Kāma gods and world of Brahmā make up a small chiliocosm one thousand small chiliocosms make a dichiliocosm  the middle universe and one thousand dichiliocosms make a trichiliocosm The destruction and the creation of the universe lasts the same time The inhabitants of Jambudvīpa have a height of four or of three elbows and a half those called Pūrva Goda and Uttara by doubling each time  The bodies of the gods of Kāmadhātu increase by quarters of krośa until a krośa and a half  The bodies of the gods of Rūpadhātu are at first a half yojana then increase by a half beyond the Parīttābhas the bodies double and reduce three yojanas from the Anabhrakas on Life among Kurus is one thousand years in length in the two continents it diminishes twice by half here it is indeterminate nevertheless it is ten years at the end and incalculable at the beginning a Fifty human years make a dayandnight for the lowest gods of Kāmadhātu and these gods live a life of five hundred years For the higher gods double the day and the life b There is no day and night for the gods of Rūpadhātu their lifespans are calculated in kalpas whose number is fixed by the dimensions of their bodies  In rūpyadhātu a lifespan of a CP should be twenty thousand kalpas which increases as much These kalpas are from the Parīttābhas on mahākalpas below halves In six hells Sajīva etc a day and night has the length of the life of the gods of Kāmadhātu with such days life as for the gods of Kāmadhātu  In Pratāpana a lifespan of a half antaḥkalpa in Avīci a lifespan of one antaḥkalpa  The life of animals is one kalpa in length at most the life of the Pretas is five hundred years with its days the duration of a month Life in the Arbudas is the time of the exhaustion of a vāha by taking a grain of sesame every one hundred years the others by multiplying each time by twenty  With the exception of Kuru there is death before their time  An atom paramaṇu a syllable akṣara and an instant kṣaṇa is the limit of matter of words and of time d Paramāṇu aṇu loharajas abrajas śaśarajas avirajas gorajas chidrarajas likṣā that which comes out of the likṣā yava and aṇguliparvan by multiplying each time by seven  twentyfour aṇgulis make one hasta four hastas make one dhanus five hundred dhanus make one krośa the distance a hermitage should be located and eight krośas make what is called one yojana b One hundred and twenty kṣanas make one tatkṣaṇa sixteen should be  tatkṣaṇas make one lava we obtain a muhūrta or hour and ahorāta or one day and night and a māsa or month  by multiplying the preceding term by thirty a savatsara or year is of twelve months by adding the ūnarātras  There are different types of kalpa  A kalpa of disappearance lasts from the nonproduction of the damned to destruction of the receptacle world  The kalpa of creation lasts from the primordial wind until the production of hellish beings  A small kalpa in the course of which a lifespan from infinite becomes a lifespan ten years in length  The eighteen kalpas which are of augmentation and of diminution  One of augmentation  They go to a lifespan of eighty thousand  In this way then the world stays created for twenty kalpas  During the same length of time the world is in the process of creation in the process of disappearance and in a state of disappearance  These eighty make a great kalpa d The quality of Buddhahood results from three of these kalpas  They appear during the decrease to one hundred  The Pratyekabuddhas appear in the course of two periods  The Rhinoceros by reason of one hundred kalpas The Cakravartin Kings do not appear when lifespan is under eighty thousand years in length they have a wheel of gold a wheel of silver a wheel of copper and a wheel of iron  in inverse order he reigns over one two three or four continents but never two at once like the Buddhas they triumph through spontaneous default personal influence fighting or the sword but always without doing evil  But the marks of the Muni are better placed more brilliant and complete  In the beginning beings were similar to the gods of Rūpadhātu then little by little through attachment to taste and through laziness they made provisions and attributed parts to themselves a protector of the fields was by them retributed  Then through the development of the courses of action life shortened to a length of ten years The kalpa terminates through iron sickness hunger which last respectively seven days seven months and seven years  There are three destructions through fire water and wind c Three Dhyānas beginning with the second are in order the top of the destructions by reason of the community of the nature of destructions and the vices of the first three Dhyānas  As for the Fourth Dhyāna no destruction by reason of its nonagitation this is not that it is eternal for its mansions are produced and perish along with the beings who live therein Seven by fire one by water and when seven destructions by water have thus taken place seven by fire followed by the destruction by wind  The variety of the world arises from action  It is volition and that which is produced through volition  Volition is mental action it gives rise to two actions bodily and vocal action  These two actions are informative and noninformative b Bodily vijñapti is shape It is not movement because all conditioned things are momentary since they perish on the other hand  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  nothing does not perish without a cause and the creative cause would be at the same time destructive  It would be perceived by two organs  Shape does not exist in an atom  Vocal vijñapti is vocal sound T a Without causes nothing could disappear  b The cause for the arising of an attribute would also be the agent of its disappearance  c How would it be directly perceivable through a second sense organ c But shape does not exist down to its atoms either  d Furthermore vocal informing is speech vagdhvani  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Scripture says that rūpa is of three types and that there is a pure rūpa there is increase of merit and there is a course of action for him who is not concerned with himself etc  From the first moment the avijñapti of Kāmadhātu arises derived from the past primary elements T ab Because  the three categories of form and  fluxfree form have been stated and because of  increase  the path of karman of one who does not perform the deed himself and so forth  cd After the first moment the noninforming that belongs to the desire realm arises from past elements  When impure bodily and vocal action derive from the primary elements of the sphere to which they belong  When they are pure they are from the primary elements of the sphere to which the person who has produced them belongs  The avijñapti is not integral to the organism it is also an outflowing it belongs solely to living beings T ab The bodily or the vocal karman that is flux driven arisen depending on elements of its own stage  c That which is fluxfree arises depending on those of the stage where the person was born  d The noninforrning is unattached anupattika  Not of absorption it derives from the primary elements which are an outflowing which are integral to the organism which are differentiated Arisen from absorption it derives from nondifferentiated primary elements not integral to the organism and increase T a is cognate naisyandika belongs to sentient beings sattvakhya  b It arises from elements that are cognate and attached  cd That which arises in concentration samadhija arises from developed aupacayika unattached and unspecialized elements  The avijñapti is never neutral  Other actions are of three types  Bad action exists in Kāmadhātu  Avijñapti also exists in Rūpadhātu  Vijñapti exists in the two spheres where there is vicāra T a There is no neutral noninforming  b  Other karman is threefold bC l Furthermore there lS the impure in the realm of desire  c There is also the noninforming in form realm  dThe informing is in the two stages where there is deliberation vicara  The vijñapti termed nivṛta is also missing in Kāmadhātu  Because the cause which produces it is absent  Deliverance is absolute good  The roots respect and fear are good in and of themselves  That which is associated with the roots etc is good through association  Actions etc are good by reason of their original cause  Evil is the contrary  Two entities are neutral in the absolute sense  That which gives rise samutthāna is of two types which are known as hetusamutthāna and tatkṣaṇasamutthāna  Which are respectively first setter into motion and second mover  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The consciousness to be abandoned through Seeing is solely agent  The manas susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation is twofold  The five are solely mover  From a good agent etc a mover of three types  With regard to the Muni mover of the same type  Or good  That which arises from retribution is neither of the two  Avijñapti is threefold discipline savara undiscipline asavara and different from either discipline or undiscipline  Prātimokṣa discipline pure discipline discipline arising from dhyāna  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The Prātimokṣa is of eight types  In substance however the Prātimokṣa is of four types  The name changes with the gender  The disciplines exist separately  But they do not contradict one another By undertaking the renouncing of the five things to avoid of the eight the ten of all the things to avoid one obtains the quality of Upāsaka Upavāsastha rāmaṇera and Bhikṣu  Morality good conduct action and discipline  The Prātimokṣa is the first vijñapti and the first avijñapti these are courses of action karmapatha  Eight persons possess the Prātimokṣa  He who possesses dhyāna possesses the discipline which arises from dhyāna  The ryans possess pure discipline  The last two disciplines are concomitants of the mind  Arising in the ānantaryamārgas in anāgamya they are called abandoning  Discipline of the mind and discipline of the organs are each of them two things attentive consciousness and mindfulness  He who is in Prātimokṣa always possesses avijñapti of the present moment as long as he does not reject the avijñapti  After the first moment he also possesses avijñapti  So too is he who dwells in undiscipline  He who possesses discipline arisen from dhyāna always possesses past and future avijñapti  The ryan at the first moment does not possess past avijñapti  The person who is in a state of absorption the person who is placed in the Way possesses avijñapti of the present moment  The intermediary at the first moment possesses medially avijñapti when the avijñapti is produced  Afterwards he possesses avijñapti of the present and the past As long as he is endowed with faith or with very active defilements the undisciplined person possesses good avijñapti and the disciplined person possesses bad avijñapti  Those who have created one vijñapti possess it always in the present  From the second moment onward they possess vijñapti of the past until the moment when they give it up  One cannot possess future vijñapti  One does not possess past vijñapti of the nivṛta and anivṛta classes  Undiscipline bad conduct immorality action course of action  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The intermediary acting with a weak volition possesses a single vijñapti  The ryan possesses a single avijñapti when he has not produced or has abandoned the vijñapti  The discipline that arises from dhyāna is acquired by one thought of the sphere of the dhyāna  Pure discipline by the same mind when it is ryan  That which is called Prātimokṣa through paravijñapana etc  One undertakes the discipline for a lifetime or for a day and a night  There is undiscipline for a day and a night  For says the School one does not undertake it thus One should undertake the fast upavāsa in a humble attitude speaking after with ornaments removed until the morrow complete the morning from another  Part of morality sīla part of vigilance apramāda parts of ascetic vows vrata have respectively four one three parts  In order to avoid weakness of mindfulness and arrogance  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Others can possess the fast but not without taking the Refuges  The discipline is produced through the fact that he accepts the qualities of an Upāsaka  One explains them to him as is also the case for a Bhikṣu  If all Upāsakas possess the discipline of the Upāsaka how can an Upāsaka be an ekadeśakārin etc  These terms say the School refer to the fact of observing the rules  All the disciplines are weak etc according to the mind He who takes the Refuges takes refuge in the aśaikṣa dharmas which form the Buddha in the two types of dharmas which form the Sagha and in Nirvāna  Sexual misconduct because it is much censured because one easily abstains from it because the ryans have obtained abstention from it  They have acquired it as they have accepted the discipline they have not accepted it with regard to some persons  Because having violated any other rule he would lie  One renounces strong liquor which is a transgression of disobedience  In order that the other rules may be kept  One acquires the discipline of Kāmadhātu relative to all actions relative to the two types of beings and to the two types of actions relative to things of the present  One acquires the discipline of dhyāna and the pure discipline relative to actions themselves and to things of the three time periods  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   One acquires discipline with regard to all beings one must distinguish regarding the parts and the causes  Undiscipline with regard to all relative to all parts and not by reason of all causes  One acquires undiscipline through action or through accepting it  One acquires the other avijñaptis by reason of the field of undertaking of an action seriously undertaken  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  The Prātimokṣa discipline is lost through abjuration through death through hermaphroditism through the cutting off of the roots and by the night coming to an end  Some say through a patanīya  Through the disappearance of the Good Law say some other masters  The Kaśmīreans believe that the transgressor possesses morality and immorality in the manner that a person can have riches and debts  The good of the sphere of dhyāna is lost through a change of state and through falling  The same for the good of rūpyadhātu  Pure good is lost through the obtaining of a result through perfection of the faculties or through falling away  Undiscipline is lost through the acquisition of discipline through death or through hermaphroditism  Intermediate avijñapti is lost through the cutting off of the force the undertaking the action the object the life and the roots  Good nonmaterial action of the sphere of Kāmadhātu is lost through the cutting off of the roots and through arising in a superior sphere  That which is defiled and nonmaterial is lost through the arising of its opposite  Humans  with the exception of the two categories of eunuchs hermaphrodites and the Kurus  are susceptible of undiscipline the same for the discipline which pertains also to the gods  The three disciplines exist among humans  Discipline of dhyāna exists among the gods of Kāmadhātu and Rūpadhātu  So too the pure discipline with the exception of the gods of the intermediate dhyāna and the Asajñisattvas and also in rūpyadhātu  Good action is salutary bad action is pernicious and action differing from good and bad is different from the salutary and the pernicious  There are meritorious actions demeritorious actions and nonagitated actions and three actions of which the action of agreeable feeling is the first  Meritorious action is a good action in Kāmadhātu nonagitated action is a good action above there  Because with regard to that which concerns its retribution action of the domain of the higher stages does not vary  Good action up to the Third Dhyāna is of agreeable feeling  Above it is of neither agreeable nor disagreeable sensation  Bad action here below is of disagreeable sensation  According to some intermediary action also exists below  Since there is no retribution with regard to dhyānāntara  Because it is admitted that the retribution of the three types of action takes place at the one and same time  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  There are five ways of being vedanīya sensed experienced of itself through sensation as an object by being retributed and by the fact of its presence  This action is determinate or indeterminate  Determinate action is of three types to be experienced in the present life etc  According to one opinion action is of five types  Others distinguish four alternatives  Three types of actions project existence  Fourfold production throughout  Good action in the hells is solely of three types  When he is firm the fool does not produce any action to be experienced at the stage from whence he is detached in his next existence  The rya no longer produces any action to be experienced in a later existence  The ryan not firm when he is detached from Kāmadhātu or from Bhavāgra the same  The intermediate being in Kāmadhātu produces twentytwo types of actions  These actions bear their results in the present existence  For all these states form together with the intermediate existence only a single existence Action accomplished through intense defilement or through intense faith with regard to the field of qualities continually and the murdering of a father and a mother are determinate  Action bears result in the present existence by reason of certain characteristics of the field and the intention  And also when one is definitely detached with regard to the stage in which the action appears  Action determinate with regard to retribution Persons who have left either nirodha or maitri or araṇā or Seeing the Truths or the result of Arhat all good and all bad with regard to them is immediately retributed  Sensation the result of good action free from vitarka is exclusively mental  Sensation which is the result of a bad action is exclusively physical  Mentaltrouble is produced in the mental consciousness  It arises from the retribution of action  Through fear the attack of demons irritation of the elements and fear  Among beings in Kāmadhātu with the exception of the Kurus  What is termed crookedness corruption stains is action arisen from hypocrisy hatred and attachment  Action is of four types white black etc Bad actions good action of Rūpa good actions of Kāma are respectively black white blackwhite action which destroys the other actions is pure action A volition may be of twelve types namely the volition of the dharmakṣāntis and of the first eight paths of abandoning in the detachment of Kāmadhātu such is the action which destroys black action  The volition of the ninth is the action which destroys blackwhite action  Volition which arises in the last paths of abandoning of the detachment of the dhyānas destroys good action  According to others the first two actions are retributed in hell and retributed moreover in Kāmadhātu  According to others arisen in Kāma actions are black when they can be abandoned through Seeing the Truths they are blackwhite in the contrary case  Aśaikṣa that is an Arhats actions of the body voice and mind are in this order the three silences  The threefold good practice in its entirety is the threefold purification  The bad actions of the body speech and mind are regarded as being the three bad practices  Even though greed wickedness anger and false views are not actions they constitute a threefold bad practice of the mind  Good practice is the opposite  By taking among these practices the most evident one defines the ten courses of action good and bad respectively  Six bad courses of action can be exclusively avijñapti  One bad course of action is always of two types  Six when one carries them out himself are of two types also  Seven good courses of action are of two types  They are only avijñapti when they have arisen from absorption  The sāmantakas are vijñapti  They may or may not be avijñapti  The opposite concerning consecutive action  Preparatory action arises from three roots  Greed and the other two mental courses arise from the three roots because they appear subsequent to these roots  Good actions with their preparatory and consecutive actions arise from nondesire nonhatred and nonignorance  Killing wickedness and injurious words are achieved through hate  Adultery greed and stealing are achieved through desire  False views through ignorance  The others by the three  Object living beings objects of enjoyment nāmarūpa and nāman  If one dies before or at the same time there is no principal course of action  Because a new body has come into existence  As soldiers etc concur in the realization of the same effect all are as guilty as the one who kills  Murder is to kill another consciously without making an error  Stealing  taking what is not given  is to appropriate to oneself the goods of another through force or in secret  Illicit sexuality fourfold is intercourse with a women with whom one should not have intercourse  Lying is discourse held with differing thoughts with a person who understands the meaning What is perceived through the visual consciousness through the auditory consciousness through the mental consciousness and through three consciousnesses is called in order seen heard cognized and known  Malicious or slanderous speech is the discourse of a person with a defiled mind with a view to dividing  Injurious words are abusive discourse  All defiled discourse is inconsiderate speech  According to others inconsiderate speech is the defiled discourse which differs from the others  For example boasting singing declamations for example bad commentaries  Greed is the desire to appropriate to oneself by illegitimate means the goods of another  Wickedness is a hatred of living beings  False view is the opinion that there is neither good nor bad  Three are courses of action seven are also action  The view of negation cuts off the roots of good  The innate roots of the sphere of Kāmadhātu  The false view which negates cause and result  Completely  Gradually  The cutting off takes place among humans  Men and women cut off the roots  The rationalist  The cutting off is nonpossession  Rearising through doubt through insight into the existence of cause etc  Not there for one guilty of ānantarya  With regard to the painful realms of rebirth volition can coexist at most with eight courses  Concerning good courses of action volition can coexist with ten  Volition does not coexist with one eight or five courses of action  Inconsiderate words injurious words anger of two types exist in hell  Greed and false views as potentiality  Three exist in Uttarakuru  The seventh course exists there in fact also  The ten bad courses of action exist elsewhere in Kāmadhātu  Three good courses of action exist everywhere as potentiality and in fact  In the rūpyas among the Unconscious Ones seven courses of action exist as potentiality  For the rest good courses of action also exist in fact with the exception of beings in hell and the Uttarakurus  All the other courses of action have retributive results outflowing result and predominating results  The result is threefold because one makes him suffer because one makes him die and because one destroys his vigor  Bodily and vocal actions which arise from attachment are wrong manner of livelihood it constitutes a separate category because it is difficult to purify  If one says that it is solely action issued from attachment to the resources necessary for life no for this is in contradiction with the Sūtra  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Impure in the path of abandoning action embraces the five results  Pure it includes four results  The rest of pure action and neutral action three results  The good bad neutral dharmas constitute four two and three results of good action  Good bad neutral dharmas constitute respectively two three and four results of bad action  The same dharmas  good bad neutral dharmas  make up two three and three results of neutral action  Some dharmas of all types constitute four results of past action  Some future dharmas constitute four results of median action  There are two which are median dharmas  For action not yet arisen there are three results made up of future dharmas  Some dharmas of the same stage constitute four results whereas some dharmas of another stage constitute three or two results  Some aikṣa dharmas etc constitute three results of aikṣa action  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  d aikṣa dharmas etc constitute one result three results and two results of Aśaikṣa action etc  Some aikṣa dharmas etc constitute two results two results and five results of action differing from the two preceding  Dharmas susceptible of being abandoned through Seeing the Truths dharśanaheya susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation bhāvanāheya and not susceptible of being abandoned apraheya constitute three results four two is a typo results one result of action susceptible of being abandoned through Seeing the Truths  The same dharmas constitute two four and three results of action susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation  The same dharmas constitute respectively one result two results and four results of action not susceptible of being abandoned  Improper action is defiled action according to some irregular action also  One action projects one arising  Many actions complete an existence  Neither the two absorptions of unconsciousness nor the prāptis project an existence nantarya actions chronic defilements and bad realms of rebirth and Asajñisattvas and Kurus are the threefold obstacle  Mortal transgressions exist in the three continents  It is not admitted that eunuchs etc are capable of this transgression because of the mediocrity of their kindness and respect  The other two obstacles exist in the five realms of rebirth  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Schism is by its nature disharmony this is an undefiledneutral dharma disassociated from the mind  It is the Sagha which possesses the schism  The transgression of schism is lying it belongs to the schismatic  The schismatic falls into Avīci for a kalpa  Suffering grows by reason of supplementary transgression  A Bhikṣu who is an intellectual who is virtuous divides  Elsewhere  Fools  When it admits another Master or another Path it is divided  It does not exceed a day  Is what we understand by breaking the Wheel  In Jamdudvīpa  By nine or more  Ritual schism in three continents  This schism supposes eight Bhikṣus or more  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  The breaking of the Wheel is impossible at the beginning at the end before the abscess before a pair when the Sage is extinguished or when a parish has not been delimited  Because they destroy or hurt a field of benefaction or a field of qualities  Even if their gender changes there is mortal transgression  The mother is the woman from whose blood one is born  No when he only had the intention of striking the Buddha  No with regard to the person who became an Arhat after the blow  Detachment and its result are impossible for one who has made preparation for a mortal transgression  Lying with a view to schism is considered the gravest transgression  Among the good worldly dharmas a volition for Bhavāgra bears the greatest result  To defile ones mother to defile an Arhantī to kill a predestined Bodhisattva to kill a aikṣa and to steal the goods of the Sagha are transgressions similar to mortal transgressions the fifth is the destruction of a Stūpa  He absolutely impedes actions by the acquisition of Kṣānti the quality of Anāgāmin and the quality of Arhat  Since when is one a Bodhisattva  When he begins to cultivate actions which produce the marks  Has good realms of rebirth he is born into noble families he possesses all the organs avyakṣaḥ he is a male he remembers his past lives and he does not desist avivṛt anivrt is a typo  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  In Jambudvīpa being a male in the presence of the Buddhas thinking of the Buddhas having their origin in reflection in the course of one hundred supplementary cosmic ages  Each arises from one hundred merits  At the end of the three asakhyeyas Paśyin Dīpa and Ratnaśikhin  The first was ākyamuni  He completed Giving by giving everything to everyone out of compassion  Morality and Patience were completed by his not being irritated even when his limbs were broken although he was still tied to desire  Energy by praising Puṣya  Absorption and Intelligence immediately before  Three are merit action occasions of the exercise of action as in the case of deeds  Giving is what gives  Through the desire to render homage or service  It is bodily and vocal action and that which produces this action  It has for its results great joys  Giving is beneficial to oneself to others to both or neither  Giving is excellent by the excellence of the giver of the object given and of the field  The giver is excellent through his faith etc  He gives with respect etc  From whence he obtains honors superior joys at the right time sheltered from all loss  The object perfect in color etc  From whence beauty glory joy great lightness of the body and contacts corresponding to the season  The field is excellent through the realm of rebirth suffering benefactors and qualities  The best is the gift from a delivered person to a delivered person  Or a gift from the Bodhisattva  Or the eighth Even though they are not ryans offering made to ones father and mother to a sick person to a preacher to the Bodhisattva in his last birth are without measure Accordingly as these causes  consecutive field adhiṣṭhāna preparation volition or intention  are small or large action also is small or large Action is termed accumulated by reason of its intentional character by its completion by the absence of regret and opposition by its accompaniments and by its retribution  The merit of a gift to a Caitya is merit produced by abandoning  Even though no one receives it as is the case with compassion etc  Even seeded into a bad field the gift bears agreeable results for there is never opposition between the result and the seed  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Immorality is bad rūpa Morality is the renouncing of immorality  Of two types  It is further the renouncing of that which is prohibited by the Buddha  Pure when it is endowed with the four qualities  Not troubled by immorality by the causes of immorality it takes as its support the opposite of immorality and peace  Good absorption or good in absorption is bhāvana meditation soaking in or impregnation  Because it perfumes impregnates the mind  Essentially the precepts have heaven for their result meditation has disconnection for its result  Four possess Brahmin merit because they are happy in the heavens for a kalpa  The gift of the Dharmas is the correct teaching not defiled of the Sūtras etc  Good is threefold merit Nirvāṇa and penetration  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  An industrious action of the body of the voice or of the mind with that which gives rise to it are such things as writing carving eloquence poetry and calculation  Defiled dharmas are sāvadya nivṛta and hīna  Good and pure dharmas are praṇīta  Good conditioned dharmas are sevya  Deliverance is the highest  The roots of existence that is of rebirth or of action are the anuśayas  Six attachment and then anger pride ignorance false views and doubt d These six make seven through the division of attachment  Attachment to existence arises from the two Dhātus  It is so called because it is turned within and in order to avoid the idea that these two Dhātus are deliverance There are five erroneous views a belief in a self satkāyadṛṣṭI false views mithyādṛṣṭi a belief in the extremes antagrāhadṛṣṭi the esteeming of views dṛṣṭiparāmarśa and the esteeming of morality and ascetic practices śīlavrataparāmarśa thus there are ten anuśayas With the exception of three or two views ten seven seven eight anuśayas are abandoned in Kāmadhātu by the Seeing of Suffering and the three other Truths respectively  Four are abandoned through Meditation  The same with the exception of the angers for Rūpadhātu  The same in rūpyadhātu  In this way there are ninetyeight  When they arise in Bhavāgra the highest state of rūpyadhātu the anuśayas which are struck by the kṣāntis are abandoned through Seeing and through Meditation  The anuśayas which are not struck by the kṣāntis are only abandoned through meditation The view of self and things pertaining to self the view of eternity and annihilation the view of negation the view that holds as high that which is low and that which holds for cause and Path that which is not cause and Path these are the five views If one clings to the idea that the Lord etc is the cause of the world this is by reason of false conceptions of permanence and personality Thus this clinging is to be abandoned through Seeing the Truth of Suffering  One distinguishes four errors within the three views  Reflective judgment and affirmation because they allow complete error  Thought and idea are termed error by reason of view  There are seven types of pride māna  Three make nine types  They perish through Seeing and Meditation c The paryavasthāna of killing etc is abandoned through Meditation the thirst for nonexistence etc  The thirst for nonexistence etc  Among the ryans the various types of pride etc and egotism because they are nourished by views and bad regret are impossible  Because they are nourished by views Universal anuśayas are the erroneous views and doubts which are abandoned through the Seeing of Suffering and Arising the ignorance which is associated with them and independent ignorance  Among them nine with the exception of the two views bear on the superior  With the exception of the prāptis dharmas coexistent with the universal anuśayas are also universals Wrong views doubt and the ignorance which is bound yukta to them and independent ignorance abandoned through the Seeing of Extinction and the Path make six anuśayas whose object is pure The extinction of their own bhūmi is the object of the anuśayas which have extinction for their sphere the Path with its six or nine bhūmis is the object of the anuśayas which have the Path for their sphere for the Paths depend on one another  Lust does not bear on pure dharmas because lust should be rejected  Anger does not because pure dharmas do not do evil  Egotism and the two esteemings do not because pure dharmas are calm pure and excellent Universal anuśayas relative to the object become anuśayana in all their spheres the nonuniversals in their one category  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Not the anuśayas that bear on the pure dharmas or a higher sphere because their object is not made ones own and opposes the anuśayas  Any anuśaya which is associated with a certain dharma becomes anuśaya through association with this dharma  All the higher dhyānas are morally neutral  The belief in a self a belief in extremes and ignorance are neutral in Kāmadhātu  The other anuśayas here are bad  Lust anger and mūḍi in Kāmadhātu are roots of evil  Three roots desire ignorance and mati that is prajñā are neutral  The others are not roots because their modality is of duality and elevation  Four say the Aparāntakas desire views egotism and delusion which are neutral in fact there are three contemplations based on ignorance  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  Categorical response as for death a distinguishing response as for rebirth a response by question as for superiority and a response by rejecting the question as for nonidentity One is bound by lust anger and egotism past and present to the object from whence they have been produced without their having been abandoned  One is bound to all objects by the same future kleśas since they are mental states  One is bound to the object of their time period by the same future kleśas since they are not mental states  Not destined to arise one is bound everywhere by the same  One is bound everywhere by the others whatever they are  The dharmas exist in the three time periods  Because the Blessed One has said it  Because mental consciousness preceeds from two  Because it has an object  And because the past bears a result  He who affirms the existence of the dharmas of the three time periods is held to be a Sarvāstivādin   There are four types of Sarvāstivādins accordingly as they teach a difference in existence bhāva a difference in characteristic a difference in condition and mutual difference  The third is the best  The three time periods are proven by reason of their activity  What is opposed to the activity of a dharma  How can activity be past etc  But it is not other than the dharma  The time periods are no longer justified  Existing in the same manner how can it be nonarisen or destroyed  The nature of things is indeed profound When that which is to be abandoned through the Seeing of Suffering is abandoned the ascetic remains in connection with it from the fact of the universal defilements when the first category is abandoned he remains in connection with it from the fact of the other defilements which have it as their object Abandoned through the Seeing of Suffering and Arising abandoned through Meditation the dharmas in Kāmadhātu are the sphere of the three consciousnesses of this sphere of one consciousness of Rūpadhātu and the pure consciousness  The same three categories of dharmas in Rūpadhātu are the object of three consciousnesses of Rūpadhātu three of Kāmadhātu one of rūpyadhātu and the pure consciousness  The same categories of dharmas in rūpyadhātu are the objects of the three consciousnesses of the three spheres and pure consciousness  The dharmas abandoned through the Seeing of Extinction and the Path are all the objects of the same consciousness with the addition of the consciousness of their own category  The pure dharmas are the object of the last three consciousnesses of the three spheres and of pure consciousness  The defiled mind is sānuśaya in two ways the nondefiled mind solely from the fact of the anuśayas which lodge therein  From moha there is doubt  From whence false views e From whence a belief in a self  From whence a belief in the extremes  From whence the esteeming of morality and ascetic practices  From whence the esteeming of bad views  From whence lust and pride relative to ones own views e And hatred with respect to another f Such is the order Kleśas with complete causes arise from the nonabandonment of the anuśaya from the presence of their object and from erroneous judgment  With complete causes  In Kāmadhātu the defilements with the exception of ignorance but with the wrappings of attachment constitute āsravas  In Rūpadhātu and rūpadhātu only the anuśayas themselves constitute the cankerous influence of existence  They are morally neutral proceed inwards and belong to the stage of absorption this is why they are put together  Ignorance is the root it is thus said to constitute a separate cankerous influence  So too for the floods and the yokes But views constitute a separate flood and a separate yoke by reason of their acuteness  They are not a separate cankerous influence because without companions they are not favorable to installation  So too the upādānas the clingings by placing ignorance with the first two and by dividing the dṛṣṭis into two  Ignorance is not the grasper like clinging it is mixed with the other anuśayas They are atomic they adhere they nourish themselves in two ways they continually blind this is why they are termed anuśayas They fix and they flow they carry away they attach they seize such is the etymology of the words āsravas etc  There are said to be five types by reason of their division into conections etc  Two views constitute separate connection by reason of their equal number of things and by reason of their common characteristics of esteeming Envy and avarice are each a connection because among the wrappings they are at one and the same time completely bad and independent  Five are inferior  Two cause on not to get out of Kāmadhātu three cause one to return there  Three because they make up the gate and the root Three are indicated because three things create an obstacle to arriving at deliverance a nondesire to go error with respect to the Path and doubt with respect to the Path  Five are superior namely two lusts those which arise from Rūpahdhātu and from rūpadhātu namely dissipation pride and ignorance  There are three bonds by reason of sensation Defiled mental states forming part of the saskāraskandha but different form the kleśas are also upakleśas without being kleśas  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  There are eight types of wrappings disrespect absence of fear envy avarice dissipation regret torpor and languor  Also anger and hypocrisy  From out of lust there proceeds disrespect dissipation and avarice  There is no agreement with regard to hypocrisy  From out of ignorance there proceeds torpor languor and absence of fear  From out of doubt there proceeds regret and anger from out of hatred there proceeds envy c The other upakleśas are the six kleśamalas cheating crookedness drunkenness of pride esteeming evil enmity and hostility b From out of lust there proceeds cheating and the drunkenness of pride from anger enmity and hostility  esteeming evil from out of the esteeming of views and crookedness from out of view  Disrespect absence of fear torpor languor and dissipation are abandoned through Seeing and Meditation  The other wrappings are solely abandoned through Meditation  And so too the malas being autonomous  In Kāmadhātu they are of two types the others are bad  Above the upakleśas are neutral  Cheating and crookedness exist in Kāmadhātu and in the First Dhyāna  Since Brahmā tried to deceive  Torpor dissipation and pridefulness exist in all three spheres The others in Kāmadhātu  Those that are abandoned through Seeing the Truths are of the spheres of the manovijñāna plus pride and languor  Plus the autonomous upakleśas  The others have the six consciousnesses for their support  Lust is associated with two agreeable sensations  Hatred with the contrary  Moha or avidyā with all  The view of negation with dissatisfaction and satisfaction sensation is a typo in Pruden  Doubt with dissatisfaction  The others with satisfaction  Those arisen in Kāmadhātu  All are associated with indifference  In the higher stages they are associated with their own sensations to be determined according to the stage  Regret envy anger hostility aversion and the esteeming of evil are associated with dissatisfaction  Avarice with the contrary  Crookedness cheating hypocrisy and languor are associated with one and the other  Pridefulness is associated with the two agreeable sensations  Indifference is everywhere  The four others with five  The hindrances exist in Kāmadhātu  Two make up a single hindrance because they have the same opposites the same nourishment and the same result  Only five by reason of the destruction of a skandha by reason of doubt  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Destruction by a knowledge of the object by the destruction of the kleśas of which they are the object and by the abandoning of the object  There is destruction through the arising of the opposition  Opposition is fourfold abandoning maintaining removal and disgust  The kleśa is supposed to become abandoned through separation from its object Separation through different nature through opposition through separation of place and through time as for example the primary elements the precepts places and the two time periods  Destruction all at once  The acquisition of disconnection from the kleśas takes place many times  There is arising of the opposition the acquisition of results and the perfection of the faculties  There are nine perfect knowledges  The destruction of the first two types of Kāma constitute one perfect knowledge  The destruction of the two types consists of two  In that same way above there are three perfect knowledges  There are three other perfect knowledges the destruction of the avarabhāgīya cankerous influences the cankerous influences of Rūpadhātu and of all the cankerous influences  Six are the result of the patiences see above p   The others the results of the knowledges  All are the result of anāgamya five or eight are the result of the dhyānas  One is the result of a sāmantaka  One is also the result of three maulārūpyas  All are the result of the ryan Path  Two of the wordly path  Two also through anvaya  Three through dharmajñāna e Five or six from one and the other groups  There is perfect knowledge by reason of the pure acquisition of disconnection the partial abandoning of Bhavāgra and the destruction of two causes  By the reason of the fact that one passes over a sphere  One who is to be found in the Path of Seeing of the Truths is either not endowed with perfect knowledge or is endowed with from one to five perfect knowledges  Abiding in Meditation with six with one or with two  One reduces the perfect knowledges to a single unit where there is detachment from one sphere and the acquisition of a result  One loses one two five or six perfect knowledges in this same way one obtains them but never five  It has been said that the defilements are abandoned through Seeing the Truths and through Meditation  The Path of Meditation is of two types the Path of Seeing is pure  The Four Truths have been mentioned  Namely suffering origin extinction and path  Their order is that in which they are understood Impure dharmas whether they are agreeable disagreeable or otherwise are without exception suffering by reason of the three types of suffering each according to its type The idea of a jug ends when the jug is broken the idea of water ends when in the mind one analyzes the water The jug and the water and all that resembles them exist relatively The rest exist absolutely  Firm in his cultivation endowed with teaching and reflection he will be capable of giving himself up to meditation  The wisdoms arisen from the teaching etc have respectively for their sphere name name and the thing and the thing  These are produced within one who is endowed with the two separations  Not for one discontented and with many desires  Discontent is desire for more than one now possesses many desires is desire with regard to that which one does not possess  Their opposites are their oppositions  They are of the three spheres or pure  Nondesire  The lineages of the ryans  Among them three are contentment  By three is taught the regimen by the last activity  In order to create an obstacle to the arising of desire  In order to momentarily or definitively arrest the desire of the object of the idea of self and of things pertaining to self  He enters therein through visualization on the loathsome and through mindfulness of breathing ānāpānasmṛta  Those in whom desire and imagination are predominant adhirāgavitarkāṇām  The skeleton for all the categories of craving  The beginner by enlarging the visualization of the bones up to the sea and by reducing it  The master by removing the toe etc until half of the skull  Holding his thought between his two eyebrows he is an absolute master in the act of attention  The loathsome is nondesire it is in ten spheres it has the visible of Kāmadhātu for its object it is generated by humans  Mindfulness of breathing ānāpānasmṛti is prajñā belonging to the five spheres having wind for its object and it is cultivated by beings in Kāmadhātu  Not to outsiders  It has six aspects counting etc  Inbreathing and outbreathing are like the body  It belongs to living beings  It is not taken up  It is an outflowing  It is not observed by an inferior mind  Having realized stilling he will cultivate the foundations of mindfulness smuṛtyupasthānas  By considering the twofold characteristics of the body sensation the mind and the dharmas  Prajñā  Proceeding from hearing etc  The others through connection and as object  The order is that of their production  Four oppositions to errors  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  Placed in the foundation of mindfulness having the dharmas as its universal object he sees that the dharmas are impermanent suffering empty and notself  From this there arises the Heat  Which has the Four Truths for its object  Which has sixteen aspects  From Heat the Summits  Which are similar to it  It is through dharma that these two imprint  They grow through the others also  From that Patience  Two are as above  Three grow totally through the dharmas  Strong it has the suffering of Kāmadhātu for its object  It is of a moment  So too the Supreme Dharmas  All include the five skandhas  With the exclusion of the possessions  This is the fourfold nirvedhabhāgīya  Arise from absorption  Their sphere is anāgāmya the intermediate state and the Dhyānas  Or rather two are also of the lower sphere  Belong to the beings of Kāmadhātu  Women obtain the Supreme Worldly Dharmas destined to be found in female and male bodies  The ryan loses them by losing the sphere  The nonryans through death  He also loses the first two through falling away  When they belong to the fundamental Dhyāna the Seeing of the Truths arises from this seeing  Lost they are acquired anew  The two losses are nonpossession  He who has attained the Summits does not cut off the roots  He who obtains the Patience does not go to the painful realms of rebirth  One can attain two nirvedhabhāgīyas of the rāvaka family and become a Buddha  One can attain three and become the other  The Master and the Rhinoceros go as far as Bodhi in one sitting by relying on the last Dhyāna  First the mokṣabhāgīyas  The most rapid obtains deliverance in three existences  Arise from hearing and reflection  The three actions  Projected among humans  From out of the Supreme Worldly Dharmas there proceeds one Patience a Patience having the dharmas for its object which is pure  Bearing on the suffering of Kāmadhātu  From this a Dharma Knowledge having the same object  In the same way relating to the rest of suffering one consecutive Patience and a Knowledge  In that same way relating to the three other Truths  In this way the comprehension of the Truths consists of sixteen mental states  It is threefold insight application and result  It is of the same sphere as the Supreme Worldly Dharmas  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The Patiences and Knowledges are in this order the Irresistible Path and the Path of Deliverance  Because they are produced within anyone who sees that which has not been seen fifteen moments are the Path of Seeing  In these moments the ascetics of weak and sharp faculties are respectively raddhānusārin and Dharmānusārin  If they have not abandoned the defilements to be abandoned through Meditation they are candidates for the first result  Up to the abandoning of the five categories  Candidates for the second until the abandoning of the ninth category  Candidates for the third through detachment either with respect to Kāmadhātu or with respect to higher sphere  In the sixteenth moment the ascetic becomes an abider in the state for which he was a candidate  At this moment the ascetics with weak and sharp faculties become respectively raddhādhimukta or Dṛṣṭiprāpta At the moment of the acquisition of a result the ascetic does not acquire the path of a higher result consequently the abider in a result does not exert himself with a view to a higher progress and he is not a candidate for a result  Each sphere has nine categories of vices  So too there are nine categories of qualities  By distinguishing weak etc in the categories of weak medium and strong  The abider in a result who has not destroyed that which one should abandon through meditation is a Saptakṛtparamaḥ  Delivered from three or four categories destined for two or three rebirths he is a Kulakula  Who has conquered up to five categories is a candidate for the second  Having destroyed the sixth category he is a Sakṛdāgāmin  Having destroyed seven or eight categories and destined for one rebirth is an Ekavīcika he is also a candidate for the third state  He is an Anāgāmin by the destruction of the ninth category  He is a saint who obtains Nirvāṇa in the interval by arising with effort without effort and by going higher  When he combines his Dhyāna he is an Akaniṣṭhaga  The Akaniṣṭhaga is either a Jumper a HalfJumper or One who Dies Everywhere  The other is a Bhavāgraga  Another who goes to rūpyadhātu is of four types  Another who obtains Nirvāṇa here  It is said that there are nine saints going to Rūpadhātu by making a threefold distinction among the three  Their differences are due to the difference of actions faculties and defilements  In not establishing any distinction among the rdhvasrotas there are seven realms of rebirth for the good  By reason of the cultivation of good and the noncultivation of evil and of the nonreturning from whence they have come  The ryan who obtains the state of Anāgāmin after having been reborn in Kāmadhātu does not go to another sphere  This ryan and one who is born in a higher sphere are incapable of modifying their faculties and are incapable of falling away  First combination of the Fourth Dhyāna  The combination is achieved through the combining of moments  With a view to arising to bliss and also through fear of the defilements  As it is fivefold there are five births or types of existence among the uddhāvāsas  The Anāgāmin who has acquired extinction is considered a Kāyasākṣin  Up to the moment when he destroys the eighth part of Bhavāgra he is a candidate for the quality of Arhat  Also in the ninth path of abandoning  This path is similar to a diamond d With the acquisition of the destruction of this category there is the knowledge of destruction  Then the saint is a Aśaikṣa an Arhat  Detachment from Bhavāgra is through the transworldly path  There is detachment from the other spheres in two ways  For the ryan who detaches himself through the worldly path his acquisitions of the disconnections are of two types  According to other masters he becomes detached through the transworldly path in the same way  For even when pure disconnection is lost the ryan is not filled with the defilements  But if he is not filled with these defilements he is like a saint half delivered from Bhavāgra like a person who is reborn above  One becomes detached from all the spheres by means of pure anāgamya  At the detachment from the Three Dhātus the last Path of Deliverance arises either from the Dhyāna or from a sāmantaka  Above it does not arise from a sāmantaka  Through the eight pure paths he triumphs over his sphere and over a higher sphere  The worldly paths paths of deliverance and paths of abandoning have respectively the aspects of calm etc coarse etc  They have for their objects the higher sphere and the lower sphere  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   When he is Immovable after his Knowledge of Destruction there is the consciousness of nonarising  In the contrary case there is either the Knowledge of Destruction or the seeing of the Aśaikṣas  These Views belong to all the Arhats  rāmaṇya is the immaculate path  His result is both conditioned and unconditioned  There are eightynine  The paths of deliverance with their destructions  But four results are established for five reasons which are encountered therein c In a result there is the abandoning of a previous path the acquisition of another path the addition of destructions the acquisition of a group of eight knowledges and the acquisition of sixteen aspects  The abandoning obtained by a worldly path is a result because it is combined and because it is supported by pure possession  Is brāhmaṇya it is brahmacakra  Because it is set into motion by a Brahmā  The Wheel of the Dharma is the Path of Seeing  Because it goes quickly etc because it has spokes etc  Three are acquired in Kāmadhātu  The last in the three Dhātus  Higher the Path of the Seeing of the Truths is absent  Disgust is absent there because the Sūtra says Here one undertakes and there one achieves  Six types of Arhat are known  Five arise from the raddhādhimuktas those liberated through faith  Their deliverance is occasional  For an Immovable One is it immovable  Thus he is not occasionally delivered  He proceeds from Dṛṣṭiprāpta  Some Arhats are of their present families from the very beginning some become part of their present families through purification or perfectioning  Four fall from their families and five fall from their states  But one does not fall away from the first family nor from the first state  The aikṣas and the nonryans are also of six families  In the Path of Seeing there is no perfecting  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   There are three types of falling away from that which is acquired from that which has not yet been acquired and from fruition  The last with respect to the Master the second also with respect to an Immovable One all three with respect to others  He does not die having fallen away from his result  He does not do what should not be done  For the Immovable One there are nine paths of two types  By reason of his intense cultivation  For the Dṛṣṭiprāpta one of each type  Pure paths  There is transformation among humans  The Aśaikṣas in nine spheres  The aikṣa in six  d Because the aikṣa who increases his faculties by abandoning his state and his progress obtains the state  Two Buddhas and seven rāvakas the Arhats have nine classes of faculties  Seven pudgalas by reason of their cultivation their faculties absorption deliverance of two  They are six  Two exist in each of the three paths  He who possesses extinction is doubly delivered the other is delivered through prajñā  It is from the point of view of absorption of faculties and of result that a aikṣa is said to be complete  The Aśaikṣa is complete from two points of view  In short the path is of four types Preparatory Irresistible Deliverance and Excellence  The path belonging to the Dhyānas is the easy route  The difficult routes belong to other spheres  When intelligence is weak a route for slow intelligence in the contrary case a route for a quick intelligence  The Knowledge of Destruction with the Knowledge of NonArising is Bodhi  Because they are favorable to it thirtyseven dharmas are its adjutants  Thirtyseven from the point of view of name but ten substantial entities  Faith energy mindfulness prajña absorption joy indifference resolution morality and aptitude  d Foundation of mindfulness is prajñā energy receives the name of right exertion the supernormal powers are samādhis  A definition according to their essentials they are also all the qualities that arise from cultivation They form seven groups which are distributed in order between the beginning stage the nirvedhabhāgīyas Meditation and Seeing  The parts of Bodhi and the parts of the Path are pure  The others are of two types  All exist in the First Dhyāna  In anāgamya with the exception of joy  In the Second with the exception of thoughts  In two with the exception of the one and the other  Also in dhyānāntara  In three rūpyas with the exception of the preceding and the parts of morality  In Kāmadhātu and in Bhavāgra the parts of Bodhi and the parts of the Path are absent  cWhen one sees three Truths one obtains the morality and the avetyaprasāda relating to the Dharma when one comprehends the Path also the avetyaprasāda relating to the Buddha and his Sagha c The Dharma is the three Truths and the Path of the Pratyekabuddha and the Bodhisattva  From the point of view of substantial entities these four are two things faith and morality  Immaculate  Because he is bound deliverance is not said to be a part of a aikṣa  Deliverance is twofold  Victory over the defilements is unconditioned deliverance adhimokṣa is conditioned deliverance  This last is a part  It is two deliverances  Bodhi as described above is knowledge  The Aśaikṣa mind arising is delivered from its obstacles  It is while perishing that the Path causes the abandoning of the obstacle  Unconditioned deliverance receives the name of dhātu  The destruction of craving is detachment  The destruction of the others is abandoning  The destruction of the object is called nirodhadhātu the sphere of extinction  Disgust arises by means of the Patiences and the Knowledges of Suffering and Origin  Detachment arises through all the dharmas by means of which there is abandoning  There are therefore four alternatives  The pure Patiences are not a type of Knowledge  The prajñā of destruction and of nonarising is not seeing  All other pure prajñā is both one and the other  All other prajñā is knowledge e Six are also seeing  Knowledge is pure or impure  The first is called conventional  Pure knowledge is of two types a knowledge of dharmas and inferential knowledge  Conventional knowledge bears on all  The knowledge of dharmas has for its object the Suffering etc of Kāmadhātu  Inferential knowledge bears on Suffering etc of the higher spheres  When one takes into consideration the distinction of the Truths these two knowledges make up four knowledges  The two knowledges fourfold are termed the knowledge of Destruction and the Knowledge of NonArising d At the moment when they arise they are inferential knowledges of Suffering and Origin  The knowledge of the mind of another follows from four  It does not know a mind in a higher sphere faculties personalities nor the past and future  The knowledge of dharmas and inferential knowledges do not know one another  The rāvaka knows two moments of Seeing the Pratyekabuddha three the Buddha without preparation all  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  The knowledge of destruction is with respect to the Truths the certitude that they are known abandoned etc the knowledge of nonarising is the certitude that they are no longer to be known to be abandoned etc The knowledges are ten in number the distinction is established by reason of their nature their opposition their aspect their aspect and their object their preparatory exercises the achievement of their task and the extension of their cause  The knowledge of dharmas in the Pathway of Meditation when it bears on Extinction and the Path is opposed to the three spheres  Inferential knowledge is not opposed to Kāmadhātu  A knowledge of dharmas and inferential knowledge have sixteen aspects  Conventional knowledge is the same and otherwise  Four because of the aspect of their Truth  So too when it is pure the knowledge of the mind of another  When it is impure it has for its aspects the unique characteristics of its object  It has for its sphere an individual object  The other has fourteen aspects by excluding the aspect of emptiness and the aspect of nonself  There are no pure aspects outside of the sixteen  Some others according to the āstra affirm that there are  The aspects are sixteen things  The aspects are prajñā  Everything that has an object perceives  Everything that exists is the object of perception  The first is of three natures the others are good  The first exists in all spheres  In six the knowledge named dharma  In nine that which is called anvaya inferential  So too six jñānas  The knowledge of the mind of another exists in the Four Dhyānas  It has for its support a person either in Kāmadhātu or Rūpadhātu  The knowledge of dharmas a person in Kāmadhātu  Others in persons of the three spheres  The knowledge of Extinction is an application of mindfulness  The knowledge of the mind of another is threefold  The others four  Nine knowledges are the object of a knowledge of dharmas  Nine are the object of inferential knowledge and knowledge of the Path  Two are the object of the knowledge of Suffering and Origin  Ten of four  None are the object of one  The totality of their object is ten dharmas  Dharmas of the Three Dhātus pure dharmas unconditioned each category being twofold  One conventional knowledge with the exception of its own complex knows the rest as nonself  Not detached in the first pure moment he possesses one knowledge  In the second moment he possesses three knowledges  Beyond in four moments each time adding a knowledge  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   In Seeing future patiences and knowledges exist to the extent to which they are produced  In the Path of Seeing one also acquires conventional knowledge at the moment of the three inferential knowledges  This conventional knowledge is termed the end of abhisamaya  It is not destined to arise  From the sphere or from a lower sphere  In Extinction the last  It has the aspects of its Truth  It proceeds from effort  In the sixteenth six through nondetachment  Through detachment seven  Above in the Path of Meditation associated with sensual desire there is the cultivation of seven  In the uninterrupted paths of the victory over seven spheres of the acquisition of the supernormal knowledges and of the quality of Immovability of mixed meditation And also in the eight paths of higher deliverance  The aikṣa in the path of deliverance of the perfectioning of the faculties cultivates six or seven knowledges  In the uninterrupted path he cultivates six knowledges  The same in the victory over Bhavāgra  At the moment of the knowledge of destruction nine knowledges  An Immovable One cultivates ten knowledges  Ten knowledges also in the last deliverance in the passage to the state of Immovability  In the cases not mentioned there is cultivation of eight knowledges  The knowledge that one cultivates in the future belongs to the sphere from which one is detached to the sphere acquired or to a lower sphere  In the knowledge of destruction the pure is also of all spheres  That which has been obtained previously is not cultivated Cultivation of good conditioned dharmas is acquisition and practice there is cultivation of opposition and expulsion with respect to impure dharmas  The dharmas unique to the Buddha are eighteen the powers etc cThere are ten knowledges in sthānāsthāna  Eight in karmaphala  Nine in the Dhyānas etc in the Indriyas in the Abhimokṣas in the Dhātus  Nine or ten in the paths  Two are conventional knowledges  Destruction is made up of six or ten knowledges  The power of former abodes and the power of deathrebirth lie in the Dhyānas the others in all the spheres  Why Because its power does not know any obstacle  Nārāyaṇa power in his body  According to others in his parts  This is a power the seventh term of a series which begins with the elephant and in which each term is worth ten times the preceding  It consists of a tangible  Assurance if fourfold  Resembling the first the tenth the second and the seventh power  Three are mindfulness and awareness prajñā  Great compassion is a conventional and mental state  It is through its factors its aspects its object its equality and its excellence  It differs from ordinary compassion in eight ways In sabhāra dharmakāya and their service to beings the Buddhas are identical not in their duration of life their caste their statures etc  There are other qualities which the Buddhas have in common with aikṣas  And Pṛthagjanas  Absence of Contention Knowledge Resulting from Resolution the Unhindered Knowledges the Supernormal Knowledges etc  Absence of Contention is conventional knowledge  It is of the sphere of the Fourth Dhyāna  It is produced by a person who is Immovable  It is produced by humans e It relates to the defilements of Kāmadhātu is future and has a real object  So too the Knowledge Resulting from Resolution  But it has all for its object  So too the Unhindered Knowledges of dharmas of objects of etymological explanations and of eloquence  The first three are unhindered knowledges bearing in this order on name the thing speech  The fourth is the knowledge of the exact and facile expression and of mastery with respect to the Path  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Its object is speech and the Path  It is made up of nine knowledges  It is of all the spheres  Unhindered Knowledge of things artha is made up of ten or six  It arises everywhere  The others are conventional knowledge  The Unhindered Knowledge of dharmas exists in Kāmadhātu and the Dhyānas  The Unhindered Knowledge of speech exists in Kāmadhātu and the First Dhyāna  One only obtains them together  The six are prāntakoṭika  It is sixfold  It is the last dhyāna in a series with all the spheres and carried to its maximum  With the exception of the Buddha acquired through effort  Realization of the knowledge of supernormal power of ear of the mind of past existences of death and rebirth of the destruction of the cankers this is the sixfold supernormal knowledge  They are the prajñā of deliverance  Four are conventional knowledge  The knowledge of the mind of another is made up of five knowledges  The supernormal knowledge of the destruction of the cankers is similar to the power  Five exist in the Four Dhyānas  They have their own sphere or a lower sphere for their domain  Already cultivated they are acquired through detachment  The third is made up of three applications of mindfulness  Supernormal power hearing and sight make up the first application of mindfulness  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   The Supernormal Knowledges of hearing and sight are neutral the others are good  Three supernormal knowledges are wisdom  Because they bring about the cessation of nonwisdom ignorance relating to the past etc  The last belongs to the Aśaikṣas  The two others are said to belong to the Aśaikṣas when they arise in the series of an Aśaikṣa  We admit that they exist in the aikṣa but then they are not called wisdoms because the series of the aikṣa is associated with nonwisdom  The first the third and the sixth are the methods of conversion  Conversion through the Teaching is the best  Because it does not exist without supernormal knowledge and because it confers the fruits of salvation and of wellbeing  ddhi is absorption  From it there arises displacement and fictive creation  Rapid displacement like the mind is unique to the Master  The others possess displacement of transport and of adhimokṣa  Fictive creation in Kāmadhātu is made up of four external āyatanas  It is of two types  Fictive creation of the sphere of Rūpadhātu is made up of two āyatanas  It is through a mind capable of creating fictive beings nirmāṇacitta that one creates They are fourteen in number  They are the results of the Dhyānas from the number of two up to five in this order  They do not arise from a lower Dhyāna  One obtains them like a Dhyāna  A mind capable of creating fictive beings proceeds from a pure Dhyāna and from itself  It produces the two  One creation takes place through one mind of its sphere  But speech also takes place through a mind of a lower sphere  With the creator except in the case of the Master  The fictive being speaks because its creator sets speech into motion through another mind after having empowered the fictive being  Empowerment continues after death  But not with respect to that which is not hard  Some other masters say no  From the beginning the ascetic creates a single creation through numerous minds capable of creating fictive beings the contrary when his practice is purified  Produced through meditation it is neutral  Innate it is threefold  ddhi is also produced through mantras plants and actions in all five types  Divine sight and divine hearing are of pure rūpa of the sphere of the Dhyānas  They are always active nondeficient they bear on the distant the subtle etc  The Arhat the Rhinoceros and the Master see a Dvisāhasra a Trisāhasra infinite universes  The others are also innate  Divine sight when it is innate does not see intermediary beings  This knowledge of the mind of another is of three types  Also when it is produced through reflection tarka or through formulas vidyā  The beings in hell know from the very beginning  Among humans not innate  The Dhyānas are twofold  The Dhyānas are four in number  The Dhyānas as existence have been defined  Concentration is the application of a pure mind on a single object e With their concomitants they are the five skandhas  The First is filled with vicāra prīti and sukha  Parts that the following Dhyānas successively abandon  So too the rūpyas  They are made up of four skandhas e It arises out of separation from lower spheres  They are called vibhūtarūpasajñā together with three sāmantakas  There is no rūpa in the rūpyas  Physical matter arises from the mind citta  kāśānantya Vijñānānantya and kicanya are named after their preparatory exercises  Because of its weakness the next absorption is called NeitherIdeasNorAbsence of Ideas nasajñānāpyasajñāka  There are then eight things that are basic absorptions  The first seven are threefold  Enjoyment pure and free from the defilements  The eighth is twofold  The absorption of enjoyment is associated with thirst  A pure absorption is of a worldly order of good  It is the object of enjoyment  The absorption free from the defilements is transworldly  There are five parts in the First  Vitarka vicāra joy prīti happiness sukha and samādhi  Four in the Second faith and joy etc  Five in the Third equanimity mindfulness awareness saprajñāna happiness and stability samādhi  And four in the last mindfulness equanimity the sensation of neither suffering nor happiness aduḥkhāsukha and samādhi  Regarded as things there are eleven parts  In the first two Dhyānas happiness sukha signifies wellbeing prasrabdhi  Purity is faith  Joy is satisfaction This is proved by two texts  In the defiled Dhyānas there is no joy happiness faith sampradhīḥ awareness saprajanya mindfulness pure equanimity nor pure mindfulness  According to some there is no wellbeing and equanimity  As it is free from the eight faults the Fourth is undisturbed  Vitarka and vicāra the two breaths and the four of which happiness is the first In the dhyāna existences there is satisfaction happiness and equanimity equanimity and sumanaskatā saumanasya satisfaction happiness and equanimity and equanimity  In the Second Dhyāna and above the body eye and ear consciousness and the consciousness that sets the act of informing into motion belong to the sphere of the First Dhyāna  These consciousnesses are undefiledneutral  One who does not possess them acquires them pure through detachment or through birth  One acquires them undefiled through detachment  One acquires them defiled through falling and through birth  After the undefiled up to the third sphere above or below there arises the good  The same after the pure by adding the defiled of its sphere  After the defiled the pure and the defiled of its sphere  And the pure of a lower sphere  At death after the pure the defiled of any types can arise  After the defiled nothing higher  The pure absorption is of four types of falling etc  In order they are suitable to the arising of the defilements to its own sphere to a higher sphere to the undefiled  After the absorption of falling etc two three three one c Going and coming in two ways over the eight spheres in immediate succession by passing over one sphere going to the third sphere of a different type is called transitional absorption  The dhyāna and ārūpya absorptions have for their support āśraya beings of their own spheres or of a lower sphere  A lower absorption has no usefulness  But in Bhavāgra it is by entering the ryan absorption of kicanya that one destroys the defilements  Associated with thirst absorption has its own existence bhava for its object  Pure absorption has all that exists for its object  The pure rūpya absorptions of the principal spheres do not have lower defiled absorptions for their object  The defilements are abandoned through the undefiled absorptions  And also by means of the sāmantakas likewise pure  There are eight sāmantakas in the basic absorptions  They are pure they possess the sensation of equanimity  The first is also ryan  Some say that it is threefold  Dhyānāntara is without vitarka  To three  It has the sensation of equanimity  It has Mahābrahmā for its result de Up to it samādhi exists with vitarka and vicāra e Beyond samādhi exists without either  The absence of characteristics has the aspect of the Tranquil  Emptiness has the aspects of emptiness and nonself  The absence of intention is associated with the other Truths  Pure or immaculate amala  Immaculate they are the three gates to deliverance vimokṣamukha  There are also three other absorptions samādhi called emptiness of emptiness etc  The first two refer to the Aśaikṣa under the aspects of emptiness and impermanence  The absence of characteristics in the absence of characteristics has for its object extinction kṣayam not attained through conscious effort and considers it as tranquil śānta  Defiled lit possessing the defilements sāsrava  Among humans  Among the Unshakeable Ones  With the exception of the seven sāmantakas  The First good Dhyāna is the cultivation of the absorption that has for its result happiness  The supernormal knowledge abhijñā of the eye has sight for its result  The cultivation of good arisen from exercise has comprehension for its result  The absorption likened to a Vajra Vajropamasamadhi of the Fourth Dhyāna has the extinction of the defilements for its result  The Immeasurables apramāṇas are four in number  Because they oppose illwill etc  Goodwill is the absence of hatred  So too compassion e Joy is satisfaction  Equanimity is the absence of desire  Their aspects are happiness unhappiness joy and beings  They have the living beings of Kāmadhātu for their sphere  Abhidharmakosa Chapter   Joy in two Dhyānas  The others in six spheres  Or according to some in five  There is no abandoning through the Immeasurables e One produces them among humans f He necessarily possesses three  The Deliverances are eight in number  The first two are meditations on loathsome things  They are in two Dhyānas  The Third in the last Dhyāna  It is the absence of desire  They are good rūpyas and absorptions  The absorption of extinction nirodhasamāpatti  Immediately after a subtlesubtle mind  Going out into a pure mind of the sphere of the same absorption or into a lower ryan mind  The first ones have for their object the visible things of Kāmadhātu  As for those that are nonmaterial all that which belongs to the Knowledge the Suffering of their sphere and of a higher sphere etc  The Dominant yatanas abhibhvāyatanas are eight in number  Two are like the First Deliverance  The following two are like the Second  And the last four are like the Third Deliverance  There are ten AllEncompassing yatanas kṛtsnāyatanas  Eight are the absence of desire  They belong to the last Dhyāna  They have Kāmadhātu for their object e Two are pure ārūpya f They have the four skandhas of their sphere for their object  Extinction has been explained  The others are obtained either through detachment or through cultivation  The qualities of rūpyadhātu are obtained by beings of the Three Dhātus the others only by humans  In two spheres it is through the power of cause and of action karma that one produces the absorption of rūpyadhātu  In Rūpadhātu it is through these two powers and also be reason of the nature of things that one produces the dhyānas  The nature of the Good Law of the Master is twofold āgama and adhigama  Those who preach it and who cultivate it support it  Abhidharmakosa Chapter  The Abhidharma that is established through the interpretation of the Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmīr is in its totality what I have explained That some ideas poorly grasped are reproduced here is our fault for only the Munis are authoritative pramāṇa in the interpretation of the Good Law The Master the eye of the world is closed the witnesses for the most part have perished the Law is put into confusion by persons who have not seen the Truth and by bad sophists independent from whom nothing is gained For he who knows for himself has departed on the Supreme Path as well as the supports of the Law of the one who knows for himself the world no longer has a Protector The defilements which destroy spiritual qualities now have full liberty Seeing that the Law of the Muni is in its last breath and that it is the hour of the forces of the defilements those who desire liberation should be diligent PP Seeing then by a path of demonstrative arguments that the doctrine of the teaching of the Buddhas is perfect and rejecting the opinion of those blind through bad views and through bad steps the nonblind see PP In fact this doctrine of the nonexistence of the soul is the only road to the city of Nirvana although illumined by the rays which are the words of this sun which is the Tathagata although followed by thousands of saints and although it is without obstacles it is not seen by persons of weak insight PP In this book one will find but a summary indication for the use of intelligent persons but poison of belief in soul once within a wound will spread itself everywhere by its own force Related Discourses   Not Knowing  Thus I have I heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks When you dont know or understanding form and dont stop or become free of desire for it the mind isnt liberated and it isnt possible to transcend the fear of birth old age illness and death Thus when you dont know or understanding feeling  perception  volition  consciousness and dont stop or become free of desire for it the mind isnt liberated and it isnt possible to transcend the fear of birth old age illness and death Monks if you know and understand form and stop and become free of desire for it the mind is liberated and its possible to transcend the fear of birth old age illness and death Thus if you know and understand feeling  perception  volition  consciousness and stop and become free of desire for it the mind is liberated and its possible to transcend the fear of birth old age illness and death When the monks who heard what the Buddha taught they rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Thus I have heard  One time the Buddha was staying at ṣipatana in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed five monks This is the noble truth of suffering Its a teaching never heard before that should be correctly considered It then gives rise to vision knowledge insight and awakening This is the noble truth of sufferings accumulation  sufferings cessation  the path to sufferings cessation Its a teaching never heard before that should be correctly considered It then gives rise to vision knowledge insight and awakening Furthermore knowledge of this noble truth of suffering should again be known This is a teaching never heard before that should be correctly considered It then gives rise to vision knowledge insight and awakening After knowing this noble truth of sufferings accumulation that accumulation should be stopped This is a teaching never heard before that should be correctly considered It then gives rise to vision knowledge insight and awakening Furthermore after knowing this noble truth of sufferings cessation that cessation should be realized This is a teaching never heard before that should be correctly considered It then gives rise to vision knowledge insight and awakening Furthermore after knowing this noble truth of the path to sufferings cessation that path should be cultivated This is a teaching never heard before that should be correctly considered It then gives rise to vision knowledge insight and awakening Furthermore monks after knowing this noble truth of suffering knowledge of that suffering is produced This is a teaching never heard before that should be correctly considered It then gives rise to vision knowledge insight and awakening Furthermore after knowing this noble truth of sufferings accumulation termination of that accumulation is produced This is a teaching never heard before that should be correctly considered It then gives rise to vision knowledge insight and awakening Furthermore after knowing this noble truth of sufferings cessation realization of that cessation is produced This is a teaching never heard before that should be correctly considered It then gives rise to vision knowledge insight and awakening Furthermore after knowing this noble truth of the path to sufferings cessation cultivation of that path is produced This is a teaching not heard before that should be correctly considered It then gives rise to vision knowledge insight and awakening Monks when vision knowledge insight and awakening hadnt arisen from the three turnings in  steps of these four noble truths I couldnt have ever attained liberation escape and separation while among the teachings heard from gods Māra Brahmā ascetics or priests Nor would I have realized for myself the unsurpassed correct and complete enlightenment Once vision knowledge insight and awakening had arisen from the three turnings in  steps of these four noble truths then I attained escape and liberation while among the teachings heard from gods Māra Brahmā ascetics and priests I realized for myself the unsurpassed correct and complete enlightenment When the Bhagavān explained this teaching Venerable Kauṇḍinya and  gods became dustless and spotless and attained purification of the Dharma eye The Bhagavān then addressed Venerable Kauṇḍinya Have you know the teaching yet Kauṇḍinya said to the Buddha Ive known it Bhagavān Again he asked Venerable Kauṇḍinya Have you know the teaching yet Kauṇḍinya said to the Buddha Ive known it Sugata Having known the teaching Venerable Kauṇḍinya was therefore called Ajñāta Kauṇḍinya After Venerable Ajñāta Kauṇḍinya knew the teaching the earth spirit raised its voice and called out Gentlemen The Bhagavān has turned the Dharma wheel three times in  steps while staying at ṣipatana in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī Never has it been turned by ascetics priests gods Māra or Brahmā Its for the benefit of many for the welfare of many and with compassion for the world Because its for the benefit and welfare of gods and humans it will increase the host of gods and diminish the host of asuras After the earth spirit called this out it was heard by the sky spirits and gods in the Cāturmahārāja Heaven Trāyastriṃśa Heaven Yama Heaven Tuṣita Heaven Nirmāṇarati Heaven and Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven In a moments time they each in turn conveyed the call until it was heard in the Brahmakāyika Heaven In the Brahma Heavens they conveyed the call saying Gentlemen The Bhagavān has turned the Dharma wheel three times in  steps while staying at ṣipatana in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī Never has it been turned by ascetics priests gods Māra or Brahmā nor by the teachings heard in the world Its for the benefit of many and for the welfare of many Because its for the benefit of gods and humans it will increase the host of gods and diminish the host of asuras At ṣipatana in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī the Bhagavān turned the Dharma wheel therefore this sūtra is called Turning the Dharma Wheel After the Buddha taught this sūtra the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Correctly Contemplated Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks You must correctly contemplate form observing that form is impermanent and truly know it Why is that Monks when form is correctly contemplated observed to be impermanent and truly known that stops desire and greed for form When desire and greed for form are stopped thats said to be the minds liberation Thus you should correctly contemplate feeling  perception  volition  consciousness observe that consciousness is impermanent and truly know it Why is that When consciousness is correctly contemplated observed to be impermanent and truly known that stops desire and greed for consciousness When desire and greed for it are stopped thats said to be the minds liberation Thus someone wanting to realize the minds liberation for themselves can then realize it My births have been ended the religious practice has been established and the task has been accomplished I myself know that I wont be subject to a later existence When the monks heard what the Buddha taught they rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Thus have I heard One time the Buddha stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks What is it that exists that arises that ties thats an attachment and thats viewed as self and causes sentient beings to create such views and such statements Knowing and seeing in sentient beings has no cause and no condition The monks then said to the Buddha The Bhagavān is the Dharma root the Dharma eye and the Dharma refuge  Its thus explained in detail and in the sequence of the three sutras  above Related Discourses   Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks He bowed his head at his feet withdrew to one side and said to the Buddha The Bhagavān says factors of awakening Bhagavān what are the factors of awakening The Buddha told the monk The expression factors of awakening refers to seven factors of the path but monks gradually produce these seven factors of awakening by cultivating their fulfillment That monk said to the Buddha Bhagavān how are these factors of awakening gradually produced by cultivating their fulfillment The Buddha told the monk Suppose a monk mindfully abides observing the internal body as body When he mindfully abides observing the internal body as body he collects his mind ties it to mindfulness and doesnt forget it At that point he skillfully cultivates the awakening factor of mindfulness After skillfully cultivating the awakening factor of mindfulness he cultivates its fulfillment After fulfilling the awakening factor of mindfulness he discriminates qualities and discerns and deliberates on them At that point he cultivates skill in the awakening factor of discriminating qualities After cultivating it skillfully hell cultivate its fulfillment Its thus up to hell cultivate the fulfillment of the awakening factor of equanimity As he mindfully abides contemplating the inner body as body he thus mindfully abides observing the external body  internal and external body  feelings  mind  and principles as principles At that point he focuses his mind ties it to mindfulness and doesnt forget it Up to the awakening factor of equanimity is also thus explained Someone who thus abides will gradually produce the factors of awakening After gradually producing them he cultivates their fulfillment After the Buddha taught this sutra the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and handed it down Related Discourses   Thus have I heard One time the Buddha stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks What is it that exists that arises that ties thats an attachment and thats viewed as self and causes sentient beings to create such views and such statements Seven bodies are not made not made by a maker not created and not created by a creator They are not killed not disturbed and substantial What are the seven They are the body of earth body of water body of fire body of wind pleasure pain and life These seven kinds of body are not made not made by a maker not created and not created by a creator They are not killed not disturbed and substantial They dont evolve dont change and dont constrain each other Whether good evil or good and evil whether painful pleasant or painful and pleasant or whether a man who beheads or the other mans head these things dont constrain the world Whether its his life or body the blade passes between the seven bodies and returns but it doesnt harm his life Nothing is killed by that and theres no killer Nothing is bound and theres no binder Nothing is thought and theres no thinker Nothing is taught and theres no teacher The monks said to the Buddha The Bhagavān is the Dharma root the Dharma eye and the Dharma refuge  Its thus explained in detail and in the sequence of the three sutras  above Related Discourses   Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī Like  above except for this Suppose a monk cultivates the seven factors of awakening After often cultivating them hell attain seven kinds of fruit and seven kinds of benefit What are the seven This monk will attain knowledge in the present life and realize happiness If he hasnt attained knowledge in the present life and realized happiness when his life ends hell attain the end of the five lower bonds when it ends and then hell attain parinirvāṇa in the interim If he doesnt attain parinirvāṇa in the interim then hell attain parinirvāṇa at birth If he doesnt attain parinirvāṇa at birth then hell attain parinirvāṇa without practice If he doesnt attain parinirvāṇa without practice then hell attain parinirvāṇa with practice If he doesnt attain parinirvāṇa with practice then hell attain parinirvāṇa upstream After the Buddha taught this sutra that certain monk who heard what he taught rejoiced and handed it down Medium Discourses  The Good Teaching Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to the country of rāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks If a monk accomplishes seven things then hell attain the

is called a monk who knows the superiority of people Thus did the Buddha speak Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Medium Discourses  The Pārijāta Tree  Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to the country of rāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks When the leaves of the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree wither and yellow the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice for it wont be long before the pārijāta trees leaves will fall Furthermore once the leaves of the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree have fallen the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice for it wont be long before the pārijāta trees leaves will grow back Furthermore once the leaves of the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree have grown back the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice for it wont be long before the pārijāta tree will grow a web of buds Furthermore once the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree has grown a web the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice for it wont be long before the pārijāta trees buds will grow like bird beaks Furthermore once the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree has grown buds like bird beaks the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice for it wont be long before the pārijāta trees buds will open like bowls Furthermore once the buds of the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree have opened like bowls the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice for it wont be long before the pārijāta tree will be in full bloom When the pārijāta tree is in full bloom the light that it shines the color that it reflects and the fragrance that it produces have a range of a hundred leagues During the fourth month of summer the Trāyastriṃśa gods entertain themselves with the five heavenly pleasures and the virtues with which theyre endowed This is called the festival under the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree Such is the meaning of the noble disciple too When he considers leaving home the disciple is called leaves yellowing Hes like the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree when its leaves wither and yellow Furthermore when he shaves off their hair puts on the reddishbrown robes attains faith leaves home goes homeless and trains on the path the noble disciple is called dropping leaves Hes like the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree dropping its leaves Furthermore the noble disciple parts with desire and bad and unskillful things With perception and contemplation this seclusion produces joy and happiness and he attains accomplishment of the first dhyāna The noble disciple then is called growing back leaves Hes like the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree growing back its leaves Furthermore once perception and contemplation have stopped the noble disciple has an inner stillness and unified mind Without perception or contemplation this concentration produces joy and happiness and he attains accomplishment of the second dhyāna The noble disciple then is called growing webs of buds Hes like the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree growing webs of buds Furthermore the noble disciple parts with joy and desire and he arrives at equanimity and pursues nothing With right mindfulness and right knowledge he personally experiences the happiness which is described by nobles as noble equanimity mindfulness happy abiding and emptiness and he attains accomplishment of the third dhyāna The noble disciple then is called growing buds like bird beaks Hes like the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree growing buds like bird beaks Furthermore the noble disciples pleasure ceases and his pain ceases The basis of joy and sorrow having ceased hes neither discomforted nor delighted Equanimous mindful and pure he attains accomplishment of the fourth dhyāna The noble disciple then is called growing like a bowl Hes like the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree buds growing like bowls Furthermore once the noble disciples contaminants have ended his mind is liberated and his wisdom is liberated In the present life he knows and recognizes for himself the accomplishment of this realization Birth has been ended the religious practice has been established the task has been accomplished and I truly know that Im no longer subject to existence The noble disciple then is called in full bloom Theyre like the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree in full bloom He becomes an arhat monk whose contaminants are ended The Trāyastriṃśa gods assemble in the Sudharmā Meeting Hall sigh admiringly and praise him Some worthy disciple at some town shaved off his hair put on the reddishbrown robes became faithful left home went homeless and trained on the path Once his contaminants had ended his mind was liberated and his wisdom was liberated In the present life he knows and recognizes for himself the accomplishment of this realization Birth has been ended the religious practice has been established the task has been accomplished and I know as it really is that Im no longer subject to existence This is called the assembly that coincides with the end of an arhats contaminants which is like the festival held under the Trāyastriṃśa Heavens pārijāta tree Thus did the Buddha speak Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Past Is Impermanent Painful Empty and Not Self Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Past and future form is  impermanent   painful   empty   not self so why wouldnt present form Noble disciples thus observe them They dont look back to past form dont wish for future form and become free of desire for present form Theyre correctly headed toward complete cessation Thus past and future feeling  perception  volition  consciousness is  impermanent   painful   empty   not self so why wouldnt present consciousness Noble disciples thus observe them They dont look back to past consciousness dont wishing for future consciousness and become free of desire for present consciousness Theyre correctly headed toward complete cessation When the monks heard what the Buddha taught they rejoiced and approved  Related Discourses   Not Self Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Form is not the self If form were the self it wouldnt be that illness and pain arise from form and there wouldnt be the desire about form Let it be so let it not be so Its because form is without self that theres illness and pain that arise from it and these desires are possible Let it be so let it not be so Feeling perception volition and consciousness are likewise Monks what do you think Is form permanent or is it impermanent The monks said to the Buddha Impermanent Bhagavān Monks if something is impermanent is it painful The monks said to the Buddha Its painful Bhagavān If its impermanent and painful its liable to change Would wellversed noble disciples see this as a self whats other than self or either of them present in the other The monks said to the Buddha No Bhagavān Feeling perception volition and consciousness are likewise Therefore monks whatever forms exist whether past future or present internal or external crude or fine beautiful or ugly and distant or near they are all not self not other than self nor are either of them present in the other Observe them in this way Feeling perception volition and consciousness are likewise Monks wellversed noble disciples truly observe that whats in these five acquired aggregates is not self and doesnt belong to self After truly observing this they grasp nothing from all the world Because they grasp nothing they attach to nothing Because they attach to nothing they realize nirvāṇa for themselves My births have been ended the religious practice has been established and the task has been accomplished I myself know that I wont be subject to a later existence After the Buddha spoke this sūtra the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Medium Discourses  The Kālāmas Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to the country of Kālāma accompanied by a great assembly of monks He went to Kesaputta and stayed in the rosewood grove to the north It was then that the Kālāma people of Kesaputta heard that the ascetic Gautama from the ākya clan had renounced the ākya dynasty left home and trained on the path He had traveled to Kālāma and arrived at Kesaputta with a great assembly of monks and was staying in the rosewood grove to the north That ascetic Gautama had a great reputation that was widely heard in ten directions The ascetic Gautama is the Tathāgata Arhat and Completely Awakened One whos accomplished in knowledge and conduct well gone an understander of the world an unsurpassed man a trainer in the principles of the path a teacher to gods and humans and whos called the Buddha the Blessed One Among the gods Māra Brahmā ascetics and priests of this world from humans up to the gods his own knowledge and awakening was accomplished by selfrealization When he teaches the Dharma its good in the beginning middle and end both its meaning and words are complete and pure and it demonstrates the religious practice If someone meets the Tathāgata Arhat and Completely Awakened One and honors venerates makes offerings and serves him they will quickly attain good benefits We should go together to see the ascetic Gautama to honor serve and make offerings to him After the Kālāma people of Kesaputta heard this they each left Kesaputta with their followers and went north to the rosewood grove They wanted to meet the Bhagavān and venerate serve and make offerings to him When they arrived some of those Kālāma people bowed their heads at the Buddhas feet and withdrew to sit at one side Some of them exchanged greetings with the Buddha and withdrew to sit at one side Some saluted the Buddha with their palms together and withdrew to sit at one side Some looked at the Buddha from a distance and quietly sat down After they each had sat down the Kālāma people concentrated as the Buddha taught the Dharma He encouraged roused and made them rejoice teaching the Dharma for them with measureless methods After he encouraged roused and made them rejoice he waited silently After the Buddha taught Dharma for them and had encouraged roused and made them rejoice each of the Kālāma people rose from their seat adjusted their robes to bare one shoulder and saluted the Buddha with their palms together They then said to the Bhagavān Gautama there was an ascetic or priest who came to Kālāma He simply praised his own knowledge and views and disparaged the knowledge and views of others Gautama there was another ascetic or priest who came to Kālāma and he too praised his own knowledge and views and disparaged the knowledge and views of others Gautama after listening to them we had this doubt Which of these ascetics or priests is genuine and which of them is false The Bhagavān told them Kālāmas dont have these doubts Why is that As a result of having doubts youll become hesitant Kālāmas they comes from your own lack of pure knowledge Is there an afterlife or no afterlife Kālāmas you also lack pure knowledge about which actions are blameworthy and which are blameless Kālāmas you should know that there are three actions that have caused past existences What are the three Kālāmas actions of greed have caused past existences Kālāmas actions of anger and delusion have caused past existences Kālāmas greed means to be hindered by greed When the mind lacks satisfaction sometimes a person kills beings takes whats not given commits sexual misconduct knowingly lies and drinks alcohol Kālāmas anger means to be hindered by anger When the mind lacks satisfaction sometimes a person kills beings takes whats not given commits sexual misconduct knowingly lies and drinks alcohol Kālāmas delusion means to be hindered by delusion When the mind lacks satisfaction sometimes a person kills beings takes whats not given commits sexual misconduct knowingly lies and drinks alcohol Kālāmas the wellversed noble disciple parts with killing stops killing and discards the knife and bludgeon With

wellversed noble disciple parts with taking whats not given stops taking whats not given and takes after something is given They are happy with taking what is given and always like generosity

and they rejoice for those who are united They dont act partisan dont enjoy partisanship and dont commend partisanship They purify their mind and rid it of duplicity Kālāmas the wellversed noble disciple parts with coarse speech and stops coarse speech If something said is in expression or feeling coarse and mean bad sounding and disagreeable to the ear that displeases many and isnt loved by many that causes others to suffer or that makes concentration impossible they stop such words If some expression is clear peaceful and flexible that agrees with the ear and enters the mind thats pleasing and lovely that causes the wellbeing of others that uses words and sounds that are completely understandable that dont cause people to be frightened and that allow others to concentrate then they speak such words Kālāmas the wellversed noble disciple parts with fancy speech and stops fancy speech They speak timely speech true speech Dharma speech purposeful speech and calming speech They enjoy calming speech perform tasks in a timely way as appropriate and they well teach and well admonish others They purify their mind and rid it of fancy speech Kālāmas the wellversed noble disciple is free of longing and stops longing They dont harbor quarrels in their mind Seeing the valuables of others and their requisites for living they dont long for or wish to obtain them for themselves They purify their mind and rid it of longing Kālāmas the wellversed noble disciple is free of anger and stops anger With conscience and modesty and with kindness and compassion theyre beneficial to all living things even insects and worms They purify their mind and rid it of animosity Kālāmas the wellversed noble disciple is free of wrong view and stops wrong view They conduct themselves in right view and arent mistaken Thus viewing and thus speaking they say Theres generosity purification and incantations Theres the results of good and bad actions Theres the present world and another world Theres father and mother The world truly has people who depart and go to good places good departures and good headings In this world and another world their own knowledge and awakening is accomplished by selfrealization They purify their mind and rid it of wrong views Thus Kālāmas the wellversed noble disciple achieves pure physical conduct and achieves pure verbal and mental conduct Theyre free of anger free of dispute and they abandon drowsiness Without agitation or arrogance they end doubt and free themselves from conceit With right mindfulness and right knowledge they have no delusions They pervade one direction with both mind and kindness They do so in two three or four directions the four counterpoints and up and down They completely pervade them all with both their mind

both their mind and compassion  joy  equanimity Its without fetters without enmity without anger without disputation and very broad and great Measureless and well cultivated they accomplish the filling of the whole world Thus Kālāmas the wellversed noble disciples mind is without fetters without enmity without anger and without disputation They readily attain four peaceful dwelling places What are the four Theres the present world and another world and there are the results of good and bad actions Ive attained this right view associated with actions upholding and perfecting it When my body breaks up and my life ends Ill surely go to a good place and be born up in the heavens Thus Kālāmas the wellversed noble disciples mind is without fetters without enmity without anger and without

such views here in the present I simply praise those of right knowledge Those who make effort and those of right view say those things exist Thus Kālāmas the wellversed noble disciples mind is without

This is called the fourth peaceful dwelling place Thus Gautama the wellversed noble disciples mind is without fetters without enmity without anger and without disputation These are called the four peaceful dwelling places Gautama weve realized it Sugata weve understood it Bhagavān We all take our refuge in the Buddha Dharma and the community of monks Please let the Bhagavān accept us as laymen Starting today these three jewels will be our personal refuge for the rest of our lives The Buddha spoke thus All the Kālāma people and the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and handed it down Medium Discourses  Ending the Contaminants Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to Kuru and was staying at the Kuru town of Kalmāṣadamya It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Its because of knowing and seeing that the contaminants can be ended not by not knowing and not seeing How can the contaminants be ended because of knowing and seeing There is correct contemplation and incorrect contemplation If someone doesnt correctly contemplate contaminants of desire that have yet to arise will arise and those that have already arisen will increase Contaminants of existence and ignorance that have yet to arise will arise and those that have already arisen will increase If someone correctly contemplates contaminants of desire that have yet to arise wont arise and those that have already arisen will cease Contaminants of existence and ignorance that have yet to arise wont arise and those that have already arisen will cease Still ordinary foolish people dont listen to the right teaching dont meet genuine friends and dont know the noble teaching They arent disciplined by the noble teaching and dont truly know that teaching When someone doesnt correctly contemplate contaminants of desire that have yet to arise will arise and those that have already arisen will increase Contaminants of existence and ignorance that have yet to arise will arise and those that have already arisen will increase When someone correctly contemplates contaminants of desire that have yet to arise wont arise and those that have already arisen will cease Contaminants of existence and ignorance that have yet to arise wont arise and those that have already arisen will cease Because they dont truly know the teaching a person thinks things that shouldnt be thought and doesnt think things that should be thought Because they think things that shouldnt be thought and dont think things that should be thought contaminants of desire that have yet to arise will arise and those that have already arisen will increase Contaminants of existence and ignorance that have yet to arise will arise and those that have already arisen will increase Wellversed noble disciples hear the right teaching and meet genuine friends They are disciplined by the noble teaching and truly know the teaching When someone doesnt correctly contemplate contaminants of desire that have yet to arise will arise and those that have already arisen will increase Contaminants of existence and ignorance that have yet to arise will arise and those that have already arisen will increase When someone correctly contemplates contaminants of desire that have yet to arise wont arise and those that have already arisen will cease Contaminants of existence and ignorance that have yet to arise wont arise and those that have already arisen will cease After truly knowing the teaching they dont think things that shouldnt be thought and think things that should be thought Because they dont think things that shouldnt be thought and think things that should be thought contaminants of desire that have yet to arise wont arise and those that have already arisen will cease Contaminants of existence and ignorance that have yet to arise wont arise and those that have already arisen will cease There are seven things that stop the contaminants the states of affliction and grief What are the seven There are contaminants stopped by seeing contaminants stopped by guarding contaminants stopped by avoiding contaminants stopped by using contaminants stopped by tolerating contaminants stopped by removing and contaminants stopped by contemplating How are contaminants stopped by seeing Ordinary foolish people cant hear the right teaching dont meet genuine friends and dont know the noble teaching They arent disciplined by the noble teaching and dont truly know the teaching Because they dont correctly contemplate they then think I have past lives I have no past lives What were the causes of my past lives What were my past lives Ill have future lives Ill have no future lives What will be the causes of my future lives What will be my future lives They doubt themselves saying Whats the meaning of this What is this Where did this sentient being come from Where will it go What were the causes for its existence in the past What will be the causes for its existence in the future Thus they incorrectly contemplate As a result of those six views this view arises There really is a soul That view gives rise to this view There really is no soul That view gives rise to this view The soul sees the soul That views gives rise to this view The soul sees whats not the soul That view gives rise to this view Whats not the soul sees the soul That view gives rise to these views The soul speaks knows acts teaches initiates actions and initiates teachings Its born in one place or another and receives the results of good and bad actions It certainly comes from nowhere  certainly doesnt exist  certainly wont exist This is called the downfall of views being moved by views and being tied by the bond of views As a result ordinary foolish people are subject to the pain of birth old age illness and death Wellversed noble disciples hear the right teaching and meet genuine friends They are disciplined by the noble teaching and truly know the teaching They truly know suffering and truly know the formation of suffering cessation of suffering and the path to the cessation of suffering After thus truly knowing them the three fetters are ended which are belief in the individual adherence to precepts and doubt After ending these three fetters they attain stream entry They wont fall into bad states and are certainly headed for right awakening Theyll experience at most seven existences After seven rebirths up in heaven or among humans theyll then reach the end of suffering If someone doesnt know and see then affliction and grief will arise When they know and see affliction and grief wont arise This is called stopping contaminants by seeing How are the contaminants stopped by guarding Monks someone who guards the eye faculty when they see things will observe whats impure with correct contemplation Someone who doesnt guard the eye faculty will observe whats pure with incorrect contemplation If someone doesnt guard their faculties then affliction and grief will arise When they guard their faculties affliction and grief wont arise So it is when someones ear  nose  tongue  body  mind faculty perceives things Someone who guards their mind faculty will observe whats impure with correct contemplation Someone who doesnt guard the mind faculty will observe whats pure with incorrect contemplation If someone doesnt guard their faculties then affliction and grief will arise When they guard them affliction and grief wont arise This is called stopping the contaminants by guarding How are the contaminants stopped by avoiding Monks someone who sees a dangerous elephant will avoid it Dangerous horses cattle dogs vipers paths ditches pits hedges rivers deep springs mountains cliffs and bad associates friends heretics villages and homes should all be avoided by a monk  If other religious practitioners sharing the same dwelling would cause people without doubts to become doubtful of him a monk avoids them too  If someone doesnt avoid these things then affliction and grief will arise When they avoid them affliction and grief wont arise This is called stopping the contaminants by avoiding How are the contaminants stopped by using Monks suppose someone uses robes not for profit not because of pride and not for ornamentation but only because of insects wind rain cold heat and modesty Suppose someone uses food not for profit not because of pride and not for the rich pleasure of it but only to make his body longlasting to remove affliction and grief to practice the religious life to end an illness and prevent new illnesses and to abide in comfort and without illness for a long time Suppose someone uses a house a hut a seat or a bed not for profit not because of pride and not for ornamentation but only for rest from weariness and to sit quietly Suppose someone uses hot water and medicine not for profit not because of pride and not for the rich pleasure of it but only to remove illness and discomfort to manage their vitality and to be comfortable and without illness If someone doesnt use these things affliction and grief will arise When they use them affliction and grief wont arise This is called stopping the contaminants by using How are the contaminants stopped by tolerating Monks someone makes effort to end bad and unskillful qualities and cultivate good qualities so he always has the idea of rising early They concentrate their mind and endeavor Their skin muscles sinews bones blood and marrow may wither but they dont abandon their effort Only when they obtain what they seek will they abandon their effort Again monks they can tolerate hunger thirst cold heat biting and stinging insects the oppression of wind and sun and harsh sounds They can even tolerate being caned When they encounter illness extreme pain or their life is about to end theyre capable of tolerating such unpleasantness If someone doesnt tolerate these things affliction and grief will arise When they tolerate them affliction and grief wont arise This is called stopping the contaminants by tolerating How are the contaminants stopped by removing Monks suppose someone gives rise to thoughts of desire that havent been removed and abandoned They give rise to thoughts of anger and harmfulness that havent been removed and abandoned If someone doesnt remove these things affliction and grief will arise When they remove them affliction and grief wont arise This is called stopping the contaminants by removing How are the contaminants stopped by contemplating Monks suppose someone contemplates the first awakening factor of mindfulness with the support of seclusion lack of desire and cessation which lead to escape He contemplates teachings  effort  joy  calm  concentration  the seventh awakening factor of equanimity with the support of seclusion lack of desire and cessation which lead to escape If someone doesnt contemplate these things affliction and grief will arise When they contemplate them affliction and grief wont arise This is called stopping the contaminants by contemplating Monks suppose someone sets out to stop the contaminants by seeing and they are stopped because of seeing  to stop the contaminants by guarding and they are stopped because of guarding  to stop the contaminants by avoiding and they are stopped because of avoiding  to stop the contaminants by using and they are stopped because of using  to stop the contaminants by tolerating and they are stopped because of tolerating  to stop the contaminants by removing and they are stopped because of removing  to stop the contaminants by contemplating and they are stopped because of contemplating This is called a monk who was once bound by all the contaminants and whos now free He can reach the end of suffering with right knowledge Thus did the Buddha speak The monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Not Knowing  Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks When you dont know or understand form and dont become free of desire for it the mind isnt liberated and its not possible to transcend the fear of birth old age illness and death Thus when you dont know or understand feeling  perception  volition  consciousness and dont become free of desire for it the mind isnt liberated and its not possible to transcend the fear of birth old age illness and death Monks if you know and understand form and become free of desire for it the mind is liberated and its

heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks When you delight in form you delight in suffering Delighting in suffering its not possible to be liberated from suffering Thus when you delight in feeling  perception  volition  consciousness you delight in suffering Delighting in suffering its not possible to be liberated from suffering Monks when you dont delight in form you dont delight in suffering Not delighting in suffering its possible to be liberated from suffering Thus when you dont delight in feeling  perception  volition  consciousness you dont delight in suffering Not delighting in suffering its possible to be liberated from suffering When the monks who heard what the Buddha taught they rejoiced

sentient beings to create such views and such statements The lack of knowing and seeing in sentient beings has no cause and no condition The monks then said to the Buddha The Bhagavān is the Dharma

was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Form is impermanent Whats impermanent is painful whats painful is not self and whats not self doesnt belong to self Such observation is called true and correct observation Thus feeling  perception  volition  consciousness is impermanent Whats impermanent is painful whats painful is not self and whats not self doesnt belong to self Such observation is called true and correct observation Noble disciples who thus observe are liberated from form and liberated from sensation  perception

precepts and accept ascetic practices I cultivate the religious practices making unripe actions ripen and ripened actions to be discarded Progress and retreat cant be known These pains and pleasures are always present for the definite measure of birthanddeath Like a ball of thread tossed into the air that gradually falls to the ground on its own likewise is this definite measure of  great eons of birthanddeath The monks said to the Buddha The Bhagavān is the Dharma root the Dharma eye and the Dharma refuge  Its thus explained in detail and in the sequence of the three sutras  above Related Discourses   The Five Monks Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at ṣipatana in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the other five monks Form doesnt have self If form had self it wouldnt be that illness and pain arise from form and there wouldnt be the desire about form Let it be so let it not be so Its because form is without self that theres illness and pain that arise from form and its possible to desire of form Let it be so let it not be so Feeling perception volition and consciousness are likewise Monks what do you think Is form permanent or is it impermanent The monks said to the Buddha Impermanent Bhagavān Monks if something is impermanent is it painful The monks said to the Buddha Its painful Bhagavān If its impermanent and painful its liable to change Would wellversed noble disciples see this as a self whats  other than self or either of them present in the other The monks said to the Buddha No Bhagavān Feeling perception volition and consciousness are likewise Therefore monks whatever forms exist whether past future or present internal or external crude or fine beautiful or ugly and distant or near they are not self and dont belong to self when truly observed Feeling perception volition and consciousness are likewise Monks wellversed noble disciple sees that whats in these five acquired aggregates is not self and doesnt belong to self Thus observing them they grasp nothing from all the world Because they grasp nothing they attach to nothing Because they attach to nothing they realize nirvāṇa for themselves My births have been ended the religious practice has been established and the task has been accomplished I myself know that I wont be subject to a later existence After the Buddha spoke this sūtra the contaminants didnt arise in those five monks and their minds were liberated After the Buddha spoke this sūtra the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Thus have I heard One time the Buddha stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks What is it that exists that arises that ties thats an

instructing others to boil and killing and instructing others to kill harming sentient beings stealing others property committing sexual misconduct knowingly speaking falsehoods and drinking alcohol penetrating walls cutting chains and stealing even going down the roads to harm villages harm cities and harm the populace with a wheel of the sharpest blades that slices dices and chops them up into a great pile of flesh they form such a theory That is not a cause or condition for evil and it doesnt bring evil If someone were to kill and injure people south of the Gaṅgā River and make a great congregation to the north of the Gaṅgā River those wouldnt be causes or conditions for good and evil nor would they bring good and evil Doing things like bestowing gifts training maintaining scriptures performing blessings and cooperating doesnt create merits either The monks said to the Buddha The Bhagavān is the Dharma root the Dharma eye and the Dharma refuge  Its thus explained in detail and in the sequence of the three sutras  above Related Discourses   The Source of SufferingThus have I heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks What is it that exists that arises that binds thats an attachment and thats viewed as self which causes the arising of grief sorrow vexation and pain that have yet to arise and increases the grief sorrow vexation and pain that have already arisen The monks said to the Buddha The Bhagavān is the Dharma root the Dharma eye and the Dharma refuge Please explain this in detail After we hear it the monks will accept and approve of it The Buddha addressed the monks Its because form exists and because form arises binds and becomes an attachment that its viewed as self It causes the arising of grief sorrow pain and vexation that have yet to arise and increases the grief sorrow pain and vexation that have already arisen Feeling perception volition and consciousness are likewise Monks what do you think  Is form permanent or is it impermanent They replied Impermanent Bhagavān Again he asked If something is impermanent is it painful They replied Its painful Bhagavān So it is monks If something is impermanent then its painful Because this pain exists these things arise bind become attachments and are viewed as self It causes the arising of grief sorrow pain and vexation that have yet to arise and increases the grief sorrow pain and vexation that have already arisen Feeling perception volition and consciousness are likewise Therefore monks all forms that exist whether past future or present internal or external coarse or fine beautiful or ugly and distant or near are not self not different than self nor are either present in the other This is called correct wisdom Feeling perception volition and consciousness are likewise whether seen heard felt cognized arisen or sought from memory perception or contemplation they are all not self not different than self nor are either present in other This is called correct wisdom If theres a view that theres a self world or this or another life thats permanent eternal and unchanging they are all not self not different than self nor are either present in the other This is called correct wisdom Again if theres a view that its not a self or what belongs to self of this life or not self or what belongs to self in the future life they are all not self not different than self nor are either present in the other This is called correct wisdom Suppose wellversed noble disciples observe these six positions as not self and not what belongs to self Such observation stops misgivings about the Buddha and stops misgivings about the Dharma and Saṃgha Monks this is called a wellversed noble disciple whos no longer capable of doing physical verbal or mental actions that lead to the three bad destinies Even when they are careless this noble disciple is definitely headed toward complete awakening With seven rebirths as gods or humans theyll reach the end of suffering After the Buddha taught this sūtra the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and approved

wasnt possible then I would never say that you must part with and stop wrong views Its because wrong views can be stopped that I say monks should part with wrong views If they dont part with wrong views then wrong views will make them undertake whats aimless unbeneficial and painful I therefore say you must part with wrong views Thus wrong intention wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration are likewise explained Monks after you part with wrong views you must cultivate right views If cultivating right views wasnt possible I would never say that you must cultivate right views Its because right views can be cultivated that I say monks must cultivate right views If they dont cultivate right views they will undertake whats aimless unbeneficial and painful Because not cultivating right views undertakes whats aimless unbeneficial and painful I therefore say you must cultivate right views Because they are purposeful and beneficial youll always attain wellbeing Therefore monks you must cultivate right views Thus right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration are

could forms that arise impermanent causes and impermanent conditions be permanent Thus feeling  perception  volition  consciousness is impermanent Whatever causes and conditions give rise to consciousnesses they are also impermanent How could consciousnesses that arise from impermanent causes and impermanent conditions be permanent Thus monks form is impermanent and feeling  perception  volition  consciousness is impermanent Whats impermanent then is painful whats painful is not self and whats not self doesnt belong to self Noble disciples who thus observe become disillusioned with form and they become disillusioned with feeling  perception  volition  consciousness Being disillusioned they dont enjoy it Not enjoying it they are liberated Being liberated they know and see My births have been ended the religious practice has been established and the task has been accomplished I myself know that I wont be subject to a later existence When the monks heard what the Buddha taught they rejoiced and approved Medium Discourses  The Wood Pile Parable Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to Kośala and stayed among the people there He traveled with a large assembly of monks and followers It was then that the Bhagavān suddenly saw from the road a place where there was a large wood pile engulfed in flames  After he saw this the Bhagavān went down to the side of the road spread out his sitting mat by a tree and sat down crosslegged After he had sat down the Bhagavān addressed the monks Do all of you see that large wood pile engulfed in flames The monks then answered We see it Bhagavān The Bhagavān again addressed the monks What do you think Suppose you were to embrace sit or lay with that large wood pile engulfed in flames Suppose there were a warrior woman or a priest householder or worker woman in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed wearing bright and pure clothing and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry and you were to embrace sit or lay down with her Which would be pleasant The monks then said Bhagavān that large wood pile is engulfed in flames If we embraced sat or lay with it it would be very painful Bhagavān suppose there were a warrior woman or a priest householder or worker woman in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed wearing bright and pure clothing and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry To embrace sit or lay with her would be very pleasant Bhagavān The Bhagavān told them I will explain this for you so you trainees dont lose the ascetic path Those of you who want to achieve the unsurpassed religious practice should rather embrace that wood pile engulfed in flames If you sit or lay down there even though it will cause you to suffer pain or die you wont be destined to go to a

your bone After cutting bone it reaches your marrow and stops Suppose you were to accept a faithful gift from a warrior priest householder or worker who massages your body limbs hands and feet Which

its fruit and its result There is an utmost happiness birth in good places and attainment of a long life I accept the faithful gifts of others for clothing food and drink bed and bedding and bathing and medicine It will cause my benefactors to obtain great fortune obtain great rewards and obtain great radiance Train yourselves in this way When he spoke this teaching the contaminants ended for  monks and they were freed from the bonds  monks renounced the precepts and returned home Why is that The Bhagavāns instructions were too profound and difficult and so was the path of training Thus did the Buddha speak Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Impermanent Painful Empty and Not Self Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks You should observe that form is  impermanent   painful   empty   not self Such observation then is right view Correctly observing it gives rise to disillusionment Being disillusioned delight and greed for form will end When delight and greed for form have ended thats said to be the minds liberation Thus observe that feeling  perception  volition  consciousness is  impermanent   painful   empty   not self Such observation then is right view Correctly observing it gives rise to disillusionment Being disillusioned delight and greed for consciousness will end When delight and greed for consciousness have ended thats said to be the minds liberation Thus monks someone wanting to realize the minds liberation for themselves then can realize it My births have been ended the religious practice has been established and the task has been accomplished I myself know that I wont be subject to a later existence When the monks heard what the Buddha taught they rejoiced and approved Medium Discourses  The Water Parable Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to the country of rāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks I will explain seven people in water for you Listen closely listen closely Consider it well The monks then accepted the teaching and listened The Buddha said What are the seven Sometimes a person remains prostrate in the water Sometimes a person emerges from the water but goes back under Sometimes a person emerges from the water and stands up Sometimes a person emerges from the water stands up and looks around after standing up Sometimes a person emerges from the water stands up looks around after standing up and wades across after looking around Sometimes a person emerges from the water stands up looks around after standing up wades across after looking around and reaches the other shore after wading across Sometimes a person emerges from the water stands up looks around after standing up wades across after looking around reaches the other shore after wading across and is called a person who stands on the shore after reaching the other shore Thus I will again explain the metaphors of these seven people in water Listen closely listen closely Consider it well The monks then accepted the teaching and listened The Buddha said What are the seven Sometimes a person remains prostrate Another person goes back under after emerging Another person stands up after emerging Another person stands up after emerging and they look around after standing up Another person stands up after emerging they look around after standing up and they wade across after looking around Another person stands up after emerging they look around after standing up they wade across after looking around and they reach the other side after wading across Another person stands up after emerging they look around after standing up they wade across after looking around they reach the other side after wading across and theyre called a priest standing the on shore after reaching the other shore These are the metaphors of these seven people in water which Ive explained briefly Do you know what they mean as theyve been described and as theyve been defined How are they to be discerned What causes and conditions do they have The monks then said to the Bhagavān The Bhagavān is the source of the Dharma The Bhagavān is the Dharma lord The Dharma comes from the Bhagavān Please let him teach it After listening well get a detailed knowledge of its meaning The Buddha then addressed them All of you listen closely and consider it well I will discern their meaning for you The monks then accepted the teaching and listened The Buddha said How does a person remain prostrate It means a person is covered up by unskillful things They are stained by defilements which bring the results of bad states and create the basis of birthanddeath This is called the person who remains prostrate Hes like a person whos submerged and remains prostrate in water I say this person is likewise This is called the first metaphor of the person in water The world in truth does have such people How does a person go back under after emerging It means a person has emerged and attained faith in the good Dharma Observing precepts generous wellversed and wise they cultivate the good Dharma At some point later they lose their faith it wasnt resolute They lose their observance of precepts generosity learning and wisdom they werent resolute This is called the person who goes back under after emerging Theyre like a person whos submerged in water and goes back under after emerging I say this person is likewise This is called the second metaphor of the person in water The world in truth does have such people How does a person stand up after emerging It means a person emerges and then attains faith in the good Dharma Observing precepts generous wellversed and wise they cultivate the good Dharma At some point later their faith remains resolute it isnt lost Their observance of precepts generosity learning and wisdom are resolute they arent lost This is called the person who stands up after emerging Theyre like the person whos submerged in water and stands up after emerging I say this person is likewise This is called the third metaphor of the person in water The world in truth does have such people How does a person stand up after emerging and look around after standing It means a person emerges and then attains faith in the good Dharma Observing precepts generous wellversed and wise they cultivate the good Dharma At some point later their faith remains resolute it isnt lost Their observance of precepts generosity learning and wisdom are resolute they arent lost Abiding in the good Dharma they truly know suffering They truly know sufferings formation know sufferings cessation and know the path to the cessation of suffering Knowing and seeing thus they readily end the three bonds which are belief in the individual adherence to precepts and doubt Once these three bonds have ended they become a stream entrant and dont fall into bad states Theyre certainly destined for right awakening and will experience at most seven existences After seven rebirths up in the heavens or here among humans they will reach the end of suffering This is called the person who stands up after emerging and looks around after standing Theyre like a person submerged in water who stands up after emerging and looks around after standing up I say that person is likewise This is called the fourth metaphor of the person in water The world in truth does have such people How does a person stand up after emerging look around after standing and wade across after looking around It means a person emerges and attains faith in the good Dharma Observing precepts generous wellversed and wise they cultivate the good Dharma At some point later their faith remains resolute it isnt lost Their observance of precepts generosity learning and wisdom are resolute they arent lost Abiding in the good Dharma they truly know suffering They truly know sufferings formation know sufferings cessation and know the path to the cessation of suffering Knowing and seeing thus they readily end the three bonds which are belief in the individual adherence to precepts and doubt Once these three bonds are ended their lust hate and delusion are weakened They may be reborn once up in the heavens or here among humans After one rebirth theyll reach the end of suffering This is called the person who stands up after emerging looks around after standing and wades across after looking around Theyre like a person submerged in water who stands up after emerging looks around after standing and wades across after looking around I say this person is likewise This is called the fifth metaphor of the person in water The world in truth does have such people How does a person stand up after emerging look around after standing wade across after looking around and reach the other shore after wading across It means a person emerges and then attains faith in the good Dharma Observing precepts generous wellversed and wise they cultivate the good Dharma At some point later their faith remains resolute it isnt lost Their observance of precepts generosity learning and wisdom are resolute they arent lost Abiding in the good Dharma they truly know suffering They truly know sufferings cultivation know sufferings cessation and know the path to the cessation of suffering Knowing and thus seeing thus they readily end the five lower bonds which are desire anger belief in the individual adherence to precepts and doubt Once these five lower bonds have ended theyre born elsewhere and then attain parinirvāṇa They become irreversible and dont return to this world This is called the person who stands up after emerging looks around after standing wades across after looking around and reaches the other shore after wading across They are like a person submerged in water who stands up after emerging looks around after standing wades across after looking around and reaches the other shore after wading across I say this person is likewise This is the sixth metaphor of the person in water The world in truth does have such people How does a person stand up after emerging look around after standing wade across after looking around reach the other shore after wading across and is called a priest standing on the shore after reaching the other shore It means a person emerges and attains faith in the good Dharma Observing precepts generous wellversed and wise they cultivate the good Dharma At some point later their faith remains resolute it isnt lost Their observance of precepts generosity learning and wisdom are resolute they arent lost Abiding in the good Dharma they truly know suffering They truly know sufferings cultivation know sufferings cessation and know the path to the cessation of suffering Knowing and seeing thus their mind is liberated from the contaminants of desire and its liberated from the contaminants of existence and ignorance After being liberated they then know that they are liberated Birth has been ended the religious practice has been established and the task has been accomplished and I truly know that Im no longer subject to existence This is called the person who stands up after emerging looks around after standing wades across after looking around reaches the other shore after wading across and is called a priest standing on the shore after reaching the other shore Theyre like a person submerged in water who stands up after emerging looks around after standing wades across after looking around reaches the other shore after wading across and is called someone who stands on the shore after reaching the other shore I say this person is likewise This is called the seventh metaphor of the person in water The world in truth does have such people I had said I will explain the seven people in water for you and so I have explained it Thus did the Buddha speak Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Medium Discourses  Ariṣṭa Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to the country of rāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove It was then that the monk Ariṣṭa who before was Gṛdhabādhi gave rise to this bad view I know the Bhagavān thus explains the teaching Engaging in desires is no obstruction After the monks heard this they went to the monk Ariṣṭa and asked Ariṣṭa is it true that you say this I know the Bhagavān thus explains the teaching Engaging in desires is no obstruction Ariṣṭa then answered Venerables I really do know that the Bhagavān thus explains the teaching Engaging in desires is no obstruction The monks reprimanded Ariṣṭa Dont say that dont misrepresent the Bhagavān Misrepresenting the Bhagavān is not good nor does the Bhagavān teach that way Ariṣṭa desire is an obstruction The Bhagavān has explained that desire is an obstruction in measureless ways Ariṣṭa you can quickly abandon this bad view After he was reprimanded by those monks the monk Ariṣṭa held to this bad view forcefully He said to one of them This is the truth The rest is a falsehood He said this three times Being unable to convince the monk Ariṣṭa to abandon this bad view they got up from their seats and departed They went to the Buddha bowed their heads as his feet and withdrew to sit to one side They said Bhagavān the monk Ariṣṭa has formed this bad view I know the Bhagavān thus explains the teaching Engaging in desires is no obstruction Bhagavān after we heard about it we went to the monk Ariṣṭa and asked him Ariṣṭa is it true that you say this I know the Bhagavān thus explains the teaching Engaging in desires is no obstruction Ariṣṭa replied to us Venerables I really know that the Bhagavān thus explains the teaching Engaging in desires is no obstruction Bhagavān we reprimanded him Ariṣṭa dont say that dont misrepresent the Bhagavān Misrepresenting the Bhagavān is not good nor does the Bhagavān teach that way Ariṣṭa desire is an obstruction The Bhagavān explains that desire is an obstruction in measureless ways Ariṣṭa you can quickly abandon this bad view After we reprimanded him he held to this bad view forcefully He said to one of us This is the truth The rest is false He said this three times Bhagavān since we were unable to convince him to abandon this bad view we got up from our seats and departed After the Bhagavān heard this he told one of the monks Go to that monk Ariṣṭa and tell him The Bhagavān summons you That monk then did as the Bhagavān instructed He got up from his seat bowed his head at the Buddhas feet circled him three times and departed He went to the monk Ariṣṭa and told him The Bhagavān summons you The monk Ariṣṭa then went to the Buddha bowed his head at his feet and withdrew to sit to one side The Bhagavān asked him Ariṣṭa is it true that youve said this I know the Bhagavān thus explains the teaching Engaging in desires is no obstruction Ariṣṭa answered him Bhagavān I really know that the Bhagavān thus explains the teaching Engaging in desires is no obstruction The Bhagavān reprimanded him Ariṣṭa how do you know that I explain the teaching that way From whose mouth did you hear that I explain the teaching that way You foolish man How can you say to someone what I havent said to someone You foolish man You heard the other monks reprimand you together You then should have answered according to the teaching Now I will ask the monks The Buddha then asked the monks Do you also thus know that I explain the teaching this way Engaging in desires is no obstruction The monks replied No The Bhagavān asked How do you know how I explain the teaching The monks answered We know the Bhagavān explains the teaching this way  Desire is an obstruction The Bhagavān teaches that desire is an obstruction Desire is like a chain of bones The Bhagavān teaches that desire is like a chain of bones Desire is like a cut of meat The Bhagavān teaches that desire is like a cut of meat Desire is like holding a torch The Bhagavān teaches that desire is like holding a torch Desire is like a fire pit The Bhagavān teaches that desire is like a fire pit Desire is like a viper The Bhagavān teaches that desire is like a viper Desire is like a dream The Bhagavān teaches that desire is like a dream Desire is like a loan The Bhagavān teaches that desire is like a loan Desire is like a tree fruit The Bhagavān teaches that desire is like a tree fruit We know that the Bhagavān explains the teaching this way The Bhagavān praised them Good Good monks You know that I explain the teaching this way Why is that I also say this Desire is an obstruction I teach that desire is an obstruction Desire is like a chain of bones I teach that desire is like a chain of bones Desire is like a cut of meat I teach that desire is like a cut of meat Desire is like holding a torch I teach that desire is like holding a torch Desire is like a fire pit I teach that desire is like a fire pit Desire is like a viper I teach that desire is like a viper Desire is like a dream I teach that desire is like a dream Desire is like a loan I teach that desire is like a loan Desire is like a tree fruit I teach that desire is like a tree fruit The Bhagavān praised them again Good good All of you know that I explain the teaching this way Still this foolish man Ariṣṭa is mistaken in how he understands my meaning and words Because he is mistaken in how he understands it he misrepresents me He does harm to himself its a violation and a misdeed It doesnt please wise religious practitioners He obtains a great misdeed by it You foolish man know that this is a bad and unwholesome position After he had been personally rebuked by the Bhagavān the monk Ariṣṭa was dejected at heart He hung his head in silence He was at a loss for words as he searched for something to say After he had personally rebuked that monk Ariṣṭa many times the Bhagavān addressed the monks If my explanation of the teaching is entirely and fully understood you must thus maintain it If my explanation of the teaching is not entirely and fully understood then you must ask me and other wise religious practitioners about it Why is that A deluded person might mistakenly understand its meaning and words As a result of their own mistaken understanding theyll know the teaching to be such and such meaning the correct sūtras songs assurances verses circumstances records legends lectures birth places extensive discourses unprecedented things and explanations of meaning They know their meaning in order to debate it they dont know their meaning in order to be liberated Their knowledge of the teaching doesnt obtain its goal they only experience suffering and trouble Why is that Its because they mistakenly understand the teaching Its like a person who wants to catch a snake so they go searching for one They walk through a wild forest as they search for a snake When the person sees a huge snake they grab it by its tail using their hands The snake then turns around and raises its head It might bite their hand foot or some other limb That persons attempt to catch a snake doesnt obtain its goal They only experience suffering and trouble Why is that Its because they dont well understand the way to grasp a snake Thus some deluded people mistakenly understand the meaning and the words of the teaching As a result of their mistaken understanding they know the teaching to be such and such meaning the correct sūtras songs assurances verses circumstances records legends lectures birth places extensive discourses unprecedented things and explanations of meaning They know their meaning in order to debate it they dont know their meaning in order to be liberated Their knowledge of the teaching doesnt obtain its goal they only experience suffering and trouble Why is that Its because they mistakenly understand the teaching Perhaps theres a clansman who isnt mistaken and well understands the meaning and the words of the teaching As a result of not being mistaken and well understanding it he knows the teaching to be such and such meaning the correct sūtras songs assurances verses circumstances records legends lectures birth places extensive discourses unprecedented things and explanations of meaning He doesnt know their meaning in order to debate it he only knows their meaning in order to be liberated His knowledge of the teaching obtains its goal so he doesnt experience suffering and trouble Why is that Its because he doesnt mistakenly understand the teaching Its like a person who wants to catch a snake and goes out searching for one When they search for a snake they carry an iron stick as they walk through a wild forest Seeing a huge snake they first pin the snakes head with the iron stick and then they grab its head with their hand Although that snake can twist its tail and coil around that persons hand foot or other limb it isnt able to bite them That persons attempt to catch a snake obtains its goal They dont experience suffering or trouble Why is that Its because they well understand the way to grasp a snake Thus perhaps theres a clansman who isnt mistaken and well understands the meaning and the words of the teaching As a result of not being mistaken and well understanding it he knows the teaching to be such and such meaning the correct sūtras songs assurances verses circumstances records legends lectures birth places extensive discourses unprecedented things and explanations of meaning He doesnt know their meaning in order to debate it he only knows their meaning in order to be liberated His knowledge of the teaching obtains its goal so he doesnt experience suffering and trouble Why is that Its because he doesnt mistakenly understand the teaching For a long time I have taught you the parable of the raft because I want you to discard the teaching and dont not want you to acquire it How have I taught you the parable of the raft for a long time wanting you to discard the teaching and not wanting you to acquire it Its like a mountain river thats both deep and wide and its long current is fast moving  Perhaps someone comes along and theres something they want on the other side When they attempt to cross the river they think This mountain river is so deep and wide Its long current is fast moving and theres debris floating in it Theres no boat or bridge but I need to cross it Theres something on the other side that I want to reach What method will I use to get myself safely to the other side Again the person thinks Perhaps I could gather a pile of wood and grass on this side bind it together to make a raft and then ride it across They then make a pile of wood and grass on the shore bind it together to fashion a raft and ride it across reaching the other side safely The person then thinks Now this raft has been quite helpful to me After riding this raft I safely made it from that side over to this one Perhaps I could put it over my right shoulder or carry it on my head when I leave They then put the raft on their right shoulder or carry it on their head What do you think about that plan Will this raft be of help to them The monks replied No The Bhagavān told them How would he get more help from this raft That person thinks This raft of mine was quite helpful After riding this raft I safely made it from that side over to this one Perhaps I could put this raft back in the water or perhaps I could put it on the shore and leave it there That man then puts his raft back in the water or puts it on the shore and leaves it What do you think By doing this will he get any help from this raft The monks then replied Itll be helpful The Bhagavān told them Thus for a long time Ive taught you the parable of the raft wanting you to discard the teaching and not wanting you to acquire it If you know that Ive taught you the parable of the raft for a long time you will abandon this teaching so why wouldnt you abandon whats not the teaching Again there are the six abodes of views What are the six A monk regarding  existent forms in the past future and present whether internal or external fine or crude wonderful or not wonderful near or distant thinks None of them are possessed by me I am not possessed by them nor are they the soul Wisely observing them this way he knows them as they really are Regarding  existent feelings  existent perceptions and  anything viewed like this They arent possessed by me and Im not possessed by them I will become nothing I will not exist He thinks None of them are possessed by me I am not possessed by them nor are they the soul Wisely observing them this way he knows them as they really are  Something is viewed like this Whether its seen heard recognized or known whats obtained or observed and whats considered by the mind it goes from this life to that life or from that life to this life He thinks None of them are possessed by me I am not possessed by them nor are they the soul Wisely observing it this way he knows it as it really is  Something is viewed like this This is the soul this is the world and this is me I will exist in the afterlife being permanent and unchanging Ill be eternal and not subject to decay He thinks None of them are possessed by me I am not possessed by them nor are they the soul Wisely observing it this way he knows it as it really is Then a monk got up from his seat adjusted his robes and saluted the Buddha with his palms together He said Bhagavān isnt there a cause for having internal fear The Bhagavān answered There is The monk again asked Bhagavān what is the cause for having internal fear The Bhagavān answered A monk thus sees and thus speaks Perhaps in the past there was nothing and maybe I wont obtain anything He thus sees and thus speaks becoming sad and troubled lamenting and beating his chest and going crazy Monk this is a cause for having internal fear After the monk praised the Bhagavān he also asked Bhagavān isnt there a cause for having no internal fear The Bhagavān answered There is Monk again asked Bhagavān what is the cause for having no internal fear The Bhagavān answered A monk doesnt thus see and doesnt thus speak Perhaps in the past there was nothing and maybe I wont get anything He doesnt thus see and doesnt thus speak so he doesnt become sad and troubled doesnt lament and beat his chest and doesnt go crazy Monk this is the cause for having no internal fear After the monk praised the Bhagavān he also asked Bhagavān isnt there a cause for having external fear The Bhagavān answered There is The monk again asked Bhagavān what is the cause for having external fear The Bhagavān answered A monk thus sees and thus speaks This is the soul this is the world and this is me I will have a later existence He thus sees and thus speaks Perhaps he meets the Tathāgata or maybe he meets a disciple of the Tathāgata whos intelligent wise speaks well and has accomplished wisdom Whether its the Tathāgata or the Tathāgatas disciple he explains the teaching in order to cease all identity Abandon all contaminants all thats self and whats made by self He explains the teaching in order to cease the tendency of conceit When the Tathāgata or the Tathāgatas disciple explains the teaching in order to cease all identity saying Abandon all contaminants all thats self and whats made by self and he explains the teaching in order to cease the tendency of conceit the monk becomes sad and troubled laments and beats his chest and goes crazy He says Ill be annihilated and never exist again Why is that For a long time that monk considered whats unattractive unenjoyable and immemorable A monk who often does that readily becomes sad and troubled laments and beats his chest and goes crazy Monk this is the cause for having external fear After the monk praised the Bhagavān he also asked Bhagavān isnt there a cause for having no external fear The Bhagavān answered There is The monk again asked Bhagavān what is the cause for having no external fear The Bhagavān answered A monk doesnt thus see and doesnt thus speak This is the soul this is the world and this is me I will have a later existence He doesnt thus see and doesnt thus speak Perhaps he meets the Tathāgata or maybe he meets a disciple of the Tathāgata whos intelligent wise speaks well and has accomplished wisdom Whether its the Tathāgata or the Tathāgatas disciple he explains the teaching in order to cease all identity Abandon all contaminants all thats self and whats made by self He explains the teaching in order to cease the tendency of conceit When the Tathāgata or the Tathāgatas disciple explains the teaching in order to cease all identity saying Abandon all contaminants all thats self and whats made by self and he explains the teaching in order to cease the tendency of conceit the monk doesnt become sad and troubled doesnt lament and beat his chest and doesnt go crazy Nor does he say Ill be annihilated and never exist again Why is that For a long time that monk considered whats attractive enjoyable and memorable A monk who often does that doesnt become sad and troubled doesnt lament and beat his chest and doesnt go crazy Monk this is the cause for having no external fear The monk then praised the Bhagavān Good good After praising him he well accepted what he heard the Buddha teach retaining and reciting it He then remained silent The Bhagavān then praised the monks Good good A monk might accept thus something as acceptable that doesnt cause sadness trouble lamentation beating of chests and craziness Do you see anything to accept thats acceptable and doesnt cause sadness trouble lamentation beating of chests and craziness The monks replied No Bhagavān The Bhagavān praised them Good good You might rely on thus seeing whats dependable Having seen it you dont become sad and troubled dont lament and beat your chests and dont go crazy Do you see something to rely on thus seeing whats dependable Having seen it will you not become sad and troubled lament and beat your chests or go crazy The monks replied No Bhagavān The Bhagavān praised them Good good You might accept such a body That body exists which is always abiding unchanging and not subject to decay Do you see and accept such a body thats an acceptable body which is always abiding unchanging and not subject to decay The monks replied No Bhagavān The Bhagavān praised them Good good Theres the claim Its because of the soul that theres a self Without the soul I see no self This is the soul A soul that exists cant be obtained or imagined An abode of views bonds attachments and tendencies in the mind also cant be obtained or imagined Monks is that not a perfect statement and view seeing whats continuous like that monk Ariṣṭa who before was Gṛdhabādhi The monks answered So it is Bhagavān Its a perfect statement and view seeing whats continuous like that monk Ariṣṭa who before was Gṛdhabādhi Furthermore there are the six abodes of views What are the six A monk regarding existent forms in the past future and present whether internal or external fine or crude wonderful or not wonderful near or distant thinks None of them are possessed by me I am not possessed by them nor are they the soul Wisely observing them this way he knows them as they really are Regarding existent feelings existent perceptions and anything viewed like this They arent possessed by me and Im not possessed by them I will become nothing I will not exist He thinks None of them are possessed by me I am not possessed by them nor are they the soul Wisely observing them this way he knows them as they really are Something is viewed like this Whether its seen heard recognized or known whats obtained or observed and whats considered by the mind it goes from this life to that life or from that life to this life He thinks None of them are possessed by me I am not possessed by them nor are they the soul Wisely observing it this way he knows it as it really is Something is viewed like this This is the soul this is the world and this is me I will exist in the afterlife being permanent and unchanging Ill be eternal and not subject to decay He thinks None of them are possessed by me I am not possessed by them nor are they the soul Wisely observing it this way he knows it as it really is Suppose a monk sees these six abodes of views and doesnt see there a soul and doesnt see something possessed by a soul After not seeing them that way he then doesnt accept this world After not accepting this world then he has no fear After he has no fear then he attains parinirvāṇa My births have been ended the religious life has been established and the task has been accomplished I wont be subject to another existence He knows it as it truly is He is known as a monk who has crossed the moat gone beyond the moat has breached the city wall has no gate and is a mirror of noble wisdom How has the monk crossed the moat He has exhausted the moat of ignorance and has known it He uprooted it completely and broke through to no more future birth Thus the monk has crossed the moat How has the monk gone beyond the moat He has ended craving for existence and has known it He uprooted it completely and broke through to no more future birth Thus the monk has gone beyond the moat How has the monk breached the city wall He has ended endless birth and death and has known it He uprooted it completely and broke through to no more future birth Thus the monk has broken through the city wall How does the monk have no gate He has ended the five lower bonds and has known it He has uprooted them completely and broken through to no more future birth Thus the monk has no gate How is the monk a mirror of noble wisdom He has ended selfconceit and has known it He uprooted it completely and broke through to no more future birth Thus the monk is a mirror of noble wisdom This is known as a monk who has crossed the moat gone beyond the moat breached the city wall has no gate and is a mirror of noble wisdom Thus Indra the god śāna Brahmā and their retinues search and arent able to find a consciousness that the correctly liberated Tathāgata relies upon such as the Tathāgata is Brahmā the Tathāgata is cooled the Tathāgata is not anguished or the Tathāgata is not different I thus explain Ascetics and priests misrepresent me They speak falsely and not truly The ascetic Gautama guides without any supposition He claims that a really existent sentient being is ended ceased and destroyed If this were so the absence of self wouldnt be explained The Tathāgata explains the absence of sorrow in the present life If another person ridicules the Tathāgata assaults the Tathāgata with numerous hateful insults the Tathāgata causes them to abide with no hate or resentment and never become harmful When people ridicule the Tathāgata and assault him with numerous hateful insults what does the Tathāgata think The Tathāgata thinks this Did I do something or make something in the past that caused this to take place Thats what the Tathāgata thinks about the words that ridicule the Tathāgata and assault him with numerous insults When another person respects the Tathāgata and offers support serves and venerates him the Tathāgata is not pleased and encouraged by that and it doesnt make him happy at heart If another person respects the Tathāgata and offers support serves and venerates him what does the Tathāgata think The Tathāgata thinks this Is there something I know and have ended now that causes this to take place Thats what the Tathāgata thinks when another person respects the Tathāgata and offers support serves and venerates him The Bhagavān addressed the monks If another person ridicules you and assaults you with numerous hateful insults or if they are respectful offer support serve and venerate you dont make this a cause to be hateful and resentful dont become harmful Dont be encouraged or joyous and dont be happy at heart Why is that We have no soul and nothing is possessed by a soul Its like the dry grass and withered wood outside the entrance of this Jetas Grove Perhaps another person takes it way burns it or makes use of it as they like What do you think Does that dry grass and withered wood think this That person took us away burned us and made use of us as they liked The monks replied No Bhagavān Thus if another person ridicules you and assaults you with numerous hateful insults or if they are respectful offer support serve and venerate you this too should cause you not to be hateful or resentful Dont become harmful Dont be encouraged or joyous either Dont be happy at heart Why is that We have no soul and nothing is possessed by a soul My teaching is well expressed revealed and disseminated has nothing pointless and spreads as its proclaimed even up to the heavens Thus is my teaching well expressed revealed and disseminated has nothing pointless and spreads as its proclaimed even up to the heavens If someone of correct wisdom is liberated then they dont claim theres something that doesnt end when their life ends My teaching is well expressed revealed and disseminated has nothing pointless and spreads as its proclaimed even up to the heavens Thus is my teaching well expressed revealed and disseminated has nothing pointless and spreads as its proclaimed even up to the heavens If someone has ended the five lower bonds then at the end of their life theyll be born elsewhere and attain parinirvāṇa Attaining irreversibility they wont return to this world My teaching is well expressed revealed and disseminated has nothing pointless and spreads as its proclaimed even up to the heavens Thus is my teaching well expressed revealed and disseminated has nothing pointless and spreads as its proclaimed even up to the heavens If someone has ended the three bonds and lust anger and delusion are weakened theyll be reborn once more up in heaven or among men After that one rebirth then theyll reach the limit of suffering My teaching is well expressed revealed and disseminated has nothing pointless and spreads as its proclaimed even up to the heavens Thus is my teaching well expressed revealed and disseminated has nothing pointless and spreads as its proclaimed even up to the heavens If someone has ended the three bonds and attained stream entry they wont fall into bad states They are certainly headed for correct awakening being reborn up in heaven or among humans not more than seven times After seven rebirths then theyll reach the limit of suffering My teaching is well expressed revealed and disseminated has nothing pointless and spreads as its proclaimed even up to the heavens Thus is my teaching well expressed revealed and disseminated has nothing pointless and spreads as its proclaimed even up to the heavens If someone is faithful and happy with me then at the end of their life theyll be born in a good place like the others with a remainder The Buddha spoke thus Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Medium Discourses  Worldly Merit Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to Kauśāmbī and stayed at Ghoṣilas Park At the time the Venerable Mahācunda rose from his seat of repose late in the afternoon and went to visit the Buddha When he arrived he paid homage and withdrew to sit at one side He said Bhagavān is it possible to define worldly merit The Bhagavān told him Its possible Cunda There are seven worldly merits that obtain great fortune rewards renown and virtue What are the seven Cunda there are faithful clansmen and clanswomen who give living quarters and meeting halls to an assembly of monks This Cunda is the first worldly merit that obtains great fortune rewards renown and virtue Furthermore Cunda there are faithful clansmen and clanswomen who go into the monks living quarters and give them seats carpets blankets mattresses and bedding This Cunda is the second worldly merit that obtains great fortune rewards renown and virtue Furthermore Cunda there are faithful clansmen and clanswomen who go into their living quarters and give them all new clean and marvelous clothing This Cunda is the third worldly merit that obtains great fortune rewards renown and virtue Furthermore Cunda there are faithful clansmen and clanswomen who go into their living quarters and give the community the morning rice gruel and midday meals They also tell their servants to serve the monastery and give additional offerings to the monastery during rain and snowstorms After they eat the assembly of monks then isnt troubled by the bad weather making their robes wet Instead they meditate and contemplate day and night in comfort This Cunda is the seventh worldly merit that obtains great fortune rewards renown and virtue Cunda these seven worldly merits will always produce fortune for those faithful clansmen and clanswomen that becomes greater and broader whether during the past or future while standing or sitting while asleep or awake or during day or night Cunda its like the Gaṅgā River which flows from its source to the ocean and becomes deeper and wider as it goes Thus Cunda are these seven worldly merits obtained by faithful clansmen and clanswomen They will always produce fortune that becomes greater and broader whether during the past or future while standing or sitting while asleep or awake or during day or night Venerable Mahācunda then rose from his seat bared his right shoulder knelt on his right knee and saluted with his palms together He said Bhagavān would it be possible to define merits that transcend the world The Bhagavān told him Its possible Cunda There are another seven merits that transcend the world and obtain great fortune rewards renown and virtue What are the seven Cunda there are faithful clansmen and clanswomen who hear that the Tathāgata or one of his disciples have traveled to certain place They rejoice when they hear that celebrating in their hearts Cunda this is the first merit that transcends the world and obtains great fortune rewards renown and virtue Furthermore Cunda there are faithful clansmen and clanswomen who hear that the Tathāgata or one of his disciples are about to come from that place to their own location They rejoice when they hear that celebrating in their hearts Cunda this is the second merit that transcends the world and obtains great fortune rewards renown and virtue Furthermore Cunda there are faithful clansmen and clanswomen who hear that the Tathāgata or one of his disciples has arrived They rejoice when hear that celebrating in their hearts They go personally to see them with a pure heart to pay their respects and make offerings Once they had made their offerings they take refuge three times in the Buddha Dharma and Saṅgha of monks and accept the lay precepts Cunda this is the seventh merit that transcends the world and obtains great fortune rewards renown and virtue Cunda if faithful clansmen and clanswomen were to attain these seven worldly merits and these other seven merits that transcend the world their fortune would be incalculable Their merits the results of their merits and the rewards of their merits simply cannot be delimited or measured and the number of those great merits cannot be determined Cunda its like the five rivers of Jambudvīpa  the Gaṅgā  Yamunā  Sarabhū  Ajiravatī and  Mahī They flow down into the ocean and their water is incalculable Their volume simply cannot be delimited or measured and the amount of water cannot be determined Thus Cunda if faithful clansmen and clanswomen attain these seven worldly merits and these other seven merits that transcend the world their fortune would be incalculable Their merits the results of their merits and the rewards of their merits simply cannot be delimited or measured and the number of those great merits cannot be determined At that point the Bhagavān spoke in verse The Gaṅgā River Is pure and easy to cross The ocean with its many treasures Is the king of myriad rivers Just like a river A person pays respect to it All the streams take refuge By flowing into the ocean Thus is a person who Gives clothes food and drink Beds sofas and mats And things for sitting Measureless rewards of merit Lead them to a marvelous place Theyre like those rivers Flowing into the ocean Thus did the Buddha speak The Venerable Mahācunda and the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Teaching Disillusionment Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Form is impermanent Whats impermanent is painful whats painful is not self and whats not self doesnt belong to self either Such an observation is called a true and correct observation Thus feeling  perception  volition  consciousness is impermanent Whats impermanent is painful whats painful is not self and whats not self doesnt belong to self either Such an observation is called a true and correct observation Noble disciples thus observe and become disillusioned with form They become disillusioned with sensation  perception  volition  consciousness Because theyre disillusioned they dont enjoy it Because they dont enjoy it they attain liberation For someone whos liberated this true knowledge arises My births have been ended the religious practice has been established and the task has been accomplished I myself know that I wont be subject to a later existence When the monks who heard what the Buddha taught they rejoiced and approved Medium Discourses

the seven places to which a good person goes and nirvāṇa without remainder and so I have explained it Thus did Buddha speak Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Thus have I heard One time the Buddha stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks What is it that exists that arises that ties thats an attachment and thats viewed as self and causes sentient beings to create such views and such statements Theres no generosity no congregation no teaching and no results of good or bad destinies from actions Theres no present world or other world no mother or father and no sentient beings There are no arhats in the world who rightly arrive at the right destination or who themselves see the Dharma and know theyve realized it fully whether its in the present or another world My births have ended the religious practice has been established the task has been accomplished and I  know I wont be subject to a later existence The monks said to the Buddha The Bhagavān is the Dharma root the Dharma eye and the Dharma refuge  Its thus explained in detail and in the sequence of the three sutras  above Related Discourses   Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī Like  above except for this Suppose a monk cultivates the seven factors of awakening After often cultivating them hell attain seven fruits What are the seven This refers to nirvāṇa with remainder when he attains knowledge in the present life and nirvāṇa at his lifes end when he doesnt attain knowledge in the present life If that isnt the case hell end the five lower bonds and attain parinirvāṇa in the interim If thats not the case then hell attain parinirvāṇa at birth If thats not the case hell attain parinirvāṇa without practice If thats not the case hell attain parinirvāṇa with practice If thats not the case hell attain parinirvāṇa upstream After the Buddha taught this sutra the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and handed it down Medium Discourses  The Abodes of Mindfulness Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to Kuru and stayed at the Kuru town of Karmasadharma It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Theres one path that purifies sentient beings It frees them from sorrow and fear ceases suffering and vexation ends lamentation and attains the right Dharma Its called the four abodes of mindfulness If there were Tathāgatas Arhats and Fully Awakened Ones in the past they all ended the five hindrances that defile the mind and weaken wisdom established their minds in the four abodes of mindfulness and cultivated the seven factors of awakening They then attained the awakening that is the unsurpassed correct and full awakening If there will be Tathāgatas Arhats and Fully Awakened Ones in the future they all will end the five hindrances that defile the mind and weaken wisdom establish their minds

the bank of the Vaggumudā River in a cedar forest It was then that the Venerable nanda was alone in a quiet place reflecting and meditating He had this thought Could it be that theres one thing that when cultivated and cultivated often will cause the fulfillment of four things that will fulfill seven things after it fulfills those four things and that will fulfill two things after it fulfills those seven things Venerable nanda then roused from his meditation and went to the Buddha He bowed his head at his feet withdrew to sit at one side and said to the Buddha Bhagavān I was alone in a quiet place reflecting and meditating I had this thought Could it be that theres one thing that when cultivated and cultivated often will cause the fulfillment of four things  and that will fulfill two things Now Id like to ask the Bhagavān is there one thing when cultivated often can cause  the fulfillment of two things The Buddha told nanda There is one thing that when cultivated often  can cause the fulfillment of two things Whats that one thing Its mindfulness of breathing When its cultivated often it can cause the fulfillment of the four abodes of mindfulness After fulfilling the four abodes of mindfulness the seven factors of awakening are fulfilled After fulfilling the seven factors of awakening insight and liberation are fulfilled How does cultivating mindfulness of breathing fulfill the four abodes of mindfulness Suppose a monk depends on a village  mindfully trains according to cessation as he exhales nanda when hes mindful of inhaling the noble disciple mindfully trains as he inhales When hes mindful of exhaling he mindfully trains as he exhales Whether its long or short he perceives his whole bodys activity When hes mindful of inhaling he mindfully trains as he inhales When hes mindful of exhaling he mindfully trains as he exhales When hes mindful of his bodys activity calming as he inhales he mindfully trains while the bodys activity calms as he inhales When hes mindful of his bodys activity calming as he exhales he mindfully trains while his bodys activity calms as he exhales At that point the noble disciple is mindfully abiding in contemplation of body as body Whatever body it is he also thus reflects according to that body If there are times the noble disciple perceives joy  perceives happiness  perceives his minds activity  perceives his minds activity calming then when hes mindful of inhaling he mindfully trains while his mental activity calms as he inhales When hes mindful of his minds activity calming as he exhales he mindfully trains while his minds activity calms as he exhales At that point the noble disciple is mindfully abiding in contemplation of feeling as feeling Whatever feeling it is he also reflects according to that feeling If there are times the noble disciple perceives his mind and perceives his minds gladness  minds concentration  minds liberation then when hes mindful of inhaling he mindfully trains as he inhales When hes mindful of his minds liberation as he exhales he mindfully trains in the minds liberation as he exhales At that point the noble disciple is mindfully abiding in contemplation of mind as mind Whatever mind it is he also reflects on it according to that mind If there are times when the noble disciple observes impermanence  ending  the lack of desire  cessation then he trains in the observation of impermanence  ending  the lack of desire  cessation At that point the noble disciple is mindfully abiding in contemplation of principle as principle Whatever principle it is he also reflects on it according to that principle This is called cultivating mindfulness of breathing and fulfilling the four abodes of mindfulness nanda said to the Buddha Thus does mindfulness of breathing cause the fulfillment of the four abodes of mindfulness How does cultivating the four abodes of mindfulness cause the fulfillment of the seven factors of awakening The Buddha told nanda Suppose a monk mindfully abides in contemplation of body as body After mindfully abiding he fixes his attention and doesnt lose it At that point this is the method of cultivating the awakening factor of mindfulness After cultivating the awakening factor of mindfulness he fulfills the awakening factor of mindfulness After fulfilling the awakening factor of mindfulness he discriminates and deliberates on qualities

for right awakening and will experience at most seven existences After seven rebirths up in heaven or among humans hell reach the limit of suffering This is the ninth virtue of someone who thus cultivates mindfulness of body and thus disseminates it Furthermore once he ends the three bonds and lust hate and delusion are weakened that monk attains one rebirth up in heaven or among humans After one rebirth he will then reach the limit of suffering This is the tenth virtue of someone who thus cultivates mindfulness of body and thus disseminates it Furthermore that monk ends the five lower bonds Hell be born elsewhere and then enter parinirvāṇa He attains irreversibility and doesnt return to this world This is the eleventh virtue of someone who thus cultivates mindfulness of body and thus disseminates it Furthermore if he has calm liberation that monk parts with form and attains formlessness According to that manner of concentration he personally accomplishes its realization He observes and knows the contaminants and ends the contaminants with wisdom This is the twelfth virtue of someone who thus cultivates mindfulness of body and thus disseminates it Furthermore that monk attains supernormal abilities  the divine ear  knowledge of other minds  knowledge of past lives  knowledge of birthanddeath  has ended the contaminants Attaining the absence of contaminants his mind is liberated and his wisdom is liberated In the present life he knows and recognizes for himself the accomplishment of selfrealization Birth has been ended the religious practice has been established and the task has been accomplished He is no longer subject to existence and knows is as it really is This should be known as the thirteenth  eighteenth virtue of someone who thus cultivates mindfulness of body and thus disseminates it These should be known as the eighteen virtues of someone who thus cultivates mindfulness of body and thus disseminates it The Buddha spoke thus Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and handed it down Related Discourses   Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks If a monk observes precepts and cultivates virtue conscience and modesty hell achieve the true teaching Seeing this person will often be fruitful If hes also heard followed in memory and followed into homelessness it will often bring virtue Its even more so to associate with honor and serve him Why is that Associating with and serving such a person a monk can hear the profound and subtle Dharma from time to time After hearing the profound Dharma hell achieve the two ways of being correct correctness of body and correctness of mind Hell skillfully cultivate the awakening factor of concentration After cultivating it hell cultivate its fulfillment  hell cultivate the fulfillment of the awakening factor of equanimity After the Buddha taught this sutra the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and handed it down Related Discourses   Thus have I heard One time the Buddha stayed at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Cultivate mindfulness of breathing If a monk cultivates the mindfulness of breathing and cultivates it often hell attain calmness of body and mind Hell cultivate and fulfill tranquility purity and the perceptions of insight with perception and contemplation How does he attain calmness of body and mind and fulfill tranquility purity and the perceptions of insight with perception and contemplation after often cultivating mindfulness of breathing Suppose this monk lives depending on a village or town In the early morning he puts on his robe and takes his bowl into the village to solicit alms He protects himself well guards his faculties and keeps his mind well restrained After soliciting alms he returns to his dwelling and puts away his robe and bowl After washing his feet he either goes to sit under a tree or in a dwelling in a forest or on bare ground out in the open He sits correctly with his body upright and fixes his attention in front of him He stops worldly cravings and secludes himself from desire purely He stops anger  drowsiness  agitation and remorse  doubt Freed from doubt and confusion he attains certainty about the minds good qualities Hes secluded from the five hindrances and disturbances in his mind that weaken the powers of wisdom block discernment and lead not to nirvāṇa Hes mindful of internal calming training well and fixing his attention Hes mindful of external calming training well and fixing his attention His breaths are long  his breaths are short  He perceives his whole body as he inhales He trains well regarding the whole body as he inhales He perceives his whole body as he exhales He trains well regarding the whole body as he exhales He perceives his whole bodys activity calming as he inhales He

exhales He trains well regarding the observation of cessation as he exhales This is called cultivating the mindfulness of breathing The body is calmed and the mind is calmed Tranquility purity and the perceptions of insight are cultivated and fulfilled with perception and contemplation After the Buddha taught this sūtra the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Not Knowing  Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks When you dont know or understand form and dont become free of desire for it the mind isnt liberated When the mind isnt liberated its not possible to stop suffering Thus when you dont know or understand feeling  perception  volition  consciousness and dont become free of desire for it the mind isnt liberated and its not possible to stop suffering Monks if you know and understand form and become free of desire for it the mind is liberated and its possible to stop suffering Thus if you know and understand feeling  perception  volition  consciousness and become free of desire for it the mind is liberated and its possible to stop suffering When the monks heard what the Buddha taught they rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Thus have I heard One time the Buddha stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks What is it that exists that arises that ties thats an attachment and thats viewed as self and causes sentient beings to create such views and such statements Theres no power no effort and no power and effort There are no men who are skillful no men who are diligent and no men who are skillful and diligent Theres nothing selfmade nothing made by others and nothing made by self and others All people all sentient beings and all spirits lack skill lack power lack force lack effort and lack capability Their certain lot is continuity change and the experience of the six destinies of pleasure and pain The monks said to the Buddha The Bhagavān is the Dharma root the Dharma eye and the Dharma refuge  Its thus explained in detail and in the sequence of the three sutras  above Related Discourses   Sixteen Who Were Liberated Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at the Umbrella Mango Tree Park on the bank of the Bhadra River in Mathurā It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Stand on your own island and on your own support Stand on the island of the teaching and the support of the teaching not on another island or another support Monks you should correctly examine this while standing on your own island and on your own support Stand on the island of the teaching and the support of the teaching not on another island or another support What cause gives rise to grief sorrow vexation and suffering How do they exist What do they cause Why are they attachments How do you yourself examine the arising of grief sorrow vexation and suffering that have yet to arise and the growth of grief sorrow vexation and suffering that have already arisen The monks said to the Buddha The Bhagavān is the Dharma root the Dharma eye and the Dharma support Please explain this After listening the monks will approve of whats said The Buddha told the monks Listen closely and well consider it I will explain it for you Monks there is form They cause form and they are tied to form when one examines for themselves the arising of grief sorrow vexation and suffering that have yet to arise and the growth of grief sorrow vexation and suffering that have already arisen Feelings perceptions volitions and consciousness are likewise Monks could it be that form is permanent eternal unchanging and a correct abode They replied No Bhagavān The Buddha told the monks Good monks Good Form is impermanent Suppose good sons know that form is impermanent painful and changing Parting with desire for it form ceases becomes tranquil and disappears After knowing that all forms have been impermanent painful and liable to change since the distant past those good sons will then stop form when its  the cause and condition giving rise to grief sorrow vexation and suffering Having stopped it theyll attach to nothing Being detached theyll live in wellbeing Once they live in wellbeing thats called nirvāṇa Feelings perceptions volitions and consciousness are likewise When the Buddha spoke this sūtra the contaminants didnt arise in  monks and their minds were liberated After the Buddha had spoken this sūtra the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Bamboo grove Vaiśālī Purity correct examination Impermanent painful not self Five three and sixteen Related Discourses   Three Gentlemen Thus have I heard One time the Buddha was staying at the Bamboo Park Monastery in Cedi At the time there were three upright gentlemen who had left home not long before They were Venerable Aniruddha Venerable Nandika and Venerable Kimbila Knowing what they were thinking in their minds the Bhagavān then instructed them Monks this is mind this is reasoning this is consciousness This should be contemplated Dont contemplate that Stopping this desire and stopping this form a person fully abides in realization Monks could there be form thats permanent unchanging and a correct abode The monks said to the Buddha No Bhagavān The Buddha told the monks Good good Form is impermanent and liable to change Tiring of and parting with desire for form it ceases become tranquil and disappears Thus since the distant past all forms have been impermanent painful and liable to change Known in this way the conditioning of those forms produces the contaminants which are harmful burning and grievous Destroy them all Once they are destroyed theres no attachment Once theres no attachment youll live in wellbeing Once you live in wellbeing youll attain parinirvāṇa Feelings perceptions volitions and consciousness are likewise When the Buddha spoke this sūtra the contaminants didnt arise in those three upright gentlemen and their minds were liberated After the Buddha spoke this sūtra the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān

time the Buddha traveled to Vaiśālī and stayed at the mango grove there It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks All things that are conditioned are impermanent They are things that dont last that soon change and that are unreliable Such conditioned things must not be objects of attachment or they will torment a person You must seek separation and liberation from them Why is that During times of drought when theres no rain all the trees the hundred grains and medicinal plants wither crumble and disappear They cant always be present therefore all conditioned things are impermanent They are things that dont last that soon change and that are unreliable Such conditioned things must not be objects of attachment or they will torment a person You must seek separation and liberation from them Furthermore theres a time when two suns arise in the world When two suns arise gully streams and rivers all dry up They cant always be present therefore all conditioned things are impermanent They are things that dont last that soon change and that are unreliable Such conditioned things must not be objects of attachment or they will torment a person You must seek separation and liberation from them Furthermore theres a time when three suns arise in the world When three suns arise the large rivers all dry up They cant always be present therefore all conditioned things are impermanent They are things that dont last that soon change and that are unreliable Such conditioned things must not be objects of attachment or they will torment a person You must seek separation and liberation from them Furthermore theres a time when four suns arise in the world When four suns arise the great springs of Jambudvīpa from which five rivers flow all dry up the  Gaṅgā  Yamunā  Sarabhū  Ajiravatī and  Mahī  They cant always be present therefore all conditioned things are impermanent They are things that dont last that soon change and that are unreliable Such conditioned things must not be objects of attachment or they will torment a person You must seek separation and liberation from them Furthermore theres a time when five suns arise in the world When five suns arise the oceans water is reduced by a hundred leagues and in turn is reduced by   leagues When five suns arise the remaining  leagues of water in the ocean is in turn reduced by  a hundred leagues When five suns arise the oceans water is reduced by one palm trees height and in turn is reduced by  seven palm trees When five suns arise the remaining seven palm trees of water in the ocean is in turn reduced to  one palm tree When five suns arise the oceans water is reduced by one fathom and in turn is reduced by  seven fathoms When five suns arise the remaining seven fathoms of water is in turn reduced to  one fathom When five suns arise the oceans water is reduced to neck deep shoulder deep waist deep thigh deep knee deep and ankle deep Theres a time when the oceans water is completely gone and theres not enough to wet a finger therefore all conditioned things are impermanent They are things that dont last that soon change and that are unreliable Such conditioned things must not be objects of attachment or they will torment a person You must seek separation and liberation from them Furthermore theres a time when six suns arise in the world When six suns arise smoke rises from the whole earth and Sumeru the king of mountains It combines into a single cloud of smoke like when a potter first lights his kiln Smoke rises from everything inside it and combines into a single cloud of smoke Thus when six suns rise smoke rises from the whole world and Sumeru the king of mountains and it combines into a single cloud of smoke Therefore all conditioned things are impermanent They are things that dont last that soon change and that are unreliable Such conditioned things must not be objects of attachment or they will torment a person You must seek separation and liberation from them Furthermore theres a time when seven suns arise in the world When seven suns arise the whole world and Sumeru the king of mountains are engulfed in flames and it combines into a single conflagration Thus when seven suns arise the whole world and Sumeru the king of mountains are engulfed in flames and it combines into a single conflagration a wind blows that conflagration up to the Brahma heavens The bhāsvara gods who are first born in that heaven havent heard of the worlds formation and demise havent seen its formation and demise and dont know about its formation and demise When they see that great fire their hair stands on end in terror and they think That fire wont reach us will it That fire wont reach us will it The gods who had been born there previously had heard about the worlds formation and demise had seen its formation and demise and knew about its formation and demise When they see that great fire they reassure those gods Dont be afraid Fire as a rule is limited to the desire realm it never reaches us here When seven suns arise a hundred leagues of Mount Sumeru crumbles and disintegrates completely Two hundred three hundred  seven hundred leagues of it crumbles and disintegrates completely When seven suns arise Mount Sumeru and this earth are engulfed in flames and burn up without remainder like burning ghee down to nothing with neither smoke nor ash remaining Thus when seven suns arise Mount Sumeru and this earth burn up without remainder therefore all conditioned things are impermanent They are things that dont last that soon change and that are unreliable Such conditioned things must not be objects of attachment or they will torment a person You must seek separation and liberation from them Now Ive described for you how Mount Sumeru will crumble and disintegrate but who is there whod believe it Only those who see truly Now Ive described for you how the ocean water will dry up completely but who is there whod believe it Only those who see truly Now Ive described for you how the whole earth will be burned up but who is there whod believe it Only those who see truly Why is that Monks there once was a great teacher named Sunetra who taught in a tradition of sages from another religion He abandoned craving and attained the miraculous abilities That great teacher Sunetra had measureless hundreds of thousands of disciples When he taught them the way of the Brahma world if his disciples didnt completely approve of his teaching then they were sometimes born in the Heaven of the Four Kings the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven the Yama Heaven the Tuṣita Heaven the Nirmāṇarati Heaven or the Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven when their lives ended If his disciples did completely approve of his teaching of the way of the Brahma world they cultivated the four abodes of Brahmā abandoned their desires and were born in the Brahma Heaven when their lives ended At the time that teacher Sunetra thought Shouldnt I and my disciples be born in the same place in a later life Now Id better cultivate increasing kindness After cultivating increasing kindness Ill be born among the bhāsvara gods Sunetra then cultivated increasing kindness After cultivating it he was born among the bhāsvara gods when his life ended That path of training of Sunetra and his disciples wasnt in vain They did attain a great result from it Monks what you do think Would you say that great teacher Sunetra was someone else who was a teacher in a tradition of sages from another religion who abandoned craving and attained miraculous abilities Dont think that for you should know that he was me At the time I was that great teacher named Sunetra a teacher from a tradition of sages from another religion who abandoned craving and attained miraculous abilities At the time I had measureless hundreds of thousands of disciples When I taught them the way of the Brahma world if my disciples didnt completely approve of my teaching then they were sometimes born in the Heaven of the Four Kings the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven the Yama Heaven the Tuṣita Heaven the Nirmāṇarati Heaven or the Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven when their lives ended If my disciples did completely approve of my teaching of the way of the Brahma world they cultivated the four abodes of Brahma abandoned their desires and were born in the Brahma Heaven when their lives ended At the time I thought Shouldnt I and my disciples be born in the same place in a later life Now Id better cultivate increasing kindness After cultivating increasing kindness Ill be born among the bhāsvara gods I then cultivated increasing kindness After cultivating it I was born among the bhāsvara gods when my life ended That path of training of mine and my disciples wasnt in vain We did attain a great result from it At the time I and my friends practiced this path by which we benefited ourselves benefited others benefited many people pitied the world sought both meaning and benefit for gods and humans and sought peace and happiness At the time I explained a teaching that didnt reach the ultimate wasnt ultimately clean wasnt ultimately the religious practice and wasnt ultimately the completion of the religious life At the time I didnt part with birth old age illness death lamentation and sorrow nor was I freed from all suffering yet Monks now I have arisen in the world as a Tathāgata Arhat and Completely Awakened One Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct Well Gone Understander of the World Trainer in the Way and Teaching Teacher of Gods and People and Im called a Buddha and a Bhagavān Now I benefit myself benefit others benefit many people pity the world seek both meaning and benefit for gods and humans and seek peace and happiness Now I explain a teaching that reaches the ultimate thats ultimately clean thats ultimately the religious practice and thats ultimately the completion of the religious life Now Ive parted with birth old age illness death lamentation and sorrow and Ive been freed from all suffering  Thus did Buddha speak Those monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and approved Related Discourses   Thus I have heard One time the Buddha stayed at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove of rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Theres wrong and theres right Listen closely and well consider it I will explain this for you Whats wrong This refers to wrong view  wrong concentration Whats right This refers to right view  right concentration Whats right view Its refers to the teaching that theres generosity theres the teaching there are observances theres good conduct and bad conduct and there are the results of good and bad conduct Theres this world and theres the other world Theres father and mother and the birth of sentient beings There are arhats who well arrive are wellheaded and know and realize for themselves the perfect abode whether its in this or the other world Whats right intention Its intent of renunciation intent without anger and intent thats not harmful Whats right speech Its being free of false speech free of duplicity free of harsh words and free of fancy speech Whats right action Its being free of killing stealing and sexual misconduct Whats right livelihood Its pursuing clothing food and drink bedding and medicine in ways that are according to the teaching and not contrary to the teaching Whats right method Its desire effort method setting out striving and the capability to work constantly and not retreat Whats right mindfulness Its mindfully following and remembering thats not false or pointless Whats right concentration Its abiding with mind unconfused resolute collected tranquil concentrated and singleminded After the Buddha taught this sūtra the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and approved Medium Discourses  Discernment of the Noble Truths Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to the country of rāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks This is the correct practice of teaching Dharma which is to gather in detail contemplate in detail discern disclose reveal define make known and direct others to the four noble truths Tathāgatas Arhats and Fully Awakened Ones of the past also had this correct practice of teaching Dharma which was to gather in detail contemplate in detail discern disclose reveal define make known and direct others to the four noble truths Tathāgatas Arhats and Fully Awakened Ones of the future also will have this correct practice of teaching Dharma which will be to gather in detail contemplate in detail discern disclose reveal define make known and direct others to the four noble truths I am the Tathāgata Arhat and Fully Awakened One of the present who also has this correct practice of teaching Dharma which is to gather in detail contemplate in detail discern disclose reveal define make known and direct others to the four noble truths The monk āriputras wisdom is clever quick fast sharp detailed profound essential insightful and eloquent The monk āriputra has accomplished real wisdom Why is that When I taught these four noble truths in brief the monk āriputra then could teach them in detail for others contemplate them in detail discern disclose reveal define make known and direct others to them When he teaches and shows in detail discerns discloses reveals defines makes known and directs others to these four noble truths the monk āriputra causes measureless people to attain their contemplation The monk āriputra can make right view be his guide The monk Maudgalyāyana can lead others to stand at the supreme limit of reality which is the ultimate end of the contaminants The monk āriputra gives birth to religious practitioners like a birthing mother and the monk Maudgalyāyana nurtures religious practitioners like a nursing mother Religious practitioners therefore should serve support respect and venerate the monks āriputra and Maudgalyāyana Why is that The monks āriputra and Maudgalyāyana seek whats purposeful and beneficial for religious practitioners They seek their welfare and happiness After speaking thus the Bhagavān rose from his seat and retired to sit in his dwelling Thereupon Venerable āriputra addressed the monks Good men the Bhagavān appeared in the world for us That is it was to teach and show in detail these four noble truths for others and to discern disclose reveal define make known and direct others to them What are the four They are the noble truth of suffering and the noble truths of sufferings accumulation sufferings cessation and the path to sufferings cessation Good men what is the noble truth of suffering Its the suffering of birth the suffering of old age the suffering of illness the suffering of death the suffering of association with whats disliked the suffering of separation from whats loved the suffering of not getting whats sought and the basic suffering of the five proliferating aggregates Good men we say suffering of birth What is the reason we say that Good men birth is when some sentient being of a certain type of sentient beings that are born is born that are produced is produced and that form is formed It generates the five aggregates Once the life root is obtained this is called birth Good men suffering of birth means that when sentient beings are born the body experiences painful feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The mind experiences painful feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body and mind experience painful feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body has feverish feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive

feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body and mind have intensely feverish afflicted and grievous feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions Good men we say suffering of birth This is the reason we say that Good men we say suffering of old age What is the reason we say that Good men old age means some sentient being of a certain type of sentient beings becomes elderly Their heads are white their teeth fall out and theyre withered Their bodies are bent and their legs are crooked Their bodies are heavy and it takes effort to get up They use the support of a staff to walk Their muscles shrink and their skin is loose and wrinkled like sesame seed Their faculties are completely degenerated and their appearance is ugly This is called old age Good men suffering of old age means that when sentient beings are old the body experiences painful feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The mind experiences painful feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body and mind experience painful feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body has feverish feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The mind has feverish feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body and mind have feverish feelings pervasive

afflicted and grievous feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body and mind have intensely feverish afflicted and grievous feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and

earaches nose pain facial pain lip pain toothaches tongue pain palate pain throat pain difficult breathing coughing burping laryngitis convulsions goiter red gall high fevers dehydration hemorrhoids and dysentery There are a variety of comparable types of illnesses that arise from contact dont part from the mind and establish themselves in the body This is called illness Good men suffering of

grievous feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body and mind have intensely feverish afflicted and grievous feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions Good men we say suffering of illness This is the reason we say that Good men we say suffering of death What is the reason we say that Good men death means some sentient being of a certain type of sentient beings has its life end and is impermanent Their dead corpse scatters and disappears When their life span is up they are destroyed and their life root is shut off This is called death Good men suffering of death means that when sentient beings die the body experiences painful feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The mind experiences painful feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body and mind experience painful feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body has feverish feelings pervasive

and grievous feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions The body and mind have intensely feverish afflicted and grievous feelings pervasive feelings perceptions and pervasive perceptions Good men we say suffering of death This is the reason we say that Good men we say suffering of association with whats disliked What is the reason we say that Good men association with

Related Discourses   Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Its good monks to rely on someone to hear the Dharma Junior monks are to support and serve the venerable elders Why is that From time to time junior monks who support and serve elder monks can hear the profound and subtle Dharma After hearing the profound Dharma theyll achieve two ways of being correct Correctness of body and correctness of mind At that point theyll cultivate the awakening factor of mindfulness After cultivating the awakening factor of mindfulness theyll fulfill the awakening factor of mindfulness After fulfilling the awakening factor of mindfulness theyll discriminate qualities discern qualities and deliberate on qualities At that point theyll skillfully cultivate the awakening factor of discriminating qualities  theyll cultivate the fulfillment of the awakening factor of equanimity After the Buddha taught this sutra the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and handed it down Related Discourses   Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in rāvastī It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks Theres whats called the factors of awakening What are the factors of awakening The monks said to the Buddha The Bhagavān is the Dharma root the Dharma eye and the Dharma refuge Please explain it for us After we hear it the monks will accept it and hand it down The Buddha addressed the monks The seven factors of awakening are seven factors of the path Monks these seven factors of awakening are gradually produced in sequence After they are gradually produced in sequence their fulfillment is cultivated The monks said to the Buddha What are the seven factors of awakening that are gradually produced in sequence and fulfilled after they are gradually produced in sequence Suppose a monk abides mindfully contemplating body as body After he abides mindfully contemplating body as body he focuses his mind ties it to mindfulness and doesnt forget it At that point hes skillfully cultivating the awakening factor of mindfulness After skillfully cultivating the awakening factor of mindfulness he cultivates its fulfillment After cultivating the awakening factor of mindfulness he discriminates qualities At that point hes cultivating skill in the awakening factor of discriminating qualities After cultivating the awakening factor of discriminating qualities skillfully he cultivates its fulfillment So it is with the awakening factors of effort joy calm concentration and equanimity They are likewise explained Like the internal body thus are the external body internal and external body feelings mind and principles explained He abides mindfully contemplating principles as principles He focuses his mind ties it to mindfulness and doesnt forget it At that point hes skillfully cultivating the awakening factor of mindfulness After skillfully cultivating the awakening factor of mindfulness he cultivates its fulfillment up to the awakening factor of equanimity which is likewise explained This is called a monk who gradually produces the seven factors of awakening in sequence After they are gradually produced in sequence he cultivates their fulfillment After the Buddha taught this sutra that certain monk who heard what he taught rejoiced and handed it down Medium Discourses  Seven Chariots  Thus I have heard One time the Buddha traveled to the city Rājagṛha and stayed at the Veḷuvana monastery He was accompanied by a large assembly of monks who had spent the summer retreat there Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra had spent his summer retreat in the Buddhas native land It was then that some native land monks had finished their summer retreat after three months had passed When they had finished mending robes they gathered up their robes and bowls and left the native land and headed for Rājagṛha They took a circuitous route to Rājagṛha and stayed at the Veḷuvana monastery Those native land monks then went to the Bhagavān paid homage by prostrating themselves and withdrew to sit at one side The Bhagavān asked them Monks where have you come from Where was your summer retreat The native land monks replied Bhagavān weve come from the native land We spent the summer retreat in the native land The Bhagavān asked them Among those monks of the native land which monk is praised by the others as having few desires and being satisfied and who praises having few desires and being satisfied Who himself lives quietly and praises quiet living Who himself makes effort and praises making effort Who himself is rightly mindful and praises right mindfulness Who himself is unified in mind and praises being unified in mind Who himself is wise and praises wisdom Who himself has ended the contaminants and praises ending the contaminants Who encourages rouses and makes others rejoice and praises encouraging rousing and making others rejoice The native land monks said Bhagavān the Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra is the monk in the native land who is praised by the other monks as having few desires and being satisfied and who praises having few desires and being satisfied He himself lives quietly and praises quiet living He himself makes effort and praises making effort He himself is rightly mindful and praises right mindfulness He himself is unified in mind and praises being unified in mind He himself is wise and praises wisdom He himself has ended the contaminants and praises ending the contaminants He encourages rouses and makes others rejoice and praises encouraging rousing and making others rejoice Venerable āriputra was sitting in the assembly at the time and he had this thought The Bhagavān asked this group of native land monks about this matter and the native land monks gave their greatest praise to the good man Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra as having few desires and being satisfied and who praises having few desires and being satisfied He himself lives quietly and praises quiet living He himself makes effort and praises making effort He himself is rightly mindful and praises right mindfulness He himself is unified in mind and praises being unified in mind He himself is wise and praises wisdom He himself has ended the contaminants and praises ending the contaminants He encourages rouses and makes others rejoice and praises encouraging rousing and making others rejoice Venerable āriputra then had another thought When will I be in the same congregation as that good man Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra Maybe hell ask about a little doctrine or he might agree to listen to my questions The Bhagavān finished the summer retreat in Rājagṛha after three months had passed After they had finished mending robes he gathered his robe and bowl and left Rājagṛha headed for the country of rāvastī He took a circuitous route to rāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove Venerable āriputra and the native land monks stayed in Rājagṛha for a few more days then they gathered their robes and bowls and headed for rāvastī They took a circuitous route to rāvastī and stayed together at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra finished his summer retreat in the native land after three months had passed After they had finished mending robes he gathered his robe and bowl and left the native land headed for rāvastī He took a circuitous route to rāvastī and also stayed at Anāthapiṇḍadas Park in Jetas Grove Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra went to the Bhagavān paid homage by prostrating himself spread out his sitting mat and sat down crosslegged Venerable āriputra then asked the other monks Good men is that the good man Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra The monks told Venerable āriputra Yes the venerable is sitting there in front of the Tathāgata The fairskinned one with a protruding nose like a parrots beak thats him Venerable āriputra then knew Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputras appearance and remembered it well After the night passed Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra gathered his robe and bowl at sunrise and went into rāvastī to solicit alms After he finished his meal he returned put away his robe and bowl and washed his hands and feet Putting his sitting mat over his shoulder he went to the charnel ground to find a place to practice After the night passed Venerable āriputra also gathered his robe and bowl at sunrise and entered rāvastī to solicit alms After he finished his meal he returned put away his robe and bowl and washed his hands and feet Putting his sitting mat over his shoulder he went to the charnel ground to find a place to practice Upon arriving at the charnel ground Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra spread his sitting mat under a tree and sat down crosslegged Venerable āriputra also reached the charnel ground spread his sitting mat under a tree not far from Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra and sat down crosslegged In the afternoon Venerable āriputra rose from his quiet repose and went over to Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra exchanged greetings with him and withdrew to sit at one side He then asked Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra Good man are you cultivating the religious practice of the ascetic Gautama He replied So it is Why good man Are you cultivating the religious practice of the ascetic Gautama because the precepts are purified by it He replied No Are you cultivating the religious practice of the ascetic Gautama because the mind is purified  views are purified  the hindrance of doubt is purified  knowing and seeing what is and isnt the path is purified  knowing and seeing the steps of the path is purified  knowledge of the paths steps to ending suffering is purified He replied No Again āriputra asked Ive put the question to you Good man are you cultivating the religious practice of the ascetic Gautama and you said So it is Then I asked Good man are you cultivating the religious practice of the ascetic Gautama because the precepts are purified and you said No  Are you cultivating the religious practice of the ascetic Gautama because the mind is purified  views are purified  the hindrance of doubt is purified  knowing and seeing what is and isnt the path is purified  knowing and seeing the steps of the path is purified  knowledge of the paths steps to ending suffering is purified and you said No What then is the purpose of cultivating the religious practice of the ascetic Gautama He replied Good man its because of nirvāṇa without remainder Again he asked Why good man Does the ascetic Gautama declare that nirvāṇa without remainder because the precepts are purified He replied No Does the ascetic Gautama declare that nirvāṇa without remainder because the mind is purified  views are purified  the hindrance of doubt is purified  knowing and seeing what is and isnt the path is purified  knowing and seeing the steps of the path is purified  knowledge of the paths steps to ending suffering is purifiedHe replied No Again āriputra asked Ive put the question to you sir Does the ascetic Gautama declare that nirvāṇa without remainder because the precepts are purified and you said No  Does the ascetic Gautama declare that nirvāṇa without remainder because the mind is purified  views are purified  the hindrance of doubt is purified  knowing and seeing what is and isnt the path is purified  knowing and seeing the steps of the path is purified  knowledge of the paths steps to ending suffering is purified and you said No Good man what do you mean by what youve said How can I know He answered Good man if the Bhagavān the ascetic Gautama declared that nirvāṇa without remainder because the precepts are purified then he would be saying something with a remainder has no remainder If the Bhagavān the ascetic Gautama declared that nirvāṇa without remainder because the mind is purified  views are purified  the hindrance of doubt is purified  knowing and seeing what is and isnt the path is purified  knowing and seeing the steps of the path is purified  knowledge of the paths steps to ending suffering is purified then he would be saying something with a remainder has no remainder Good man if the Bhagavān declared that nirvāṇa without remainder was to part with these things then ordinary people would enter parinirvāṇa because they part with these things too Good man its simply because the precepts are purified that the mind can be purified  because the mind is purified that views can be purified  because views are purified that the hindrance of doubt can be purified  because the hindrance of doubt is purified that knowing and seeing what is and isnt the path can be purified  because knowing and seeing what is and isnt the path is purified that knowing and seeing the steps of the path can be purified  because knowing and seeing the steps of the path is purified that knowledge of the paths steps to ending suffering can be purified  because knowledge of the paths steps to ending suffering is purified that the Bhagavān the ascetic Gautama declares nirvāṇa without remainder Permit me to continue good man Once the king of Kośala Prasenajit was in rāvastī and had some business in āketa He thought What would be a way to go from rāvastī to āketa in one days travel Again he thought Now for me to go from rāvastī to āketa I would need to place seven chariots between them Seven chariots were then placed between rāvastī and āketa After the seven chariots were arranged he left rāvastī and went to the first chariot He rode the first chariot to the second chariot and dismounted from the first chariot He rode the second chariot to the third chariot and dismounted from the second chariot He rode the third chariot to the fourth chariot and dismounted from the third chariot He rode the fourth chariot to the fifth chariot and dismounted from the fourth chariot He rode the fifth chariot to the sixth chariot and dismounted from the fifth chariot He rode the sixth chariot to the seventh chariot and dismounted from the sixth chariot Riding the seventh chariot he reached āketa in a single day After his business in āketa was done he was surrounded by ministers while sitting in the kings main hall That group of ministers asked Did the god king travel from rāvastī to āketa in a single day The king said So it is Did the god king ride the first chariot from rāvastī to āketa in a single day The king said No Did he ride the second chariot  ride the third chariot  the seventh chariot from rāvastī to āketa The king said No How was it good man Being repeatedly questioned what did the king of Kośala Prasenajit say The king answered that crowd of ministers I was in rāvastī and had some business in āketa I thought Whats a way to travel from rāvastī to āketa in a single day Then I thought Now for me to go from rāvastī to āketa I would need to place seven chariots between them I then had seven chariots placed between rāvastī and āketa After the seven chariots were arranged I left rāvastī and went to the first chariot I rode the first chariot to the second chariot and dismounted from the first chariot I rode the second chariot to the third chariot and dismounted from the second chariot I rode the third chariot to the fourth chariot and dismounted from the third chariot I rode the fourth chariot to the fifth chariot and dismounted from the fourth chariot I rode the fifth chariot to the sixth chariot and dismounted from the fifth chariot I rode the sixth chariot to the seventh chariot and dismounted from the sixth chariot Riding the seventh chariot I reached āketa in a single day Thus good man did the king of Kośala Prasenajit answer that crowd of ministers questions Thus good man its because the precepts are purified that the mind can be purified  because the mind is purified that views can be purified  because views are purified that the hindrance of doubt can be purified  because the hindrance of doubt is purified that knowing and seeing what is and isnt the path can be purified  because knowing and seeing what is and isnt the path is purified that knowing and seeing the steps of the path can be purified  because knowing and seeing the steps of the path is purified that knowledge of the paths steps to ending suffering can be purified  because knowledge of the paths steps to ending suffering is purified that the Bhagavān declares nirvāṇa without remainder Venerable āriputra then asked Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra Good man whats your name What do religious practitioners call you good man Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra answered Good man Im called Pūrṇa My mothers name was Maitrāyani so religious practitioners call me Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra Venerable āriputra praised him Good good The good man Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra is a disciple of the Tathāgata whos been made intelligent insightful and discerning by him Hes peaceful fearless accomplished and disciplined He has gained great eloquence attained the banner of immortality and has himself realized the accomplishment of the immortal element Thats because this good man gives complete answers when asked about profound subjects Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra religious practitioners attain great rewards when they meet the Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra go to see him at appropriate times and venerate him at appropriate times Now Ive also attained a great reward from going to see him at an appropriate time and venerating him at an appropriate time Should religious practitioners wrap a cloth around the top of their heads and carry Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra theyd attain great rewards Now Ive also attained a great reward from going to see him at an appropriate time and venerating him at an appropriate time Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra asked Venerable āriputra Good man whats your name What do religious practitioners call you good man Venerable āriputra answered Good man my name is Upatiṣya My mothers name is ārī so religious practitioners call me āriputra Venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra praised him Now I didnt know I was talking to this

see him at an appropriate time and venerating him at an appropriate time Thus did these two good men commend each other After praising each others goodness they rejoiced and approved They then rose from their seats and returned to their lodging Related Discourses   Direct Realization Thus I have heard One time the Buddha was staying in the Kalandakas Bamboo Park of Rājagṛha At the time the Venerable āriputra and Mahākauṣṭhila was present on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa In the afternoon Mahākauṣṭhila got up from meditation and visited āriputra They exchanged greetings and pleasantries and then he sat to one side Mahākauṣṭhila then said to āriputra Sir I would like to ask a question Would you have a moment to answer it āriputra said Sir you may ask Ill answer with that I know Mahākauṣṭhila then asked āriputra If a monk who has yet to attain direct realization wishes to pursue direct realization what method does he pursue What teaching does he contemplate āriputra replied If a monk who has yet to attain direct realization wants to pursue direct realization he diligently contemplates this The five acquired aggregates are like illnesses abscesses thorns and killers They are impermanent painful empty and not self Why is that Because its appropriate for his situation If a monk diligently contemplates these five acquired aggregates hell realize the fruit of stream entry Mahākauṣṭhila also asked āriputra suppose he wants to realize the fruit of oncereturning after realizing the fruit of stream entry What teaching should he contemplate āriputra replied Kauṣṭhila someone who wants to realize the fruit of oncereturning after realizing the fruit of stream entry should also diligently contemplate this The five acquired aggregates are like illnesses abscesses thorns and killers They are impermanent painful empty and not self Why is that Because its appropriate for his situation If a monk diligently contemplates these five acquired aggregates hell realize the fruit of oncereturning Mahākauṣṭhila also asked āriputra Suppose he wants to realize the fruit of nonreturning after realizing the fruit of the oncereturning What teaching should he contemplate āriputra replied Kauṣṭhila someone who wants to realize the fruit of nonreturning after realizing the fruit of oncereturning should also diligently contemplate this The five acquired aggregates are like illnesses abscesses thorns and killers They are impermanent painful empty and not self Why is that Because its appropriate for his situation If a monk diligently contemplates c these five acquired aggregates hell realize the fruit of nonreturning Mahākauṣṭhila also asked āriputra Suppose he wants to realize the fruit of the arhat after realizing the fruit of nonreturning What teaching should he contemplate āriputra replied Kauṣṭhila someone who wants to realize the fruit of the arhat after realizing the fruit of nonreturning should also diligently contemplate this The five acquired aggregates are like illnesses abscesses thorns and killers They are impermanent painful empty and not self Why is that Because its appropriate for his situation If a monk diligently contemplates these five acquired aggregates hell realize the fruit of the arhat Mahākauṣṭhila also asked āriputra After he attains fruit of the arhat then what teaching does he contemplate āriputra replied Mahākauṣṭhila an arhat also contemplates this The five acquired aggregates are illnesses abscesses thorns and killers They are impermanent painful empty and not self Why is that Because he has attained what was yet to be attained realized what was yet to be realized and sees the teachings abode of happiness Those two upright men each heard what was taught rejoiced and departed From the delusion of self and dharmas Comes the conveyence of various manifestations These are supported and transformed by consciousness And there are only three of these which may transform These are retribution thought And the perception of external objectsThe first of these is the Alaya Consciousness Which is retribution as well as all the seeds Its grasping location and knowing are imperceivable And it is always associated with mental contact Attention sensation conception and thought It is associated with neither pleasure nor painIt is undefiled and morally indeterminate Its conveyence is like that of a flowing stream And it is abandoned in the stage of the arhatNext is the second which is able to transform And this consciousness is called Manas It is supported by the previous conveyence And its character and nature are that of thoughtIt is always associated with the four vexations Which are delusion of a self perception of a self Identity with a self and love of a self As well as mental contact and the others It is defiled and morally indeterminate And its location is bound to that of lifeIn the Nirodha Sampatti of the arhats And in the Supramundane Path it does not existNext is the third which is able to transform Which is distinguished into six different divisions Its appearance and nature are perceiving external objects And these may be good bad or indeterminateIt is associated with omnipresent mental activities With the external objects the good the vexations The secondary vexations and the undetermined And it is associated with all three feelingsOmnipresent mental activities are mental contact etc Next are those with objects which are desires Determination mindfulness samdhi wisdom etc And the object of each of these is not the same The good are faith conscience a sense of shame The three roots such as desirelessness etc And also vigor peacefulness vigilance Equanimity and harmlessnessThe vexations are desire hatred Delusion pride doubt and wrong viewsThe secondary vexations are anger Hostility obscuration anger jealousy greed Deceit harmful flattery arrogance Lack of shame lack of conscience Acting upon agitations torpor A lack of faith laziness Negligence as well as forgetfulness Distraction and incorrect knowingThe undetermined are remorse sleep And both types of initial and sustained thoughtWith their basis in the root consciousness The five consciousnesses manifest according to conditions These manifestations may occur together or separately Just as waves are formed upon the waterThe thought consciousness always manifests Except for those born in the heavens of nothought For those in the two samdhis without thought And for those who are drowsy or unconsciousnessThese various consciousnesses are transformed As discrimination and that which is discriminated And with this basis they are all empty Thus they are all Consciousness OnlyThrough the consciousness of all seeds There are suchandsuch transformations And from the power of this conveyence Thisandthat are produced by discriminationDue to the habit energy of various actions Along with the habit energy of dualistic grasping Even when earlier retributions are exhausted Still the renewed arising of retribution occursFrom this and that imagination One imagines all kinds of objects These pervasive imagined objects Are without actual selfnatureFrom the selfnature of interdependence Comes discrimination arising from conditions The perfection of the fruit comes from Always being apart from the former natureTherefore in relation to the interdependent It is neither different nor is it not different Just like the nature of impermanence etc And when one is not perceived the other isOn the basis of the three kinds of selfnature Is established the threefold absence of selfnature Thus the Buddha spoke with the hidden intent That all dharmas are without natureThe first is the naturelessness of characteristics The next is the naturelessness of selfexistence The last is the detachment from the first When the natures of self and dharmas are grasped This is the ultimate truth of all dharmas And it is also the same as True SuchnessBecause its nature is eternally so It is the true nature of Consciousness OnlySo long as one has not given rise to the consciousness Which seeks to abide in the nature of Consciousness Only Then regarding the two types of grasping dispositions He is still not yet able to subdue and extinguish themSetting up and establishing even something small And saying this is the nature of Consciousness Only Because there is still something which is grasped It is not truly abiding in Consciousness OnlyWhen one regards that which is conditioned With the wisdom of total nonappropriation Then at that time one abides in Consciousness Only Apart from the duality of grasping at appearancesWithout grasping and not conceptualizing This is the wisdom of the supramundane realm Which abandons the coarseness of duality And naturally attains transformation of the basisThe Divine Root Conceives and the Spring Breaks Forth As the Hearts Nature Is Cultivated the Great Way Arises Before Chaos was divided Heaven and Earth were one All was a shapeless blur and no men had appearedOnce Pan Gu destroyed the Enormous Vagueness The separation of clear and impure beganLiving things have always tended towards humanity From their creation all beings improveIf you want to know about Creation and Time Read Difficulties Resolved on the Journey to the WestIn the arithmetic of the universe  years make one cycle Each cycle can be divided into twelve phases I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI and XII the twelve branchesEach phase lasts  yearsNow within a single day the positive begins at the time I at II the cock crows at III it is not quite light at IV the sun rises V is after breakfast and at VI one does businessVII is when the sun reaches noon at VIII it is slipping towards the West IX is late afternoon the sun sets at X XI is dusk and at XII people settle down for the nightIf you compare this with the big numbers then at the end of Phase XI Heaven and Earth were still one and no beings had appeared years later came the beginning of Phase XII when all was darkness and there were still no people or other creatures for this reason it was called ChaosAnother  years later Phase XII was drawing to a close and a new cycle was about to begin As Phase I of the new era approached gradually Journey to the West there was lightAs Shao Yong said When winter reaches the midpoint of Phase I The heart of Heaven does not moveWhere the Positive first appears Nothing has yet come to life At this time Heaven first had a foundation years later in the middle of Phase I the light and pure rose upwards and sun moon stars and constellations were createdThese were called the Four ImagesHence the saying that heaven began in IAnother  years later when Phase I was nearing its end and Phase II was imminent things gradually solidified As the Book of Changes says Great is the Positive farreaching is the NegativeAll things are endowed and born in accordance with Heaven This was when the earth began to congealAfter  more years came the height of Phase II when the heavy and impure solidified and water fire mountains stone and Earth came into being These five were called the Five MoversTherefore it is said that the Earth was created in Phase IIAfter a further  years at the end of Phase II and the beginning of the Phase III living beings were createdIn the words of the Book of the Calendar The essence of the sky came down and the essence of earth went upHeaven and Earth intermingled and all creatures were born Then Heaven was bright and Earth was fresh and the Positive intermingled with the Negative years later when Phase III was at its height men birds and beasts were created Thus the Three PowersHeaven Earth and Mannow had their set placesTherefore it is said that man was created in Phase IIIMoved by Pan Gus creation the Three Emperors put the world in order and the Five Rulers laid down the moral code The world was then divided into four great continents The Eastern Continent of Superior Body the Western Continent of Cattlegift the Southern Continent of Jambu and the Northern Continent of KuruThis book deals only with the Eastern Continent of Superior BodyBeyond the seas there is a country called AolaiThis country is next to an ocean and in the middle of the ocean is a famous island called the Mountain of Flowers and FruitThis mountain is the ancestral artery of the Ten Continents the origin of the Three Islands it was formed when the clear and impure were separated and the Enormous Vagueness was divided It is a really splendid mountain and there are some verses to prove itIt stills the ocean with its might It awes the jade sea into calmIt stills the ocean with its might Tides wash its silver slopes and fish swim into its cavesJourney to the West It awes the jade sea into calm Amid the snowy breakers the seaserpent rises from the deepIt rises high in the corner of the world where Fire and Wood meet Its summit towers above the Eastern SeaRed cliffs and strange rocks Beetling crags and jagged peaksOn the red cliffs phoenixes sing in pairs Lone unicorns lie before the beetling cragsThe cry of pheasants is heard upon the peaks In caves the dragons come and goThere are deer of long life and magic foxes in the woods Miraculous birds and black cranes in the treesThere are flowers of jade and strange plants that wither not Green pine and bluish cypress ever in leaf Magic peaches always in fruit Clouds gather round the tall bambooThe wisteria grows thick around the mountain brook And the banks around are newlycoloured with flowersIt is the Heavensupporting pillar where all the rivers meet The Earths root unchanged through a myriad aeonsThere was once a magic stone on the top of this mountain which was thirtysix feet five inches high and twentyfour feet roundIt was thirtysix feet five inches high to correspond with the  degrees of the heavens and twentyfour feet round to match the twentyfour divisions of the solar calendarOn top of it were nine apertures and eight holes for the Nine Palaces and the Eight TrigramsThere were no trees around it to give shade but magic fungus and orchids clung to its sidesEver since Creation began it had been Journey to the West receiving the truth of Heaven the beauty of Earth the essence of the Sun and the splendour of the Moon and as it had been influenced by them for so long it had miraculous powersIt developed a magic womb which burst open one day to produce a stone egg about the size of a ballWhen the wind blew on this egg it turned into a stone monkey complete with the five senses and four limbsWhen the stone monkey had learned to crawl and walk he bowed to each of the four quartersAs his eyes moved two beams of golden light shot towards the Pole Star palace and startled the Supreme Heavenly Sage the Greatly Compassionate Jade Emperor of the Azure Vault of Heaven who was sitting surrounded by his immortal ministers on his throne in the Hall of Miraculous Mist in the Goldengated Cloud Palace When he saw the dazzling golden light he ordered Thousandmile Eye and Windaccompanying Ear to open the Southern Gate of Heaven and take a lookThe two officers went out through the gate in obedience to the imperial command and while one observed what was going on the other listened carefullySoon afterwards they reported back In obedience to the Imperial Mandate your subjects observed and listened to the source of the golden light We found that at the edge of the country of Aolai which is East of the ocean belonging to the Eastern Continent of Superior Body there is an island called the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit A magic stone on the top of this mountain produced a magic egg and when the wind blew on this egg it turned into a stone monkey which bowed to each of the four quartersWhen he moved his eyes golden light shot towards the Pole Star Palace but now that he is eating and drinking the golden light is gradually dying In his benevolence and mercy the Jade Emperor said Creatures down below are born of the essence of heaven and earththere is nothing remarkable about him On his mountain the monkey was soon able to run and jump feed from plants and trees drink from brooks and springs pick mountain flowers and look for fruitHe made friends with the wolves went around with the tigers and leopards was on good terms with the deer and had the other monkeys and apes for relationsAt night he slept under the rockfaces and he roamed around the peaks and caves by dayAs the saying so rightly goes There is no calendar in the mountains and when winters over you dont know the time of year On hot mornings he and all the other monkeys would play under the shade of some pines to avoid the heat Just look at them allClimbing trees picking flowers looking for fruit Throwing pellets playing knucklebones Running round sandy hollows building stone pagodas Chasing dragonflies and catching locusts Worshipping the sky and visiting Bodhisattvas Tearing off creepers and weaving straw hats Catching fleas then popping them with their teeth and fingers Grooming their coats and sharpening their nails Beating scratching pushing squashing tearing and tugging Journey to the West Playing all over the place under the pine trees Washing themselves beside the green streamAfter playing the monkeys would go and bathe in the stream a mountain torrent that tumbled along like rolling melonsThere is an old saying Birds have bird language and animals have animal talk All the monkeys said to each other I wonder where that water comes fromWeve got nothing else to do today so wouldnt it be fun to go upstream and find its source With a shout they all ran off leading their children and calling to their brothers They climbed up the mountain beside the stream until they reached its source where a waterfall cascaded from a springThey saw One white rainbow arching A thousand strands of flying snow Unbroken by the sea winds Still there under the moonCold air divides the greeny crags Splashes moisten the mountainside A noble waterfall cascades Hanging suspended like a curtainThe monkeys clapped their hands and explained with delight What lovely waterIt must go all the way to the bottom of the mountain and join the waves of the sea Then one monkey made a suggestionIf anyone is clever enough to go through the fall find the source and come out in one piece lets make him our king When this challenge had been shouted three times the stone monkey leapt out from the crowd and answered at the top of his voice Ill go Ill go Splendid monkeyIndeed Today he will make his name Tomorrow his destiny shall triumphHe is fated to live here Journey to the West As a King he will enter the Immortals palaceWatch him as he shuts his eyes crouches and springs leaping straight into the waterfall When he opened his eyes and raised his head to look round he saw neither water nor waves A bridge stood in front of him as large as lifeHe stopped calmed himself took a closer look and saw that the bridge was made of ironThe water that rushed under it poured out through a fissure in the rocks screening the gateway to the bridgeHe started walking towards the bridge and as he looked he made out what seemed to be a houseIt was a really good place He saw Emerald moss piled up in heaps of blue White clouds like drifting jade While the light flickered among wisps of coloured mistA quiet house with peaceful windows Flowers growing on the smooth bench Dragon pearls hanging in niches Exotic blooms all aroundTraces of fire beside the stove Scraps of food in the vessels by the tableAdorable stone chairs and beds Even better stone plates and bowlsOne or two tall bamboos Three or four sprigs of plum blossom A few pines that always attract rain All just like a real homeHe took a good long look and then scampered to the middle of the bridge from where he noticed a stone tablet On the tablet had been carved in big square letters HAPPY LAND OF THE MOUNTAIN OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT CAVE HEAVEN OF THE WATER CURTAIN The stone monkey was beside himself with gleeHe rushed away shut his eyes crouched and leapt back through the waterfall Journey to the West Were in luck were in luck he said with a chuckleAll the other monkeys crowded round him asking Whats it like in thereHow deep is the water Theres no water none at all replied the stone monkeyTheres an iron bridge and on the other side of the bridge theres a house that must have been made by Heaven and Earth How ever could you see a house there the other monkeys askedThe stone monkey chuckled again The water here comes under the bridge and through the rocks and it hides the gateway to the bridge from viewThere are flowers and trees by the bridge and a stone house tooInside the house are stone rooms a stone stove stone bowls stone plates stone beds and even stone benches In the middle of it all is a tablet which says Happy Land of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit Cave Heaven of the Water CurtainIts just the place for us to settle down intheres room there for thousandsLets all move in then we wont have to put up with any more nonsense from heavenIn there We can hide there from the wind And shelter from the rain With nothing to fear from frost and snow And never a rumble of thunderThe coloured mists glow bright And the place smells luckyThe pine and bamboo will always be beautiful And rare flowers blossom every day The other monkeys were all so delighted to hear this that they said You go first and take us with you The stone monkey shut his eyes crouched and leapt in again shouting Follow me in follow me in The braver monkeys all jumped throughThe more timid ones peered forward shrank back rubbed their ears scratched their cheeks shouted and yelled at the top of their voices before going in all clinging to each otherAfter rushing across the bridge they all grabbed plates and snatched bowls bagged stoves and fought over beds and moved everything around Monkeys are born naughty and they could not keep quiet for a single moment until they had worn themselves out moving things aroundThe stone monkey sat himself in the main seat and said Gentlemen A man who breaks his word is worthlessJust now you said that if anyone was clever enough to come in here and get out again in one piece youd make him king Well thenIve come in and gone out and gone out and come in Ive found you gentlemen a cave heaven where you can sleep in peace and all settle down to live in blissWhy havent you made me king On hearing this all the monkeys bowed and prostrated themselves not daring to disobeyJourney to the West They lined up in groups in order of age and paid their homage as at court all acclaiming him as the Great King of a Thousand Years The stone monkey then took the throne made the word stone taboo and called himself Handsome Monkey KingThere is a poem to prove it that goesAll things are born from the Three positives The magic stone was quick with the essence of sun and moonAn egg was turned into a monkey to complete the Great Way He was lent a name so that the elixir would be completeLooking inside he perceives nothing because it has no form Outside he uses his intelligence to create visible thingsMen have always been like this Those who are called kings and sages do just as they wishTaking control of his host of monkeys apes gibbons and others the Handsome Monkey King divided them into rulers and subjects assistants and officersIn the morning they roamed the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and in the evening they settled down for the night in the Water Curtain Cave They made a compact that they would not join the ranks of the birds or go with the running beasts They had their own king and they thoroughly enjoyed themselvesIn spring they picked flowers for food and drink In summer they lived off fruitIn autumn they gathered tares and chestnuts They got through the winter on SolomonssealThe Handsome Monkey Kings innocent high spirits could not of course last three or four hundred yearsOne day he suddenly felt depressed during a banquet with his monkey host and he started to weepThe startled monkeys crowded round bowed to him and asked Whats the matter Your Majesty Although Im happy now the Monkey King replied Im worried about the futureThats whats getting me down The other monkeys laughed and said Your Majesty is being greedyWe have parties every day we live in a mountain paradise in an ancient cave in a divine continent We are spared the rule of unicorns the Journey to the West domination of phoenixes and the restraints of human kings We are free to do just as we likewe are infinitely luckyWhy make yourself miserable worrying about the future To this the Monkey King replied Yes we dont have to submit to the laws and regulations of human kings and we dont live in terror of the power of birds and beasts But the time will come when we are old and weak and the underworld is controlled by the King of Hell When the time comes for us to die we wont be able to go on living among the Blessed and our lives will have been in vain All the monkeys covered their faces and wept as everyone of them thought about deathSuddenly a gibbon jumped out from their ranks and shrieked in a piercing voice If Your Majesty is thinking so far ahead this is the beginning of enlightenmentNow of the Five Creatures there are only three that do not come under the jurisdiction of the King of Hell Do you know which they are asked the Monkey King Yes the ape repliedThey are the Buddhas the Immortals and the Sages They are free from the Wheel of Reincarnation They are not born and they do not die They are as eternal as Heaven and Earth as the mountains and the rivers Where do they live the Monkey King askedOnly in the human world the ape replied in ancient caves on magic mountains The Monkey King was delighted to hear thisI shall leave you all tomorrow he said and go down the mountain If I have to Ill roam the corners of the oceans and go to the edge of the sky to find these three kinds of beings and discover the secret of eternal youth that will keep us out of the clutches of the King of Hell for ever GoodnessBecause of these words he was to learn how to be free from the Wheel of Reincarnation and become the Great Sage Equaling HeavenAll the monkeys clapped with approval and said GreatTomorrow well climb all over the mountain and get lots of fruit to give Your Majesty a really big banquet to send you off The next day the monkeys set out to pick magic peaches gather rare fruits dig out yams and cut SolomonssealMagic fungus and fragrant orchid were collected and everything was set on the stone benches and the stone tables with fairy wine and dishesYou could see Golden pills and pearl pellets Bursting red and plump yellowThe golden pills and pearl pellets were winter cherries beautiful and sweet The bursting red and plump yellow were ripe plums tasty and sharpFresh sweetfleshed longans with thin skinsFiery lichees with tiny stones in a red sackBranch after branch of crabapples Journey to the West Yellowskinned loquats with their leaves onRabbithead pears and chickenheart jujubes To quench your thirst remove your cares and sober you upFragrant peaches and tender apricots As sweet and luscious as jade wineCrisp plums and arbutus As sharp as glistening yogurtRipe melons with red coats and black seeds Big foursectioned persimmons with yellow skinsBursting pomegranates Cinnabar pips shining like firecrystal pearlsOpened waterchestnuts With firm round flesh like golden agateWalnuts and gingko fruits to eat with tea Coconuts and grapes to make into wineDishes loaded with pine cones yewnuts filberts and crabapples Tangerines sugarcane and oranges covering the tableHot roast yams Tender boiled Solomonsseal Pounded chinaroot and Jobs tearsSimmered in soup in a stonepotAlthough we humans have rare delicacies to eat We are no happier than those monkeys in the mountainsJourney to the West The host of monkeys ushered the Handsome Monkey King to the seat of honour and sat down below him according to age Each of them took it in turns to bring him wine flowers and fruit and they drank hard for a whole dayThe next morning the Handsome Monkey King got up early and ordered Children tear down some old pines and make me a raftFind a bamboo pole to punt with and load it up with fruit Im going He went aboard the raft all by himself pushed off with all his might and floated off towards the waves of the ocean He intended to sail with the wind and cross over to the Southern Jambu ContinentThe heavenborn monkey whose conduct was so noble Left his island to drift with heavens windsHe sailed oceans and seas to find the Way of Immortality Deeply determined to do a great deedThe predestined one should not have vulgar longings He can attain the primal truth without care or worryHe is bound to find a kindred spirit To explain the origins and the laws of natureHe had chosen just the right time for his journey After he boarded his raft the Southeasterly wind blew hard for days on end and bore him to the Northwestern shore of the Southern ContinentTesting the depth of the water with his pole he found that it was shallow so he abandoned the raft and jumped ashoreHe saw humans by the coast fishing hunting geese gathering clams and extracting saltHe went up to them leaping around and making faces which so scared them that they dropped their baskets and nets and fled in all directions as fast as they couldThe Monkey King grabbed one of them who was a poor runner stripped him of his clothes and dressed himself in them like a humanHe swaggered through the provinces and prefectures learning human behavior and human speech in the market placesWhether he was eating his breakfast or going to bed at nigh he was always asking about Buddhas Immortals and Sages and seeking the secret of eternal youthHe observed that the people of the world were too concerned with fame and fortune to be interested in their fatesWhen will the struggle for fame and fortune endToiling from morning till night never pleasing yourselfThose who ride donkeys long for stallions The Prime Minister always wants to be a princeThey only worry about having to stop work to eat or dress Journey to the West They never fear that the King of Hell will come to get themWhen trying to ensure their sons and grandsons inherit their wealth and power They have no time to stop and thinkAlthough he asked about the way of the Immortals the Monkey King was unable to meet oneHe spent eight or nine years in the Southern Jambu Continent going through its great walls and visiting its little countiesWhen he found that he had reached the Great Western Ocean he thought that there must be Sages and Immortals on the other side of it so he made himself another raft like the last one and floated across the Western Ocean until he came to the Western Continent of CattlegiftHe went ashore and made extensive and lengthy enquiries until one day he came upon a high and beautiful mountain thickly forested on its lower slopesNot fearing wolves and undaunted by tigers or leopards he climbed to the summit to see the viewIt was indeed a fine mountain A thousand peaks brandishing halberds Screens ten thousand measures tallIn the sunlight the mountain haze is lightly touched with blue After the rain the black rocks look coldly greenWithered creepers coil round ancient trees And the old ford marks the bounds of the mysteriousStrange flowers and precious plants Flourishing in all four seasons rivaling fairylandThe nearby cry of a hidden bird The clear running of a springValley upon valley of mushroom and orchid Lichen grows all over the cliffsThe range rises and dips in dragonlike majesty Surely there mush be lofty hermits hereAs he was looking at the view the Monkey King heard a human voice coming from the depths of the forestHe rushed into the trees and when he cocked his ear to listen he heard a songJourney to the West Watching the chess game I cut through the rotten Felling trees ding ding Strolling at the edge of the cloud and the mouth of the valley I sell firewood to buy wine Cackling with laughter and perfectly happyI pillow myself on a pine root looking up at the moon When I wake up it is lightRecognizing the old forest I scale cliffs and cross ridges Cutting down withered creepers with my axeWhen Ive gathered a basketful I walk down to the market with a song And trade it for three pints of riceNobody else competes with me So prices are stableI dont speculate or try sharp practice Couldnt care less what people think of me Calmly lengthening my daysThe people I meet Are Taoists and Immortals Sitting quietly and expounding the Yellow Court The Monkey King was overjoyed to hear this and he said with glee So this is where the Immortals have been hiding He bounded deeper into the woods for a closer look and saw that the singer was a woodcutter cutting firewoodHe was wearing the most unusual clothes Journey to the West On his head he wore a hat Woven from the first skin shed by new bamboo shootsThe clothes on his body Were made of yam from the wild cottontreeThe belt round his waist Was of silk from an old silkwormThe straw sandals under his feet Had straps torn from rotten sago treesIn his hand he held a steel axe On his back he carried a hempen rope At climbing pines and felling dead trees Who was a match for this woodcutterThe Monkey King went closer and called to him Old Immortal your disciple greets you The woodcutter dropped his axe in astonishment and turned round to say No noI dont even have enough to eat or drink so how can I possibly let you call me an Immortal If youre not an Immortal the Monkey King said why do you talk like one I dont talk like an Immortal the woodcutter saidAt the edge of the wood just now the Monkey King replied I heard you say The people I meet are Taoists and Immortals sitting quietly and expounding the Mantingfang The Mantingfang contains the truth about the Way so if youre not an Immortal what are you The woodcutter laughedIts quite true that the song is called The Fragrance of the Mantingfang and an Immortal who lives near my hut taught me it He said he saw how hard I had to work and how I was always worried so he made me sing this song when things were getting me down It lightens my cares and makes me forget my wearinessI was singing it just now because I had some problems on my mind and I never imagined that you would be listening If youve got an Immortal for a neighbour you ought to learn from him how to cultivate your conduct and get him to teach you a recipe for eternal youth Journey to the West Ive had a hard life the woodcutter repliedMy mother and father brought me up till I was about eight and just when I was beginning to know about life my father diedMy mother remained a widow and I had no brothers or sisters As I was the only child I had to look after my mother morning and nightNow she is old that I cant possibly leave herOur land is so overgrown that I cant grow enough to feed and clothe both of us so I have to cut a couple of bundles of firewood to sell in the market for a handful of coppers to buy the few pints of rice that I cook for myself and for my motherThats why I cant cultivate my conduct From what you say the Monkey King replied youre a filial son and a gentlemanyoure bound to be rewarded for it one dayBut Id be grateful if you could show me where that Immortal lives so that I can go and pay him my respects The woodcutter said Its not far from hereThis mountain is the Spirit Tower Heart Mountain and in it there is the Cave of the Setting Moon and the Three Stars In that cave lives an Immortal called the Patriarch SubhutiI dont know how many disciples he has trainedthere are thirty or forty of them cultivating their conduct with him at the momentIf you take that path South for two or three miles youll reach his home The Monkey King tugged at the woodcutter and said Take me there Elder BrotherIf I get anything out of this I wont forget your kindness You idiot the woodcutter replied didnt you understand what I told you just nowIf I went with you I wouldnt be able to earn my living and who would look after my poor old mother thenIve got to get on with my woodcutting Go by yourself After hearing this the Monkey King had to take his leaveHe came out of the forest and found the path which led up a mountain slope for two or three miles when he saw the caveHe pulled himself up to his full height to take a look and it was a really magnificent placeMisty clouds scattered colours Sun and moon shimmered brightA thousand ancient cypresses Ten thousand lofty bamboosA thousand ancient cypresses A soft green drawing the rain from the skyTen thousand lofty bamboos And a misty valley is azure blueOutside the gate rare flowers spread brocade Beside the bridge wafts the scent of jade flowersRocky crags jut glossy with green moss Journey to the West On overhanging cliffs blue lichen growsSometimes the call of the crane is heard And often you see the phoenix soarThe call of the crane Echoes beyond the Ninth Heaven and the Milky WayWhen the phoenix soars The brilliance of its wings colours the cloudsBlack apes and white deer can be just made out Golden lions and jade elephants prefer to keep hiddenIf you look closely at this happy land You will see that it rivals paradiseHe saw that the doors of the cave were shut fast and that everything was still with no signs of any peopleHe turned round and noticed that there was a stone tablet about thirty feet high and eight feet wide at the top of the cliff On it was carved in enormous letters SPIRITTOWER HEART MOUNTAIN CAVE OF THE SETTING MOON AND THE THREE STARSThe Monkey King exclaimed with delight The people here really are honest The mountain and the cave do exist He took a good long look but did not dare to knock on the doorHe climbed to the and of a pine branch and ate some pine seeds to amuse himselfBefore long the doors of the cave opened with a creak and an immortal boy came out In the nobility of his bearing and the exceptional purity of his features he was completely different from an ordinary boyHis hair was bound with a pair of silken bands His flowing gown had two capacious sleevesHis face and body were naturally distinguished His mind and appearance were both emptyFor many years a guest beyond the world of things An eternal child amid the mountains Untouched by any speck of dust Journey to the West He let the years go tumbling byWhen this boy had come out he shouted Whos making that row out here The Monkey King scampered down the tree went up to him and said with a bow Immortal child I am a disciple who has come to ask about the Way and study under the ImmortalThe last thing Id do would be to make a row here The boy laughed So youve come to ask about the Way have you Yes the Monkey King repliedOur master has just got up the boy said and has now mounted the dais to expound the Way Before he had started to explain about origins he told me to open the doorHe said There is someone outside who wants to cultivate his conductGo and welcome him I suppose he must have meant you Yes he meant me the Monkey King said with a smileCome with me the boy saidThe Monkey King straightened his clothes and followed the boy deep into the depths of the cave He saw majestic pavilions and towers of red jade pearl palaces and gateways of cowry and countless rooms of silence and secluded cells leading all the way to a jasper daisHe saw the Patriarch Subhuti sitting on the dais and thirtysix minor Immortals standing below itA golden Immortal of great enlightenment free from filth Subhuti the marvel of the Western WorldNeither dying nor born he practices the triple meditation His spirit and soul entirely benevolentIn empty detachment he follows the changes Having found his true nature he lets it run freeAs eternal as Heaven and majestic in body The great teacher of the Law is enlightened through aeonsAs soon as the Handsome Monkey King saw him he bowed low and knocked his head on the ground before him many times saying Master master your disciple pays his deepest respects Journey to the West Where are you from the Patriarch askedYou must tell me your name and address before you can become my pupil I come from the Water Curtain Cave in the Flowers and Fruit Mountain in the land of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body replied the Monkey KingThrow him out the Patriarch roaredHes a liar and a cheat and even if he tried cultivating his conduct he would get nowhere The Monkey King desperately kept hitting his head on the ground and said Your disciple spoke the truthI promise I wasnt lying The Patriarch asked If you were speaking the truth why did you say that you came from the Eastern Continent of Superior BodyBetween here and the Eastern Continent there are two seas and the Southern Jambu Continent so how could you possibly have come here from there The Monkey King still kowtowing replied I sailed across seas and oceans crossed frontiers and wandered through many countries for over ten years before I arrived here So you came here by stages the Patriarch remarkedWhat is your surname Im not surly the Monkey King repliedIf people call me names it doesnt bother me and if they hit me I dont get angryIm just polite to them and thats that Ive never been surly I didnt ask if you were surlyI wanted to know the surname you inherited from your parents I didnt have any parents the Monkey King repliedIf you had no parents did you grow on a tree I grew not on a tree but in a stone the Monkey King repliedAll I remember is that there was a magic stone on the top of the Flower and Fruit Mountain and that one year the stone split open and I was born Concealing his delight at searing this the Patriarch remarked In other words you were born of Heaven and EarthWalk around for a moment and let me have a look at you The Monkey King leapt to his feet and shambled round a couple of timesThe Patriarch smiled and said Though you have rather a base sort of body you look like one of the rhesus monkeys that eat pine seeds and I ought to give you a surname that fits your appearance and call you Hu The elements that make up the character Hu are animal old and moonWhat is old is ancient and the moon embodies the Negative principle and what is ancient and Negative cannot be transformed But I think I would do much better to call you Sun Apart from the animal element the character Sun has one part implying male and one part suggesting a baby which fits in with my basic theories about childrenYour surname will be Sun When the Monkey King heard this he kowtowed with delight and said GreatNow I have a surname I am eternally grateful to you for your mercy and compassion masterI beg you to give me a personal name to go with my new surname then it will be much easier to address me There are twelve words within my sect said the Patriarch which I give as namesYou belong to the tenth generation of my disciples Journey to the West What are these twelve words asked the Monkey KingBroad great wisdom intelligence true likeness nature sea bright awakened complete and enlightenmentIf we work out the generations of disciples then you should have a name with Wu  in itSo we can give you the Dharmaname Sun Wukong which means Monkey Awakened to EmptinessWill that do Marvellous marvellous said the smiling Monkey KingFrom now on my name will be Sun Wukong IndeedWhen the Great Vagueness was separated there were no surnames To smash foolish emptiness he had to be awakened to emptinessIf you want to know what success he had in cultivating his conduct you must listen to the explanation in the next installmentHe Becomes Aware of the Wonderful Truth of Enlightenment By Killing the Demon He Realizes His SpiritNature The story goes on to tell how after being given a name the Handsome Monkey King jumped for joy and bowed to Subhuti to express his thanksThe Patriarch then ordered the others to take Sun Wukong out through the double doors and teach him how to sprinkle and sweep the floor answer orders and deport himself properlyAll the Immortals went out in obedience to this commandWhen Sun Wukong was outside the doors he bowed to all his spiritual elder brothers and laid out his bed on the verandahThe next morning and every following day he studied language and deportment under his spiritual elder brothers expounded the scriptures discussed the Way practiced calligraphy and burnt incenseWhen he had any spare time he would sweep the grounds dig the vegetable patch grow flowers tend trees look for kindling light the fire carry water and fetch soyEverything he needed was providedThus six or seven years slipped by in the cave without his noticing themOne day the Patriarch took his seat on the dais called all the Immortals together and began to explain the Great WayHeavenly flowers fell in profusion While golden lotuses burst forth from the earthBrilliantly he expounded the doctrine of the Three Vehicles Setting forth ten thousand Dharmas in all their detailsAs he slowly waved his whisk jewels fell from his mouth Journey to the West Echoing like thunder and shaking the Nine HeavensNow preaching the Way Now teaching meditation He showed that the Three Beliefs are basically the sameIn explaining a single word he brought one back to the truth And taught the secrets of avoiding birth and understanding ones natureAs Monkey sat at the side listening to the exposition he was so delighted that he tugged at his ear scratched his cheek and smiled He could not help waving his hands and stampingWhen the Patriarch noticed this he said to Monkey Why are you leaping around like a madman in class instead of listening to the lesson Your disciple is listening to the exposition with all his attention Monkey replied but your marvellous words made me so happy that I started jumping around without realizing what I was doingPlease forgive me To this the Patriarch replied If you really understand my marvellous words then answer this questionHow long have you been in my cave You disciple was born stupid Monkey replied so Ive no idea how long Ive been hereAll I know is that whenever the fire in the stove goes out I go to the other side of the mountain to collect firewood and there I see a hill covered with fine peach trees Ive had seven good feeds of peaches there That hill is called Tender Peach HillIf you have eaten there seven times you must have been here seven yearsWhat sort of Way do you want to learn from me That depends what you teach me masterAs long as theres a whiff of Way to it your disciple will learn it There are three hundred and sixty sideentrances to the Way and they all lead to a True Result the Patriarch saidWhich branch would you like to study I will do whatever you think best master replied MonkeyWhat about teaching you the Way of Magic Arts What does the Way of Magic Arts mean Magic arts the Patriarch replied include summoning Immortals using the magic sandboard and divining by milfoilWith them one can learn how to bring on good fortune and avert disaster Can you become immortal this way asked MonkeyNo certainly not replied the PatriarchShant learn it Journey to the West Shall I teach you the Way of Sects the Patriarch askedWhat are the principles of the Sects said MonkeyWithin the branch of Sects there is Confucianism Buddhism Taoism the study of the Negative and Positive Mohism medicine reading scriptures and chanting the name of a BuddhaYou can also summon Immortals and Sages with this branch Can you attain immortality that way asked MonkeyTo try and attain immortality that way the Patriarch replied is like putting a pillar in the wall Master Monkey said Im a simple chap and I cant understand your technical jargonWhat do you mean by putting a pillar in the wall When a man builds a house and wants to make it strong he puts a pillar in the wallBut when the day comes for his mansion to collapse the pillar is bound to rot From what you say Monkey observed its not eternalShant learn it Shall I teach you the Way of Silence the Patriarch then askedWhat True Result can be got from Silence said MonkeyIt involves abstaining from grain preserving ones essence silence inaction meditation abstaining from speech eating vegetarian food performing certain exercises when asleep or standing up going into trances and being walled up in total isolation Is this a way of becoming immortal Monkey askedIts like building the top of a kiln with sundried bricks the patriarch repliedYou do go on master said Sun WukongIve already told you that I cant understand your technical jargonWhat does building the top of a kiln with sundried bricks mean If you build the top of a kiln with sundried bricks they may make it look all right but if they have not been hardened with fire and water then they will crumble away in the first heavy rainstorm Theres nothing eternal about that either then replied MonkeyShant learn that Shall I teach you the Way of Action then the Patriarch askedWhats that like Monkey askedIt involves acting and doing extracting the Negative and building up the Positive drawing the bow and loading the crossbow rubbing the navel to make the subtle humors flow refining elixirs according to formulae lighting fires under cauldrons consuming Red lead purifying Autumn Stone and drinking womens milk Can doing things like that make me live for ever Monkey askedJourney to the West To try and attain immortality that way is like lifting the moon out of water What does lifting the moon out of water mean The moon is in the sky the Patriarch replied and only its reflection is in the water Although you can see it there you will try in vain to lift it out NoShant learn that Monkey exclaimedWhen the Patriarch heard this he gasped and climbed down from his dais Pointing at Sun Wukong with his cane he said You wont study this and you wont study that so what do you want you monkey He went up to Monkey and hit him three times on the head then went inside with his hands behind his back and shut the main door abandoning them allThe class was shocked and they all blamed Sun Wukong You cheeky ape youve no idea how to behaveThe master was teaching you the Way so why did you have to argue with him instead of learning from himNow youve offended him we dont know when hell come out again They were all very angry with him and regarded him with loathing and contemptBut Sun Wukong was not bothered in the least and his face was covered with smilesThe Monkey King had understood the riddle and had the answer hidden away in his mind So he did not argue with the others but bore it all without a wordWhen the Patriarch hit him three times he had been telling him to pay attention at the third watch and when he went inside with his hands behind his back and shut the main door he had told the Monkey King to go in through the back door and be taught the Way in secretThe delighted Sun Wukong spent the rest of that day with the others in front of the Three Stars Cave looking at the sky and impatient for night to comeAt dusk he went to bed like all the others pretended to close his eyes controlled his breathing and calmed himself downNobody beats the watches or calls out the hour in the mountains so he had no way of knowing the time except by regulating the breath going in and out of his noseWhen he reckoned that it was about the third watch he got up very quietly dressed and slipped out through the front door away from the others When he was outside he looked up and saw The moon was bright and clear and cold The vast space of the eight points was free from dustDeep in the trees a bird slept hidden While the water flowed from the springFireflies scattered their lights And a line of geese was stretched across the cloudsIt was exactly the third watch The right time to ask about the WayJourney to the West Watch the Monkey King as he follows the old path to the back door which he found to be ajarThe Patriarch has left the door open so he really intends to teach me the Way he exclaimed in delightHe tiptoed toward went in sideways through the door and walked over to the Patriarchs bed where he saw the Patriarch sleeping curled up facing the inside of the roomNot daring to disturb him Sun Wukong knelt in front of the bedBefore long the Patriarch woke up stretched out both his legs and mumbled to himself Its hard hard hardThe Way is very obscure Dont make light of the Gold and the CinnabarTo teach miraculous spells to any but the Perfect Man Is to tire the voice and dry the tongue in vain Sun Wukong said in reply Master your disciple has been kneeling here for a long time When the Patriarch heard that it was Sun Wukong who was speaking he pulled some clothes on sat up crosslegged and shouted Its that monkeyWhy have you come into my room instead of sleeping out in front Master you told me publicly in front of the altar yesterday that your disciple was to come in here through the back gate at the third watch as you were going to teach me the WayThat is why I made so bold as to come to pay my respects beside my masters bed The Patriarch was very pleased to hear this and said to himself This wretch was indeed born of Heaven and EarthOtherwise he wouldnt have been able to understand my cryptic message Sun Wukong said There is no third pair of ears in this room your disciple is the only other person here I hope master that in your great mercy you will teach me the Way of ImmortalityIf you do Ill always be grateful to you You are predestined the Patriarch said so I shall be happy to tell youSince you understood my cryptic message come over here and listen carefully while I teach you the miraculous Way of Immortality Sun Wukong kowtowed with gratitude and knelt before the bed listening with all his attentionThe Patriarch said True spells revealing secrets and all powerful Are the only sure way of protecting ones lifeThey all come from essence vapour and spirit Must be stored away securely and never be divulgedJourney to the West Must never be divulged and be stored in the body Then the Way I teach you will flourish of itselfMany are the benefits of learning spells They give protection from evil desires and make one pureMake one pure with a dazzling radiance Like a bright moon shining on a cinnabar towerThe moon contains a Jade Rabbit the sun a Golden Crow The Tortoise and the Snake are always intertwinedAlways intertwined then life is firm And one can plant golden lotuses in fireGrasp all the Five Elements and turn them upside down And when you are successful you can become a Buddha or an Immortal The Patriarchs explanation went to the root of things and Sun Wukongs heart was filled with bliss as he committed the spells to memoryHe bowed to the Patriarch to express his deep gratitude and went out of the back door to lookHe saw that there was a trace of white in the East while the golden light of the moon was shining in the WestHe went to the front door by the old path pushed it open gently and went in He sat down where he had been sleeping earlier shook his bedding and said loudly Its dawn its dawnGet up The others were all asleep unaware of Sun Wukongs good fortuneAt daybreak he got up and muddled through the day while secretly keeping to what he had been told In the afternoon and evening he regulated his breathingAfter three years had passed in this way the Patriarch once more sat on his lecturing throne and expounded the Dharma to the studentsHe recounted famous sayings and parables and discussed external phenomena and external appearancesWithout warning he asked Where is Sun Wukong Sun Wukong went forward knelt down and replied Your disciple is present What Way have you cultivated since coming here Journey to the West Your disciple is now fairly well conversant with the Dharma Sun Wukong replied and my Source is getting gradually stronger If you are conversant with the Dharma and you know about the Source the Patriarch replied and if the spirit has already flowed into you then you must beware of the Three Disasters Sun Wukong thought for a long time then he said Patriarch youre talking rubbishI have often heard that the Way is lofty and its power mighty that it is as eternal as Heaven that it can overcome fire and water and prevent all illnesses from arising so how could there be Three Disasters To this the Patriarch replied This is not the ordinary Wayit involves seizing the very creation of Heaven and Earth and encroaching on the hidden workings of the sun and moonOnce the elixir is made devils and spirits cannot tolerate itAlthough it will preserve the youthfulness of your face and prolong your life in five hundred years time Heaven will strike you with a thunderbolt You must be clearsighted in nature and mind so that you can hide from it before it comesIf you succeed in avoiding it you will live as long as Heaven and if you dont it will kill youAnother five hundred years later Heaven will burn you with fireThis fire will be not heavenly fire or ordinary fire but hidden fireIt will burn you from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head your five viscera will be reduced to ashes your four limbs will be destroyed and a thousand years of asceticism will have been so much wasted timeYet another five hundred years later a wind will blow at youIt will not be the North South East or West wind nor will it be a warm fragrant wind from the Northwest nor will it be the kind of wind that blows among flowers willows pine and bamboo It will be what is called a monster windIt will blow through the crown of your head down into your six entrails It will go through the Cinnabar Field below your navel and penetrate your nine orifices Your flesh and your bones will be destroyed and your body will disintegrateSo you must avoid all three of these disasters When he heard this Sun Wukongs hair stood on end and he kowtowed with the words I implore you my lord to show pity and teach me how to avoid these three disastersIf you do I will be grateful to you for ever That would be easy the Patriarch replied but for the fact that you are different from other peoplewhich means that I cant I have a head that faces the sky and feet standing on earth said Sun WukongI have nine orifices and four limbs five viscera and six entrailsHow am I different from anyone else Although you are quite like other people your cheeks are too small Now the Monkey had a funny face with cheeks that caved inwards and a sharp chinSun Wukong felt it with his hand and replied with a laugh Master you didnt take everything into accountAlthough Im a bit short of jaw Ive got more dewlap than other people to make up for it Very well then the Patriarch said which would you prefer to learnthe thirtysix heavenly transformations or the seventytwo earthly ones Your disciple wants to get as much out of it as he can so I would like to learn the seventytwo earthly ones If thats what you want the Patriarch replied come here and Ill teach you the spells Thereupon he whispered into Sun Wukongs ear and who knows what miraculous spells he taught himThe Monkey King was the sort of person who understands everything once he is told a tiny part and he learned the spells on the spot He practiced and trained until he had mastered all seventytwo transformationsOne day the Patriarch and all his disciples were enjoying the sunset outside the Three Stars CaveJourney to the West The Patriarch asked Sun Wukong Have you succeeded yet Sun Wukong replied Thanks to your infinite mercy master your disciples results have been perfect and I can now rise on the clouds and fly Let me see you try a flight the Patriarch saidSun Wukong used his skill to perform a series of somersaults that carried him fifty or sixty feet into the air then walked around on the clouds for about as long as it takes to eat a meal He covered about a mile altogether before landing in front of the Patriarch folding his arms across his chest and saying Master thats flying and soaring in the clouds The Patriarch laughed Thats not soaring on the cloudsits just climbing up themThere is an old saying that an Immortal visits the Northern Sea in the morning and Cangwu in the eveningBut to take as long as you did just to go a mile doesnt count as climbing on the clouds How can it be possible to visit the Northern Sea in the morning and Cangwu in the evening Sun Wukong askedAll cloudsoarers start off from the Northern Sea early in the morning visit the Eastern Western and Southern Seas and then come back to Cangwu Cangwu is what the Northern Sea is called in the Lingling languageWhen you can go beyond all four seas in a single day you can regard yourself as a cloudsoarer But that must be very difficult Sun Wukong observedWhere theres a will theres a way the Patriarch repliedNothing by halves master replied Sun Wukong with bows and kowtows I beg of you in your great mercy to teach me the art of cloudsoaringI promise that I will always be grateful Immortals take off with a stamp of their feet said the Patriarch but you do it differentlyjust now I saw you pull yourself upAs that is the way you do it Ill show you how to do it your own way and teach you the somersault cloud Sun Wukong bowed again imploring him to do so and the Patriarch taught him the spellFor this kind of cloud the Patriarch said you make the magic by clasping your hands in the special way recite the words of the spell clench your fist shake yourself and jump With one somersault you can go sixty thousand miles When the others heard this they all exclaimed with a laugh Lucky old Sun WukongWith magic like this he could bea messenger delivering official letters and reports and hed never go short of a meal When it was dark the Patriarch and his pupils returned to the caveThat night Sun Wukong moved his spirit practiced the technique and mastered the cloud somersaultFrom then on he was free from all restraint and he enjoyed the delights of immortality drifting around as he pleasedOn a day when spring was giving way to summer and all the students had been sitting under some pine trees listening to lectures for a long time they said Sun Wukong in what life did you earn your present destinyThe other day our teacher whispered to you how to do the transformations to avoid the Three DisastersCan you do them all yet Its true brothers said Sun Wukong with a grin I can do them all In the first place its because our master taught me and in the second place its because I practiced them hard day and night Journey to the West This would be a good time for you to give us a demonstration At this suggestion Sun Wukong braced his spirit to show off his skill Whats it to be brothersTell me what youd like me to turn myself into Turn into a pine tree they all saidSun Wukong clenched his fist said the magic words shook himself and changed into a pine treeIt was truly Green and misty throughout the four seasons Raising its upright beauty to the cloudsNot in the least like a demon monkey Every inch a tree that withstands frost and snowWhen the students saw it they clapped their hands and chuckled aloud saying Good old monkey good old monkey They did not realize that the row they were making had disturbed the Patriarch who rushed out through the door dragging his stick behind himWhos making a row out here he askedThe students hurriedly pulled themselves together straightened their clothes and went over to himSun Wukong who had now resumed his real appearance said from the forest Master we were holding a discussion here and there were no outsiders making a din Yelling and shouting like that the Patriarch angrily roared is no way for those cultivating their conduct to behaveIf you are cultivating your conduct the subtle vapours escape when you open your mouth and when you wag your tongue trouble starts What was all the laughing and shouting about Just now Sun Wukong did a transformation for funWe told him to turn himself into a pine tree and he did We all praised and applauded him which was why we disturbed you with the noise master We beg you to forgive us The Patriarch sent them all away except for Sun Wukong to whom he said Come hereIs that a way to use your spirit To change into a pine treeIs this a skill you should be showing off in front of peopleIf you saw somebody else doing that wouldnt you ask him to teach youIf other people see you doing it theyre bound to ask you to teach them and if you want to keep out of trouble youll have to do so otherwise they may do you harm and then your life will be in danger Sun Wukong kowtowed and said Please forgive me master I shant punish you the Patriarch replied but youll have to go Sun Wukongs eyes filled with tearsMaster where am I to go Journey to the West Go back to where you came from Sun Wukong had a sudden awakening and he said I came from the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body If you hurry back there the Patriarch replied you will be able to preserve your lifeIf you stay here it will be absolutely impossible to do so Sun Wukong accepted his punishmentYes master he said Ive been away from home for twenty years and I do miss the old days and my children and grandchildren But when I remember that I have not yet repaid your enormous generosity to me I cant bring myself to go What sort of kindness would you be doing me if you stayedIll be happy enough if you keep me out of any disasters you cause Seeing that there was nothing else for it Sun Wukong bowed and took leave of him saying goodbye to all the other studentsNow that youre going the Patriarch said Im sure that your life will not be a good oneWhatever disasters you cause and crimes you commit I forbid you under any circumstances to call yourself my discipleIf you so much as hint at it Ill know at once and Ill tear off your monkey skin chop up your bones and banish your soul to the Ninth DarknessI wont let you out for ten thousand aeons I promise never to give away a single letter of your name said Sun WukongIll just say that I taught myself Sun Wukong took his leave and went away Making the spell by clasping his fist he jumped head over heels summoned a somersault cloud and went back to the Eastern ContinentWithin two hours he saw the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and FruitThe Handsome Monkey King was so pleased that he said to himself When I left here my mortal flesh and bones were heavy But now I have the Way my bodys lightNo one in the world has real determination To the firm will the hidden becomes clearWhen I last crossed the seas the waves got in my way But now on my return the journeys easyThe parting words still echo in my ears When will I see The Eastern Ocean again Journey to the West Sun Wukong put away his cloud and headed straight to the Mountain of Flowers and FruitAs he followed the path there he heard the call of the cranes and the cries of the apes The crane calls echoed beyond the Milky Way and the ape cries were pathetically sadSun Wukong shouted Children Im back Big monkeys and little monkeys came bounding in their thousands and tens of thousands from caves in the cliffs from the grass and flowers and down from the trees They all crowded round the Handsome Monkey King kowtowed and said Your Majesty youre a cool one How could you stay away for so long abandoning us all hereWeve been desperate for you to come backA demon has been mistreating us terribly Hes occupied our Water Curtain Cave and weve been fighting for our lives with himRecently hes been stealing our things and carrying off many of our youngsters Weve had to stay awake all night to guard our families Thank goodness youve come backAnother year without you Your Majesty and every one of us would be under his control cave and all Sun Wukong was furious Who is this demonWhat an outrage Tell me everything about him and then Ill go and give him whats coming to him The monkey host kowtowed again and said Your Majesty the wretch calls himself the Demon King of Confusion He lives North of here How far away is his lair Sun Wukong askedHe comes and goes in cloud and mist with wind and rain or thunder and lightning so we dont know how far it is If thats how it is Sun Wukong replied then dont worryJust keep yourselves amused while I go and find him The splendid Monkey King jumped up into the air and as he somersaulted towards the North he saw a high and precipitous mountain It was a fine sightPerpendicular peaks jutting straight up Deepsunk winding streamsThe perpendicular peaks jutting straight up pierced the sky The deepsunk winding streams led to the underworldOn pairs of cliffs the plants compete in strangeness Elsewhere pine vies in greenness with bambooTo the left are docile dragons To the right are tame tigersIron oxen ploughing are a common sight Journey to the West Golden coins are always sown as seedsHidden birds sing beautifully Red phoenixes stand in the sunRacing over stones the clear waves Twist and bend in a vicious torrentMany are the famous mountains in the world And many the flowers that bloom and wither on themBut this scenery is eternal Unchanging through the four seasonsIt is truly the mountain from which the Three Worlds spring The Cave in the Belly of the Water that nourishes the Five ElementsAs the Handsome Monkey King stood gazing in silence at this view he heard voicesWhen he went down the mountainside to look he found the Cave in the Belly of the Water facing the cliffSeveral minor demons were dancing around in front of the cave doors and they ran away as soon as they saw Sun WukongWait a moment Sun Wukong saidI want you to take a message for meI am the King of the Water Curtain Cave in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit that lies due South of hereIve come to find that Demon of Confusion of yours or whatever hes called the one whos been mistreating my children and grandchildren and have it out with him The minor demons scuttled into the cave and reported A disaster Your Majesty What do you mean disaster the demon king askedTheres a monkey outside the cave the minor demons reported who says that hes the King of the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit He says that you have been bullying his children and grandchildren and that hes come specially to find you to have it out with you The demon king laughedThose monkey devils are always going on about a king of theirs who renounced the world to cultivate his conduct I suppose it must be him whos here nowDid you see how he was dressed or what weapons he was carrying He hasnt got any weaponsHes bareheaded and hes wearing a red gown belted with a yellow silk sash and a pair of black boots He isnt dressed like a monk or a layman or an ImmortalHes barehanded and emptyfisted and hes standing outside the doors yelling Bring me my armour and weapons said the demon king when he heard thisThe minor demons produced them at once and when he had donned his armour he went out of the door with all the demons his sword in Journey to the West his hand Who is the King of the Water Curtain Cave he roaredSun Wukong took a quick look at him and saw that On his head he wore a dark golden helmet Glistening in the sunOn his body he wore a black silk gown Flapping in the breezeBelow that he wore black metal armour Girt with a leather beltOn his feet he wore patterned boots As splendid as a fieldmarshalsHis waist was ten feet round And his height was thirty cubitsIn his hand he held a sword With gleaming point and edgeHe called himself the Demon King of Confusion And his appearance was truly dazzlingYou insolent demon shouted the Monkey King Your eyes may be big but you cant see who I am The demon king laughed at himYou dont even stand four feet from the ground youre still in your twenties and youve got no weapon in your handWhat sort of mad courage makes you challenge me to a fight You insolent demon retorted Sun Wukong how blind you areYou may think Im small but I can grow easily enoughYou may think Im unarmed but I could pull the moon down from the sky with my two handsDont worry old Sun Wukong will sock you one Sun Wukong gave a jump and leapt into the air taking a swing at his faceThe demon king put out his hand to stop him and said Look how big I am you dwarfIf you use your fists Ill use my swordBut Id only make myself look ridiculous if I killed you with a swordWait till Ive put my sword down and then Ill give you a display of boxing Journey to the West Well said exclaimed Sun Wukong spoken like a manCome on then The demon king dropped his guard to throw a punch and Sun Wukong rushed in towards him punching and kickingWhen he spread out his hand it was enormous and when he clenched his fist it was very hardSun Wukong hit the demon king in the ribs kicked his backside and smashed several of his jointsThe demon king seized his steel sword that was as big as a plank and swung it at Sun Wukongs skullSun Wukong dodged the blow and the sword only split air Seeing how ugly the demon king had turned Sun Wukong used his magic art of getting extra bodiesHe pulled out one of his hairs popped it in his mouth chewed it up and blew it out into the air shouting Change It turned into two or three hundred little monkeys who all crowded round himSun Wukong now had an immortal body and there was no magic transformation of which he was not capableSince he had followed the Way he could change each of the eightyfour thousand hairs on his body into anything he wantedThe little monkeys were too quick and nimble for sword or spearLook at them leaping forwards and jumping backwards rushing up and surrounding the demon king grabbing him seizing him poking him in the backside pulling at his feet punching him kicking him tearing his hair out scratching at his eyes twisting his nose all picking him up together and throwing him to the ground They went on until they had beaten him to a pulpSun Wukong snatched his sword from him told the little monkeys to get out of the way and brought it down on the crown of his head splitting it into twoThen he led his forces charging into the cave where they exterminated all the demons big and smallHe shook his hair and put it back on his body The monkeys who did not go back on his body were the little monkeys the demon king had carried off from the Water Curtain CaveSun Wukong asked them how they had got thereThere were thirty of forty of them and they replied with tears in their eyes It was after Your Majesty went off to become an Immortal He has been fighting with us for the last two years He brought us all here by forceAll the things herethe stone bowls and plateswere stolen from our cave by that beast If its our stuff take it all out said Sun WukongHe then set fire to the Cave in the Belly of the Water and burnt it to a cinderCome back with me he ordered the monkeysYour Majesty they replied when we came here all we could hear was the wind howling in our ears as it blew us here so we dont know the wayHow are we ever going to get back Theres nothing at all to that spell he used said Sun WukongI can do it too as now I only have to know the smallest bit about something to understand it completelyShut your eyes and dont worry Splendid Monkey King He recited a spell took them riding on a hurricane then brought the cloud down to the groundOpen your eyes and look children he shoutedAs soon as the monkeys feet touched the ground they recognized their home In their delight they all ran along the familiar path to the cave and the monkeys who had stayed in the cave all crowded in as wellThey divided themselves into agegroups and bowed in homage to the Monkey KingWine and food was laid out to celebrate and they asked him how he had defeated the demon king and saved their childrenWhen Sun Wukong had told them the whole story the monkeys were full of admiration Where did you learn such arts Your Majesty they asked insistentlyJourney to the West When I left you Sun Wukong replied I followed the waves and the currents and drifted across the Eastern Ocean to the Southern Jambu Continent Here I taught myself to take human form and to wear these clothes and boots I swaggered around for eight or nine years but I never found the Way so I sailed across the Western Ocean to the Western Continent of Cattlegift After long enquiries I was lucky enough to meet a venerable Immortal who taught me the True Result which makes me as immortal as heaven and the great Dharma Gate to eternal youth The monkeys all congratulated him and exclaimed that his like could not be found in a billion yearsSun Wukong laughed and said Children we should congratulate ourselves on having a surname What is Your Majestys surname the monkey masses askedMy surname is now Sun and my Buddhist name is Wukong The monkeys all clapped their hands with joy and said Your Majesty is Old Sun and we are Second Sun Third Sun Thin Sun Little Suna family of Suns a nation of Suns a den of Suns They all offered Old Sun their respects with big plates and small bowls of coconut toddy grape wine magic flowers and magic fruit The whole household was happy My wordBy uniting themselves with a single surname They are waiting to be transferred to the Register of ImmortalsIf you dont know how this ended and want to know about the rest of their lives there then listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Four Seas and Thousand Mountains All Submit In the Ninth Hell the Tenth Category Is Struck Off the Register We have related how the Handsome Monkey King returned home in glory bringing a large sword he had captured when he killed the Demon King of ConfusionFrom then on they practiced the military arts every day He asked the little monkeys to cut down bamboo to make spears carve swords out of wood and learn to use banners and whistles They learned to advance and retreat and build a camp with a stockade round it They spent a lot of time playing at thisOnce Sun Wukong was sitting in his seat of meditation when he wondered What would happen to us if our games were taken for the real thing What if it alarmed some human monarch or gave offence to some king of birds or beasts They might say that we were having military training for a rebellion and attack us with their armies You would be no match for them with your bamboo spears and wooden swordsWe must have really sharp swords and halberdsWhat are we to do about it When the monkeys heard this they all said with alarm Your Majesty has great foresight but theres nowhere we can get them When it was the turn of four older monkeys to speaktwo barebottomed apes and two Journey to the West gibbonsthey came forward and said Your Majesty if you want sharp weapons they can be very easily obtained How could it be easy asked Sun WukongTo the East of our mountain they replied there is a lake some seventy miles wide that is the boundary of the country of AolaiThat country has a princely capital and huge numbers of soldiers and civilians live in the city It must have workshops for gold silver bronze and ironIf you went there Your Majesty you could either buy arms or get them made then you could train us to use them in the defense of our mountain This would give us longterm security Sun Wukong was delighted with the suggestionWait here while I go there he saidSplendid Monkey King He leapt on to his somersault cloud crossed the seventy miles of lake and saw that on the other side there was indeed a city wall a moat streets markets ten thousand houses a thousand gates and people coming and going in the sunlightThere must be readymade weapons here Sun Wukong thought and getting a few by magic would be much better than buying them So he made a magic with his fist and said the words of the spell sucked in some air from the Southeast and blew it hard out againIt turned into a terrifying gale carrying sand and stones with it Where the thunderclouds rise the elements are in chaos Black fogs thick with dust cloak the earth in darknessBoiling rivers and seas terrify the crabs and fish As trees are snapped off in mountain forests tigers and wolves fleeNo business is done in any branch of commerce And no one is working at any kind of tradeIn the palace the king has gone to his inner quarters And the officials in front of the steps have returned to their officesThe thrones of princes are all blown over Towers of five phoenixes are shaken to their foundationsWhere the storm blew the prince of Aolai fled in terror and gates and doors were shut in the streets and markets Nobody dared to move outsideSun Wukong landed his cloud and rushed straight through the gates of the palace to the arsenal and the military stores opened the doors and saw countless weapons swords pikes sabres halberds battleaxes bills scimitars maces tridents clubs bows crossbows forks and spears were all there Journey to the West At the sight of them he said happily How many of these could I carry by myselfId better use the magic for dividing up my body Splendid Monkey KingHe plucked a hair from his body chewed it up spat it out made the magic with his fist said the words of the spell and shouted Change It turned into hundreds and thousands of little monkeys who rushed wildly about grabbing weapons The strong ones took six or seven each and the weaker ones two or three and between them they removed the lotHe climbed back up on the clouds called up a gale by magic and took all the little monkeys home with himThe monkeys big and small of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit were playing outside the gates of the cave when they heard the wind At the sight of countless monkey spirits flying through the air they fled and hidA moment later the Handsome Monkey King landed his cloud put away his mists shook himself replaced his hair and threw all the weapons into a pile beside the mountainChildren he shouted come and get your weapons When the monkey masses looked they saw Sun Wukong standing by himself on some level ground and they all rushed over to him to kowtow and asked what had happenedSun Wukong told them the whole story of how he had raised the gale and taken the weaponsAfter all the monkeys had thanked him they snatched sabres grabbed swords seized battleaxes fought for pikes drew bows stretched crossbows shouted yelled and so amused themselves for the rest of the dayThe next day they paraded as usualSun Wukong assembled all the monkey host and they numbered over fortyseven thousandThis had alarmed all the strange beasts of the mountainwolves monsters tigers leopards deer muntjacs riverdeer foxes wild cats badgers raccoons lions elephants horses orangutans bears stags wild boar mountain cattle antelopes rhinoceroses little dogs huge dogs The kings of various kinds of monsters seventytwo in all all came to pay homage to the Monkey KingThey offered tribute every year and attended court in each of the four seasons They also took part in drill and paid their seasonal grain leviesEverything was so orderly that the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit was as secure as an iron bucket or a wall of bronzeThe kings of the monsters sent gongs drums coloured flags helmets and armour in great abundance and every day there were military exercisesOne day amid all this success the Handsome Monkey King suddenly said to the other monkeys You are now expert in the bow and crossbow and highly skilled in other weapons but this sword of mine is too clumsy for my likingWhat shall I do about it The four veteran monkeys came forward and submitted a suggestion Your Majesty is an Immortal so mortals weapons are not good enough for youWe wonder if Your Majesty is able to travel underwater Since hearing the Way Sun Wukong replied I have mastered the seventytwo earthly transformations My somersault cloud has outstanding magical powersI know how to conceal myself and vanish I can make spells and end themI can reach the sky and find my way into the earthI can travel under the sun or moon without leaving a shadow or go through metal or stone freelyI cant be drowned by water or burned by fireTheres nowhere I cannot go If Your Majesty has these magical powers the stream under our iron bridge leads to the Dragon palace of the Eastern SeaIf you are willing to go down there go and find the Dragon King and ask him for whatever weapon it is you wantWouldnt that suit you Wait till I get back was Sun Wukongs delighted replyJourney to the West Splendid Monkey King He leapt to the end of the bridge and made a spell with his fist to ward off the water Then he dived into the waves and split the waters to make way for himself till he reached the bed of the Eastern SeaOn his journey he saw a yaksha demon who was patrolling the sea The yaksha barred his way and asked What sage or divinity are you pushing the waters aside like thatPlease tell me so that I can make a report and have you properly received I am the Heavenborn Sage Sun Wukong from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and your old Dragon Kings close neighbourHow is it you dont know me When the yaksha heard this he hurried back to the crystal palace and reported Your Majesty Sun Wukong the Heavenborn Sage from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit who says he is your neighbour is coming to your palace Ao Guang the Old Dragon King of the Eastern Sea leapt to his feet and went out to meet Sun Wukong with his dragon sons and grandsons his prawn soldiers and his crab generalsCome in exalted Immortal he said taking Sun Wukong into the palace where they introduced themselves seated him in the place of honour and offered him teaThen the Dragon King asked him Exalted Immortal when did you find the Way and what magic arts did you acquire After my birth said Sun Wukong I renounced the world and cultivated my conduct and thus obtained an immortal and indestructible bodyRecently I have trained my sons and grandsons to guard our cave but unfortunately I have not yet found my self a weaponI have long heard that my illustrious neighbour enjoys the delights of a jade palace with gatetowers of cowry and I was sure that you must have some magic weapons to spare so I have come especially to beg one of you Not wishing to refuse this request the Dragon King sent Commander Perch to fetch a large sword and offer it to Sun WukongI dont know how to use a sword said Sun Wukong so could I ask you to give me something else The Old Dragon King then sent Colonel Mackerel and Guard Commander Eel to fetch a ninepronged spearSun Wukong leapt down from his seat took it tried it out then flung it down saying Its too light far too light and it doesnt suit meI beg you to give me another The Dragon King smiled as he said Exalted Immortal dont you see that this weighs three thousand six hundred pounds It doesnt suit me it doesnt suit me at all protested Sun WukongThe Dragon King feeling frightened now ordered Provincial Commander Bream and Garrison Commander Carp to bring out a patterned heavenly halberd for warding off spells that weighed seven thousand two hundred pounds As soon as he saw it Sun Wukong bounded forward to take itHe tried a few postures and thrusts with it then stuck it in the ground between themStill too light far too light The Dragon King now really terrified said Exalted Immortal that halberd is the heaviest weapon in my palace As the old saying goes said Sun Wukong with a grin Never think the dragon king has no treasures Have another look and if you find anything satisfying Ill give you a good price for it Journey to the West I really have nothing else the Dragon King repliedAs he was speaking his dragon wife and dragon daughters came in from the back of the palace and said Your Majesty by the look of him this sage must be really somebodyThe piece of miraculous iron that anchors the Milkey Way in place has been shining with a lovely rosy glow for the last few days and creating a most auspicious atmospherePerhaps it has started to shine to greet this sage That piece of miraculous iron is one of the nails that Yu the Great used to fix the depths of rivers and seas when he brought the waters under control said the Dragon King What use could it be Never mind whether its useful or not his wife replied Just give it to him and let him do with it as he pleasesAt least youll get him out of the palace The Dragon King did as she suggested and described the piece of iron to Sun Wukong who said Bring it out and let me see It cant be movedYou will have to go and look at it yourself exalted Immortal Where is itTake me there said Sun Wukong The Dragon King took him into the middle of the sea treasury where all of a sudden they could see ten thousand rays of golden lightPointing at it the Dragon King said Thats it where all the light is coming from Sun Wukong hitched up his clothes and went to give it a feelHe found that it was an iron pillar about as thick as a measure for a peck of grain and some twenty feet longSeizing it with both hands he said Its too thick and too longIf it were a bit shorter and thinner it would do As soon as these words were out of his mouth this precious piece of iron became several feet shorter and a few inches thinnerSun Wukong tossed it in his hands remarking that it would be even better if it were thinner stillThe precious iron thereupon became even thinnerSun Wukong was taking it out of the sea treasury to have a look at it when he saw that it had two gold bands round it while the middle part was made of black iron There was a line of inlaid writing near the bands which said that it was the ASYOUWILL COLDBANDED CUDGEL WEIGHT  POUNDS Sun Wukong was delighted though he did not show itI think that this little darling will do whatever I want As he walked along he weighed it in his hand and said reflectively If it were even smaller still it would be perfect By the time he had taken it outside it was twenty feet long and as thick as a rice bowlWatch him as he uses his magical powers to try a few routines with it whirling all round the crystal palaceThe Old Dragon King was trembling with fright and the little dragons were scared out of their wits Terrapins freshwater turtles seawater turtles and alligators drew in their heads while fish shrimps lobsters and giant turtles hid their facesHolding his treasure in his hands Sun Wukong sat down in the main hall of the palace of crystal and said with a smile to the Dragon King Many thanks worthy neighbour for your great generosity The Old Dragon King humbly acknowledged his thanks and Sun Wukong went on This piece of iron will be very useful but there is one more thing I want to ask What might that be exalted Immortal asked the Dragon KingJourney to the West If I hadnt got this cudgel that would be the end of the matter but as I have got it the problem is that I dont havethe clothes to go with it What are we to do about itIf you have any armour here Id be most obliged if you gave me a suit The Dragon King said he had not anyA guest should not have to trouble two hosts said Sun WukongI wont leave without one Please try some other sea exalted Immortalyou may find one there Its better to stay in one house than to visit three I beg and implore you to give me a suit I really dont have one replied the Dragon KingIf I had I would present it to you If you really havent then Ill try this cudgel out on you Dont hit me exalted Immortal dont hit me pleaded the Dragon King in terrorLet me see whether my brothers have one that they could give you Where do your brothers live They are Ao Qin the Dragon King of the Southern Sea Ao Shun the Dragon King of the Northern Sea and Ao Run the Dragon King of the Southern Sea Im damned if Im going thereas the saying goes Two in the pocket is better than three owing So be a good chap and give me one There is no need for you to go lofty Immortal the Dragon King replied I have an iron drum and a bronze bellIn an emergency we strike them to bring my brothers here in an instant In that case said Sun Wukong hurry up and sound them And indeed an alligator general struck the bell while a terrapin marshal beat the drumThe sound of the bell and the drum startled the other three dragon kings who had arrived and were waiting together outside within the instantOne of them Ao Qin said Elder Brother whats upWhy the drum and the bell It hurts me to tell you brother the Old Dragon King repliedTheres this socalled heavenborn sage from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit who came here this morning saying that I was his neighbour then demanded a weaponI offered him a steelpronged spear but he said it was too small and a patterned halberd that he said was too lightThen he picked up the miraculous iron that fastens the Milky Way and tried a few movements with itNow hes sitting in the palace and demanding a suit of armour but we havent got one Thats why I used the bell and the drum to call you here You three must have some armourPlease give him a suit then we can get rid of him When Ao Qin heard this he said in a fury To arms brothers Arrest the criminal NoIts out of the question said the Old Dragon KingIf that iron cudgel of his gets you youre done for if it hits you die if it comes close your skin is broken and if it so much as brushes against you your sinews are smashed Ao Run the Dragon King of the Western Sea said Second brother you must not attack him Instead we should put a suit of armour together for him then send him awayWe can send a memorial about it to Heaven then Heaven will of course punish him Journey to the West Youre right said Ao Shun the Dragon King of the Northern SeaI have a pair of lotusroot cloudwalking shoes Ive brought a suit of golden chain mail said Ao Run the Dragon King of the Western SeaAnd I have a phoenixwinged purple gold helmet added Ao Qin the Dragon King of the Southern SeaThe Old Dragon King was very pleased and he brought them into the palace to meet Sun Wukong and present the equipment to himSun Wukong put on the golden helmet and the armour and the cloudwalking shoes then charged out waving his cudgel and saying to the dragons My apologies for disturbing you The four Dragon Kings were most indignant but we will not go into their discussions on the protest they sent to HeavenWatch the Monkey King as he parts the waters and goes straight back to the iron bridge where the four senior apes can be seen waiting for him at the head of the monkey hostSun Wukong suddenly leapt out of the waves without a drop of water on him and gleaming with goldAs he came across the bridge the monkeys were so astonished that they fell to their knees and said How splendid you look Your Majesty how splendid Sun Wukong his face lit up with youthful vigor climbed up to his throne thrust his cudgel into the ground in their midstThe foolish monkeys all tried to grab this treasure but it was as futile as a dragonfly trying to shake an iron tree they were unable to move it in the slightestBiting their fingers and sticking out their tongues they said Grandpa its so heavy how can you possibly lift it Sun Wukong went over lifted it with one hand and laughed as he said to them Everything has its rightful ownerThis little treasure has been lying in the sea treasury for goodness knows how many thousands of years but it just happened to start shining this yearThe Dragon King thought it was just a piece of ordinary iron and said it was the miraculous treasure that holds the bed of the Milky Way in placeNone of his men could move it so he had to ask me to go and fetch it myselfIt was more than twenty feet long then and as thick as a peckmeasureWhen I picked it up I felt that it was too big and it shrank till it was several times as smallI told it to get even smaller and it did that too then I told it to get smaller still and it got many times smaller againI hurried out into the light of day to look at it and I saw that there was an inscription on it that read ASYOUWILL GOLDBANDED CUDGEL WEIGHT  POUNDSStand aside and Ill make it change again Holding his treasure in his hand he said Shrink shrink shrink and it became as small as an embroidery needle tiny enough to be hidden in his earYour Majesty the monkeys cried out in astonishment bring it out and play with it again So the Monkey King brought it out of his ear again laid it on the palm of his hand and said Grow grow grow It became as thick as a peck again and twenty feet long Now that he was really enjoying himself he bounded over the bridge and went out of the caveClasping his treasure he used some of his heaven and earth magic bowed and shouted Grow He became a hundred thousand feet tall his head was as big as a mountain his waist like a range of hills his eyes flashed like lightning his mouth seemed to be a bowl of blood and his teeth were as swords and halberds the cudgel in his hands reached up to the Thirtythird Heaven and down to the Eighteenth HellThe tigers leopards and wolves the beasts of the mountain and the seventytwo monster kings all kowtowed and Journey to the West bowed in terror trembling so much that they went out of their mindsA moment later he reverted to his proper size turned his treasure into an embroidery needle hid it in his ear and went back to the caveThe panicstricken kings of the monsters all came to offer their congratulationsThere was a great display of banners and drums and the air resounded to the sound of gongs and bells Rare delicacies were set out in great quantities cups brimmed with coconut toddy and the wine of the grape and the Monkey King feasted and drank with his people for a long time Then training went on as beforeThe Monkey King named the four senior apes as his four Stalwart Generals he named the two barebottomed apes Marshal Ma and Marshal Liu and called the two gibbons General Beng and General BaHe entrusted the stockade questions of discipline and rewards to these fourThus freed from cares he mounted the clouds and rode the mists wandering round the four seas and enjoying the thousand mountainsHe practiced his martial arts visited many a hero used his magical powers and made a wide and distinguished circle of friendsHe met with six sworn brothers of his the Bull Demon King the Salamander Demon King the Roc Demon King the Camel King the Macaque King and the Lion King With him included they made sevenFor days on end they talked about politics and war passed round the goblet strummed sang piped danced went off on days out together and enjoyed themselves in every possible wayA journey of thousands of miles seemed to them to be no more than a walk in the courtyardIt could be said that they traveled a thousand miles in the time it takes to nod ones head and covered three hundred with a twist of the waistOne day he instructed his four Stalwart Generals to arrange a feast for the six other kings Oxen and horses were slaughtered sacrifices were made to Heaven and Earth and the assembled monsters danced sang and drank themselves blottoWhen he had seen the six kings out and tipped his senior and junior officials Sun Wukong lay himself down under the shade of the pines beside the bridge and was asleep in an instantThe four Stalwart Generals made the others stand round and guard him and they all kept their voices downIn his sleep the Handsome Monkey King saw two men approach him with a piece of paper in their hands on which was written Sun Wukong Without allowing any explanations they tied up his soul and dragged it staggering along till they reached a city wallThe Monkey King who was gradually recovering from his drunken stupor looked up and saw an iron plate on the wall on which was inscribed WORLD OF DARKNESS in large lettersIn a flash of realization he said The World of Darkness is where King Yama livesWhy have I come here Your life in the world above is due to end now his escorts said and we were ordered to fetch you To this the Monkey King replied I have gone beyond the Three Worlds and I am no longer subject to the Five Elements I dont come under King Yamas jurisdictionHow dare you grab me you idiots But the fetchers of the dead just went on tugging at him determined to drag him insideThe Monkey King lost his temper pulled his treasure out of his ear and gave it a shake It became as thick as a rice bowlIt only took a slight movement of his arm to smash the two fetchers of the dead to pulpHe untied his bonds loosed his hands and charged into the city whirling his cudgel so terrifying the oxheaded and horsefaced devils that they fled in all directions for coverAll the devil soldiers rushed to the Senluo Palace and reported Your Majesty disaster disasterA hairyfaced thundergod is attacking us out there Stricken by panic the Ten Kings who sit in the ten palaces judging the criminal cases of the dead hurriedly straightened their clothing and went out to lookWhen they saw his ferocious expression they lined up in order and shouted at the tops of their voices Please tell us your name exalted Immortal Journey to the West If you dont know who I am replied the Monkey King then why did you send men to bring me here We wouldnt dare do such a thingThe messengers must have made a mistake I am Sun Wukong the Heavenborn sage of the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and FruitWhat are your posts We are the ten kings Tell me your names at once if you dont want a bashing To this the ten kings replied We are the King of Qinguang the King of Chujiang King Songdi King Wuguan King Yama King Impartial the King of Mount Tai the Metropolitan King the King of Biancheng and the King of the Everturning Wheel To this Sun Wukong replied You are all kings and have esoteric understanding so why dont you know any betterI Sun Wukong have cultivated the Way of Immortality and will live as long as Heaven Ive soared beyond the Three Worlds and leapt outside the Five Elements so why did you send your men to get me Please dont be angry lofty Immortal the ten kings saidMany people in the world share the same name so perhaps the fetchers of the dead went to the wrong place Nonsense nonsenseAs the saying goes The magistrate may be wrong and the sergeant may be wrong but the man who comes to get you is never wrong Go and get the Register of Life and Death for me to see The Ten Kings invited him to come into the palace and look through itSun Wukong went into the Senluo Palace with his club in his hand and sat down in the middle of the hall facing SouthThe Ten Kings then ordered the presiding judge to fetch the register and the judge hastened to his office and brought out five or six documents and ten registersHe looked through them all one by one but could not find Sun Wukongs name in the sections devoted to hairless creatures hairy creatures feathered creatures insects or scaly creatures Then he looked through the monkey sectionNow although monkeys looked like men they were not entered under the humans although they were like the hairless creatures they did not live within their boundaries although they were like running animals they were not under the jurisdiction of the unicorn and although they were like birds they were not ruled by the phoenixThere was another register and Sun Wukong looked through this one himself Under Soul No  was the name of Sun Wukong the Heavenborn stone monkey who was destined to live to the age of  and die a good death I wont write down any number of years said Sun WukongIll just erase my name and be done with itBring me a brush The judge hastily handed him a brush and thick black inkSun Wukong took the register crossed out all the names in the monkey section and threw it on the floor with the words The accounts closed Thats an end of itWe wont come under your control any longer Then he cudgeled his way out of the World of DarknessThe Ten Kings dared not go near him and they all went to the Azure Cloud Palace to bow in homage to the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha and discuss the report they would send up to Heaven But we will not go into thisAfter charging out through the city wall the Monkey King tripped over a clump of grass tried to regain his balance and woke up with a start It had all been a dreamAs he stretched himself he heard his four Stalwart Generals and the other monkeys saying Your Majesty time to wake up You drank too much and slept all night Journey to the West Never mind about my sleepingI dreamt that two men came for me They dragged me to the citywall of the World of Darkness where I came roundI showed them my magic powers and went yelling all the way to the Senluo Palace where I had an argument with those Ten Kings and looked through the Register of Life and Death of us Wherever there was mention of your names in the register I crossed them outWe wont come under the jurisdiction of those idiots any more All the monkeys kowtowed to him in gratitudeThe reason why from that time on so many mountain monkeys have never grown old is that their names are not on the books of the officials of the UnderworldWhen the Handsome Monkey King had finished telling his story the four Stalwart Generals informed the other monster kings who all came to offer their felicitationsA few days later his six sworn brothers also came to congratulate him and all were delighted to hear how he had struck the names off the books We will not describe the daily feasts that followedInstead we will describe how one day the Supreme Heavenly Sage the Greatly Compassionate Jade Emperor of the Azure Vault of Heaven was sitting on his throne in the Hall of Miraculous Mist in the Goldengated Cloud Palace surrounded by his immortal civil and military officials at morning court when the Immortal Qiu Hongji reported Your Majesty Ao Guang the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea has presented a memorial outside the Hall of Universal Brightness and is awaiting a summons from your Imperial Majesty The Jade Emperor ordered that he be called in and the Dragon King came to the Hall of Miraculous MistWhen he had done obeisance an immortal page came from the side to take his memorialThe Jade Emperor read it through It ranYour Subject Ao Guang the Humble Dragon of the Eastern Sea of the Eastern Continent of Superior Body in the Nether Watery Regions Reports to the Jade Emperor of the Azure Vault of Heaven Recently one Sun Wukong an immortal fiend born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit now living in the Water Curtain Cave bullied this humble dragon and occupied my watery house by forceHe demanded a weapon by displaying magical prowess he insisted on having armour by showing off his evil powersHe terrified the watery tribe and made the tortoises and alligators flee in terrorThe dragon of the Southern Sea trembled the dragon of the Western Sea was made miserable the dragon of the Northern Sea had to hang his head and come in submission and I your subject Ao Guang humbled myself before himWe had to present him with a miraculous iron cudgel a golden phoenixwinged helmet a suit of chain mail and a pair of cloudwalking shoes and we escorted him out politelyHe continued to show off his martial arts and magic powers and all he had to say for himself was My apologies for disturbing you There is truly no match for him and he is uncontrollableYour subject now presents this memorial and respectfully awaits your sage decisionI humbly beg that heavenly soldiers be sent to arrest this evil demon so that the sea and the mountains may be at peace and the ocean may enjoy tranquillityJourney to the West When the Jade Emperor had read this through he ordered Let the Dragon God return to the Sea we shall send generals to arrest the demon The Old Dragon King bowed till his head touched the floor and took his leaveThen the Venerable Immortal Ge a heavenly teacher reported Your Majesty the King of Qinguang one of the ministers of the Underworld has come with a memorial from the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha A jade girl messenger took the memorial which the Jade Emperor read through It ranThe regions of darkness are the negative part of the EarthHeaven contains gods while the Earth has devils Positive and Negative are in a constant cycleBirds and beasts are born and die male and female alternateLife is created and change takes place male and female are conceived and born this is the order of nature and it cannot be changedNow the evil spirit the Heavenborn monkey of the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit is presently giving full rein to his wicked nature committing murders and refusing to submit to disciplineHe killed the devil messengers of the Ninth Hell with his magic and he terrified the Ten Benevolent Kings of the Underworld with his powerHe made an uproar in the Senluo Palace and crossed some names out by forceHe has made the race of monkeys completely uncontrollable and given eternal life to the macaquesHe has annulled the law of transmigration and brought them beyond birth and deathI impoverished monk that I am importune the might of Heaven by presenting this memorialI prostrate myself to beg that Heavenly soldiers be despatched to subdue this fiend bring the positive and Negative back into order and give lasting security to the UnderworldWhen the Jade Emperor had read this through he ordered Let the Lord of Darkness return to the Underworld We shall send generals to arrest the demon The King of Qinguang then bowed till his head touched the floor and took his leaveHis Celestial Majesty then asked all his civil and military officials When was this monkey demon bornWhat is his origin that he should have such powers Before he had finished speaking Thousandmile Eye and Windaccompanying Ear came forward from the ranks of officials and said This demon monkey is the stone monkey who was born of heaven three hundred years agoAt the time nobody paid any attention to him and we do not know where he refined himself and became an Immortal in recent years so that he has been able to make the tigers and dragons submit to him and to strike his name off the register of the dead Which divine general shall be sent down to capture him asked the Jade Emperor and before he had finished speaking the Great White Planet stepped forward bowed down and submitted All beings in the upper worlds that have nine apertures can become ImmortalsThis monkey has a body that was created by Heaven and Earth and conceived by the sun and moon His head touches they sky and his feet stand on the earth he drinks the dew and eats the mist How does he differ from humans if he has succeeded in cultivating the way of immortality and can subdue dragons and tigersI beg Your Majesty to remember your lifegiving mercy and hand down a sage edict of amnesty and enlistment summoning him to this upper world and inscribing his name on the list of officeholders thus keeping him here under controlIf he obeys Your Majestys heavenly commands he can later be promoted and if he disobeys he can be arrestedThis will both avoid military operations and be a way of winning over an Immortal The Jade Emperor delighted with the suggestion ordered that it should be put into effectHe told the Wenqu Star Officer to compose the edict and commanded the Great White planet to persuade the monkey to accept Journey to the West the amnestyThe Great White Planet left Heaven by the Southern Gate and brought his propitious cloud down by the Water Curtain Cave where he said to the little monkeys I am an envoy from Heaven and I am carrying a divine edict inviting your great king to the upper worldGo and tell him at once The little monkeys outside conveyed the message by relays into the depths of the cave Your Majesty theres an old man outside carrying a document on his back He says hes an envoy from Heaven with an invitation for you The Handsome Monkey King was delightedHe said Id been thinking of going up to Heaven to have a look round for the past couple of days and now a heavenly envoy has come to invite me Ask him in at once he shouted hastily straightening his clothes and going out to meet the envoyThe Planet came straight in stood facing the South and said I am the Great White Planet of the West and I have come down to earth with an Edict of Amnesty and enlistment from the Jade Emperor to invite you to Heaven to be given office as an Immortal I am very grateful to you venerable Planet for condescending to come here replied Sun Wukong with a smile then he told his subjects to prepare a feast to entertain the visitorIm afraid I cant delay replied the Planet as I am carrying a divine edict so may I ask Your Majesty to come back with me nowWe can talk at leisure after your glorious elevation Thank you for coming said Sun WukongIm sorry you couldnt take some refreshments before leaving Then he called for his four Stalwart Generals and ordered them Give my sons and grandsons a thorough trainingWhen Ive had a look round in Heaven Ill take you all to live with me up there The four Stalwart Generals accepted their orders and the Monkey King made his cloud carry him up above the cloudsHe was Raised to a highranking heavenly office Listed among the courtiers in the cloudsIf you dont know what office he was given listen to the explanation in the next installmentDissatisfied at Being Appointed Protector of the Horses Not Content with the Title of Equal of Heaven The Great White Planet left the depths of the cave with the Handsome Monkey King and they ascended together on their cloudsAs Sun Wukongs somersault cloud was exceptionally fast he reached the Southern Gate of Heaven first leaving the Great White planet far behindJust as he was putting away his cloud to go in his way was barred by the Heavenly Guardian Virudhaka and his powerful heavenly soldiers Liu Gou Bi Journey to the West Deng Xin Zhang and Tao who blocked the gate of Heaven with their spears and swords and refused to let him inThis old Great White planet is a trickster said Sun Wukong He invited me here so he has no business to have me kept out with spears and swords Just as he was kicking up a row the Planet suddenly arrivedSun Wukong flung his accusation at him Why did you play this trick on me you old fogyYou told me you came with an Edict of Amnesty from the Jade Emperor to invite me here so why did you arrange for these people not to let me in through the gate of Heaven The Great White Planet laughed Dont be angry Your MajestyYouve never been here before your name is not on the books here and the heavenly soldiers have never met you Of course they could not let you in just for the askingBut when youve seen His Celestial Majesty and been given office among the Immortals you will be able to come and go as you wish and nobody will try to stop you Be that as it may said Sun Wukong Im not going in The Great White Planet would not let him go and asked him to go in with him in spite of it allAs they approached the gate the Planet shouted Heavenly officers of the gates of Heaven sergeants and soldiers let us inThis is an Immortal from the lower world and I am carrying an edict from the Jade Emperor summoning him here Only then did the Heavenly King Zengzhang and his soldiers withdraw their arms and stand backNow the Monkey King began to trust the Great White Planet He walked slowly in with him and looked at the viewTruly it was his First ascent to the upper world Sudden entry into paradiseTen thousand beams of golden light shone with a reddish glow A thousand strands of propitious vapour puffed out purple mistSee the Southern Gate of Heaven Deep green Crystalline Shimmering bright Studded with jewelsOn either side stood scores of heavenly marshals Tall as the roofbeams next to the pillars Holding metaltipped bows and bannersAll around stood gods in golden armour Journey to the West Brandishing their clubs and halberds Wielding their cutlasses and swordsThe outside was remarkable enough But the inside astonished him Here were several mighty pillars Round which coiled tawnybearded dragons their gold scales gleaming in the sunThere were long bridges Where strutted phoenixes brilliant of plumage and with bright red crestsA rosy glow shone with heavenly light Thick green mists obscured the Pole StarIn this heaven there are thirtythree heavenly palaces The Palace of Clouds Dispersed the Vaisravana Palace the palace of Five Lores the Sun Palace the Palace of Flowery Bliss Every palace had golden animals on its roofThen there were seventytwo precious halls The Hall of Morning Audience the Hall of Rising into Space the Precious Light Hall the Hall of the Heavenly Kings the Hall of the Master of Miracles Jade unicorns on every columnOn the Terrace of the Star of Longevity Grew flowers that never witherBeside the Stove for Decocting Elixir Were herbs that stay green for everIn front of the Facing the Sage pavilion Crimson gauze clothes Glittered like stars Lotus hats Shone with gold and jadeJourney to the West Jade hairpins and pearlsewn shoes Golden seals on purple cordsAs the golden bell tolled The three classes of divinities approached the steps and submitted memorialsAs the heavenly drum was beaten Ten thousand sage kings attended the Jade EmperorThen they entered the Hall of Miraculous Mist Where jade doors were studded with gold And phoenixes danced before the crimson gatesWinding arcades Everywhere carved in openwork Layer on Layer of eaves With dragons and phoenixes soaringOn top was a majestically purple Bright Perfectly round And dazzling Golden gourdshaped finial Below fans hung from the hands of heavenly consorts While jade maidens proffered magic clothesFerocious The heavenly generals guarding the court Majestic The immortal officials protecting the throneIn the middle were set Crystal dishes Filled to overflowing with Great Monad Pills Journey to the West Agate jars In which stood twisted coral treesAll the wonderful things in Heaven were there None of which are seen on EarthGolden gates silver chariots and a purple palace Precious plants jade flowers and jasper petalsThe jade hares of the princes at court ran past the alter The golden rooks of the sages present flew down lowThe Monkey King was fated to come to Heaven Rather than be sullied by the mortal worldThe Great White Planet led the Handsome Monkey King to the outside of the Hall of Miraculous Mist He went straight in to the imperial presence without waiting to be summoned and did obeisance to the throneSun Wukong stood bolt upright beside him not bothering with any court etiquette but just concentrating on listening to the Great White Planet make his report to the Jade EmperorIn obedience to the Divine Edict your subject has brought the demon Immortal here The Jade Emperor lowered his curtain and asked And which of you is the demon Immortal Me replied Sun Wukong only now making a slight bowThe faces of the officials went white with horror as they exclaimed What a savage monkey He has the impudence to answer Me and without even prostrating himself firstHe must die In reply to this the Jade Emperor announced Sun Wukong is a demon Immortal of the lower world who has only just obtained human form so he is not acquainted with court procedureWe shall forgive him this time We thank you for your mercy said the immortal ministersOnly then did Sun Wukong express his respect by bowing low and chanting naaaw at the top of his voiceThe Jade Emperor ordered his immortal civil and military officials to find a vacancy in some department for Sun WukongThe Star Lord Wuqu stepped forward form the side and reported There are no vacancies in any of the palaces halls and departments of Heaven except for a superintendent in the Imperial Stables Then make him Protector of the Horses ordered the Jade EmperorAll the ministers thanked him for his mercy apart from Sun Wukong who just expressed his respect with a loud naaaw The Jade Emperor then told the Wood Planet to take him to the Imperial StablesJourney to the West The Wood Planet accompanied the delighted Monkey King to his post and then went back to the palaceThe Monkey King then called together the deputy and the assistant superintendent the bookkeeper the grooms and all the other officials high and low to find out about the duties of his department He found that he had to look after a thousand heavenly horsesChestnuts and stallions Courser and chargersDragon and Purple Swallow Pegasus and Sushun Jueti and Silver Yaoniao and Flying Yellow Taotu and Feathers Red Hare and Faster Than Light Dazzler and Horizon Mistsoarer and Victory Windchaser and Matchless Flying Wing and Galloping Mist Lazy Whirlwind and Red Lightning Bronze Cup and Drifting Cloud Skewbald and TigerStripe Dustfree and Purple Scales The Four Ferghana Steeds The Eight Chargers and Nine Gallopers Coursers that can cover three hundred miles All these fine horses were Neighing in the wind chasing the lightning mighty in spirit Pawing the mist climbing the clouds great in their strengthJourney to the West The Monkey King looked through the register and counted the horsesIn the stables the bookkeeper was responsible for ordering the fodder the head groom was in charge of currying the horses chopping up and cooking the fodder and giving them water the deputy superintendent and his assistant helped to oversee the workThe Protector of the Horses looked after his charges sleeping neither by day nor by nightIt is true that he fooled around by day but at night he looked after the animals with great diligence waking them up and making them eat whenever they fell asleep and leading those still on their feet to the troughAt the sight of him the heavenly horses would prick up their ears and paw the ground and they became fat and plumpThus more than half a month slipped byOn one morning that was a holiday all the officials of the stables held a feast both to welcome and congratulate the Protector of the HorsesIn the middle of the party the Monkey King suddenly put down his cup and asked What sort of office is this Protector of the Horses What the name suggests thats all Which official grading does it carry Unclassified What does unclassified mean Bottom grade the others replied going on to explain It is a very low and unimportant office and all you can do in it is look after the horsesEven someone who works as conscientiously as Your Honour and gets the horses so fat will get no more reward than someone saying good and if anything goes at all wrong you will be held responsible and if the losses are serious you will be fined and punished The Monkey King flared up on hearing this gnashed his teeth and said in a great rage How dare they treat me with such contemptOn the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit I am a king and a patriarch How dare he trick me into coming here to feed his horses for himIts a low job for youngsters not for meI wont do it I wontIm going back He pushed the table over with a crash took his treasure out of his ear and shook it It became as thick as a rice bowl and he brandished it as he charged out of the Imperial Stables to the Southern Gate of HeavenAs the celestial guards knew that his name was on the register of immortal officials they did not dare to block his path but let him out through the gateHe descended by cloud and was back on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in an instantSeeing the four Stalwart Generals and all the kings of the monsters drilling their troops there he shouted in a shrill voice Children Im back The monkeys all bowed to him took him into the heart of the cave and asked him to sit on his throne while they prepared a banquet to welcome him backCongratulations Your Majesty they all said After over a dozen years up there you must be coming back in glory and triumph What do you mean over a dozen years asked the Monkey KingIve only been away for a fortnight or so Your Majesty cant have noticed the time passing in heavenA day in heaven lasts as long as a year on earthMay we ask what office you held Journey to the West It hurts me to tell you replied the Monkey King with a wave of his hand I feel thoroughly humiliatedThat Jade Emperor doesnt know how to use a good man A man like meProtector of the Horses That meant I had to feed his animals for him and wasnt even given an official gradingI didnt know this at first so I fooled around in the Imperial Stables until today when I found out from my colleagues how low the job wasI was so angry that I pushed the table over and quit the jobThats why Ive come back Quite right too the other monkeys saidYour Majesty can be king in our cave paradise and enjoy as much honour and pleasure as you like so why go and be his groom Then they gave orders for wine to be brought at once to cheer their king upAs they were drinking someone came in to report Your Majesty there are two Singlehorned Devil Kings outside who want to see you Ask them in said the Monkey King and the two formallydressed devil kings hurried into the cave and prostrated themselvesWhy have you come to see me asked the Handsome Monkey King and they replied We have long heard that Your Majesty is looking for men of talent but we were unable to see you beforeNow that Your Majesty has been given heavenly office and come back in triumph we would like to offer you this yellow robe as a token of our congratulationsWe also hope that you will not reject us although we are low and worthless but will accept our humble services An exultant Monkey King put on the yellow robe and his happy subjects bowed to him in order of precedenceThe two devil kings were appointed Commanders of the Van and when they had thanked the Monkey King for this they asked What office did Your Majesty hold while you were all that time in Heaven The Jade Emperor has no respect for talent replied the Monkey KingHe made me something called Protector of the Horses Your Majesty has such miraculous powers you should never have been feeding his horses for himYou should have been made a Great Sage Equaling Heaven shouldnt you The Monkey King was beside himself with delight at this suggestion and he kept saying how splendid it wasGet me a banner made at once with the words Great Sage Equaling Heaven in big letters on it and put up a pole to hang it from he ordered his four Stalwart GeneralsFrom now on I am to be called Great Sage Equaling Heaven not Your Majesty or King Pass this order on to all the other kings of the monsters We will leave him at this pointWhen the Jade Emperor held his morning court the next day the Heavenly Teacher Zhang led the deputy and assistant superintendents of the Imperial Stables to the vermilion steps bowed low and reported Your Majesty Sun Wukong the new Protector of the Horses left Heaven yesterday because he thought his office was too humble Just as he was speaking the Heavenly Guardian Virudhaka came from the Southern Gate of Heaven with his heavenly soldiers and reported The Protector of the Horses has gone out through the gateWe do not know why On hearing this the Jade Emperor commanded Let the two divine officials return to their posts we shall send heavenly soldiers to capture this devil Journey to the West The pagodabearing Heavenly King Li Jing and Prince Nezha stepped forward from the ranks of those attending the audience and they memorialized Your Imperial Majesty we beg you to command us your incompetent servants to subdue this fiend The Emperor was delighted with this suggestion and he appointed the Pagodabearing Heavenly King as Demon quelling High Marshal and Prince Nezha as Great God of the Seas He told them to take their forces down to the lower world at onceHeavenly King Li and Nezha kowtowed took their leave went straight back to their own palace and assembled their troops commanders and officers They put the Mighty Miracle God in charge of the vanguard and General Fishbelly in command of the rear while General Yaksa was made adjutantWithin an instant they were outside the Southern Gate of Heaven and they went straight to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit They chose a piece of level and open ground on which to construct a fortified camp and ordered the Mighty Miracle God to issue the challenge to battleOn receiving this order the Mighty Miracle God tied on his armour firmly and went to the Water Curtain Cave holding his flowerspreading battleaxeWhen he got there he saw huge numbers of devilswolves tigers and leopardswielding spears brandishing swords leaping around fighting each other and making a great noise outside the little entrance to the caveAccursed beasts shouted the Mighty Miracle God tell the Protector of the Horses at once that I am a heavenly general come on the orders of the Jade Emperor to subdue himIf you make him come out and surrender immediately it will save the lot of you from being wiped out The devils went rushing into the cave and reported Disaster disaster What disaster the Monkey King askedTheres a heavenly general outside who says hes come on the orders of the Jade Emperor to subdue youIf you go out and surrender immediately he says hell spare our lives Fetch me my armour said the Monkey KingHe then donned his golden helmet tied on his golden armour put on his cloudwalking shoes and took his AsYouWill goldbanded cudgel in his hand He led his troops out of the cave and drew them up in battle arrayThe Mighty Miracle God gazed wideeyed at the excellent Monkey King On his body was gleaming golden armour On his head a dazzling golden helmet In his hand a goldbanded club On his feet a pair of cloudwalking shoes to matchHis devil eyes shone like stars His ears were long and hardHis sturdy frame could be transformed at will His voice rang clearly as a bellThe sharpmouthed Horse Protector with protruding teeth Journey to the West Wanted to become a Sage Equaling HeavenThe Mighty Miracle God shouted in a harsh voice Insolent apeDont you recognize me The Great Sage Sun Wukong replied at once Ive never met you beforeHow should I know which wretched little deity you are Tell me your name at once Ill get you you conceited baboonSo you dont know who I amI am the Heavenly General Mighty Miracle the commander of the vanguard for Heavenly King Li the Pagodabearer I have come here on the orders of the Jade Emperor to accept your surrenderTake off your armour at once and submit to the mercy of Heaven or Ill wipe out every animal on the mountainAnd if you so much as hint at a refusal Ill smash you to powder Stop talking so big you lousy god retorted the furious Monkey King and give that long tongue of yours a restId just love to kill you with this cudgel of mine but if I did thered be no one to deliver my message for me so Ill spare your lifeHurry back to Heaven and tell that Jade Emperor that he doesnt know how to use a good manWhy did he make me waste my infinite powers on feeding his horses for himTake a look at whats written on my standardIf hes willing to give me this title officially Ill call off my troops and let Heaven and Earth continue in peace but if he refuses Im coming up to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to knock him off his dragon throne When the Mighty Miracle God heard this he looked hard and saw that a tall pole had been planted outside the entrance to the cave on which hung a banner reading GREAT SAGE EQUALING HEAVENHeh heh heh he mocked you ignorant apeWhat shameless effrontery to want to be a Great Sage Equaling Heaven Take that He swung with his battleaxe at the Monkey King who quite unflustered parried with his gold banded cudgelIt was a fine battle The cudgel was called AsYouWill The axe was named Flower SpreaderAs soon as the two met You could not tell which was better Axe and club Locked togetherOne was concealing his magic powers One was a bigmouthed boasterThey used their magic To breathe out cloud and mist Journey to the West When they opened their hands They scattered sand and dustThe heavenly general was a master of magic Endless were the changes the Monkey King could makeWhen the cudgel was raised it was like a dragon playing in the water As the axe came down it was a phoenix among the flowers Although the fame of Miracle was known throughout the world His skill was no match for his enemyIf the Great Sage lightly twirled his club A mere touch would paralyze The Mighty Miracle God was no match for his opponentHe hastened to block the Monkey Kings first blow with his axe which broke in two with a crunchHe fled for his life as fast as he could and the Monkey King said mockingly You bag of pus Ill spare you this timeHurry back with my message and look sharp about it The Mighty Miracle God returned to his camp went straight to the Pagodabearing Heavenly King Li Jing knelt before him and said with an awkward laugh The Protector of the Horses has really tremendous magic powers I was no match for himHe beat me and now I have come to take my punishment This fool has ruined our morale exploded the Heavenly King Li in a furyTake him away and off with his head Prince Nezha who was standing to one side stepped forward bowed and said Do not be angry Your MajestyForgive the Mighty Miracle God and let me go and do battle then well see whos boss The heavenly king accepted his advice and told Mighty Miracle God to go back and look after the camp while he awaited his punishmentWhen he had put on his armour and helmet Prince Nezha charged straight out of the camp to the Water Curtain CaveSun Wukong who was just going to pull back his troops saw the ferocity of his onslaughtWhat a fine prince he was His hair in tufts barely covers his scalp His cloak not over his shouldersHow striking his intelligence Journey to the West How elegant his airIndeed he is the scion of a unicorn in Heaven In truth he is a phoenix Immortal from the cloudsThe seed of dragons is different from the common herd This fine youth is not at all like mortalsWith him he carries six divine weapons Endless his transformations as he soars through the airNow he has received an edict from the Jade Emperors mouth Making him Commander of the Three Temples of the MassesSun Wukong went up to him and asked Whose little boy are you thenWhat do you mean charging up to my door Stinking monkey fiend shouted Prince Nezha dont you know who I amI am Nezha the third son of the pagodabearing Heavenly King and I have been commanded by the Jade Emperor to come here and arrest you You do talk big dont you little prince said Sun Wukong laughing at himBut as youve still got all your milk teeth and are still wet behind the ears Ill spare your life and I wont hit youDo you see what it says on my standard Go and tell the Jade Emperor that if he gives me that title Ill call off my armies and submit to him once moreBut if he doesnt do what I want him to Ill surely attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist Nezha looked up and saw the words Great Sage Equaling Heaven You wicked monkeyHow dare you give yourself a title like that whatever your magic powers may beDont worry all youre getting is my sword Give me a few swipes then replied Sun Wukong I wont move Change yelled Nezha in a passion and at once he had three heads and six arms which made him look most ferociousIn his hands he held six weapons a demonbeheading sword a demonhacking cutlass a demonbinding rope a demonquelling pestle an embroidered ball and a firewheeland wielding all these he rushed straight at Sun WukongAt the sight of him Sun Wukong exclaimed with astonishment Well my boy you certainly know a trick or twoBut just behave yourself and watch what I can do Our dear Great Sage shouted Change and he too had three heads and six armsHe shook his goldbanded cudgel and it turned into three cudgels which he gripped with his six hands to ward off Nezhas blowsIt was a great fight and it made the earth shake and the mountains tremble Journey to the West Sixarmed Prince Nezha Heavenborn Monkey King Wellmatched opponents Both in the same classOne sent down to the lower world on a mission The other priding himself as a fighting bullFast moves the point of the demonbeheading sword And evil spirits fear the demonhacking cutlass The demonbinding rope flies like a dragon While the demonquelling pestle has the head of a wolf The firewheel flashes with lightning And the embroidered ball shoots everywhereThe Great Sages three AsYouWill cudgels Block and parry with consummate skillThough many hardfought rounds prove inconclusive The prince refuses to call the battle off Making his six weapons multiply in number He throws them in their millions at the Monkey Kings head But the Monkey King fearless roars with laughter As his iron clubs whirl and think for themselvesOne becomes a thousand one thousand ten Their wild dance fills the sky as if with dragonsAll the demon kings shut their gates in terror Every goblin on the mountain finds some place to hideCloudblack the anger of the heavenly troops Whistling like the wind the goldbanded cudgelsJourney to the West On the one side The bloodcurdling warcries of the heavenly hostOn the other The spinechilling banners of the monkey fiendsBoth parties are equal in fighting courage Neither could be said to be the winnerPrince Nezha and Sun Wukong both used their divine powers to the full as they fought thirty roundsWhen the six weapons of the prince turned into thousands and tens of thousands so did Sun Wukongs goldbanded cudgelThe air was filled as if with drops of rain or shooting stars and there was no way of telling who was winningAs Sun Wukong was deft of hand and quick of eye he plucked one of the hairs from his body in the midst of the fray and shouted Change It changed into his own double to mislead Nezha while his real self leapt round till he was behind Nezha and struck at his left shoulderNezha was in the middle of performing a spell when he heard the whistle of the cudgel through the air and twisted away as fast as he could But he was unable to avoid the blow and had to flee woundedHe brought his magic to an end put his six weapons away reverted to his true appearance and abandoned the field of battle in defeatThis had all been observed by Heavenly King Li who was on the point of sending reinforcements when his son appeared before him and reported in fear and trembling Father the Protector of the Horses is very powerfulMy magic was outclassed and he has wounded me in the shoulder The color drained from the face of the horrorstruck Heavenly King as he said If the creature has magic powers like that how are we going to defeat him Outside the gates of the cave the prince went on to report there is a banner on a pole that reads Great Sage Equaling HeavenHe bragged that if the Jade Emperor gave him this title he would call everything off otherwise he said he would attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist In that case said the Heavenly King well disengage now go back to Heaven and request that more heavenly troops be sent to capture this wretchThere is plenty of time The prince in pain and unable to go on fighting went back to Heaven with the Heavenly King and put in this request but of that no more for the momentWatch as the Monkey King returns to the mountain in triumph to receive the congratulations of the seventytwo kings of the monsters and his six sworn brothers There was great drinking and singing in the cave paradiseSun Wukong said to his six sworn brothers As Ive called myself Great Sage Equaling Heaven you can all call yourselves great sages too Honorable brother youre right roared the Bull Demon KingI shall call myself the Great Sage Matching Heaven Ill be the Great Sage Overturning the Sea said the Salamander Demon KingIll be the Great Sage Throwing Heaven into Confusion said the Roc Demon KingJourney to the West Ill be the Great Sage Who Moves Mountains said the Camel Demon KingIll be the Great Sage Who Travels with the Wind said the Macaque KingAnd Ill be the Great Sage Who Drives Away Gods said the Lion KingThe seven great sages then did just as they pleased and gave themselves the titles they chose and after enjoying themselves all day they went homeHeavenly King Li and Prince Nezha led their forces straight to the Palace of Miraculous Mist and made this request We your subjects took our forces down to the lower world under your Divine Edict to subdue the immortal fiend Sun Wukong But to our surprise we found that his magical powers were too farreaching for us to be able to defeat himWe therefore hope that Your Imperial Majesty will send more troops to exterminate him How could a mere monkey goblin have such great powers that you actually need more troops asked the Jade EmperorPrince Nezha then came forward and memorialized We beg Your Majesty to spare us the deaths we deserveThat monkey fiend has an iron cudgel that he used to defeat the Mighty Miracle God and wounded me on the shoulderHe has set a banner up outside the entrance to his cave that reads Great Sage Equaling Heaven and he says that if you give him this office he will stop fighting and submit otherwise he will attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist When the Jade Emperor heard this he asked in horror How dare that monkey fiend talk so wildlySend all the generals to execute him at once As he spoke the Great White Planet stepped forward from the ranks of officials That monkey fiend knows how to talk he suggested but he has no idea about real powerIf more soldiers were sent to fight him they might not be able to overcome him at once and their energies would be wastedBut if Your Imperial Majesty were to show your great mercy you could send down a pacificatory amnesty and let him be a Great Sage Equaling HeavenIt would only be an empty title that he was given just an honorary appointment What do you mean by an honorary appointment asked the Jade EmperorHe would be called a Great Sage Equaling Heaven but he would not be given any responsibility or paid any salary He would be kept between Heaven and Earth where his evil nature would be under control and he would be kept from wickednessThus Heaven and Earth can be at peace while sea and sky enjoy tranquillity The Jade Emperor approved this suggestion and ordered that a new edict should be issued for the Great White Planet to deliverThe Great White Planet left once more through the Southern Gate of Heaven and went straight to have a look at the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and FruitIt was quite different from before There was an aweinspiring and spinechilling atmosphere and every kind of fiend was presentThey were roaring and leaping around with their swords spears cutlasses and stavesAs soon as they saw the Great White Planet they all went for him Will your commander please come forward said the PlanetI would trouble you to inform your Great Sage that I am a heavenly envoy sent by the Jade Emperor and I am carrying a divine edict with an invitation for him Journey to the West The fiends rushed in to report Theres an old man outside who says hes come from Heaven with an edict of invitation for you When Sun Wukong heard this he said Im glad hes comeI expect hes that Great White Planet who came beforeAlthough I wasnt given a decent job last time I went to Heaven I did get up there and learn my way aroundIf its him again his intentions must be good He told his commanders to put on a big display of banners and drums and to turn out a guard of honour to welcome himThen the Great Sage wearing his helmet his yellow robe over his armour and his cloudwalking shoes hurried out of the cave at the head of his monkey host bowed in greeting and shouted in a loud voice Please come in venerable PlanetForgive me for not being here to welcome you The Planet walked straight into the cave stood facing the South and said Great Sage when you left the Imperial Stables because you found the post too humble the officials of that department naturally reported the matter to the Jade EmperorThe Jade Emperor decreed that all officials have to work their way up from the bottom and asked why you objected to its being humbleAfter this Heavenly King Li took Nezha down to the lower world to do battle with youYour divine powers Great Sage were more than they expected and they suffered defeat On their return to Heaven they reported that you had set up a banner and wanted to be a Great Sage Equaling HeavenAll the generals wanted to punish you but I Great Sage ran the risk of punishment by suggesting that the armies should not be called out and that Your Majesty should be given a post insteadThe Jade Emperor approved my memorial and that is why I have come here to invite you I am most grateful for this honour after the trouble I caused you earlier replied Sun Wukong but I am not sure whether there is such a title as Great Sage Equaling Heaven in the upper world After obtaining imperial approval for this title said the Planet I came down bearing a decreeIf anything goes wrong Ill bear the responsibility A highly delighted Sun Wukong tried his hardest to persuade the Planet to stay to a banquet but without success so he went with him by propitious cloud to the Southern Gate of HeavenThe heavenly generals and soldiers all greeted them with respectfully folded arms and they went straight to the Hall of Miraculous MistThe Great White Planet did obeisance and said In obedience to the imperial edict your subject has summoned Sun Wukong the Protector of the Horses and he is present Let Sun Wukong come forward said the Jade EmperorWe do now proclaim you Great Sage Equaling Heaven Your rank is now very highLet there be no more mischief from you The monkey simply chanted naaaw to express his thanks to the EmperorThe Jade Emperor then ordered the two officials in charge of public works Zhang and Lu to build a residence for the Great Sage Equaling Heaven to the left of the Peach Orchard In the residence there were to be two offices a Tranquillity Office and a Calm Divinity OfficeBoth these offices were to have immortal clerks and senior and junior assistantsHe then told the Star Lords of the Constellation Five to escort Sun Wukong to his post and in addition gave him two bottles of imperial wine and ten golden flowers and admonished him to settle down and keep out of mischiefThe Monkey King accepted the order and went that same day with the Star Lords of the Constellation Five to his residence where he opened the bottles of wine and drained them dry with the help of all presentHe then saw the star officials off and returned to his own palace From then on he lived in happiness and content and enjoyed untrammelled pleasure in the PalaceTruly His immortal name was for ever inscribed in the register of eternal life Journey to the West To be transmitted for ten thousand ages free of the wheel of rebirthIf you dont know what happened next listen to the explanation in the next installmentAfter Chaos Among the Peaches the Great Sage Steals the Pills In the Revolt Against Heaven the Gods Capture the Demons The story goes on to relate that the Great Sage Equaling Heaven a mere monkey devil after all was quite satisfied that his name was on the register of office without caring about the grading of his job and his own rank or the size of his salaryThe immortal clerks in the two offices in his residence were in constant attendance on him he had three meals a day and a bed to sleep on at night and he lived a free and easy life without worriesIn his spare time he would visit the other palaces get together with his old friends and make new onesWhen he saw the Three Pure Ones he would address them as venerable and when he met the Four Emperors he called them Your Majesty He was on fraternal terms with the Nine Bright Shiners the Generals of the Five Regions the TwentyEight Constellations the Four Great Heavenly Kings the Gods of the Twelve Branches the Five Ancients of the Five Regions the star ministers of the whole sky and the countless gods of the Milky WayToday he would wander East and tomorrow he would go West coming and going by cloud and never staying anywhere for longWhen the Jade Emperor was holding his morning court one day the Immortal Xu of Jingyang came forward from the body of officials kowtowed and suggested The Great Sage Equaling Heaven is spending his time in idle travel and is making the acquaintance of all the stars in the sky calling them all his friends irrespective of their rank It would be as well to give him some responsibility and prevent his idleness leading to trouble later on The Jade Emperors response to this suggestion was to send for the Monkey King at onceHe came in a cheerful mood and asked What promotion and reward have you summoned me here to receive Your Majesty Seeing that you are idle and have nothing to do replied the Jade Emperor we are giving you a jobYou are to administer the Peach Orchard and you will give it your attention day and night The Great Sage was overjoyed and after expressing his thanks and chanting naaaw he withdrewIn his eagerness to be at work he went straight to the Peach Orchard to have a look roundWhen he got there he was stopped by a local tutelary god who asked him Where are you going Great Sage Ive been put in charge of the Peach Orchard by the Jade Emperor and Ive come to inspect it The local god hastened to greet him formally and he called the men who weeded brought water looked after the trees and swept the grounds to come and kowtow to the Great Sage When Sun Wukong was taken inside this is what he saw Charming Journey to the West Every treeCharming and luxuriant the full blossom Every tree weighed down with fruitThe fruitladen branches bend like cardingbows The blossoming trees are covered with powder and rougeAlways blossoming always in fruit they are ripe for a thousand years They know no summer or winter but linger for everThe early ripeners Look redfaced and tipsy The ones still growing Are green in stalk and skinWhen the dew forms their flesh has a touch of blue While the sun picks out their vermilion beautyBelow the trees exotic flowers grow Bright and unfading throughout the yearOn either side stand towers and pavilions And a rainbow always arches the skyThese are not the common breeds of the Dark Earth Capital But are tended by the Queen Mother of the Jade PoolAfter taking a good look at this the Great Sage asked the local god How many of these trees are there Three thousand six hundred all together the local god replied The ones growing at the front have tiny blossoms and small fruits and they ripen every three thousand years Anyone who eats them becomes an Immortal and understands the Way and his body becomes both light and strongThe twelve hundred in the middle have multiple blossoms and sweet fruits and ripen every six thousand years whoever eats them can fly and enjoy eternal youthThe back twelve hundred are streaked with purple and have pale yellow stones They ripen once every nine thousand years and anyone who eats them becomes as eternal as Heaven and Earth as longlived as the Sun and Moon The Great Sage was beside himself with joy on learning this and that day he checked the number of the trees and looked over the buildings in the orchard before going back to his residenceFrom then on he went to admire them every three or four days He dropped his friends and Journey to the West made no more pleasure jauntsOne day he noticed that the peaches near the end of the branches of one old tree were all but ripe and he felt like trying one but as the local god the workmen and the immortal clerks from his residence were close on his heels it was impossibleSuddenly he had an idea and he said Go and wait for me outside the gates while I take a nap in this summerhouse All the Immortals thereupon withdrew and the Monkey King took off his official hat and clothes climbed one of the bigger trees and chose some large ripe peachesWhen he had picked a good number he sat at his ease in the branches and ate his fill of them then jumped down from the tree pinned on his hat put on his clothes and shouted for all his attendants to go back to his residence with himTwo or three days later he thought of another trick to steal some more peaches and he ate his fill of themOne day the Queen Mother arranged a banquet opening many precious pavilions for a feast of peaches by the Jade PoolShe sent the Red Fairy the Blue Fairy the White Fairy the Black Fairy the Purple Fairy the Yellow Fairy and the Green Fairy to the Peach Orchard with their baskets to pick peaches for the feastThe seven fairies went straight to the orchard gates the workmen of the orchard and the immortal superintendents of the two offices of the Equaling Heaven Residence were guarding the gateThe fairies went up to them and said We have come on the orders of the Queen Mother to pick peaches for a feast Wait a moment please Immortal Beauties said the local godThings are different this year The Jade Emperor has appointed the Great Sage Equaling Heaven to be the guardian of this orchard and we must ask him before we can open the orchard to you Where is the Great Sage the fairies asked and the local god replied Inside the orchardAs he was feeling tired he is having a nap by himself in a summerhouse In that case please find him without delay requested the fairies and the local god took them into the orchardBut all they could find of him in the summerhouse were his hat and clothes They had no idea where he could have gone and looked everywhere without successThe Great Sage had in fact made himself only two inches long after eating some of the peaches for fun and he was sleeping under a large leaf at the top of one of the big treesWe have come by decree and we cant go back emptyhanded although the Great Sage is nowhere to be found said the fairiesOne of the immortal superintendents who was standing nearby replied As you Immortal Beauties have come by order of the Queen Mother we must not delay youOur Great Sage is always wandering off so I expect that he has gone away to visit some of his friendsYou had better pick the peaches it will be all right if we inform him The fairies did as he suggested and went into the orchard to pick peachesFirst they filled two baskets from the trees in front and then they picked three basketfuls from the trees in the middle but when they came to the trees at the back they saw that peaches and blossoms were few and far between Only a few unripe fruits with furry stalks and green skins were leftAll the ripe ones had been eaten up by the Monkey KingThe seven fairies looked everywhere but all they could see was a single red and white peach on a Southern branchThe Blue Fairy pulled the branch down the Red Fairy picked the peach and then they let the branch go againThis woke up the Great Sage who had changed himself into this peach to take a nap on this branchJourney to the West He resumed his own form took his goldbanded cudgel from his ear shook it till it was as thick as a ricebowl and shouted at them Where are you from you thieving fiends The seven fairies fell on their knees in confusionPlease dont be angry with us Great SageWere not fiends but seven fairies sent by Her Majesty the Queen Mother of the West to pick peaches of immortality and open the precious halls here for a Feast of PeachesWhen we arrived here we saw the local god and other deities of the place but we could not find you Great SageWe could not delay carrying out the Queen Mothers orders so we went ahead and picked the peaches without waiting for you Great SageWe very much hope that you will forgive us These words turned the Great Sages bad mood into a good one and he said Please rise Fairy BeautiesWho is the Queen Mother inviting to this feast There are old rules about who attendsThe Buddha of the Western Heaven Bodhisattvas holy monks Arhats the Guanyin of the South Pole the Merciful and Sage Emperor of the East the Venerable Immortals of the Ten Continents and the Three Islands the Mystic Divinity of the North Pole and the Great Yellowhorned Immortal of the Yellow Pole at the CentreThese make up the Five Venerable Ones of the Five Regions There will also be the Star Lords of the Five Constellation the Three Pure Ones the Four Emperors and the Heavenly Immortal of the Great Monad from the Eight High Caves the Jade Emperor the immortals of the Nine Mounds and the gods of the Seas and Mountains and the Ruler of the Nether World from the Eight Lower Caves and the terrestrial deities All the major and minor gods of all the halls and palaces will come to the Feast of Peaches Will I be invited asked the Great Sage with an ingratiating smileNot as far as weve heard the fairies repliedIm the Great Sage Equaling Heaven so why shouldnt I be asked said the Great Sage That was what happened beforewe dont know about this time the fairies replied Youre right he saidJust wait here while I go and find out whether Im invited Splendid Great SageMaking a magic with his hands as he spoke the words of the spell he said to the fairies Stay where you areStay where you are As this was an immobilizing spell the seven fairies were left standing in a daze under the peach tree with their eyes wide open as the Great Sage leapt out of the orchard on a somersault cloud and headed for the Jade PoolAs he traveled he saw that The sky shimmered with auspicious light As clouds of many colours streamed across itThe white storks cry made the heavens shake A thousand leaves grew on the purple asphodelAmid it all an Immortal appeared Carrying himself with heavensent elegance Journey to the West As he danced on the rainbow cloaked by the Milky Way With a talisman at his waist to ward off birth and deathHis name was BareFoot Immortal And he was going to the feast of longevitygiving peachesAs the Barefoot Immortal saw him the Great Sage lowered his head and thought of a plan by which to trick the Immortal and get to the banquet himselfWhere are you going reverend sir he asked and the Immortal replied Im going to the Peach Banquet by the invitation of the Queen Mother There is something you do not know venerable sir said the Great SageAs my somersault cloud is so fast the Jade Emperor has sent me everywhere to tell all you gentlemen to go to the Hall of Universal Brightness for a ceremony before going on to the banquet As the Immortal was an open and upright man he took this lie for the truth but wondered The thanksgiving ceremony is usually held by the Jade Pool so why are we having the ceremony in the Hall of Universal Brightness before going to the Jade Pool for the banquet Nevertheless he turned his propitious cloud around and went to the Hall of Universal BrightnessAs the Great Sage rode his cloud he said a spell shook himself took the form of the Barefoot Immortal and hurried to the Jade PoolHe reached the pavilion there a moment later stopped his cloud and went quietly insideHe saw Fabulous perfumes coiling A confusion of auspicious clouds The jade tower set with color The precious pavilions scattering mists The phoenix soars till almost lost to view And jeweled flowers seem to rise and fallAbove a ninephoenix screen A rainbow stool of the eight precious things A coloured golden table Green jade bowls with a thousand flowersJourney to the West On the table were dragon livers and marrow of phoenix bone Bears paws and apes lips A hundred different dishes and all of them good Rare fruits and fine delicacies every one uniqueEverything was neatly set out but no Immortals had yet arrivedThe Great Sage had not finished looking when he smelt wine and as he whirled round he saw under a portico to the right several immortal officials in charge of brewing liquor with some workmen who stirred the lees a number of novices who carried water and some boys who looked after the fires They were washing the vats and scrubbing the pots having made jade liquor and a fragrant fermentation of the leesThe Great Sage could not stop himself from drooling and he longed to drink some but unfortunately all those people were thereSo he performed a spell by pulling several hairs from his body chewing them up spitting them up saying the magic words and shouting Change whereupon the hairs turned into sleep insects which flew into the faces of all the liquormakersWatch them as their hands go limp their heads droop their eyes close and they drop their symbols of office and all fall asleepWhereupon the Great Sage grabbed the rare delicacies and exotic foods then went under the portico and drank from the vats and pots until he was completely drunk Only then did he think This wont do at allWhen the guests come for the banquet theyll be furious with me and Ill be for it if Im caughtId better get back to the Residence as soon as I can and sleep it off Our dear Great Sage staggered and swayed charging about all over the place under the influence of the liquor and going the wrong wayHe arrived not at the Equaling Heaven Residence but at the Tushita Heavenly PalaceAs soon as he saw this he sobered up and said to himself The Tushita Palace is the highest of the thirtythree heavens where Lord Lao Zi of the Great Monad reigns However did I get hereNever mind Ive always wanted to see that old chap and Ive never managed to come here beforeI might as well go and have a look at him now that Im passing this way He straightened his clothes and rushed in but did not see Lord Lao Zi There was no sign of anyoneThis was because Lao Zi and the Ancient Buddha Dipamkara were expounding the Way from a red dais in a triplestoried pavilion and all the immortal boys generals officials and petty functionaries were standing to right and left listening to the lectureThe Great Sage went straight to the room in which the elixir was kept and although he could not find Lao Zi there he saw that there was a small fire in the stove beside the range over which pills were madeOn either side of the stove were five gourds full of golden pills of refined elixirThis is the Immortals greatest treasure he exclaimed in delightIve wanted to refine some of these golden pills to save people with ever since I understood the Way and mastered the principle of the correspondence of the Esoteric and Exoteric but Ive never had time to come hereToday Im in luckIve found themAs Lao Zi isnt here Ill try a few He emptied the gourds of their contents and ate up all the pills as if he were eating fried beansBefore long he was full of pills and quite soberThis is terrible he thought this is a colossal disaster If the Jade Emperor is shocked by this Im done for I must get out of hereId be much better off as a king in the lower world He rushed out of the Tushita Palace avoiding his usual route Using a spell to make himself invisible he left by the West Gate of Heaven and went straight down to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit by cloudWhen he Journey to the West got there he saw flags banners spears and halberds gleaming in the sun the four Stalwart Generals and the seventytwo kings of the monsters were holding military exercises Children Im back shouted the Great Sage in a loud voice and all the fiends dropped their weapons and fell to their kneesYou dont care do you Great Sage they saidIts been so long since you left us and you never came back to see us I havent been long I havent been long protested the Great Sage and as they talked they walked into the innermost part of the caveWhen the four Stalwart Generals had tidied the place up and made him sit down they kowtowed to him and asked What office did you hold Great Sage during your century and more in Heaven The Great Sage laughed and said As far as I can remember it was only six months so why do you say it was over a century A day in Heaven is the same as a year on earth the Stalwart Generals repliedI was lucky this time said the Great Sage The Jade Emperor took a liking to me and ennobled me as the Great Sage Equaling Heaven He had an Equaling Heaven Residence built for me complete with a Tranquillity Office and a Calm Divinity Office with Immortal functionaries attendants and guardsLater on when he saw that I had nothing to do he put me in charge of the Peach OrchardRecently the Queen Mother Goddess gave a Peach Banquet but she didnt invite me Instead of waiting for an invitation I went to the Jade Pool and stole all the immortal food and drinkI staggered away from the Jade Pool and blundered into Lord Lao Zis palace and there I ate up his five gourds of pills of immortalityThen I got out through the heavenly gates and came here because I was scared that the Jade Emperor was going to punish me All the fiends were delighted with what they heard and they laid on liquor and fruit with which to welcome him backThey filled a stone bowl with coconut toddy and handed it to him but when he tasted it the Great Sage grimaced and said Its awful its awful Two of his Stalwart Generals Beng and Ba explained You dont find coconut toddy very tasty because you have drunk immortal liquor and eaten immortal food in the heavenly palace Great SageBut as the saying goes Sweet or not its water from home To this the Great Sage replied And all of you whether related to me or not are from my homeWhen I was enjoying myself beside the Jade Pool today I saw jars and jars of jade liquor under a portico thereAs none of you have ever tasted it Ill go and pinch you a few jars then you can each have a little drink and live for ever All the monkeys were beside themselves with gleeThe Great Sage then went out of the cave turned a somersault made himself invisible and went straight to the Peach Banquet As he went through the gates of the Jade Pool he saw that the men who made the wine stirred the lees carried the water and looked after the fire were still snoring awayHe tucked two big jars of wine under his arms took two more in his hands then turned his cloud round and went back to have a feast of immortal wine with the monkey masses in the cave They all drank several cups and were very happy but we will not go into thisThe story returns to the seven fairies who were only able to free themselves a whole day after Sun Wukong had immobilized them with his magicThey picked up their baskets and went back to report to the Queen Mother that they were late because the Great Sage Equaling Heaven had held them there by magicJourney to the West How many peaches did you pick the Queen Mother askedTwo baskets of little ones and three baskets of medium onesBut when we got to the back we could not find a single big one we think that they were all eaten by the Great SageWhile we were looking for some the Great Sage suddenly appeared and he beat and tortured us to make us tell him who had been invited to the banquetAfter we had told him he immobilized us there and we dont know where he wentWe only came round and freed ourselves a moment ago On hearing this the Queen Mother went to see the Jade Emperor and gave him a full account of what had happenedBefore she had finished the liquormakers arrived with their immortal officials to report that an unknown person had thrown the Grand Peach Banquet into confusion and stolen the jade liquor as well as the precious delicacies of a hundred flavorsThen came Four Heavenly Teachers to announce that the Supreme Patriarch of the Way Lao Zi had arrivedThe Jade Emperor went out with the Queen Mother to meet him and after doing obeisance Lao Zi said I had refined some Golden Pills of the Nine Transformations in my palace for a Feast of Elixir Pills with Your Majesty but a thief has stolen themThis is what I have come to report to Your Majesty This news made the Jade Emperor tremble with fear Not long afterwards the immortal administrators from the Equaling Heaven Residence came to kowtow and reportThe Great Sage Sun Wukong abandoned his post and went wandering off yesterday He has not come back yet and we do not know where he has gone The Jade Emperor now more suspicious than ever then saw the BareFoot Immortal bow his head to the groundYour subject was going to the banquet on a summons from the Queen Mother he reported when I happened to meet the Great Sage Equaling Heaven He told me O Lord of Ten Thousand Years that you had issued a decree ordering him to tell all the rest of us to go to the Hall of Universal Brightness for a ceremony before going to the banquetYour subject went back to the Hall of Universal Brightness as he had told me to but as I did not see the Imperial Dragon and Phoenix Chariot outside I hurried here to await orders This wretch has the impudence to invent fraudulent decrees and deceive eminent ministers exclaimed the Jade Emperor with anger and astonishmentThe Miraculous Investigator is to find out at once what he has been up to The Miraculous Investigator left the palace in obedience to the edict and by making thorough enquiries he found out all the details of what had happenedThe wrecker of the Heavenly Palace was Sun Wukong he reported and he went on to give a full account The Jade Emperor was furiously angry and he ordered the Four Great Heavenly Kings along with Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha to mobilize the Twentyeight Constellations the Nine Bright Shiners the Twelve Gods of the Twelve Branches the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions the Four Duty Gods the Constellations of the East and West the Gods of the North and South the Deities of the Five Mountains and the Four Rivers the star ministers of all Heaven and a total of a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers They were to descend to the lower world with eighteen heavenandearth nets surround the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and capture that wretch for punishmentThe gods called out their troops at once and left the heavenly palaceA gusty sandstorm blotted out the heavens Journey to the West Purple fog threw the earth into darknessJust because the monkey fiend offended the Supreme Emperor Heavenly hosts were sent down to the mortal dustThe Four Great Heavenly Kings The Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions The Four Great Heavenly Kings held the supreme command And the Revealers controlled the soldiers movementsLi the Pagoda Carrier commanded the central corps Nezha the deadly led the vanThe star Rahu ordered the leading rands And the star Ketu towered behindThe Sun revealed his divinity And radiance shone from the MoonThe stars of the Five Elements were mighty in valour And the Nine Bright Shiners were fond of battleThe stars of the Branches Zi Wu Mao and You Were all great heavenly warriorsThe Five Plagues and the Five Mountains were drawn up on the East and West While the Six Ding and Six Jia marched to right and leftThe Dragon Gods of the Four Rivers stood above and below And the Twentyeight Constellations were drawn up in serried ranksHorn Gullet Base and Chamber were the officers commanding Strider Harvester Stomach and Mane wheeled and soared Dipper Ox Woman Barrens Roof House and Wall Heart Tail and Winnowerall able stars Well Ghost Willow Spread Whig and Axletree Journey to the West Wielded their swords and spears showed forth their power Halted their clouds and descended in mists to the mortal world Pitching camp before the Mountain of Flowers and FruitThere is a poem that runs Many the transformations of the heavenborn Monkey King Happy in his lair after stealing the pills and wineJust because he wrecked the banquet of peaches A hundred thousand heavenly troops now spread their netsHeavenly King Li gave the order for the heavenly soldiers to pitch camp and throw a watertight cordon round the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit Above and below they spread eighteen heavenandearth nets and the Nine Bright Shiners were sent out to start the battleThey took their soldiers to the outside of the cave where they saw the monkeys big and small leaping and fooling aroundThe star officers shouted in harsh voices Little goblins wheres that Great Sage of yoursWe are gods sent from the upper world to subdue your mutinous Great SageTell him to surrender at onceand if theres so much as a hint of a no from him we will exterminate every last one of you The little monkeys went rushing in to report Great Sage a disaster a disasterThere are nine evil gods outside who say theyve been sent from the upper world to subdue you The Great Sage who was just then sharing the immortal liquor with the seventytwo kings of the monsters and his four Stalwart Generals paid no attention to the report saying Today we have wine so today we celebrateTo hell with whats happening outside the gate But before the words were out of his mouth another group of little devils came in Those nine evil gods are using foul and provocative language to challenge us to fight they announcedNever mind them said the Great Sage with a laughJourney to the West With verse and wine were happy today Who cares when fame will come our way But before these words were out of his mouth yet another group of devils came rushing inSir those nine evil gods have smashed the gates and are charging in The stinking gods exploded the Great Sage What nerveI never wanted a fight with them so why should they come here to push us around He thereupon ordered the Onehorned Monster King to lead the seventytwo monster kings into battle while he followed them with the four Stalwart GeneralsThe monster king hastily assembled the devil soldiers and sallied forth to meet the enemy They were all stopped by a charge by the Nine Bright Shiners who held the head of the iron bridge so that no one could enter or leaveDuring the tumult the Great Sage came on the scene and shouting Make way he raised his iron cudgel shook it till it was as thick as a bowl and twelve feet long and struck and parried as he came charging outThe Nine Bright Shiners who were no match for him fell backYou reckless Protector of the Horses they shouted when they were back in the safety of their own position You have committed the most terrible crimes You stole the peaches and the wine wrecked the Peach Banquet and pilfered the immortality pills of Lord Lao Zi On top of all this you brought some of the immortal liquor you stole back hereDont you realize that you have piled crime upon crime The Great Sage laughedIts true its true he said but what are you going to do about it In obedience to a golden edict of the Jade Emperor the Nine Bright Shiners replied we have led out troops here to subdue youSubmit at once or else all these creatures of yours will have to pay with their livesIf you refuse we shall trample this mountain flat and turn your cave upsidedown You hairy gods roared the Great Sage in a fury what magic powers have you got to let you talk so big Clear off or Ill give you a taste of my cudgel The Nine Bright Shiners did a wardance together which did not frighten the Handsome Monkey King in the leastHe whirled his goldbanded cudgel parrying to right and left and fought the Nine Bright Shiners till their muscles were weak and their strength was gone then each of them broke ranks and fled dragging their weapons behind themThey rushed to the command post of the central corps and reported to the PagodaBearing Heavenly King Li that the Monkey King was so ferocious that they had fled from the battlefield unable to defeat himHeavenly King Li then sent the Four Heavenly Kings and the Twentyeight Constellations into battleThe Great Sage not at all frightened at this ordered the Onehorned Demon King the seventytwo kings of the monsters and the four Stalwart Generals to draw up their line of battle outside the gates of the cave The ensuing melee was really terrifying Howling winds Dark sinister cloudsOn one side flags and standards colorfully flying On the other side the gleam of spears and halberdsJourney to the West Round helmets shine Layered armour gleamsThe shining round helmets reflect the sun Like silver boulders reaching to the sky Gleaming layers of armour are built into a wall Like a mountain of ice weighing down the earthLonghandled swords Flash through the clouds like lightning Paperwhite spears Pierce mists and fogs Heavenshaped halberds Tigereye chains Bristling like a field of hemp Bronze swords And fourbrightness spears Drawn up like a dense forestBows and crossbows eaglefeathered arrows Short clubs and snaky spears to terrify the soulWielding his single AsYouWill cudgel The Great Sage fights against the heavenly godsSuch is the slaughter that no bird flies over it And tigers and wolves flee in terrorThe swirling stones and clouds of sand make everything dark The dirt and the dust blot out the heavensThe clash of arms startles the universe As the battle strikes awe into gods and demonsJourney to the West The battle started in the morning and went on till the sun set behind the mountains in the WestBy then the Onehorned Demon King and the seventytwo kings of the monsters had all been captured by the heavenly hostsOnly the four Stalwart Generals and the monkeys had got away and they were now hiding in the innermost recesses of the Water Curtain CaveThe Great Sages solitary cudgel had fought off the Four Heavenly Kings Li the Pagodabearer and Prince Nezha who were all in the skyAfter the battle had gone on for a long time the Great Sage saw that night was drawing on so he plucked out one of his hairs munched it up spat out the pieces and shouted Change They changed into thousands of Great Sages all with goldbanded cudgels who forced Prince Nezha and the five Heavenly Kings to withdrawAfter winning this victory the Great Sage put back his hair and hurried back to the cave where the four Stalwart Generals at once led the monkeys out to kowtow at the head of the iron bridge to welcome him back They sobbed three times and then laughed three timesWhy are you laughing and crying at the sight of me the Great Sage askedWhen we led all the commanders into battle against the heavenly kings this morning replied the Stalwart Generals the seventytwo kings of the monsters and the Onehorned Demon King were all captured by the gods and we had to flee for our lives That is why we criedWe laughed because you Great Sage have come back victorious and unharmed To this the Great Sage replied Victory and defeat are all the soldiers lotAs the ancients said To kill ten thousand of the enemy you must lose three thousand of your own Anyhow the officers of ours who were captured were all tigers leopards wolves badgers riverdeer foxes and raccoondogs Not one of our own kind was even wounded so theres no need for us to be bothered about itBut although I forced the enemy to withdraw by dividing up my body through magic theyre still encamped at the foot of our mountain so well have to remain on our guardMeanwhile we must eat a good meal and get a good nights sleep to build up our energyTomorrow morning Ill use powerful magic to capture those heavenly generals and avenge our people After the four Stalwart Generals and the other monkey commanders had drunk several cups of coconut toddy they went to bed with their worries calmedWhen the four Heavenly Kings had withdrawn their troops and ended the battle those who had distinguished themselves reported what they had done Some had captured tigers and leopards some lions and elephants and others wolves and raccoondogs but not one single monkey goblin had been takenThen they built a mighty stockade around their camp Commanders who had distinguished themselves wee rewarded and the soldiers who made up the heavenandearth nets were ordered to surround the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit holding bells and shouting ready for a great battle the next dayEvery man heard the orders and they were strictly obeyedIndeed A wicked monkey made chaos shocking heaven and earth So they spread their nets and watched by night and dayListen to the next installment to hear how he was dealt with the following morningJourney to the West Guanyin Comes to the Feast and Asks the Reason Why The Little Sage Uses His Might to Subdue the Great Sage We shall leave for the moment the Heavenly Generals making their encirclement and the soundly sleeping Great SageThe story goes on to tell how the Compassionate and Merciful Miraculous Savior from Suffering the Bodhisattva Guanyin of Mount Potaraka in the Southern Sea having been invited by the Queen Mother to the Peach Banquet went to the precious pavilions at the Jade Pool with her great disciple Huian the Novice She found the place deserted and the banquet ruinedThe few Immortals present were not sitting at their places but holding confused discussionsWhen greetings were over the Immortals gave the Bodhisattva an account of what had happenedIf there is to be no banquet and no drinking said the Bodhisattva you had better all come with me to the Jade Emperor The Immortals were delighted to follow her and when they arrived before the Hall of Universal Brightness the Four Heavenly Teachers the BareFoot Immortal and many others were all there to greet the Bodhisattva They told her that the Jade Emperor had sent heavenly armies to capture the demon but they had not yet returnedI wish to see the Jade Emperor said the Bodhisattva so may I trouble you to inform him on my behalf The heavenly teacher Qui Hongji then went to the Hall of Miraculous Mist and the Bodhisattva was invited inShe found that Lord Lao Zi was there in the place of honour and that the Queen Mother was behind himThe Bodhisattva went in at the head of the others and when she had done obeisance to the Jade Emperor she greeted Lao Zi and the Queen Mother After they had all sat down she asked what had happened at the Peach BanquetThe banquet is held every year and it is normally a very happy occasion the Jade Emperor replied but this year that monkey fiend wrecked it so that your invitation was worth nothing Where does this monkey fiend come from asked the BodhisattvaHe was born from a stone egg on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body the Jade Emperor answeredWhen he was born golden beams flashed from his eyes that reached to the star palaceAt first we paid no attention to him but later on he became a spirit subduing dragons and tigers and erasing his own name from the registers of deathThe Dragon Kings and King Yama of the underworld informed us of this in memorials and we wanted to capture him but the Star of Longevity memorialized that in the Three Worlds all beings with nine orifices can become ImmortalsWe therefore extended education to the worthy by summoning him to the upper world and appointing him Protector of the Horses in the Imperial StableBut this was not good enough for the scoundrel who rebelled against HeavenWe sent Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha to accept his surrender extended him an amnesty and summoned him back to the upper world We made him a Great Sage Equaling Heaven though this carried no salaryAs he had nothing to do he would go wandering all over the place and for fear that this might lead to trouble we had him look after the Peach OrchardOnce again he flouted the law by stealing and eating every single one of the big peaches from the old treesWhen the banquet was to be held he was not invited as his position was purely an honorary one so he played a trick on the Barefoot Immortal went to the banquet looking like him ate all the immortal delicacies and drank all the immortal liquor On top of this he stole Lord Lao Zis pills of immortality and some imperial liquor which he took to his mountain for the monkeys to enjoyThis made us very angry so we sent a hundred thousand heavenly troops to spread Journey to the West heavenandearth nets and subdue himBut we have received no reports today so we do not know whether we have been victorious When the Bodhisattva heard this she said to Huian the Novice Hurry down from Heaven to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and find out about the military situationIf you meet with any opposition you may do your bit to help but the important thing is to bring an accurate report back Huian the Novice straightened his robes took his iron staff left the palace by cloud and went straight to the mountainHe saw that with the layer upon layer of heavenandearth nets and the men holding bells and shouting passwords at the gates of the camp the cordon round the mountain was watertightHuian stopped and called Heavenly soldiers at the gates of the camp I would trouble you to report that I Moksa the second son of Heavenly King Li also known as Huian the senior disciple of Guanyin of the Southern Sea have come to ask about the military situation Then the divine soldiers of the Five Mountains inside the camp went in through the gates of the headquarters where the Rat the Cock the Horse and the Hare stars reported the news to the commander of the central corpsHeavenly King Li sent a flag of command with the order that the heavenandearth nets were to be opened to let Huian inThe East was just beginning to grow light as Huian followed the flag in and bowed to Heavenly King Li and the four other heavenly kingsWhere have you come from my son asked Heavenly King LiYour stupid son accompanied the Bodhisattva to the Peach Banquet and when she found the banquet deserted and nobody at the Jade Pool she took me and the other Immortals to see the Jade EmperorThe Jade Emperor told her that you father and the other kings had gone down to the lower world to capture this monkey fiend As the Jade Emperor has received no news all day on the outcome of the battle the Bodhisattva sent me here to find out what has happened We arrived here and encamped yesterday Heavenly King Li replied then sent the Nine Bright Shiners to challenge the enemy to battle but that wretch used such tremendous magic powers that the Nine Bright Shiners all came back defeatedThen we led out own soldiers into action and the wretch also drew up his line of battleOur hundred thousand heavenly soldiers fought an indecisive engagements with him till dusk when he used a spell to divide up his body and force us backWhen we withdrew our forces and held an investigation we found that we had only captured wolves tigers leopards and so on and had not even taken half a monkey fiendWe have not yet given battle today Before he had finished speaking someone appeared outside the gates of the headquarters to report that the Great Sage was outside at the head of a crowd of monkey spirits clamoring for battleThe four other Heavenly Kings Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha were all for committing their forces but Moksa said Father when your stupid son was instructed by the Bodhisattva to come here and find out the news I was also told that if there was a battle I could do my bit to helpMay I please go and see what sort of a Great Sage he is untalented though I am My boy said Heavenly King Li you have been cultivating your conduct with the Bodhisattva for some years now so I suppose that you must have acquired some magic powers but do be very careful The splendid Prince Moksa hitched up his embroidered robes and charged out through the gates of the headquarters waving his iron staff with both hands Which of you is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven he shoutedI am answered the Great Sage brandishing his AsYouWill cudgelBut who do you think you are asking a question like that Journey to the West I am Prince Moksa the second son of Heavenly King Li and I am now a disciple and a guard before the throne of the Bodhisattva GuanyinMy Buddhist name is Huian Why have you come here to see me instead of staying in the Southern Sea and cultivating your conduct asked the Great Sage and Moksa replied My teacher sent me here to find out about the military situation but now that Ive seen your savagery Ive come to capture you You talk big dont you said the Great SageWell then dont go away try a taste of my cudgel Moksa not in the least frightened struck at him with his iron staffIt was a fine fight they fought halfway up the mountainside outside the gates of the headquarters The staves were matched but made of different iron The weapons clashed but their masters were not the sameOne was a wayward Immortal known as the Great Sage The other a true dragon disciple of GuanyinThe castiron staff beaten with a thousand hammers Had been forged by the art of the Ding and the JiaThe AsYouWill cudgel once anchored the Milky Way As the Treasure Stilling the Sea its magic power was greatWhen the two met they were well matched indeed And they parried and lunged at each other without endThe sinister cudgel Infinitely murderous Could whirl round your waist as quick as the wind The spearcatching staff Never yielding an opening Was irresistible parrying to right and leftOn the one side the flags and banners fly On the other the camel drums rollTen thousand heavenly generals in multiple encirclement A cave of monkey devils densely packed togetherJourney to the West Monstrous fogs and evil clouds cover the earth While the smoke of deadly battle rises to the skyYesterdays fighting was bad enough Todays struggle is even worseThe admirable skills of the Monkey King Put Moksa to flight utterly defeatedAfter they had fought some fifty or sixty rounds Huians arm and shoulders were numbed and aching and he could resist the Great Sage no longer Waving his staff in a feint he turned away and ranThe Great Sage then withdrew his monkey soldiers and encamped outside the gates of the caveThe big and little heavenly soldiers at the gates of the other camp received Huian and let him go straight to the headquarters where he gasped and panted for breath as he said to the Four Heavenly Kings Li the Pagodabearer and his brother Prince Nezha What a Great Sage What a Great SageHis magic powers are too much for me He beat me Startled by this news Heavenly King Li had a request for reinforcements written and sent the Strongarm Devil King and Prince Moksa up to Heaven to submitNot daring to waste a moment the two messengers rushed out through the heavenandearth nets and mounted their propitious cloudsA moment later they arrived outside the Hall of Universal Brightness where they greeted the Four Heavenly Teachers who led them to the Hall of Miraculous Mist and handed up their memorialPrince Moksa or Huian did homage to the Bodhisattva who asked him what he had found outAs you instructed me I went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit reported Huian asked them to open the gates of the heavenandearth net saw my father and told him of the orders you had given meHis Majesty my father said that they fought against the Monkey King yesterday but did not capture a single monkey spiritonly tigers leopards lions elephants and so onWhile he was telling me this the Monkey King demanded battle again so your disciple fought some fifty or sixty rounds against him with my iron staff but I was no match for him He beat me and drove me back to the campThis is why my father has sent me and the Strongarm Devil King up to Heaven to ask for reinforcements The Bodhisattva lowered her head in deep thought The Jade Emperor opened the memorial and saw that it contained a request for helpThis intolerable monkey spirit has enough tricks to fight off a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers he observed with a smileHeavenly King Li has asked for reinforcementsWhich heavenly soldiers should I send him Before the words were out of his mouth Guanyin put her hands together and said Do not worry You MajestyI can recommend a god to capture this monkey Which god the Jade Emperor asked and the Bodhisattva replied Your Majestys nephew the Illustrious Sage and True Lord Erlang who is now living at Guanjiangkou in Guanzhou enjoying the incense that the lower beings burn to himIn the past he exterminated the Six Bogies He has the Brothers of Plum Hill and the twelve hundred strawheaded gods and his magical powers are enormousHe will agree to be sent though he would not obey a summons to come here so Your Majesty might like to issue a decree ordering him to take his troops to the rescue The Jade Emperor then issued such a decree and sent the Strongarm Devil Journey to the West King to deliver itThe devil king took the decree mounted his cloud and went straight to Guanjiangkou He reached the temple of the True Lord within an hourWhen the demon judges guarding the gates went in to report that there was an envoy from heaven standing outside with an imperial decree Erlang went with the brothers to receive the decree outside the gates and incense was burned as he readThe Great Sage Equaling Heaven the monkey fiend of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit has rebelled Because he stole peaches wine and pills while in Heaven and wrecked the Peach Banquet we have despatched a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers and eighteen heavenandearth nets to surround the mountain and force him to submit but we have not yet succeededWe do now therefore especially appoint our worthy nephew and his sworn brothers to go to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and give their help in eliminating himWhen you succeed large rewards and high office shall be yours Erlang was delightedHe told the envoy from Heaven to go back and report that the would be putting his sword to the Emperors serviceWe need not describe how the devil king reported back to HeavenThe True Lord Erlang called the six sworn brothers of Plum HillMarshals Kang Zhang Yao and Li and Generals Quo Shen and Zhi Jiantogether before the hall The Jade Emperor has just ordered us to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to subdue a monkey fiend he saidYou are all coming with me The brothers were all eager to go and mustering their divine troops they unleashed a gale wind In an instant they had crossed the Eastern Ocean riding eagles and leading dogs pulling their bows and drawing their crossbows and had reached the Mountain of Flowers and FruitFinding that the many layers of heavenearth nets were impenetrable Erlang shouted Listen all you generals in charge of the heavenandearth nets I am the True Lord and the Illustrious Sage Erlang and I have been sent here by the Jade Emperor to capture the monkey fiendOpen the gates of the camp and let me in at once Each line of gods forming the nets let them through and the four other Heavenly Kings and Heavenly King Li all came to welcome him outside the headquartersWhen the introductions were over he asked how the fighting had gone and the Heavenly Kings gave him a full account of what had happenedNow that I the Little Sage have come here I shall have to match a few transformations with him said Erlang with a smileI hope that all you gentlemen will maintain a close cordon with your heavenandearth nets but dont screen off the top of the mountain then Ill be able to fight himIf he beats me I shant need the help of you gentlemen as I have my brothers to support me and if I beat him I wont have to trouble you to tie him up as my brothers can do itI would just like to ask Heavenly King Li to stand in the sky and operate this fienddetecting mirrorIm worried that if hes beaten he may go and hide somewhere so you will have to give me a clear view of him and not let him get away The Heavenly Kings stayed in the four quarters and all the heavenly soldiers were drawn up in their battle positionsThe True Lord Erlang went out at the head of the four marshals and the two generalsmaking seven sworn brothers with himself includedto challenge the enemy to battle and he ordered his other officers to defend the camp firmly and keep the eagles and dogs under controlAll the strawheaded gods acknowledged the orderErlang then went to the outside of the Water Curtain Cave where he saw the monkey hordes neatly drawn up in a coileddragon battle line in the middle of the central corps stood a pole with a banner on it reading Great Sage Equaling Heaven Journey to the West What business has that loathsome fiend to call himself the equal of Heaven Erlang asked and the six sworn brothers of Plum Hill replied Stop admiring him and challenge him to battle When the junior monkeys at the gate of their camp saw the True Lord Erlang they rushed back to report whereupon the Monkey King took his goldbanded cudgel adjusted his golden armour put on his cloudwalking shoes felt his golden helmet and leapt out through the gates of the camp He saw at first sight how cool and remarkable Erlang looked and how elegantly he was dressedIndeed His bearing was refined his visage noble His ears hung down to his shoulders and his eyes shoneThe hat on his head had three peaks and phoenixes flying And his robe was of a pale gooseyellowHis boots were lined with cloth of gold dragons coiled round his socks His jade belt was decorated with the eight jewels At his waist was a bow curved like the moon In his hand a doubleedged tridentHis axe had split open Peach Mountain when he rescued his mother His bow had killed the twin phoenixes of ZongluoWidespread was his fame for killing the Eight Bogies And he had become one of Plum Hills seven sagesHis heart was too lofty to acknowledge his relatives in Heaven In his pride he went back to be a god at GuanjiangHe was the Merciful and Miraculous Sage of the red city Erlang whose transformations were numberlessWhen the Great Sage saw him he laughed with delight raised his goldbanded cudgel and shouted Where are you from little general that you have the audacity to challenge me You must be blind you wretch if you cant recognize meI am the nephew of the Jade Emperor and my title is Merciful and Miraculous King ErlangI am here on imperial orders to arrest you Protector of the Horses you rebel against Heaven you reckless baboon Journey to the West Now I remember who you are replied the Great SageSome years ago the Jade Emperors younger sister wanted to be mortal and came down to the lower world where she married a Mr Yang and gave birth to a son who split the Peach Mountain open with his axe Is that who you areI should really fling you a few curses but Ive got no quarrel with you and it would be a pity to kill you by hitting you with my cudgelSo why dont you hurry back young sir and tell those four Heavenly Kings of yours to come out When the True Lord Erlang heard this he burst out angrily Damned monkey Where are your mannersTry this blade of mine The Great Sage dodged the blow and instantly raised his goldbanded club to hit backThere was a fine battle between the two of them The Merciful God Erlang The Great Sage Equaling HeavenOne is the Handsome Monkey King the proud deceiver of his enemies The other a true pillar the unknown subduerWhen the two met They were both in a fighting moodHe who had no respect before Today learned a sense of proportionThe iron staff raced with the flying dragons The divine cudgel seemed like a dancing phoenixParrying to the left thrusting to the right Advancing to meet a blow flashing behindThe brothers of Plum Hill add to one sides might While the other has the four Stalwart Generals to transmit ordersAs the flags wave and the drums roll each side is as one Battlecries and gongs raise everyones moraleThe two steel blades each watch for their chance But neither leaves an opening as they come and goThe goldbanded cudgel the treasure from the sea Can fly and transform itself to win the victoryJourney to the West A moments delay and life is lost A single mistake will be the lastAfter Erlang and the Great Sage had fought over three hundred rounds the outcome of the fight was still undecidedErlang braced himself and with a shake became ten thousand fathoms tall in his hands his twobladed trident looked like the peaks of Mount Hua His face was black his fangs were long and his hair was bright red he looked ferociously evil He hacked at the Great Sages headThe Great Sage also resorting to magic gave himself a body as big as Erlangs and a face as frightening and he raised his AsYouWill goldbanded cudgel which was now like the pillar of Heaven on the summit of the Kunlun Mountain to ward off Erlangs blowThis reduced the two ape field marshals Ma and Liu to such trembling terror that they could no longer wave their banners while the gibbon generals Seng and Ba were too scared to use their swordsOn the other side Kang Zhang Yao Li Guo Shen and Zhi Jian threw the strawheaded gods into an assault on the Water Curtain Cave with the dogs and eagles unleashed and their bows and crossbows drawnThis attack put the four monkey generals to flight and two or three thousand devils were capturedThe monkeys threw away their spears tore off their armour abandoned their swords and halberds and fled screaming Some went up the mountain and some returned to the cave like roosting birds frightened by an owl or stars scattered across the skyThat is all we have to say about the sworn brothers victoryThe story goes on to tell how the True Lord Erlang and the Great Sage having turned themselves into figures on the scale of Heaven and Earth were locked in battle when the Great Sage was suddenly appalled to notice that the monkey fiends in his camp had scattered in terror Putting off his magic appearance he broke away and fled his cudgel in his handSeeing him go the True Lord Erlang hurried after him with long strides Where are you going he askedIf you surrender at once your life will be spared The Great Sage who had no heart left for the fight was running as fast as he couldAs he approached the mouth of the cave he came up against Marshals Kang Zhang Yao and Li as well as Generals Guo Shen and Zhi Jian blocking his way at the head of their armiesWhere are you going damned monkey they asked and the Great Sage hastily squeezed his goldbanded cudgel till it was the size of an embroidery needle and hid it in his earThen he shook himself turned into a sparrow flew up into a tree and perched on one of its branchesThe six sworn brothers looked for him very hard but could find him nowhere so they all shouted in unison The monkey fiend has escaped the monkey fiend has escaped As they were shouting the True Lord Erlang arrived and asked them Brothers where had you chased him to when he disappeared We had him surrounded here just now but he vanished Erlang opened his phoenix eyes till they were quite round and looked about himHe saw that the Great Sage had changed himself into a sparrow and was perching on a branch so he put off his magical appearance threw down his divine trident and took the pellet bow from his waistThen he shook himself changed into a kite spread his wings and swooped in to attackAs soon as the Great Sage saw this he took off and turned himself into a big cormorant soaring up into the skyErlang saw him and with a quick shake of his feathers and a twist of his body he transformed himself into a crane and pierced the clouds as he tried to catch himThe Great Sage landed on a mountain stream and changing into a fish plunged into the waterErlang who had pursued him to the bank of the stream could see no trace of himJourney to the West That macaque must have gone into the water and changed himself into some kind of fish or shrimp he thoughtIll transform myself again then Ill get him He turned into a fishhawk and soared above the lower reaches of the stream and the first waves of the seaHe waited there for a time Meanwhile the Great Sage who was in the form of a fish swam with the stream until he noticed a bird flying above himIt was quite like a blue kite except that its feathers were not blue it was quite like an egret but it had no crest on its head and it was quite like a stork but its legs were not redThat must be what Erlang turned himself into while waiting for me he thought turned round quickly and went awayThe fish who turned round thought Erlang when he saw this is like a carp but its tail isnt red its like a mandarin fish but I cant see the pattern on its scales its like a snakehead but without a star on its head and like a bream but it has no needles on its gillsWhy did it turn round the moment it saw meIt must be that monkey transformed He swooped down and snapped at the Great Sage with his beakThe Great Sage leapt out of the water turned into a watersnake swam to the bank and slid into the grassFailing to catch the fish in his beak Erlang saw a snake jump out of the water and realized it was the Great SageHe changed himself at once into a redcrested grey crane and stretched out his long beak that was like a pair of pointed pincers to eat up the watersnakeThe snake gave a jump and became a bustard standing stiffly on a smartweedcovered bankWhen Erlang saw that he had turned himself into so low a creaturefor the bustard is the lowest and lewdest of birds not caring whether it mates with phoenix eagle or crowhe kept his distance reverted to his own body went away to fetch and load his pellet bow and knocked him flying with a single shotThe Great Sage seized the chance as he rolled down the precipice to crouch there and turn himself into a temple to a local godHe opened his mouth wide to look like the entrance to the temple and turned his teeth into the doors he made his tongue into a statue of a god and his eyes into windows and latticeHe could not tuck his tail away so he stuck it up behind him as a flagpoleWhen Erlang came to the foot of the precipice he could not see the bustard he had shot over and anxiously opening his phoenix eyes he looked carefully around and saw a temple with its flagpole at the backIt must be that monkey over there he observed with a smile Hes trying to fool me againIve seen temples before but never one with the flagpole at the backIm sure it is that beast up to his tricks againIf hed managed to lure me in hed have been able to get me with a single bite
