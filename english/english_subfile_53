Soon after when they were at court the Emperor asked what was the bag he saw on Guan Yus breastMy beard is rather long Your Majesty said Guan YuSo the Prime Minister gave me a bag to protect it The Emperor bade him take off the bag and show his beard in all its fullness and it fell in rippling waves below his breastReally a most beautiful beard said the EmperorThis is why people call himThe Man with the Beautiful Beard Another time after a banquet Cao Cao was seeing his guest start from the gate of his palace when he noticed that his charger was very thin Why is it so thin said Cao CaoMy worthless body is rather heavy and really too much for itIt is always out of condition Cao Cao at once told his attendants to bring out a certain steed and before long it appearedIt was red like glowing charcoal and a handsome creature in every wayDo you recognize it asked Cao CaoWhy it is no other than RedHare cried Guan YuYes it is RedHare said Cao CaoAnd he presented the horse all fully caparisoned to his guestGuan Yu bowed many times and thanked him again and again till Cao Cao began to feel displeased and said I have given you many things lovely handmaids and gold and silks and never won a bow of gratitude from you beforeThis horse seems to please you better than all the restWhy do you think so poorly of the damsels and so much of the steed I know the horse it can travel five hundred miles a day and I am very lucky to get him Now as soon as I find out where my brother is I can get to him in a single day said Guan YuCao Cao grumbled to himself and began to repent of his gift Fortune dealt a stunning blow still he played his part Partitioning his dwelling proved his purity of heartThe crafty minister desired to win him to his side But felt that failure was foredoomed however much he triedSaid Cao Cao to Zhang Liao I have treated Guan Yu pretty liberally but he still cherishes the desire to leave me Do you know if it is really so I will try to find out was the replySo Zhang Liao took an early opportunity of seeing Guan Yu and when the politeness of the visit were over Zhang Liao said I recommended you to the Prime Minister and you have not lost much by that I am deeply affected by his kindness and bounty said Guan Yu but though my body is here yet I am always thinking of my brother Your words do not express present conditions quite correctly One who lives in the world without discrimination and consideration of his relations with others is not the most admirable type of personEven Liu Bei never treated you better than does the Prime MinisterWhy then do you maintain this desire to get away I know only too well that he has been most kind but I have also received great kindness from Uncle Liu BeiBeside we have sworn to die together and I cannot remain here but before I go I must try to render the Prime Minister some signal service to prove my gratitude Supposing Liu Bei should have left the world whither will you go said Zhang LiaoI will follow him to the below realms of Nine Golden Springs There could no longer be the least doubt as to Guan Yus intentions and Zhang Liao told Cao Cao just how matters stood Cao Cao sighedTo serve ones chief with unswerving fidelity is a proof of the highest principle of all said heSaid Xun Yu He spoke of performing some act of service before leaving If he gets no chance of such a thing he will not be able to go Cao Cao agreed that this was so Liu Bei went to Yuan Shao for refugeHere Liu Bei was always sorrowful and when asked the reason said he did not know where his brothers were nor what had happened to his family since they fell into the hands of Cao CaoWhy should I not be sad when I have failed towards my country and my family said he I have long wished to attack Xuchang said Yuan ShaoNow it is autumn and just the time for an expedition so let us discuss plans for the destruction of Cao Cao Tian Feng at once opposed thisWhen Cao Cao attacked Xuzhou and Xuchang was undefended you let the chance slip byNow that Xuzhou has been captured and their soldiers are flushed with victory it would be madness to attempt itIt is necessary to await another chance Let me think about it said Yuan Shao He asked advice from Liu Bei whether to attack or to hold on Liu Bei replied Cao Cao is a rebelI think you are failing in your duty if you do not attack him Your words are good said Yuan Shao He made up his mind to moveBut again the adviser Tian Feng intervenedThen Yuan Shao grew angry saying You fellows who cultivate literature and despise war have made me miss a lot Tian Feng bowed his head and said Neglect your servants wise words and you will fail in the field Yuan Shao was so angry that he wanted to put Tian Feng to death However Liu Bei begged him off and he was only imprisonedSeeing the fate of his colleague another adviser Ju Shou assembled his clan and distributed among them all his possessions saying I go with the army If we succeed then nothing can exceed our glory but if we are defeated the risk I run is great His friends wept as they said farewellGeneral Yan Liang was appointed to the command of the advance guard to go to attack Baima Then Ju Shou first protested His mind is too narrow for such a postHe is brave but unequal to such a trust You are not the sort of man to measure my best generals replied Yuan ShaoThe army marched to Liyang and Governor Liu Yan of Dongjun sent an urgent call to Xuchang for aidCao Cao moved his armies hastilyAs soon as the news of battle got about Guan Yu went to see the Prime Minister and said Illustrious Sir the army is mobilized I volunteer for the van leader I scarcely dare put you to such inconvenience but presently if need arises I will call upon you So Guan Yu retired and one hundred fifty thousand soldiers marched out in three directionsOn the road the letters from Liu Yan arrived praying for help and Cao Cao marched the first fifty thousand troops to Baima and took up a position supported by the hillsIn the wide plains in front of them Yan Liang was encamped with one hundred thousand veteransCao Cao was frightened at the force opposed to him and returning to camp spoke to Song Xian who had once served under Lu Bu saying You are one of Lu Bus famous veteran generals can you give battle to this Yan Liang Song Xian agreed to tryHe armed himself mounted and rode to the frontYan Liang was there on horseback his sword lying crosswaysSeeing an opponent approaching he uttered a loud shout and galloped toward Song XianThe two met but after only three bouts Song Xian fell under a mighty slash from Yan Liangs swordWhat a terrible leader said Cao CaoHe has slain my comrade I want to go and avenge him then cried Wei XuCao Cao bade him go and he rode out spear set and in front of the army railed at Yan LiangYan Liang replied not a word but their two steeds came together and at the first blow from Yan Liangs sword Wei Xus forehead was halvedNow who again dares face him cried Cao Cao Xu Huang took up the challenge and he went outThe combat endured twenty bouts and then Xu Huang fled back to his own sideThe other generals were now greatly depressed at their failureCao Cao withdrew his army feeling very sad at the loss of two generals in quick succession Yan Liang also marched off his forceThen Cheng Yu went to see his chief saying I can produce a man the equal of Yan Liang Who cried Cao CaoNo other than Guan Yu I am afraid that if he is given an opportunity to perform that return service he spoke of he will leave me If Liu Bei is still alive he is with Yuan ShaoIf you get Guan Yu to defeat Yuan Shaos army Yuan Shao will look askance at Liu Bei and put him to deathLiu Bei gone where can Guan Yu go This argument appealed to Cao Cao at once and he sent to request Guan Yu to comePrevious to obeying the call Guan Yu went to say farewell to his sistersinlawYou may get news of the Uncle on the journey said they Yes said Guan Yu and left themArmed with his greendragon saber riding on the swift steed RedHare and having but a slender following Guan Yu was not long in arriving at Baima He saw Cao Cao who told him what had happened Yan Liang was too valiant for any to faceLet me look at him said Guan YuThen wine was served for his refreshment and while they were drinking it was reported that Yan Liang once again offered a challengeSo Cao Cao and his guest and staff went to the summit of a hill whence the enemy could be seenCao Cao and Guan Yu sat on the hill top and the commanders stood about themCao Cao pointed out Yan Liangs troops arrayed on the plains below The ensigns and banners waving fresh and bright amid the forest of spears and swords made a grand and imposing spectacle See how formidable these soldiers of the North of Yellow River are said Cao CaoI regard them as so many clay fowls and mud dogs said Guan YuCao Cao pointed out Yan Liang saying There under that grand umbrella in that embroidered robe and that silver breastplate and riding on horseback and gripping that huge sword is Yan Liang His head looks as though it was stuck on a pole for sale said Guan Yu just glancing over the army at his feet He is very terribleYou must not despise him said Cao CaoGuan Yu rose saying I am a poor thing but I will go over and bring you his head if you like Joking is not allowed in this army interposed Zhang LiaoPlease be careful what you say General Guan Yu quickly mounted turned down his mighty weapon and galloped down the hill his phoenix eyes rounded and his silkworm eyebrows fiercely bristlingHe dashed straight into the enemys array and the northern soldiers opened like falling waves and dissolving storms He made directly for the commanderNow Yan Liang sitting there in state saw a horseman rushing toward him and just as he began to ask who the rider of the red horse was lo the horseman was there Taken utterly by surprise the leader could make no defenseGuan Yus arm rose and the mighty weapon fellAnd with it fell Yan Liang Leaping from the saddle Guan Yu cut off his victims head and hung it to his horses neck Then he mounted and rode out just as if there was no army thereThe northern troops panic stricken made no fightCao Caos army attacked with full force and slew great numbers of themThey captured many horses and weapons and much military gearGuan Yu rode quickly back up the hill and laid the proof of his prowess at the feet of the Prime MinisterYou are more than human General cried Cao CaoWhat have I done to talk about said Guan YuMy brother Zhang Fei did the same thing in an army of a hundred legions and did it as easily as picking something from his own pocket Cao Cao marveled at the statement and turning to those about him said If you meet this Zhang Fei be careful And he bade them make a note on the overlap of their robes so that they should rememberThe beaten army returning northward met Yuan Shao on the road and told their story A redfaced warrior with a long beard wielding a huge longhandled sword broke into the army cut off the generals head and bore it off said theyWho was this asked Yuan ShaoJu Shou said It must have been Liu Beis brother Guan Yu it could be nobody else Yuan Shao was very angry and pointing to Liu Bei he said Your brother has slain my beloved leader You are in the plot tooWhy should I save you alive He bade the lictors take Liu Bei away and behead himMorning saw him guest on high Evening prisoner doomed to die Liu Beis actual fate will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER Yuan Shao Loses Another Leader Guan Yu Abandons Rank And Wealth As the last chapter closed Liu Bei had been condemned to dieLiu Bei spoke up however and said Pray hear one word Illustrious Sir before you decideI have lost sight of my brother since my misfortune at Xuzhou and know not whether Guan Yu be dead or aliveThere are many men in the world who resemble him Is every redfaced man with a beard named Guan YuShould you not rather seek some evidence Now Yuan Shao was impulsive and facile by nature and when Liu Bei spoke thus he suddenly turned upon Ju Shou saying By wrongly regarding what you said I nearly killed an innocent person Then Yuan Shao requested Liu Bei once more to resume his seat in the tent and give advice on how to avenge Yan LiangSoon from the lower end a voice was heard saying Yan Liang and I were as brothers and can I allow any other to avenge his death The speaker was a man of middle height with a face like a linlion a famous leader from the North of Yellow River named Wen ChouYuan Shao was pleased and said You are the only man who can do itI will give you one hundred thousand troops and you can cross the Yellow River and quickly smite that rebel Cao CaoYou cannot do it he will fail said Ju ShouThe proper course is to hold Yenjin and detach a force to GuanduIf you rashly cross the river and anything goes wrong not a soul will return Yuan Shao said That is always the way with you fellows always delaying and taking the dash out of the army You put off today and postpone tomorrow till success has become impossibleDo you forget that promptitude is what each soldier honors The adviser withdrew sadly sayingSuperiors do not curb their ambitions inferiors crave for achievements things are undoneEternal is the course of Yellow River shall I change it Thereafter Ju Shou feigned illness and went no more to the council Liu Bei said I have received much kindness at your hands and have been unable to show my gratitude I would accompany General Wen Chou that I may repay your bounty and also that I may hear news of my brother Yuan Shao gladly consented and ordered Wen Chou to share his command with Liu BeiBut the former objected saying Liu Bei has been so often defeated that it will augur ill for success this timeSince you wish I will give Liu Bei command of the rear guard of thirty thousand soldiers And this being approved three legions were told off under Liu Beis special command to follow the main bodyThe prowess displayed by Guan Yu in the bold attack on Yan Liang redoubled Cao Caos respect for him and Cao Cao memorialized the Throne that Guan Yu receive the title of Lord of Hanshou and a seal was cast for himJust then came the unexpected news that Yuan Shaos army had moved toward the Yellow River and was in position above YenjinCao Cao first sent to transfer the inhabitants to Siho and then led out an army to oppose Yuan ShaoHe issued an order to face about thus placing the rear companies in front The commissariat wagons were also placed in the van What is this reversal for asked Lu QianCao Cao replied When the supplies are in rear they are liable to be plunderedSo I have put them first But if you meet the enemy and they steal them Wait till the enemy appears I shall know what to do Lu Qian was much exercised at this new move of the Prime MinisterIn the meantime the supply train moved along the river toward YenjinPresently the foremost troops raised a great shout and Cao Cao sent to see what it meant The messenger came back saying Wen Chous army is approaching and the supply train has been abandoned and is at the mercy of the enemyThe main body is still far behind what to do next Thereupon Cao Cao pointed to two mounds saying We will take refuge here for the present All those near him hastened to the moundsThere Cao Cao ordered them all to loosen their dress lay aside their breastplates and rest a time The horsemen turned their steeds looseWen Chous soldiers approached under coverAs they drew near the officers told Cao Cao saying The rebels are near we ought to catch the horses and go back to Baima But Adviser Xun You checked them saying These are a bait for the enemy why retire Cao Cao glanced across at him and said He understands do not say anything Now having got possession of the supply carts the enemy next came to seize the horsesBy this time they had all broken ranks and were scattered each soldier going his own wayThen suddenly Cao Cao gave the order to go down from the mounds and smite them The surprise was completeWen Chous army was in confusion and Cao Caos army surrounded themWen Chou made a stand but those about him trampled each other down and he could do nothing but flee And he fledThen standing on the top of a mound Cao Cao pointed to the flying leader calling out There is one of the most famous generals of the north who can capture him Zhang Liao and Xu Huang both mounted and dashed after him crying Wen Chou do not run away Looking round the fugitive saw two pursuers and then he set aside his spear took his bow and adjusted an arrow which he shot at Zhang LiaoCease shooting you rebel shouted Xu HuangZhang Liao ducked his head and the shaft went harmlessly by save that it carried away the tassel of his cap He only pressed harder in pursuitThe next arrow however struck his horse in the head and the animal stumbled and fell throwing its rider to the earthThen Wen Chou turned to come back Xu Huang whirling his battleax stood in his way to stop Wen ChouBut Xu Huang saw behind Wen Chou several more horsemen coming to help and as they would have been too many for him he fledWen Chou pursued along the river bankSuddenly he saw coming toward him with banners fluttering in the breeze a small party of horse and the leader carried a great sword Stop cried Guan Yu for it was he and he attacked at once At the third bout Wen Chous heart failed him and he wheeled and fled following the windings of the riverBut Guan Yus steed was fast and soon caught up One blow and the hapless Wen Chou fellWhen Cao Cao saw from the mound that the leader of the enemy had fallen he gave the signal for a general onset and half of the northern army were drowned in the river And the carts with supplies and all the horses were quickly recoveredNow Guan Yu at the head of a few horsemen was thrusting here and striking there at the moment when Liu Bei with the thirty thousand reserve troops appeared on the battle field on the other bank of the riverAt once they told him that the redfaced longbearded warrior was there and had slain Wen Chou Liu Bei hastily pressed forward to try to get a look at the warriorHe saw across the river a body of horse and the banners bore the words Guan Yu Lord of HanshouThen it is my brother and he is really with Cao Cao said Liu Bei secretly thanking God that Guan Yu was safeLiu Bei made an attempt to wait about till he could call to Guan Yu but a great mass of Cao Caos soldiers came rushing down and he was forced to retireYuan Shao bringing reinforcements reached Guandu and built a stockadeTwo advisers Guo Tu and Shen Pei went in to see him and said Again that fellow Guan Yu has been in the battle he killed Wen ChouLiu Bei pretends ignorance of him Their master was angry and railed at Liu Bei The longcared rebelHow dare he do such a thing Soon Liu Bei appeared again Yuan Shao ordered him out to instant executionWhat crime have I committed asked Liu BeiYou sent your brother to slay one of my generals Is that no crime Pray let me explain before I dieCao Cao hated me and has always done so Now he has found out where I am and fearing that I may help you has got my brother to destroy your two generals feeling sure that when you heard of it you would be angry and put me to deathYou cannot fail to see this What he says is sense said Yuan Shao turning to his advisers and you two nearly brought on me the reproach of injuring the good Yuan Shao ordered his attendants to retire and asked Liu Bei to come and sit by him Liu Bei came saying I am deeply thankful Illustrious Sir for your great kindness for which I can never be sufficiently grateful Now I desire to send some confidential messenger with a secret letter to my brother to tell him where I am and I am sure he will come without a moments delay He will help you to destroy Cao Cao to make up for having destroyed your two officersDo you approve of this If I got Guan Yu he would be ten times better than the Yan Liang and Wen Chou that I have lost replied Yuan Shao So Liu Bei prepared a letter But there was no one to take itYuan Shao ordered the army to withdraw to Wuyang where they made a large camp For some time nothing was doneThen Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun to defend the strategic points at Guandu while he led the bulk of the army back to the capitalThere he gave many banquets in honor of the services of Guan Yu and then he told Lu Qian that putting the supplies in the front of the army had been meant as a bait to draw the enemy to destructionOnly Xun You understood that said Cao Cao in conclusion Every one present praised his ingenuityEven while the banquet was proceeding there arrived news of a rising of Yellow Scarves rebels at Runan led by Liu Pi and Gong DuThey were very strong and Cao Hong had been defeated in several engagements Now he begged for helpGuan Yu hearing this said I should like to have the opportunity of performing some service by destroying these rebels You have already rendered noble services for which you have not been properly requited I could hardly trouble you again said Cao CaoI have been idle too long I shall get ill said Guan YuCao Cao then let him to go and gave him fifty thousand troops with Yu Jin and Yue Jin as generals under him They were to leave soonThen Xun Yu said privily to his master He always cherishes the idea of returning to Liu Bei He will leave you if he hears any newsDo not let him go on this expedition If he does well this time I will not let him go into battle again said Cao CaoIn due time the force led by Guan Yu drew near the rebels in Runan and made their campOne night just outside his camp two spies were caught and taken in to Guan Yu who in one of them recognized Sun QianThe attendants being dismissed Guan Yu questioned Sun Qian After we lost sight of each other I have heard not a word of you what are you doing here said Guan YuAfter I escaped I drifted hither and thither till I had the good fortune to reach Runan and Liu Pi and Gong Du the Yellow Scarves leaders took me inBut why are you with Cao Cao GeneralAnd where are your sistersinlawAre they well Guan Yu told him all that had happened I have heard lately that Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao I would have liked to go and join him but I have not found a convenient opportunityNow the two men I am with have taken the side of Yuan Shao against Cao CaoBy good luck you were coming here so I got command of a small party of scouts to be able to see you and tell youPresently our two leaders will pretend to be defeated and you and the two ladies can go over to Yuan Shao And you will see your brother Since he is there I certainly must go at once to see himBut it is a misfortune that I have slain two of Yuan Shaos generals I fear things are not in my favor said Guan YuLet me go first and see how the land lies I will come back and tell you I would risk a myriad deaths to see my brother said Guan YuBut I must go to say farewell to Cao Cao Sun Qian was sent away that night and next day Guan Yu led out his army to offer battleGong Du in armor went out to the front of the line of battle and Guan Yu said You people why have you risen against the government Why do you blame us when you have turned your back on your own lord replied Gong DuHow have I turned my back on my lord Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao and you are with Cao Cao what is that Guan Yu could not reply but he whirled round his sword and rode forwardGong Du fled and Guan Yu followedGong Du turned and said to Guan Yu Do not forget your old chiefs kindnessNow attack as soon as you can and I will give up the defense Guan Yu understood and urged on his troops The leaders of the rebels pretended they were worsted and they all scattered So Runan was retakenHaving pacified the people Guan Yu quickly led his army back to the capital where he was met by Cao Cao and congratulated on his success and feastedWhen this was all over Guan Yu went to the dwelling of his sistersinlaw to pay his respects at their gateHave you been able to get any news of Uncle Liu Bei in your two expeditions asked Lady GanNone replied Guan YuAs he retired from the door he heard sounds of bitter weeping within He is dead said theyOur brotherinlaw thinks we shall be greatly distressed and thus he hides the truth from us One of the old soldiers who acted as guard hearing the sounds of perpetual grief took pity on them and said Do not weep ladies your lord is with Yuan Shao in the North of Yellow River How do you know that said theyI went out with General Guan Yu and one of the soldiers told me The two ladies summoned Guan Yu and reproached him saying Uncle Liu Bei never betrayed you and yet you remain here enjoying the bounty of Cao Cao and forgetting the old timesAnd you tell us falsehoods Guan Yu bowed his head saying My brother really is in the North of Yellow River but I dared not tell you lest it should become knownSomething must be done but done carefully and it needs time BrotherinLaw you should hasten said Lady GanGuan Yu withdrew feeling that he must evolve some scheme of departure without further loss of time It caused him much uneasinessYu Jin having found out that Liu Bei was in the north told Cao Cao who at once sent Zhang Liao to find out Guan Yus intentionsZhang Liao entered jauntily and congratulated Guan Yu saying They tell me you obtained news of your brother in the battlefield I felicitate you My lord was there indeed but I met him notI see nothing to be glad about Is there any difference between the relationship of you two and that of any other two brothers Guan Yu replied You and I stand in the relationship of friends Liu Bei and I are friends and brothers beside and prince and minister in addition to bothOur relationship cannot be discussed in usual terms Well now that you know where your brother is are you going to him How can I go back on what I said beforeI am sure you will explain fully to the Prime Minister Zhang Liao went back and told his master who said I must find a way to keep him here While Guan Yu was pondering over his difficulties they told him that a friend had come to inquire for himThe visitor was introduced but Guan Yu did not recognize himWho are you asked Guan YuI am Chen Zhen of Nanyang in the service of Yuan Shao In great perturbation Guan Yu sent away the attendants and they being gone said There is some special reason for your visit For reply Chen Zhen drew out a letter and handed it to his host who recognized that it was from his brother Liu BeiThe letter readI the writer and you Sir pledged ourselves in the Peach Garden to die togetherWhy then are we apart and yet alive our kindly feelings destroyed our sense of right outragedIf you desire to obtain fame and acquire riches and honor I will offer my head without hesitation so that your achievement is fulfilledMore might be said but I await your commands with great anxiety Guan Yu finished the letter with a bitter cry I always wanted to find my brother but I did not know where he was How can he think such evil of me said heLiu Bei looks for you very eagerly and if you are still bound by the old pledge you should go quickly said Chen ZhenAny one born into the world without the essential virtue of sincerity is no true humanI came here openly and can go in no other wayNow will I write a letter which I will ask you to bear to my brother that as soon as I can take leave of Cao Cao I will bring the ladies and come to him But what if Cao Cao refuse to let you go said Chen ZhenThen would I rather die I will not remain here Then Sir quickly write your letter and relieve your brother from his anxiety So Guan Yu wrote like thisI the humble one know full well that a human of principle does not betray and a human of loyalty despises deathI have been a student in my youth and know somewhat of the proprieties I sigh and weep at the memory of the fraternal affection that made Yangjue Ai and Zuo Botao die rather than separate I was in charge of Xiapi but the place lacked provision and there was no helpI would have fought to the death but there was on my shoulders the responsibility for my sistersinlawWherefore I had to take care of my body lest I betrayed your trust And so I made a prisoner of myself hoping to find a way of releaseI heard of you lately in RunanI must however bid farewell to Cao Cao and bring the ladies with me when I comeMay I perish victim to the superhuman powers if I have harbored any traitorous thoughtInk and paper are poor substitutes for what I would say but I look to see you soon Chen Zhen left with this missive and Guan Yu went to tell the womenThen he proceeded to the Prime Ministers palace to say farewellBut Cao Cao knew what he was coming for and at the gate Guan Yu found the board intimating that no one could be received So he had to return However he bade his own few soldiers prepare to start at any momentHe also gave orders that everything received from Cao Cao was to be left in the quarters nothing was to be takenNext day he again proceeded to the Palace to say farewell to his patron but again found the board hanging there to show there was no admissionSo it was several times he could never enterThen he went to see Zhang Liao but he was indisposedThis means Cao Cao will not let me go thought Guan YuBut I am going and I shall hesitate no longer So he wrote this letterAs a young man I entered the service of the Imperial Uncle and pledged myself to share his fortunesHeaven and Earth witnessed this oathWhen I lost the city I made three requests which you grantedNow I hear my brother is with Yuan Shao and I remembering our pledge cannot but go to himThough your bounty is great I forget not the bond of the past wherefore I write this letter of farewell trusting that when you have read it you will be content for me to postpone to another season the proof of my gratitude Guan Yu sealed and sent it to the PalaceThen he deposited in the treasury of his dwelling all the gold and silver he had received hung his seal of lordship of Hanshou in the middle of the reception hall and left taking his sistersinlaw with him in a carriageHe rode RedHare and carried the greendragon saber in his hand With a small escort of guards those formerly under his command he left the city by the north gateThe wardens would have stopped him but Guan Yu frightened them with a fierce shoutHaving got out he told the escort to go in front with the carriage while he would remain behind to guard against pursuit So they pushed the carriage toward the high roadIn the city Guan Yus letter reached the Prime Minister while he was consulting about what to doHe read it and exclaimed So he has left Then the warden of the gate came to report that Guan Yu had forced his way out and was gone with a carriage a horse and a score of guardsNext came the servants from his house to report that he had left taking nothing of the treasure nor any one of the waiting maidsEverything was left in the house Even his seal was there His only escort were the few soldiers of his original forceSuddenly from the assembly of officers rose a voice saying With three thousand of mailed horse I will bring him back alive Their eyes turned to the speaker who was General Cai YangOn the dragons cave he turns his back But numberless wolves infest his trackWhat came of this offer to pursue will be seen in the next chapter CHAPTER The Man of Beautiful Beard Rides On A Solitary Journey Guan Yu Slays Six Generals Through Five Passes Now of all the officers in Cao Caos army the two friendly toward Guan Yu were Zhang Liao and Xu Huang The others treated Guan Yu with respect except Cai Yang who was decidedly inimicalSo this Cai Yang was ready to pursue and capture Guan Yu as soon as he heard of his departure But Cao Cao accepted Guan Yus going as naturalHe does not forget his old leader and he was perfectly open in all his actions He is a gentleman and you would do well to follow his example said Cao CaoSo Cao Cao bade the wouldbe pursuer be gone and say no more about pursuit You were exceedingly good to Guan Yu said Cheng Yu but he went off very rudely He certainly left a screed behind with his reasons but he affronted you and that is no light matterNow to let him join Yuan Shao is to add wings to a tigerYou would better catch him and put him to death so as to guard against future evil Cao Cao replied But he had my promise and can I break my wordEach has his masterDo not pursue But Cao Cao said to Zhang Liao He has rejected all I gave him so bribes were powerless with him in whatever shape I have the greatest respect for such as himHe has not yet gone far and I will try to strengthen his attachment to me and make one appeal to sentimentRide after him and beg him to stop till I can come up and bid farewell and offer him a sum of money for his expenses and a fighting robe that he may remember me kindly in after days So Zhang Liao rode out quite alone Cao Cao followed him leisurely with an escort of a score or soNow the steed that Guan Yu rode was RedHare and it was very fastNo one could have come up with him but that there was the ladies carriage to escort and so RedHare had to be held in and go slowSuddenly Guan Yu heard a shout behind him a voice crying Go slowly Guan Yu He turned and made out the person to be Zhang LiaoOrdering the pushers of the carriage to press on along the high road he reined in his steed held the greendragon saber ready for a stroke and waited for Zhang Liao to come up Of course you have come to take me back Zhang Liao said Guan YuNo the Prime Minister seeing that you are going a long journey wishes to see you on your way and told me to hasten forward and beg you to wait till he can come upThat is the only thing Seeing that he is coming along with mailed men I shall fight to the very last said Guan YuAnd he took up his position on a bridge where he waited the approach of the party who advanced quicklyFour of Cao Caos generals Xu Chu Xu Huang Yu Jin and Li Dian followed closeSeeing Guan Yu was ready to fight Cao Cao ordered his escort to open out in two lines and then it was seen they carried no arms This relieved his mind for it proved to Guan Yu they meant no attackWhy do you go in such haste Guan Yu asked Cao CaoGuan Yu inclined his head but did not dismount saying I informed you in writing that since my lord was in the North of Yellow River I had to leave at onceI went to your palace again and again but was refused admittance So I wrote a letter of farewell sealed up the treasure resigned my lordship seal and left everything for youI hope you recall the promise you once made me Cao Cao replied My desire is to keep my troth with all people I cannot go back on my wordHowever you may find the journey expensive and therefore I have here prepared a sum of money to help you Then from horseback Cao Cao held out a packet of goldGuan Yu said I have sufficient left from your former bounty keep that for presents to your soldiers Why should you refuse thisIt is but an insignificant return for great services My services have been all trifling not worth mentioning Really Guan Yu you are the most highprincipled of humansI am very sorry my luck is too poor to retain you at my sidePray accept just this robe to show you I am not quite ungrateful said Cao CaoAnd one of his generals dismounting held up a silken coat in both handsGuan Yu even still fearful of what might happen would not dismount but he reached down his sword and took the robe on its point Then he threw it over his shoulders and turned to thank the giver saying I thank you Sir Prime Minister for the robe and trust we shall meet again So saying Guan Yu went down from the bridge and bore away to the north He is a very rude man said Xu Chu who was of the escortWhy do you not take him prisoner Cao Cao replied He was absolutely alone facing scores of us he was justified in being suspiciousBut my word has gone forth and he is not to be pursued Cao Cao and his escort returned the Prime Minister very sad when he thought of the man who had goneGuan Yu went down from the bridge and started in the wake of the carriage carrying the two ladies which should have gone about ten miles while this interview had been going onHe could see no signs of it and rode hither and thither looking on all sidesPresently he heard some one shouting from a hill calling him by name to haltHe saw a youth wearing a yellow turban and dressed in a silk robe He held a spear in his hand and was mounted on a horse from the neck of which dangled a bloody head Behind him were a hundred or so men on foot and they advanced quicklyWho are you asked Guan YuThe young man dropped his spear dismounted and made a low bowGuan Yu feared this was some ruse so he only checked his horse and gripped his sword the more firmly saying Sir I desire you to tell me your name My name is Liao HuaI belong to a Xiangyang familySince these troubled times began I have been an outlaw among the rivers and lakes and I and my comrades have lived by plunder We are about five hundred in allBy chance my friend Du Yuan came across two ladies in a carriage just now and quite wrongly he took them prisoners and brought them to the hold in the hillsI questioned the servants and so found out who they were and who was escorting them So I wished them to be set free to pursue their journeyDu Yuan opposed this and spoke so illmannerly that I killed himAnd here is his headI pray you pardon me Where are the two ladies They are among the hills replied Liao HuaBring them down here at once said Guan YuIn a short time a party of the brigands pushed the carriage down the hill and the ladies sat there before him Then Guan Yu dismounted laid aside his sword and stood respectfully before them with his arms crossed Sisters have you been alarmed asked heThey replied We should have suffered at the hands of Du Yuan had it not been for Liao Hua How did Liao Hua come to save the ladies asked Guan Yu of those who stood byThey said Du Yuan carried off the ladies and proposed that he and Liao Hua should have one each as wifeBut Liao Hua had found out they were of gentle birth and worthy and was for treating them with respectWhen Du Yuan disagreed Liao Hua slew him Hearing this Guan Yu bowed to Liao Hua and thanked himLiao Hua then wanted to join himself and his troop to Guan Yu but Guan Yu seeing he was a Yellow Scarf would have nothing to do with him So Guan Yu simply thanked him for his kindness to the ladiesLiao Hua offered some presents but these were also declinedSo Liao Hua took his leave and presently disappeared in a valley among the hillsGuan Yu told his sisters the story of his interview with Cao Cao and the gift of a robe and then he urged the carriage on its wayTowards dark they came to a farm where they would restThe farmer an old graybeard came out to welcome the party and asked who they wereGuan Yu described himself as the brother of Liu Bei and said his nameSurely you are no other than the slayer of Yan Liang and Wen Chou said the venerable hostThat is so replied Guan YuCome in said the old man joyfullyMy two sistersinlaw are in the carriage said Guan Yu will you let your women folks go out to receive them As Guan Yu remained standing there the host asked him to be seated but he would not sit while the women were present and remained standing in a respectful attitude till the old mans wife had returned and ushered the ladies into the inner apartmentsThen the old man set to the entertainment of his guest in the guest hallGuan Yu asked his nameHe replied I am called Hu HuaIn the days of the Emperor Huan I was an officer of the court but I resigned and retired into private lifeI have a son Hu Ban with Governor Wang Zhi of Yingyang and if you should be going that way General I should like to send him a letter by you Guan Yu said he would take the letterNext day after an early meal the ladies got into their carriage the host handed his letter to Guan Yu and the little party once more took the road They went toward LuoyangPresently they approached a pass known as the Dongling Pass guarded by Commander Kong Xiu and five hundred soldiersWhen the soldiers saw a carriage being pushed toward the pass they ran to tell their commander who came out to accost the travelersGuan Yu dismounted and returned the officers salute and Kong Xiu said Whither are you going I have left the Prime Minister to go into the North of Yellow River to find my brother But Yuan Shao is my masters rivalYou have authority from him to go thither I left hurriedly and could not get it If you have no authority you must wait while I send to request orders To remain while you send and receive an answer will delay me greatly said Guan YuI must stand by my instructions that is the only thing to do said Kong XiuThen you refuse to let me pass If you want to go through leave the family as a gage At this Guan Yu got very angry and made to cut at the commander on the spot but Kong Xiu withdrew into the gate and beat the drums for an attackThereupon the soldiers armed themselves mounted and came down to oppose the passage crying Dare you go through eh The carriage was sent off to a safe distance and then Guan Yu rode at full speed directly at the commander of the guard who set his spear and came to meet himThe two steeds met and the men engaged but at the first stroke of the greendragon saber the commander of the gate fell to the earth deadHis troops fledSoldiers do not flee cried Guan YuI killed him because I could do no otherwiseI have nothing against you but I would ask you to tell the Prime Minister how this thing came to pass that Kong Xiu wished to kill me and so I slew him in self defense The soldiers bowed before him and Guan Yu with the carriage passed through the gates and continued their way to LuoyangBut one of the guards of the pass went quickly in advance and informed the Governor of Luoyang Han Fu of the slaughter of Kong XiuWherefore Han Fu assembled his officers to take counselMeng Tan one of his generals said This Guan Yu must be a fugitive or he would have a safe conductOur only course is to stop him or we shall incur blame The man is fierce and brave Remember the fate of Yan Liang and Wen ChouIt seems vain to oppose him by force and so we must think out some trap for him said Han Fu I have a ruse ready said Meng Tan I will close the gate with thorny blockades and I will go to fight with him I will engage and then flee and you can shoot him from an ambush along the roadIf we can get him and his party and send them prisoners to the capital we ought to be well rewarded This course was determined upon and soon they heard that Guan Yu was approachingHan Fu strung his bow and filled his quiver with arrows and with one thousand soldiers took up position along the passThen as the party approached Han Fu said Who is the traveler who comes Guan Yu bowed low and said He is a certain Guan Yu Lord of Hanshou and he wishes to go through the pass Have you a letter from the Prime Minister In the hurry of departure I did not get any My special orders from him are to hold this pass and make examination of all spies that may go to and froAny person without an authority must be a fugitive Then Guan Yu began to be angry saying I have killed Kong Xiu at Dongling PassDo you also seek death Who will capture him for me cried Han Fu and Meng Tan offered himself He rode out whirling his double swords and made straight for Guan YuGuan Yu sent back the carriage out of danger and then rode toward Meng TanThey engaged but very soon Meng Tan turned his steed and fledGuan Yu pursued Meng Tan intent only on leading his enemy toward the ambush took no account of the speed of RedHareVery soon Meng Tan was caught up and a stroke of the mighty sword cut him in two piecesThen Guan Yu stopped and turned back The archers in the gate shot their hardest and though it was a long way off one of them lodged an arrow in his left arm He pulled it out with his teeth but the blood streamed down as he rode toward Governor Han Fu The men scattered Guan Yu rode straight at his next victim He raised his sword and made an oblique cut which sliced off the head and shoulder of Han Fu Then Guan Yu drove off the soldiers and returned to escort the carriageHe bound up his wound and fearing lest any one might take advantage of his weakness he made no long halts on the road but hurried toward River Si PassThe warden of this pass was Bian Xi of Bingzhou a warrior whose weapon was a comethammerHe had been a Yellow Scarf and had gone over to Cao Cao who had given him this postAs soon as he heard of the coming of the redoubtable Guan Yu he cudgeled his brains for a ruse to use against him He decided upon an ambush In the Guardian Temple at the pass he placed two hundred axmen and swordsmen He reckoned on enticing Guan Yu to the temple for refreshment and when he let fall a cup as signal the hidden ruffians would rush outAll being thus arranged and ready he went out to welcome Guan Yu in friendly guise and Guan Yu dismounted at his coming Bian Xi began very amiablyYour name General makes the very earth tremble and every one looks up to youThis return to the Imperial Uncle proves you to be noble and true Guan Yu in reply told him the story of the men he had slain in the last two passesBian Xi replied You slew them that is wellWhen I see the Prime Minister I will explain to him the inner reasons for these acts Guan Yu thought he had found a friend and so mounted and rode through the passWhen he came to the temple a number of priests came out to meet him with clanging bellsThis temple named Guardian of the State had a courtyard in which the Emperor Ming had burned incense in the past In the temple were thirty priests and among these there happened to be one Pu Jing who came from the same village as Guan YuHis religious name was TransversePeace Hearing who the visitor was TransversePeace came forward to speak with himGeneral said TransversePeace it is many a long year since you left Pudong Yes said Guan Yu nearly twenty years Do you recognize this poor priest I left the village many years ago I do not recognize you My house and yours were only separated by a rivulet said the priestNow Bian Xi seeing TransversePeace holding forth about village matters thought TransversePeace would blab about the ambush so Bian Xi bade him be silent I want to invite the General to a feast You priest fellows seem to have a lot to say said Bian XiNot too much said Guan YuNaturally when fellow villagers meet they talk of old times Bian Xi invited the visitor into the guest room to take tea but Guan Yu said The two ladies are out there in the carriage they ought to have some first So the priest bade them take some tea to the ladies and then he led Guan Yu within at the same time lifting the priest knife which he wore at his side and looking meaningfully at Guan YuThe latter understood and told his people to bring along his weapon and keep close at his sideWhen Bian Xi invited Guan Yu to go into the Hall of the Laws for some refreshment Guan Yu turned to him saying Is this invitation with good intention or evil Bian Xi was so taken aback that he could make no reply and then Guan Yu saw that many armed men were concealed behind the arrasThen Guan Yu shouted loudly at Bian Xi saying What means this I thought you an honorable manHow dare you The traitor saw that his plot had failed and called to the assassins to come out and fall to but Guan Yu had a short sword in his hand and slashed at any one who came nearSo they scattered Their commander ran down the hall and tried to escape among the side buildings but Guan Yu threw aside the short sword took up the greendragon saber and went after Bian XiThe latter was trying to get into position to throw his comethammer but Guan Yu cut the cord and the weapon was useless Guan Yu followed Bian Xi in and out and soon caught up with himThen with one blow Guan Yu cut him in halvesThe fight over Guan Yu sought the two ladies who were surrounded by soldiers These fled at sight of the terrible warriorSeeking out the priest his fellow countryman he thanked him for the timely warning which had saved him from deathI cannot remain here after this said TransversePeace I shall pack up my few garments and my alms bowl and take to the road vague in my wanderings as the clouds in the skyBut we shall meet again and till then take care of yourself Then Guan Yu took leave and retook the road to YingyangThe Governor of this city was named Wang Zhi and he was related to Han Fu by their childrens marriageHearing of the death of his relative Wang Zhi set about a scheme to kill Guan Yu secretlyHe sent soldiers to guard the city gates and when he heard that Guan Yu approached he went himself and received Guan Yu with a smiling countenance and bade Guan Yu welcomeGuan Yu told him the object of his journeyYou General have been able to get some exercise on the road but the ladies in their carriage must be cramped and fatigued I pray you come into the city and all of you remain the night in the official travelers quartersTomorrow you can set forth again The offer was tempting and his host seemed in earnest so the two ladies went into the city where they found everything very comfortably prepared for themAnd though Guan Yu declined the Governors invitations to a banquet refreshments for the travelers were sent to their lodgingsGuan Yu was fatigued from the trials of the journey and as soon as the evening meal was over he bade the ladies retire to rest while he sat down in the main room quite alone for he bade all to get repose while they couldHis horse was given a good feed for onceHe sat with his armor loosened in order to be more at ease Now Governor Wang Zhi had a secretary named Hu Ban to whom he had entrusted the arrangements for the destruction of his guestSaid Wang Zhi This Guan Yu is a traitor to the Prime Minister and a fugitive On the road he has murdered several Commanders of Passes and is guilty of serious crimesBut he is too strong and valiant for any ordinary soldier to overcomeSo this evening a whole company of a thousand troops will surround his lodging each one armed with a torch and we will burn him They will start the fire about midnightEvery one of the party will perishI will come with a force to stand by and assist if necessary These orders received Hu Ban passed them on to the soldiers who began secretly to prepare dry wood and other combustibles which they piled up at the gate of the rest houseHu Ban thought within himself that he would like to know what manner of man was this Guan Yu whose fame had spread so far so he determined to get a peep at the guest He went to the rest house and inquired where Guan Yu wasThe General is the man in the main hall reading was the replyHu Ban noiselessly made his way to the outside of the room and peeped in He saw the famous warrior stroking his beard with his left hand while he read by the light of a lamp placed on a low table An involuntary exclamation of wonder escaped at the majesty of the figureReally a god Hu Ban sighedWho is there suddenly asked the reader at the soundHu Ban entered and said I am the Governors secretary Hu Ban Surely you are the son of Hu Hua who lives outside Xuchang said Guan YuI am he replied Hu BanThen Guan Yu called up his followers and bade them look among the baggage for the letter which they broughtGuan Yu handed it to the secretary who read it and then breathed long saying I very nearly caused the death of a good man Then he betrayed the whole plot saying This Wang Zhi is a wicked man who wanted to kill you At this moment you are surrounded and at the third watch they will set fire to this placeNow I will go and open the city gates while you hastily prepare for flight Guan Yu was greatly surprised but he quickly buckled up his armor got his steed ready roused the two ladies and put them into their carriage Then they left the rest house and as they passed out they saw the soldiers all about them each with a torchThe party hastened to the outskirts of the city and found the gate already open and they lost no time in getting clear of the cityHu Ban returned to give orders to fire the rest houseThe fugitives pressed on but before long they saw lights coming up behind them and Wang Zhi called out to them to stopGuan Yu reined in his horse and began to abuse him crying Worthless fellowWhat had you against me that you wished to burn me to death Wang Zhi whipped up his steed and set his spear but Guan Yu cut him through with the short sword he wore at his side and scattered his followersThen the carriage pushed on Guan Yus heart was filled with gratitude to Hu BanWhen they drew near Huazhou some one told Liu Yan who rode out to welcome him Liu Yan had been once rescued by Guan Yu who slew Yan Liang and Wen Chou and lifted the siege of the cityGuan Yu did not dismount but bowed from horseback saying Have you been quite well since we parted Whither are you going Sir replied Liu YanI have left the Prime Minister and am on my way to find my brother Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao who is at enmity with the Prime Minister How can you be allowed to go to him asked Liu YanThat matter was settled long ago The Yellow River Ferry is an important point and is guarded by a commander of Xiahou Dun he will not let you cross But suppose then you provide boats for me Though there are boats I dare not give them to you Well formerly I slew Yan Liang and Wen Chou and saved you a grave dangerNow you refuse me a ferry boat I am afraid Xiahou Dun will know of it and make it a fault against me Guan Yu perceived that no help was to be expected from this man so he pushed on and presently reached the ferryThere the Commander of the Guard Qin Qi came out to question himI am one Guan Yu Lord of Hanshou Whither are you bound I go to the North of Yellow River to seek my brother Liu Bei and I respectfully ask you to grant me a passage over the river Where is the authority of the Prime Minister I am not on a mission from the Prime Minister so why should I have such an authority I have orders from my chief to guard the ferry and you will not cross even if you grew wings you should not fly over Guan Yus choler aroseDo you know that I have been the death of all those who have hitherto tried to stop me said heYou have only slain a few officers of no rank or reputation but you dare not kill me Where would you stand beside Yan Liang and Wen Chou asked Guan YuQin Qi grew angry and he loosed his rein Sword in hand he came at a gallopThe two met but in the first encounter Qin Qis head was swept off by the terrible greendragon saberHe who opposed me is dead you others need not be afraid cried Guan YuBe quick and prepare me a boat The boat was soon at the landing and the two women stepped on board followed by Guan YuThey crossed and were then in the country of Yuan ShaoIn the course of his journey to this point Guan Yu had forced five passes and slain six generalsHis seal hung up the treasury locked his courtly mansion left He journeyed toward his brother dear too long from his side leftThe horse he rode was famed for speed as for endurance great His good sword made a way for him and opened every gateHis loyalty and truth forth stand a pattern unto all His valor would frighten rushing streams and make high mountains fallAlone he traveled lustily this was death to meet his blade He has been themed by myriads his glory never will fadeI did not willingly slay a single one of them mused Guan Yu as he rode along There was no help for itNevertheless when Cao Cao hears of it he will regard me as ungrateful for his bounty Before long he saw a rider on the road who soon hailed him and proved to be Sun QianI have never heard a word from you since we lost sight of each other at Runan how have you fared said Guan Yu After your departure Liu Pi and Gong Du retook the cityI was sent by them to Yuan Shao to try to make peace with him and succeeded so that Yuan Shao invited Liu Bei to go to him and share in the deliberations for a concerted attack on Cao CaoBut to my disgust the leaders of Yuan Shaos army showed great jealousy of each other so that Tian Feng got into gaol Ju Shou was degraded and others quarreledThen Yuan Shao vacillated and hesitated so that your brother and I consulted how we might get away from them allNow the Uncle is at Runan with Liu Pi and thinking you could not know that and might suffer some harm if you unwillingly went to Yuan Shao I have come to warn youIt is good fortune to find you like thisNow we can hasten to Runan and you will meet your brother Guan Yu took Sun Qian to make his bow to the ladies who asked after his adventures and Sun Qian said Uncle Liu Bei were nearly executed due to Yuan Shaos sudden bursts of anger after the deaths of Yan Liang and Wen ChouNow however he is out of his way and safe at Runan and you will meet him soon The ladies covered their faces and wept at the recital of his dangersThen the party no longer traveled north but took the road toward RunanNot long after a great cloud of dust was noticed behind them and that presently made out a hundred of horsemen These were led by Xiahou Dun who shouted out to Guan Yu to stopOne by one the pass commanders stopped his progress and were slain The river crossed another army comes and he must fight againHow finally Guan Yu escaped death will appear in the succeeding chapterCHAPTER  Putting Cai Yang To Death The Brothers Doubts Disappear Meeting At Gucheng Lord and Liege Fortify Each Other Sun Qian had joined Guan Yu in escorting the two ladies and they were on the road to Runan when Xiahou Dun suddenly determined to pursue So with a couple of hundred horse Xiahou Dun set outWhen Xiahou Dun was seen approaching Guan Yu bade Sun Qian go ahead with the carriage while he remained to deal with the pursuersWhen they were near enough Guan Yu said In coming after me thus you do not reinforce the magnanimity of your master Replied Xiahou Dun The Prime Minister has sent no definite instructionsYou have caused the death of several people among them one of my commanders and so I have come to capture you You have behaved most grosslyThe Prime Minister will decide Thereupon Xiahou Dun dashed forward with his spear ready to thrustBut at that moment a rider came up behind him at full gallop crying You must not fight with Guan Yu Guan Yu stayed his steed at once and waitedThe messenger came up drew from his bosom an official letter and said to Xiahou Dun The Prime Minister loves General Guan Yu for his loyalty and honor and fearing lest Guan Yu might be stopped at the various passes he sent me with this letter to show when necessary at any point on the road But this Guan Yu has slain several commanders of the passes does the Prime Minister know that said Xiahou DunThe messenger said these things were unknownThen said Xiahou Dun I will arrest him and take him to the Prime Minister who may set him free or not as he wills Do you think I fear anything you can do said Guan Yu getting wrathful And he rode forwardXiahou Dun nothing loth set his spear and prepared for battleThey met and had reached the tenth encounter when a second horseman came up at full speed crying Generals wait a little Xiahou Dun stayed his hand and asked the messenger saying Am I to arrest him No replied the messengerFearing lest he should have difficulties at the passes the Prime Minister has sent me with a dispatch to say he is to be released Did the Prime Minister know that he had slain several commanders on the way He did not know Since he was ignorant of that I may not let this Guan Yu go and Xiahou Dun gave the signal to his men to close in round Guan YuBut Guan Yu flourished his sword and made to attack them and a fight was again imminent when a third rider appeared who cried Guan Yu give way and do not fight The speaker was Zhang Liao Both combatants made no further move but awaited his arrivalZhang Liao said I bring the Prime Ministers order that since he has heard that Guan Yu has slain certain commanders on the way he fears that some will hinder his passage Wherefore he has sent me to deliver his command at each gate that Guan Yu is to be suffered to pass freely Xiahou Dun said Qin Qi was the son of Cai Yangs sister and he was confided to my especial careNow this Guan Yu has killed him and how can I refrain When I see his uncle Cai Yang I will explainBut now the main point is that you have the Prime Ministers orders to let Guan Yu pass and you may not despise his wish So the only thing for Xiahou Dun to do was to retire and he didWhither are you going then said Zhang Liao to Guan YuI fear my brother is no longer with Yuan Shao and now I am going to find him wherever he is As you do not know where to go why not return to the Prime Minister Where is the sense of that said Guan Yu with a smileBut Zhang Liao you return and try to arrange pardon for my faults With this Guan Yu saluted Zhang Liao and took his leaveZhang Liao retired and joined Xiahou DunGuan Yu quickly regained the carriage and as they went along side by side he told Sun Qian what had happenedSeveral days later a heavy rain storm came on which soaked everythingLooking about for protection they noticed a farm under the shelter of a precipice and took their way thitherAn old man came out to them to whom they told their storyWhen they had finished the old fellow said My name is Guo Chang and I have lived here many yearsI am very pleased to greet the man whom I have known so long by reputation Guo Chang quickly killed a sheep for their refreshment and brought out wine for the two men The two ladies were entertained in the inner apartmentsAnd while they refreshed themselves their baggage was put out to dry and their steeds were fedAs the day closed in they saw several youths come along and their host said My son is come to pay his respects This is my humble son said Guo Chang presenting a lad to Guan YuWhat has he been doing asked Guan YuHe has just come in from hunting The young fellow went outThe old man continued All my family have been farmers or scholars He is my only son and instead of following in the footsteps of his ancestors he cares for nothing but gadding about and hunting unhappily Why unhappily said Guan YuIn these days of disorder a good soldier can make a name for himself If he would only learn the military arts that would be something of a career but he is nothing but a vagabond and does everything he should notHe is a grief to me Guan Yu sighed in sympathy The old gentleman stayed till a late hour and when he took his leave his two guests began to prepare for restSuddenly outside there arose a great hubbub men shouting and horses neighingGuan Yu called to his people but as no one answered he and Sun Qian drew their swords and went into the stable yardThere they found their hosts son on the ground shouting to his followers to fightGuan Yu asked what it was all about and his guards told him The young fellow had tried to steal RedHare but had been badly kickedWe heard shouting and went to see what it meant when his men had set on us Guan Yu was very wrathfulYou mean thieves Would you steal my horse cried heBut before he could do anything his host came running out saying It was not with my consent that my son did this evil thing I know he is very guilty and deserves deathBut his mother loves him tenderly and I pray you be generous and pardon him Really he is unworthy of his father said Guan YuWhat you told me shows he is a degenerateFor your sake I pardon him Then Guan Yu told his own people to keep a better lookout sent the people about their business and in company with Sun Qian went away to restNext morning both host and hostess were up betimes waiting to thank Guan Yu for forgiving their sons mad freak My son has insulted your tiger dignity I know and I am deeply affected by your kindness in not punishing him said the old manBring him here and I will talk to him said Guan YuHe went out before daylight with a lot of his fellow rogues and I know not where he is So Guan Yu bade them farewell got the ladies into their carriage and they moved out of the farmyard Guan Yu and Sun Qian riding abreast as escort They took the road toward the hillsBefore they had gone far they saw a large party of men led by a couple of riders pouring down one of the gullies One of the riders wore a yellow turban and a battle robeThe other was Guo Changs sonThe wearer of the turban called out saying I am one of the commanders of Zhang Jue the Lord of HeavenWhoever you may be leave that horse you are riding for meYou may then go free Guan Yu greeted the speech with a hearty laugh O you mad ignoramusIf you had ever been with Zhang Jue as a bandit you would have learned to know Liu Bei Guan Yu and Zhang Fei the three brothers I have heard of the ruddy long beard called Guan Yu but I have never seen himWho may you be Guan Yu then laid aside his sword stopped his horse and drew off the bag that covered his beard thus showing its magnificenceThe turban wearer immediately slipped out of the saddle laid an angry hand on his companion and they both bowed low in front of Guan Yus steedWho are you asked Guan YuI am Pei YuanshaoAfter the death of Zhang Jue I was left forlorn and I got together a few others like myself and we took refuge in the forestsThis morning early this fellow came to tell us that a guest at his fathers farm had a valuable horse and proposed to me to steal itI did not think I should meet you General The wretched Guo Changs son implored that his life might be spared and Guan Yu pardoned him for his fathers sakeThen Guan Yu covered his face and crept awayYou did not recognize me how then did you know my name asked Guan YuPei Yuanshao replied Not far from here is a mountain called the Sleeping Bull where lives a certain Zhou Cang a very powerful man who came from the west He has a stiff curly beard and looks very handsomeHe also was a commander in the rebel army who took to the forest when his leader perishedHe has told me a lot about you but I have never had the happiness of seeing you Said Guan Yu Under the green wood trees is no place for a heros footYou would better abandon this depraved life and return to the path of virtueDo not work out your own destruction As they were talking a troop of horsemen appeared in the distanceThey belonged to Zhou Cang as Pei Yuanshao said and Guan Yu waited for them to approachThe leader was very dark complexioned tall and armed with a spearAs soon as he drew near enough to see he exclaimed joyfully This is General Guan Yu In a moment he had slipped out of the saddle and was on his knees by the roadside Zhou Cang renders obeisance said heSaid Guan Yu O Warrior where have you known me I was one of the Yellow Scarves and I saw you then My one regret was that I could not join youNow that my good fortune has brought me here I hope you will not reject meLet me be one of your foot soldiers to be always near you to carry your whip and run by your stirrupI will cheerfully die for you As he seemed thoroughly in earnest Guan Yu said But if you follow me what of your companions They may do as they please follow me or go their ways Thereupon they all shouted We will follow Guan Yu dismounted and went to ask the ladies what they thought of thisLady Gan replied BrotherinLaw you have traveled thus far alone and without fighters you have safely passed many dangers and never wanted their assistanceYou refused the service of Liao Hua why then suffer this crowdBut this is only a my view and you must decide What you say SisterinLaw is to the point Therefore returning to Zhou Cang he said It is not that I am lacking in gratitude but my sistersinlaw do not care for a large followingWherefore return to the mountains till I shall have found my brother when I will surely call you Zhou Cang replied I am only a rough uncouth fellow wasting his life as a brigandMeeting you General is like seeing the full sun in the skies and I feel that I can never bear to miss you againAs it might be inconvenient for all my people to follow you I will bid my companion lead them away but I will come and follow you on foot wherever you go Guan Yu again asked his sistersinlaw what they thought of thisLady Gan said one or two made no difference and so Guan Yu consentedBut Pei Yuanshao was not satisfied with this arrangement and said he wished also to followZhou Cang said If you do not stay with the band they will disperse and be lostYou must take command for the moment and let me accompany General Guan YuAs soon as he has a fixed abode I will come to fetch you Somewhat discontentedly Pei Yuanshao accepted the situation and marched off while his onetime colleague joined the train of Guan Yu and they went toward RunanThey traveled quickly for some days and then they saw a city on a hillThe natives told them This city is called GuchengA few months before a warrior suddenly appeared drove out the magistrate and took possession Then he has begun to recruit soldiers buy up horses and lay in stores The warriors name is Zhang Fei Now he has a large force and no one in the neighborhood dare face him To think that I should find my brother like this said Guan Yu delightedI have had never a word of him nor knew I where he was since Xuzhou fell So Guan Yu dispatched Sun Qian into the city to tell its new commander to come out to meet him and provide for their sistersinlawNow after being separated from his brothers Zhang Fei had gone to the Mangdang Hills where he had remained a month or so while he sent far and near for tidings of Liu BeiThen as he happened to pass Gucheng he had sent in to borrow some grain but had been refusedIn revenge he had driven away the magistrate and taken possession of the city He found the place well suited to his needs at the momentAs directed by Guan Yu Sun Qian entered the city and after the usual ceremonies told Zhang Fei the news Liu Bei has left Yuan Shao and gone to Runan and Guan Yu with your sistersinlaw is at the gatesHe wishes you to go out and receive them Zhang Fei listened without a word till he came to the request to go out to meet his brotherAt that point he called for his armor and when he had put it on laid hold of his long octaneserpent halberd mounted and rode out with a large company at his backSun Qian was too astonished to ask what this meant and simply followedGuan Yu was very glad when he saw his brother coming put up his weapons and with Zhou Cang at his back rode toward him at full speedBut as Guan Yu approached he saw all the signs of fierce anger on Zhang Feis face and Zhang Fei roared as he shook his spear threatening Guan YuGuan Yu was entirely taken aback and called out anxiously Brother what does this meanIs the Peach Garden Pledge quite forgotten What impudence is this that you come to see me since your disgraceful behavior shouted Zhang FeiWhat disgraceful behavior has been mine said Guan YuYou have betrayed your brother you have surrendered to Cao Cao and you have received title and office at his handsAnd now you are come to exploit meOne of us shall die Guan Yu said Really you do not understand and it is hard for me to explainBut ask the two ladies here Worthy Brother and they will tell you At this the ladies lifted the curtain of the carriage and called outBrother why is this Zhang Fei said Wait a while sisters and see me slay this traitorAfter that I will conduct you into the city Said Lady Gan Since he knew not where you were our brother took shelter with Cao CaoAnd since he knew that his elder brother was at Runan he has braved every danger to escort us thus far on the roadPray take a correct view of his conduct Lady Mi also chimed in When your brother went to Xuchang no other course was open to him Sisters do not let him blind you to the truthReal loyalty prefers death to dishonorNo good person can serve two masters Guan Yu said Brother cease to wrench me I pray you Sun Qian said Guan Yu came expressly to seek you How much more nonsense will you talk roared Zhang Fei How can he be trueheartedHe came to capture me I say Had I come to capture you I should have come with troops and horses said Guan YuAnd are there not troops and horses said Zhang Fei pointing to a point behind Guan YuGuan Yu turned and there he saw a cloud of dust rising as though a squadron of horse was comingAnd soon they were near enough and from their trumpets and banners they showed themselves to be of Cao Caos armyNow will you try to cajole me further cried Zhang Fei in a rageHe set his octaneserpent halberd and was just coming on when Guan Yu said Brother wait a while see me slay the leader of these that I may prove myself no traitor Well if you are really true prove it by slaying that leader whoever he may be before I have finished three rolls of the drum Zhang Feis condition was acceptedSoon the attacking force was near enough to make out the leader to be Cai YangSword in hand Cai Yang rode at full speed crying So I have found you slayer of my nephewI have a command to capture you and will execute it Guan Yu made no replyRaising his sword ready to strike he moved out and the drums began to beatBefore a roll could be completed the fight was over and Cai Yangs head had rolled on the groundHis force scattered and fledGuan Yu however captured the young ensign bearer and questioned him The youth said The fact is the Prime Minister had not given an orderIncensed at the loss of his nephew Cai Yang wished to cross the river to pursue and attack you General although the Prime Minister refused permissionTo satisfy him the Prime Minister had sent Cai Yang to attack Runan and the meeting at this place is entirely an accident Guan Yu bade him repeat this story to his brotherZhang Fei also questioned him concerning all that had happened in the capital and the recital of the whole story satisfied Zhang Fei of the fidelity of Guan YuJust then messengers came from the city to Zhang Fei to saySome scores of horsemen has arrived at the south gateThey seem in a great hurry but no one know them Zhang Fei with still a lingering doubt in his mind went to look at the newcomers and there saw some forty mounted archers with light bows and short arrowsHastily dismounting to see them better he found they were Mi Zhu and Mi FangQuickly slipping out of the saddle they came up and Mi Zhu said After the dispersal at Xuzhou when we lost sight of you we returned to our village whence we sent all around for news of youWe heard that Guan Yu had surrendered to Cao Cao and our lord was in the North of Yellow River with Yuan ShaoThe one of whom we could hear nothing was yourselfBut yesterday while on our way we fell in with some travelers who told us a certain General Zhang Fei of such and such an appearance had suddenly occupied Gucheng and we felt it must be youSo we came to inquire and we happily fell in with you here Zhang Fei replied Guan Yu and Sun Qian are here and my two sisters are with themThey had heard where my elder brother was This news added to the joy of the two newcomers who went to see Guan Yu and the women and then they all entered the city When the ladies had settled down a little they related the whole story of the adventures on the road at which Zhang Fei was overcome with remorse and bowed before his brother bitterly weeping Mi Zhu and Mi Fang were greatly affected Then Zhang Fei related what had happened to himA day was spent in banquets and next day Zhang Fei wished his newly found brother to go with him to Runan to see their elder brother Liu BeiBut Guan Yu said No you take care of the ladies here while Sun Qian and I go to get news So Guan Yu and Sun Qian with a small escort set out When they reached Runan they were received by Liu Pi Liu Bei is no longer in the cityAfter waiting some days he has come to the conclusion that the soldiers are too few and has gone back to Yuan Shao to consult with him said Liu PiGuan Yu was greatly disappointed and Sun Qian did his best to console him saying Do not be sorrowful it only means the trouble of another journey into the North of Yellow River to tell Uncle Liu Bei and then we can all meet at Gucheng So spoke Sun Qian and Guan Yu accepted itThey took leave of Liu Pi and returned to Gucheng where they related what had happenedZhang Fei wanted to go with them into the North of Yellow River but Guan Yu opposed this saying Seeing you have this city it makes a rallying point for us and a resting place We must not abandon it lightlySun Qian and I will go and while sway we look to you to keep the city safe How can you go after killing the two generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou That will not stop meAnd after I am there I can act according to circumstances Then Guan Yu summoned Zhou Cang and asked him saying How many followers are there with Pei Yuanshao at Sleeping Bull Mountain I should think four or five hundred Now said Guan Yu I am going to take the shortest road to find my brotherCan you go to summon your army and lead them along the high road to assist me With instructions to bring up this force Zhou Cang left while Guan Yu and Sun Qian and their small escort went off to the northWhen they drew near the boundary Sun Qian said You must be careful how you go over you ought to stop here while I go in see Uncle Liu Bei and take the necessary steps Seeing the wisdom of this Guan Yu stopped there and sent his companion in advance he and his followers going up to a nearby farm as an abiding placeWhen they got to the farm out came a venerable man leaning on a staffAfter exchanging salutes Guan Yu told the old man all about himselfMy family name is also Guan my personal name being Ding said the old manI know your reputation and I am very happy to meet you Guan Ding sent for his two sons to come and make their bowHe put up Guan Yu in his house and provided for his escort in the farm buildingsIn the meantime Sun Qian had made his way to Jizhou City and told Liu Bei the whole storyLiu Bei said Jian Yong also is hereWe will send for him secretly to talk over this matter They did so and when the usual salutes had been exchanged they three began to consider the means of getting awayMy lord said Jian Yong you see Yuan Shao personally and say you wish to go to Jingzhou to see Liu Biao about a scheme for the destruction of Cao CaoThat will give an excuse That seems best said Liu Bei but will you go with me I have another plan to extricate myself said Jian YongHaving settled their plans Liu Bei soon went in to see his protector and suggested Liu Biao is strong and well posted his help should be sought against our enemy I have sent messengers repeatedly to ask his help said Yuan Shao but he is unwilling As he and I are of the same family he will not refuse me if I go and ask him said Liu BeiCertainly he is worth much more than Liu Pi you shall go I have just heard Yuan Shao continued that Guan Yu has left Cao Cao and wants to come hereIf he does I will put him to death out of revenge for my two beloved generalsYan Liang and Wen Chou Illustrious Sir you wished to employ him and so I sent for himNow you threaten to put him to deathThe two men he slew were but deers compared with such a tiger as he is When you exchange a couple of deers for a tiger you need not complain of the bargain Really I like him said Yuan Shao I was only jokingYou can send another messenger for him and tell him to come soon May I send Sun Qian for him Certainly After Liu Bei had gone Jian Yong came in and said to Yuan Shao If Liu Bei goes he will not come back I would better go to speak to Liu BiaoAnd I can keep a watch on Liu Bei Yuan Shao agreed and issued orders for both to goOn the subject of the mission Guo Tu came in to his chief to dissuade himSaid Guo Tu Liu Bei went to speak to Liu Pi but he accomplished nothingNow you are sending Jian Yong with him and I am sure neither will ever return Do not be too suspicious said Yuan Shao Jian Yong is clever enough That was the end of the interviewForthwith Liu Bei sent Sun Qian back to Guan Yu and then with Jian Yong took leave of Yuan Shao and rode out of the city As soon as they reached the border line they met Sun Qian and all three rode off to Guan Dings farm to meet Guan YuHe came out to welcome them bowed and then seized his brothers hands while tears streamed down his facePresently the two sons of their host came to bow to the visitorsLiu Bei asked their namesThese are of the same name as myself said Guan YuThe sons are Guan Ning who is a student and Guan Ping who is to be a soldier I have been thinking of sending the younger in your train General said old Guan Ding Would you take him What is his age said Liu BeiHe is eighteen Liu Bei said Since O Senior you are so kind I venture to suggest that your son should be adopted by my brother who has no son of his ownWhat think you of that Guan Ding was perfectly willing so he called Guan Ping and bade him make a sons obeisance to Guan Yu and to style Liu Bei Uncle Then it was time to get on their way lest they should be pursued and with Guan Yu went Guan PingGuan Ding and Guan Ning escorted them a long distance and then returnedThe party took the road to Sleeping Bull MountainBefore they had gone very far they met Zhou Cang with a small party He was woundedHe was introduced to Liu Bei who asked him how it was He replied Before I reached the hill a certain warrior all alone had fought with my friend Pei Yuanshao and killed him Then many of our troops surrendered to him and he occupied our old campWhen I reached it I tried to allure the soldiers back to my side but only succeeded with a few The others were too afraidI got angry and engaged the interloper who however worsted me time after time and wounded me thrice Who is the warriorWhat does he look like asked Liu BeiAll I know he is a doughty fighter I do not know his name Thereafter they advanced toward the hill with Guan Yu in front and Liu Bei in rearWhen they drew near Zhou Cang began to abuse his enemy who soon appeared mailed and armed coming down the hill like a tornadoSuddenly Liu Bei rode out waving his whip and shouting O Zhao Yun I am here to look for you Indeed the rider was Zhao YunHe instantly slipped out of the saddle and bowed by the roadside Liu Bei dismounted to talk with him and ask how he came to be thereWhen I left you I had no idea that Gongsun Zan was a man who would listen to no reason The result was disaster and he perished in the flames Yuan Shao invited me to him several times but I thought too little of him to goThen I wanted to go to Xuzhou to you but you had lost that place and Guan Yu had gone over to Cao Cao and you had joined Yuan ShaoSeveral times I thought of coming to you but I feared Yuan ShaoSo I drifted from one place to another with nowhere to rest till I happened to come this way and Pei Yuanshao tried to steal my horse So I slew him and took possession of his campI heard Zhang Fei was in Gucheng but thought it might be only a rumorAnd so the days have passed till this happy meeting Liu Bei told Zhao Yun all that had happened to him since they parted and so did Guan YuSaid Liu Bei The first time I saw you I felt drawn to you and did not want to part from youI am very happy to meet you again In all my wanderings trying to find a lord worth serving I have seen no one like youNow I have reached your side that is enough for all my lifeI care not what may happen to me Next they burned the camp on Sleeping Bull Mountain after which they all took the road back to Gucheng where they were welcomedThey exchanged the stories of their several adventures and the two ladies related the valiant deeds of Guan Yu whereat Liu Bei was too affected to speakThen they performed a great sacrifice to Heaven and Earth with the slaughter of a bull and a horse The soldiers also were recompensed for their toils Liu Bei surveyed the conditions around him and found therein much to rejoice at His two brothers were restored to his side and none of his helpers were missing Moreover he had gained Zhao Yun and Guan Yu had acquired an adopted son Guan Ping Another commander had joined his ranks in the person of Zhou Cang There was every occasion for feasting and gratificationScattered wide were the brothers none knew anothers retreat Joyfully now they foregather dragon and tigers meetAt this time the forces under the command of Liu Bei Guan Yu Zhang Fei Zhao Yun Sun Qian Jian Yong Mi Zhu Mi Fang Guan Ping and Zhou Cang numbered four or five thousand soldiersLiu Bei was in favor of leaving Gucheng and occupying Runan and just then Liu Pi and Gong Du the commanders of that city sent to invite him to go there So they went There they devoted all their efforts to strengthen their army both horse and footYuan Shao was much annoyed when Liu Bei did not return and at first was for sending a force after himHowever Guo Tu dissuaded himLiu Bei needs cause you no anxiety Cao Cao is your one enemy and must be destroyedEven Liu Biao though strongly posted on the river is none too terribleThere is Sun Ce on the southeast of the Great River strong feared with wide domain of six territories a large army and able counselors and leaders you should make an alliance there against Cao Cao Guo Tu won his chief to his view and wrote to Sun Ce sending the letter by Chen Zhen Just as one warrior leaves the north Another from the east comes forthFuture chapters will reveal the outcome of these dispositions CHAPTER The Little Chief Of The South Slays Yu Ji The Green Eyed Boy Lays Hold On The South Sun Ce gradually became supreme on the southeast of the Great River In the fourth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  he took Lujiang by the defeat of the Governor Liu Xun He dispatched Yu Fan with a dispatch to Governor Hua Xin of Yuzhang and Hua Xin surrenderedThence Sun Ces renown increased and he boldly sent a memorial on his military successes to the Emperor by the hand of Zhang HongCao Cao saw in Sun Ce a powerful rival and said He is a lion difficult to contend with So Cao Cao betrothed his niece daughter of Cao Ren to Sun Kuang the youngest brother of Sun Ce thus connecting the two families by marriageCao Cao also retained Zhang Hong near him in the capitalThen Sun Ce sought the title of Grand Commander one of the highest offices of state but Cao Cao prevented the attainment of this ambition and Sun Ce keenly resented it Henceforward his thoughts turned toward an attack on Cao CaoAbout this time the Governor of Wujun Xu Gong sent a secret letter to the capital to Cao Cao sayingSun Ce is a turbulent fellow of the Xiang Yu type  and the government ought under the appearance of showing favor to him to recall him to the capital for he is a danger in the southern regions But the bearer of this letter was captured on the Great River and sent to Sun Ce who immediately put him to deathThen Sun Ce treacherously sent to ask the author of the letter to come and consult over some affair The unsuspecting Xu Gong cameSun Ce produced the letter saying So you wish to send me to the land of the dead eh And thereupon the executioners came in and strangled Xu GongThe family of the victim scattered but three of his clients determined to avenge him if only they could find some means of attacking Sun CeOne day Sun Ce went hunting in the hills to the west of Dantu A stag was started and Sun Ce pressed after it at topmost speed and followed it deep into the forestPresently he came upon three armed men standing among the treesRather surprised to see them there he reined in and asked who they wereWe belong to Han Dangs army and are shooting deer was the reply So Sun Ce shook his bridle to proceedBut just as he did so one of the men thrust at him with a spear and wounded his thighSun Ce drew the sword at his side dashed forward and tried to cut down the aggressor The blade of his sword suddenly fell to the ground only the hilt remaining in his handThen one of the assassins drew his bow and an arrow wounded Sun Ce in the cheekSun Ce plucked out the arrow and shot at the offender who fell but the other two attacked him furiously with their spears shouting We are Xu Gongs men and his avengers Sun Ce then understoodBut he had no weapons save his bow against themHe tried to draw off keeping them at bay striking with his bow but the fight was getting too much for him and both he and his steed were wounded in several placesHowever just at the critical moment Cheng Pu and some of his own officers came up and they minced the assassins into pieces But their lord was in a sorry plight His face was streaming with blood and some of the wounds were very severeThey tore up his robe and therewith bound up his wounds and they carried him homeA poem in praise of the three avengers says O Sun Ce was a warrior and a stranger he to fear But he was basely murdered while hunting of the deerYet were they leal who slew him to avenge a murdered lord Self immolated like Yu Rang they dreaded not the swordBadly wounded Sun Ce was borne to his homeThey sent to call the famous physician Hua Tuo but he was far away and could not be found However a disciple of his came and the wounded man was committed to his careThe arrowheads were poisoned said the physician and the poison has penetrated deepIt will take a hundred days of perfect repose before danger will be pastBut if you give way to passion or anger the wounds will not heal Sun Ces temperament was hasty and impatient and the prospect of such a slow recovery was very distastefulHowever he remained quiet for some twenty of the hundred days Then came Zhang Hong from the capital and Sun Ce insisted on seeing and questioning himCao Cao fears you my lord very greatly said Zhang Hong and his advisers have exceeding respect for you all except Guo Jia What did Guo Jia say asked the sick chieftain Zhang Hong remained silent which only irritated his master and caused him to demand to be toldSo Zhang Hong had to speak the truth He said The fact is Guo Jia told Cao Cao that he needed not fear you that you were frivolous and unready impulsive and shallow just a stupid swaggerer who would one day come to his death at the hands of some mean person This provoked the sick man beyond endurance The fool how dare he say this of me cried Sun Ce I will take Xuchang from Cao Cao I swear It was no more a question of repose Ill as he was he wanted to begin preparations for an expedition at once They remonstrated with him reminded him of the physicians orders and urged him to restYou are risking your priceless self in a moments anger said Zhang ZhaoThen arrived Chen Zhen the messenger from Yuan Shao and Sun Ce would have him brought inHe said My master wishes to ally himself with the South Land in an attack on Cao Cao Such a proposal was just after Sun Ces heartAt once he called a great meeting of his officers in the wall tower and prepared a banquet in honor of the messengerWhile this was in progress Sun Ce noticed many of his officers whispering to each other and they all began to go down from the banquet chamber He could not understand this and inquired of the attendants near him what it meantThey told him Saint Yu Ji has just gone by and the officers have gone down to pay their respects to him Sun Ce rose from his place and went and leaned over the railing to look at the manHe saw a Taoist priest in snowy garb leaning on his staff in the middle of the road while the crowd about him burnt incense and made obeisanceWhat wizard fellow is this Bring him here said Sun Ce This is Yu Ji said the attendantsHe lives in the east and goes to and fro distributing charms and draughtsHe has cured many people as everybody will tell you and they say he is a saintHe must not be profaned This only angered Sun Ce the more and he told them to arrest the man at once or disobey at their perilSo there being no help for it they went down into the road and hustled the saint up the stepsYou madman How dare you incite humans to evil said Sun Ce I am but a poor priest of the Langye MountainsMore than half a century ago when gathering simples in the woods I found near the Diamond Spring a book called The Way of Peace It contains a hundred and more chapters and taught me how to cure the diseases of humansWith this in my possession I had only one thing to do to devote myself to spreading its teachings and saving humankind I have never taken any thing from the people Can you say I incite people to evil deeds You say you take nothing whence came your clothes and your foodThe fact is you are one of the Yellow Scarves and you will work mischief if you are left alive Then turning to his attendants Sun Ce ordered Take him away and put him to death Zhang Zhao interceded The Taoist Saint has been here in the east these many yearsHe has never done any harm and does not deserve death or punishment I tell you I will kill these wizard fellows just as I would cattle The officials in a body interceded even the guest of honor Chen Zhen but in vain Sun Ce refused to be placatedHe ordered Yu Ji to be imprisonedThe banquet came to an end and Chen Zhen retired to his lodging Sun Ce also returned to his palaceHis treatment of the Taoist Holy Man was theme of general conversation and soon reached the ears of his motherLady Wu sent for her son to the ladies apartments and said to him They tell me you have put Saint Yu Ji in bondsHe has cured many sick people and the common folk hold him in great reverenceDo not harm him He is simply a wizard who upsets the multitude with his spells and craft He must be put to death replied Sun Ce Lady Wu entreated him to stay his hand but he was obstinateDo not heed the gossip of the streets Mother said heI must be judge of these matters However Sun Ce sent to the prison for Yu Ji in order to interrogate himNow the gaolers having a great respect for Yu Ji and faith in his powers were very indulgent to him and did not keep him in the collarHowever when Sun Ce sent for him he went with collar and fetters all completeSun Ce had heard of their indulgence and punished the gaolers and ordered the prisoner thereafter to be put in constant tortureZhang Zhao and many others moved by pity made a petition which they humbly presented and they offered to become surety for himSun Ce said to them Gentlemen you are all great scholars but why do you not understand reasonFormerly in Jiaozhou was Imperial Protector Zhang Jing who was deluded by these vicious doctrines into beating drums twanging lyres burning incense and such things He wore a red turban and represented himself as able to ensure victory to an army But he was slain by the enemyThere is nothing in all this only none of you will see itI am going to put this fellow to death in order to stop the spread of this pernicious doctrine Lu Fan interposed saying I know very well this Yu Ji can control the weatherIt is very dry just now why not make him pray for rain as an amercement We will see what sort of witchcraft he is equal to said Sun CeThereupon he had the prisoner brought in loosed his fetters and sent him up to an altar to intercede for rainThe docile Taoist Yu Ji prepared to do as he was bidden He first bathed himself then dressed himself in clean garments After that he bound his limbs with a cord and lay down in the fierce heat of the sunThe people came in crowds to look onSaid Yu Ji I will pray for three spans high of refreshing rain for the benefit of the people nevertheless I shall not escape death thereby The people said But if your prayer be efficacious our lord must believe in your powers The day of fate has come for me and there is no escape Presently Sun Ce came near the altar and announced that if rain had not fallen by noon he would burn the priestAnd to confirm this he bade them prepare the pyreAs it neared noon a strong wind sprang up and the clouds gathered from all quarters But there was no rainIt is near noon said Sun Ce Clouds are of no account without rainHe is only an impostor Sun Ce bade his attendants lay the priest on the pyre and pile wood around him and apply the torchFanned by the gale the flames rose rapidly Then appeared in the sky above a wreath of black vapor followed by roaring thunder and vivid lightning peal on peal and flash on flash And the rain fell in a perfect delugeIn a short time the streets became rivers and torrents It was indeed a threespan fallYu Ji who was still lying upon the pile of firewood cried in a loud voice O Clouds cease thy rain and let the glorious sun appear Thereupon officials and people helped the priest down loosened the cord that bound him and bowed before him in gratitude for the rainBut Sun Ce boiled with rage at seeing his officers and the people gathered in groups and kneeling in the water regardless of the damage to their clothing Rain or shine are as nature appoints them and the wizard has happened to hit upon a moment of change what are you making all this fuss about cried heThen he drew his sword and told the attendants to smite the Taoist Saint therewith They all besought him to hold his handYou want to follow Yu Ji in rebellion I suppose cried Sun CeThe officers now thoroughly cowed by the rage of their lord were silent and showed no opposition when the executioners seized the Taoist Saint and beheaded himAs the head fell they saw just a wreath of black smoke drift away to the northeast where lay the Langye MountainsThe corpse was exposed in the market place as a warning to enchanters and wizards and such peopleThat night there came a very violent storm and when it calmed down at daylight there was no trace of the body of Yu JiThe guards reported this and Sun Ce in his wrath sentenced them to deathBut as he did so he saw Yu Ji calmly walking toward him as if the Taoist Saint were still aliveSun Ce drew his sword and darted forward to strike at the wraith but he fainted and fell to the groundThey carried him to his chamber and in a short time he recovered consciousnessHis mother Lady Wu came to visit him and said My son you have done wrong to slay the holy one and this is your retribution Mother when I was a boy I went with Father to wars where people are cut down as one cuts reed stalks There is not much retribution about such doingsI have put this fellow to death and so checked a great evilWhere does retribution come in This comes of want of faith she repliedNow you must avert the evil by meritorious deeds My fate depends on Heaven wizards can do me no harm so why avert anything His mother saw that it was useless to try persuasion but she told his attendants to do some good deeds secretly whereby the evil should be turned asideThat night about the third watch as Sun Ce lay in his chamber he suddenly felt a chill breeze which seemed to extinguish the lamps for a moment although they soon brightened again and he saw in the lamp light the form of Yu Ji standing near his bedSun Ce said I am the sworn foe of witchcraft and I will purge the world of all such as deal in magicYou are a spirit and how dare you approach me Reaching down a sword that hung at the head of his bed he hurled it at the phantom which then disappearedWhen his mother heard this story her grief redoubledSun Ce ill as he was went to see his mother and did his utmost to reassure her She said Confucius the Teacher saysHow abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them and Prayer has been made to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds You must have faithYou sinned in putting Saint Yu Ji to death and retribution is sureI have already sent to have sacrifices performed at the JadePure Monastery and you should go in person to prayMay all come right Sun Ce could not withstand such a mandate from his mother so mustering all his strength he managed to get into a sedan chair and went to the monastery where the Taoists received him respectfully and begged him to light the incenseHe did so but he returned no thanks To the surprise of all the smoke from the brazier instead of floating upwards and dissipating collected in a mass that gradually shaped itself into an umbrella and there on the top sat Yu JiSun Ce simply spat abuse and went out of the temple As he passed the gates lo Yu Ji stood there gazing at him with angry eyesDo you see that wizard fellow said he to those about himThey said they saw nothingMore angry than ever he flung his sword at the figure by the gate The sword struck one of his escorts who fellSun Ce told them to bury the manBut as he went out of the courtyard he saw Yu Ji walking inThis temple is nothing more than a lurking place for sorcerers and wizards and such people said Sun CeWhereupon he took a seat in front of the building and sent for five hundred soldiers to pull the place downWhen they went up on the roof to strip off the tiles Sun Ce saw Yu Ji standing on the main beam flicking tiles to the groundMore angry than ever Sun Ce told them to drive out the priests belonging to the place and burn itThey did so and when the flames rose their highest Sun Ce saw the dead Taoist Yu Ji standing in the midst of the fireSun Ce returned home still in a bad humor which increased when he saw the form of Yu Ji standing at his gateHe would not enter but mustered his army and went into camp outside the city walls And there he summoned his officers to meet him and talk over joining Yuan Shao in an attack on Cao Cao They assembled but they remonstrated with him and begged him to consider his precious healthThat night he slept in the camp and again saw Yu Ji this time with his hair hanging looseSun Ce raged at the vision without cessationNext day his mother called him into the city and he went She was shocked at the change in his appearance he looked so utterly miserable Her tears fellMy son said Lady Wu how wasted you are He had a mirror brought and looked at himself he was indeed so gaunt and thin that he was almost frightened and exclaimed How do I come to look so haggard While he spoke Yu Ji appeared in the mirrorHe struck it and shrieked Then the half healed wounds reopened and he fainted He was raised and borne withinWhen he recovered consciousness he said This is the end I shall die He sent for Zhang Zhao and his other chief officers and his brother Sun Quan and they gathered in his chamber He gave them his dying charge saying In the disordered state of the empire the domains of Wu and Yue  with its strong defense of the three rivers and resourceful lands has a brilliant futureYou Zhang Zhao must assist my brother So saying Sun Ce handed his seal to Sun Quan saying For manipulating the might of Wu so as to make it the deciding force among the factions and then obtaining the whole empire you are not so suited as I but in encouraging the wise and confiding in the able and getting the best out of every one for the preservation of this land I should not succeed as you willRemember with what toil and labor your father and I have won what we possess and take good care thereof Sun Quan wept as he knelt to receive the seal and the dying Sun Ce turned to his mother saying Mother the days allotted of Heaven have run out and I can no longer serve my tender motherI have given over the seal to my brother and trust that you will advise him early and late and see that he lives worthy of his predecessors AlasYour brother is full young for such a task said his mother weeping I know not what may happen He is far abler than I and fully equal to the task of rulingShould he have doubts upon internal affairs he must turn to Zhang Zhao for outer matters he must consult Zhou YuIt is a pity Zhou Yu is absent so that I cannot give him my charge face to face To his brothers Sun Ce said When I am gone you must help your brotherShould any discord arise in the family let the others punish the wrongdoer and let not his ashes mingle with those of his ancestors in the family vaults The young men wept at these wordsThen he called for his wife Lady Qiao and said Unhappily we have to part while still in the full vigor of life You must care for my motherYour sister will come to see you presently and you can ask her to tell her husband Zhou Yu to help my brother in all things and make my brother keep to the way I have taught him to walk in Then Sun Ce closed his eyes and soon after passed awayHe was only twentysixPeople called him first of the chieftains The east had felt his might He watched like a tiger crouchingStruck as a hawk in flight There was peace in the lands he ruled His fame ran with the windBut he died and left to another The great scheme in his mindAs his brother breathed his last Sun Quan sank by the bed and weptThis is not the time to mourn said Zhang ZhaoFirst see to the funeral ceremonies and that the government is safe So the new ruler dried his tearsThe superintendence of the funeral was confided to Sun Jing and then Zhang Zhao led his young master to the hall to receive the felicitations of his officersSun Quan was endowed with a square jaw and a large mouth he had green eyes and a dark brown beardFormerly when Minister Liu Wan had gone to Wu to visit the Sun family he said of the family of brothers I have looked well at them all and they are all clever and perspicacious but none of them have the very ultimate degree of good fortune Only the second Sun Quan has the look of a deep thinkerHis face is remarkable and his build unusual and he has the look of one who will come to great honor When Sun Quan succeeded to his brother and his brothers might there was still some reorganization to be doneSoon Zhou Yu had arrived WujunThe young ruler received him very graciously and said I need have no anxiety now that you have come Zhou Yu had been sent to hold BaqiuWhen he heard that his chief had been wounded he thought it well to return to see how he wasBut Sun Ce had died before Zhou Yu could arriveHe hurried to be present at the funeralWhen Zhou Yu went to wail at the coffin of his late chief Lady Wu the dead mans mother came out to deliver her sons last injunctionsWhen she had told him the last charge Zhou Yu bowed to the earth saying I shall exert the puny powers I have in your service as long as I live Shortly after Sun Quan came in and after receiving Zhou Yus obeisance said I trust you will not forget my brothers charge to you Zhou Yu bowed saying I would willingly suffer any form of death for you How best can I maintain this great charge which I have inherited from my father and brother He who wins people prospers he who loses them failsYour present plan should be to seek humans of high aims and farseeing views and you can establish yourself firmly My brother bade me consult Zhang Zhao for internal administration and yourself on external matters said Sun Quan Zhang Zhao is wise and understanding and equal to such a taskI am devoid of talent and fear to take such responsibility but I venture to recommend to you as a helper one Lu Su a man of LinhuaiThis mans bosom hides strategy and his breast conceals tacticsHe lost his father in early life and has been a perfectly filial son to his motherHis family is rich and renowned for charity to the needyWhen I was stationed at Juchao I led some hundreds of soldiers across Linhuai We were short of grain Hearing that the Lu family had two granaries there each holding three thousand carts I went to ask for helpLu Su pointed to one granary and said Take that as a gift Such was his generosityHe has always been fond of fencing and horse archery He was living in QueHis grandmother died while he was there and he went to bury her in Dongcheng and then his friend Liu Ziyang wished to engage him to go to Chaohu and join Zheng Bao However he hesitated about that and has not gone yetYou should invite him without loss of time Sun Quan at once sent Zhou Yu to engage the services of this man and Zhou Yu set outWhen the obeisance was over Zhou Yu laid before Lu Su the inducements that his own master held outLu Su replied I have been engaged by Liu Ziyang to go to Chaohu and I am just starting thither Said Zhou Yu Of old Ma Yuan said to Liu Xiu This is an age when not only do princes select their ministers but ministers must also choose their princes Now our General Sun Quan calls to him the wise and treats his officers wellThus he engages the help of the wonderful and gets the services of the extraordinary in a way that few others doBut if you are not engaged elsewhere come with me to the South Land as the best thing to do Lu Su returned with Zhou Yu and saw Sun Quan who treated him with the greatest deference and with him discussed affairs very fullyThe conference proved so interesting that it went on all day and neither felt fatigueOne day at the close of the usual reception Sun Quan kept Lu Su to dine with him They sat up late and by and by slept on the same couch as would the closest of friendsIn the dead of night Sun Quan said to his bedfellow The dynasty is failing and everything is at sixes and sevensI have received a great charge from my father and brother and I am thinking of imitating the actions of the celebrated Protectors of Reign Wen and Huan and becoming the leader of the feudal lords and I pray you instruct me Lu Su replied Of old the Founder of Han the Supreme Ancestor wished to honor and serve Emperor Yi of Qin but could not on account of Xiang Yus evildoingsNow Cao Cao can be compared with Xiang Yu how can you be the protector of the EmperorMy humble opinion is that the Hans have fallen beyond hope of recovery and Cao Cao cannot be destroyed and that the only key to your big schemes is to secure your present position in order to keep the master hand and control the combinations among the othersNow take advantage of the turmoil in the north to smite Huang Zu and attack Liu Biao in JingzhouThereby you will command the whole length of the Great River Then you may consolidate the empire and become the Son of HeavenThis was how the Supreme Ancestor acted Hearing this Sun Quan was very greatly pleased He threw on some clothing got up and thanked his newlyfound adviserNext day Sun Quan gave Lu Su costly gifts and sent robes and silks to his motherLu Su then recommended a friend of his to Sun Quans notice a man of wide reading and great abilityHe was also a filial son His name was Zhuge Jin and he came from NanyangSun Quan treated Zhuge Jin as a superior guestThis man dissuaded Sun Quan from making common cause with Yuan Shao but advised him rather to favor Cao Cao against whom he could plan when occasion servedSun Quan therefore sent back the messenger Chen Zhen with dispatches that broke off all negotiationsHearing of Sun Ces death Cao Cao was for sending an expedition against the southBut Zhang Hong dissuaded him saying It would be mean to take advantage of the period of mourningAnd if you should not overcome him you will make him an enemy instead of being a friendIt would be preferable to treat him generously So Cao Cao memorialized the Throne and obtained for Sun Quan the title of General and Governor of Kuaiji while Zhang Hong was appointed Commander under Sun QuanAnd a seal of office was sent to Sun Quan by Zhang HongThe new appointment pleased Sun Quan and he was greatly glad to get Zhang Hong back again Then Zhang Hong was sent to act jointly with Zhang Zhao in the administration Zhang Hong was the means of getting another into Sun Quans serviceHis friend was Gu Yong a disciple of the Historian Cai YongGu Yong was a man of few words and an abstainer from wineHe was very correct in all things Sun Quan appointed Gu Yong Governor DeputyHenceforward Sun Quans rule was very prosperous and he waxed mightily in influence and won the love of all the peopleWhen Chen Zhen had returned and related the events in the South Land and told of the honors that Cao Cao had obtained for Sun Quan in return for his support Yuan Shao was very wroth and he set about preparing for an attack on Xuchang with a force of seven hundred thousand northern soldiersAlthough in the south they rest from war They rattle the spears beneath the northern starLater it will be seen which side conquered CHAPTER Shunning Advice Yuan Shao Loses Leaders and Granaries Using Strategy Cao Cao Scores Victory At GuanduHearing that Yuan Shao was hastening to attack at Guandu Xiahou Dun wrote to the capital urgently asking for reinforcements and Cao Cao told off seventy thousand troops with which he marched Xun Yu was left to guard the capitalJust as Yuan Shaos army was starting Tian Feng sent out a remonstrance from his prison cell saying My lord a hasty attack in full scale will bring disaster to our armyIt is best now to wait upon such times as Heaven should appoint Peng Ji said to Yuan Shao Why does this Tian Feng utter illomened wordsMy lord is sending forth an army in the cause of humanity and justice Easily moved to anger Yuan Shao was going to execute Tian Feng but this time he forbore at the entreaties of many of his officersHowever he was not appeased for he said I will punish Tian Feng when I return from conquering Cao Cao Meanwhile Yuan Shao hastened to startThe banners of his host filled the horizon their swords were as trees in the forestThey marched to Yangwu and there made a strong campThen Ju Shou once more opposed any hasty movement saying Though our soldiers are many they are not so bold as the enemy however veterans as are the enemy they have not ample suppliesTherefore they will wish to force on a speedy battle while our policy is to hold them off and delayIf we can keep from a decisive battle long enough the victory will be ours without fighting This advice did not appeal to Yuan ShaoSaid he threateningly Tian Feng spoke discouraging words to my armies and I will assuredly put him to death on my returnHow dare you follow in the same way Yuan Shao summoned the lictors and sent away the adviser in chains saying When I have overcome Cao Cao then will I deal with you and Tian Feng together  The huge army was camped in four divisions one toward each point of the compass The camps were thirty miles in circuitScouts and spies were sent out to discover the strong and the weak points of the enemyCao Caos army arrived and were smitten with fear when they heard of the strength of their enemyThe leader called together his councilThen said Adviser Xun You The enemy are many but not terribleOurs is an army of veterans every soldier of ours worth ten of theirs but our advantage lies in a speedy battle for unhappily our stores are insufficient for a long campaign You speak to the point said Cao CaoI think the same Therefore Cao Cao issued orders to press noisily forward and force on a battleYuan Shaos soldiers took up the challenge and the two sides were arrayedOn Yuan Shaos side Shen Pei placed ten thousand of crossbowmen in ambush on the two wings while five thousand of archers held the centerThe signal for general attack was a bomb and the onset was to continue through three rolls of the drum Yuan Shao wore a silver helmet and breastplate and an embroidered robe held in by a jeweled beltHe took up his post in the center with his commandersGao Lan Zhang He Han Meng Chunyu Qiong and others ranged right and leftHis banners and ensigns made a brave showWhen Cao Caos armys center opened and the banners moved aside the chieftain appeared on horseback with his staff of doughty leaders all fully armedXu Chu Zhang Liao Xu Huang Li Dian and othersPointing with his whip at Yuan Shao Cao Cao cried In the presence of the Emperor I pressed your claims to consideration and obtained for you the title of Regent Marshal why do you now plan rebellion Yuan Shao replied You take the title of a minister of Han but you are really a rebel against the HouseYour crimes and evil deeds reach to the heavens and you are worse than the usurper Wang Mang and the rebel Dong ZhuoWhat are these slanderous words about rebellion that dare you address to me I have a command to make you prisoner I have the Girdle Decree to arrest rebels replied Yuan ShaoThen Cao Cao became wrathful and bade Zhang Liao ride forth as his championFrom the other side rode Zhang He on a curvetting steedThe two champions fought four or five bouts with no advantage to eitherIn his heart Cao Cao thought the contest amazingThen Xu Chu whirled up his sword and went to help From the other side to match him rode out Gao Lan with his spear set and the contestants were now four battling two and twoThen Cao Cao ordered three thousand troops under Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong to attack the opponents arrayThereupon on Yuan Shaos side Shen Pei gave the signal for attack and the legion of crossbowmen on the wings shot and the center archers let fly all together The arrows flew all over the field in front and Cao Caos troops could not advanceThey hastened away toward the south Yuan Shao threw his soldiers on their rear and they were brokenThey fled away toward Guandu and Yuan Shao advanced another stageHe camped near them Then Shen Pei said Now send one hundred thousand soldiers to guard Guandu and get near Cao Caos camp then build up observation mounds to get a clear view of the enemy and choose vantage points whence to shoot arrows into the midst of their hostIf we can force him to evacuate this place we shall have gained a strategic point whence Capital Xuchang can be attacked Yuan Shao adopted this suggestionFrom each of the camps they sought out the strongest veterans who dug with iron spades and carried earth to raise mounds near Cao Caos camp Cao Caos soldiers saw what their enemies were doing and were anxious to make a sortie and drive them offBut the archers and crossbowmen came out commanding the narrow throat through which it was necessary to attack and stayed themAt the end of ten days they had build up more than half a hundred mounds and on the summit of each was a lofty tower whence the archers could command their opponents campCao Caos soldiers were greatly frightened and held up their bucklers to keep off the various missilesFrom the mounds the arrows flew down like a fierce rain after each roll of drumsThe soldiers of Yuan Shaos army laughed and jeered when they saw their enemies crouching under their shields and crawling on the ground to avoid their missilesCao Cao saw that his troops were getting out of hand under this attack so he called a councilLiu Ye spoke up saying Let us make catapults and so destroy them Cao Cao at once had models brought and set cunning workers to make these stonethrowing machinesThey soon constructed some hundreds and placed them along the walls of the camp inside just opposite the high ladders on the enemys mounds Then Cao Caos troops watched for Yuan Shaos archers to ascend the towersAs soon as the archers began to shoot all the catapults began to heave stone balls into the skies and they wrought great havocThere was no shelter from the falling stones and enormous numbers of the archers were killedYuan Shaos troops called these machines Rumblers and after their appearance the archers dared not ascend the mounds to shoot Then Shen Pei the strategist thought out another planHe set troops to tunnel under the walls into the midst of Cao Caos camp and called this corps The Sappers Cao Caos soldiers saw the enemy digging out pits behind the mounds and told the chief who at once sought a counter plan from Liu YeAs Yuan Shao can no longer attack openly he is attacking secretly and is tunneling a road under ground into the midst of our camp said Liu YeBut how to meet it We can surround the camp with a deep moat which renders their tunnel useless So a deep moat was dug as quickly as possible and when the enemy sappers arrived thereat lotheir labor had been in vain and the sap was uselessCao Cao held Guandu throughout the eighth and ninth months when his army being worn out and provisions failing he began to think of giving up and returning to the capitalAs he could not make up his mind he referred his difficulties by letter to Xun Yu whom he had left to guard Xuchang The reply he got was to this effectI have received your command to decide whether to continue the campaign or retireIt appears to me that Yuan Shao assembled such large forces at Guandu with the expectation of winning a decision You Sir are very weak while he is very strong and if you cannot get the better of him he will be able to work his will on you and this will be a crisis of the empireYour opponents are indeed numerous but their leader knows not how to use themWith your military genius and discernment where are you not sure to succeedNow though your numbers are small your situation is still brighter than Liu Bangs when he faced against Xiang Yu in Jungyang and ChenggaoYou are securely entrenched with your hands on Yuan Shaos throat and even if you cannot advance that state of things cannot endure forever but must changeThis is the time to play some unexpected move and you must not miss itThe device I leave to your illustrious ingenuity This letter greatly pleased Cao Cao and he urged upon his troops to use every effort to maintain the positionYuan Shao then retired some ten miles and Cao Cao sent out scouts to ascertain his new dispositionsOne of Xu Huangs officers Shi Huan captured an enemy spy and sent him to his chiefXu Huang interrogated him and found out that a convoy of supplies was expected and that this spy and others had been sent to find out what were the risks of the routeXu Huang went at once to tell Cao CaoWhen Xun You heard that the commander of the convoy was Han Meng he said That fellow is a valiant foolA few thousand light horse sent to intercept him can capture the whole train and cause much trouble in the enemys camp Whom should I send asked Cao CaoYou might send Xu Huang he is capable of such a task So Xu Huang was deputed and he took with him Shi Huan who had captured the spy and his company And this party was supported by Zhang Liao and Xu ChuIt was night when the commissariat train of many thousands of wagons drew near Yuan Shaos campAs they passed through a defile Xu Huang and Shi Huan came out and stopped the trainHan Meng galloped up to give battle but was soon overcomeThe guard was scattered and soon the whole train was in flames The escort and their leader fled awayThe glow of the flames seen from Yuan Shaos camp caused great consternation which became fear when the escaped soldiers rode in and told their tale Yuan Shao sent out Zhang He and Gao Lan to try to intercept the raiders and they came upon Xu Huang and his companyJust as Zhang He and Gao Lan were attacking reinforcements from Zhang Liao and Xu Chu came up and the Yuan Shaos troops were between two firesThey were cut to pieces and the successful generals of Cao Cao rode back to Guandu where they were richly rewardedAs an additional safeguard Cao Cao made a supporting outpost in front of the main camp to be the apex of a triangle of defenseWhen Han Meng returned with his woeful tidings Yuan Shao was angry and threatened to put him to deathHis colleagues begged him off Then said Shen Pei Food is very important for an army in the field and must be defended with the greatest diligenceWuchao is our main depot and must be carefully guarded My plans being complete said Yuan Shao you may as well return to Capital Yejun of Jizhou and undertake the control of the suppliesLet there be no shortage So Shen Pei left the army Then a force of twenty thousand troops was told off to defend the depot in WuchaoThe leaders of this body were Chunyu Qiong Gui Yuanjin Han Juzi Lu Weihuang and Zhao RuiOf these generals Chunyu Qiong was a hard man and a heavy drinker who in his cups was a terror to the soldiersUnder the idle life of guarding the supply depot the leaders gave themselves up to indulgence and drank heavilyIn Cao Caos army also food was getting scarce and a message was sent to Capital Xuchang to send grain quicklyThe messenger with the letter however had not gone far when he fell into the hands of Yuan Shaos guards who took him to the adviser Xu YouSeeing from the letter that Cao Cao was short of supplies Xu You went to Yuan Shao and told him saying Cao Cao and we have been at grips here for a long time and Capital Xuchang must be undefendedA small army sent quickly could take it and at the same moment an attack here would deliver Cao Cao into our handsNow is the moment to strike for his supplies are short Yuan Shao replied Cao Cao is full of ruses and this letter is artfully designed to bring about a battle to suit himself If you do not take this chance he will do you some injury by and by Just at this juncture in came a dispatch from Yejun in which after some details regarding the forwarding of grain Shen Pei said he had discovered that Xu You had been in the habit of receiving bribes while in Jizhou and had winked at his relatives collecting excess taxes One of his son and nephew were then in prisonAt this Yuan Shao turned on Xu You angrily and said How can you have the face to stand before me and propose plans you extortionate fellowYou and Cao Cao have old liking for each other and he has bribed you to do his dirty work for him and help his base schemes Now you want to betray my armyI ought to take off your head but temporarily I will let your neck carry it awayGet out and never let me see you again The discredited adviser sighed and went out saying Faithful words offend his ear He is a pest and unworthy of advice from meAnd now that Shen Pei has injured my son and nephew how can I look my fellow folks in the face again And Xu You drew his sword to end his life But his people prevented thatThey said If Yuan Shao rejects your honest words then assuredly he will be taken by Cao CaoYou are an old friend of Cao Caos why not abandon the shade for the sunlight Just these few words awakened Xu You to consciousness of his position and he decided to leave Yuan Shao and go over to Cao Cao for he was an old friend Vainly now for chances lost Yuan Shao sighs once he was greatHad he taken Xu Yous advice Cao Cao had not set up a stateXu You stealthily left the camp and set out for Cao Caos lines He was captured on the way He told his captorsI am an old friend of the Prime Minister go and tell the Prime Minister that Xu You of Nanyang wishes to see him They did soCao Cao was resting in his tent his clothing loose and comfortable after the toils of the day When he heard who wished to see him he arose quite joyfully and hastily ran out on bare feet to receive Xu You Cao Cao went forth to greet him They saw each other in the distance and Cao Cao clapped his hands with gladness bowing to the ground when near enough to his visitorXu You hastened to help him rise saying Sir you a great minister should not thus salute a simple civilian like me But you are my old friend and no name or office makes any difference to us replied Cao Cao Having been unable to choose the lord I would serve I bowed my head before Yuan Shao wishing to support him sincerelyBut he was deaf to my words and disregarded my plans Wherefore I have left him and come now to see my old friend from whom I hope employment If Xu You is willing to come then have I indeed a helper said Cao CaoI desire you to give me a scheme for the destruction of Yuan Shao I counseled him to send a light force to take Capital Xuchang and at the same time attack here in full scale so that head and tail be both attacked Cao Cao was alarmed saying If he does so I am lost How much grain have you in store said the new adviserEnough for a year I think not quite said Xu You smilingWell half a year The visitor shook out his sleeves rose and hurried toward the door of the tent saying I offer him good counsel and he repays me with deceitCould I have expected it Cao Cao held him back Do not be angry said he I will tell you the truth Really I have here only enough for three months Everybody says you are a marvel of wickedness and indeed it is true said Xu You But who does not know that in war there is no objection to deceit replied Cao CaoThen whispering in Xu Yous ear he said Actually here I have only supplies for this months use O do not throw dust in my eyes any more Your grain is exhausted and I know it Cao Cao was startled for he thought no one knew of the straits he was inHow did you find that out said Cao CaoXu You produced the captured letter saying Who wrote that Where did you get it Whereupon Xu You told Cao Cao the story of the captured messengerCao Cao seized him by the hand saying Since our old friendship has brought you to me I hope you have some plan to suggest to me Xu You said To oppose a great army with a small one is to walk in the way of destruction unless you inflict quick defeatI can propose a plan which will defeat the innumerable hordes of Yuan Shao without fighting a battleBut will you follow my advice I very much desire to know your plan said Cao Cao Your enemys stores of all kinds are at Wuchao where the commander of the guard is that drunkard Chunyu QiongYou can send some of your trusty veterans to pretend they belong to one of Yuan Shaos generals Jiang Qi sent to help guard the depot These soldiers can find an opportunity to fire the grain and stores of all kinds which will upset all Yuan Shaos calculations In three days Yuan Shao is no more Cao Cao greatly approvedHe treated Xu You very liberally and kept him in his campForthwith he chose five thousand of horse and foot ready for the expeditionZhang Liao protested saying The enterprise will be futile as the grain depot will certainly be well guardedWithout caution we may be victims of the treachery on the part of the newly arrived Xu You Xu You is no traitor said Cao CaoHe has come sent by Heaven to defeat Yuan ShaoIf we do not get grain it will be hard to hold out and I have either to follow his advice or sit still and be hemmed inIf he were a traitor he would hardly remain in my campMoreover this raid has been my desire for a long timeHave no doubts the raid will certainly succeed Well then you must look out for an attack here while the camp is undefended That is already well provided for said Cao Cao gleefully The arrangements for the raid on the grain depot were made with extreme care to ensure successCao Cao assigned Xun You Jia Xu and Cao Hong to guard the main camp together with Xu You Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan to guard the left camp Cao Ren and Li Dian to guard the right camp When all was ready they set out Cao Cao himself in the center with Zhang Liao and Xu Chu as van leaders and Xu Huang and Yu Jin as rear guard The army showed the ensigns of their opponents The troops carried bundles of grass and faggots to make a blaze The soldiers were gagged and the horses tied round the muzzles so as to prevent any noise They set out at duskThe night was fine and the stars shone brightlyJu Shou still a prisoner in Yuan Shaos camp saw the stars were very brilliant and told his gaolers to conduct him out to the central pavilion whence he could study themWhile watching he saw the planet Venus invade the quarter of the Bear and Lyra which startled him very greatly Some misfortune is near said Ju ShouSo although it was still night he went to see his masterBut Yuan Shao was sleeping after indulgence in too much wine and was in bad humor However when they had roused him saying that the prisoner had a secret message to deliver he got upWhile I happened to be studying the aspect of the heavens said the night visitor I saw Venus then between Hydra and Cancer suddenly shoot into the neighborhood of the Bear and LyraThere is danger of a robber raid and special precautions must be taken at the grain depotLose no time in sending good soldiers and vigorous leaders thither and keep a lookout on the byways among the hills that you may escape the wiles of Cao Cao You are a criminal said Yuan ShaoHow dare you come with such wild nonsense to upset my armies And turning to the gaolers Yuan Shao continued I bade you confine him why did you let him come Then he issued orders to put the gaolers to death and appointed others to keep the prisoner in close custodyJu Shou went away wiping his falling tears and sighing deeply Our soldiers destruction is at hand and I know not where our poor corpses may find a resting place Blunt truth offended Yuan Shao Too stupid any plan to make His stores destroyed this is evident That Jizhou also is at stake Cao Caos raiding party went along through the nightPassing one of Yuan Shaos outpost camps they were challengedCao Cao sent forward a man to say Jiang Qi has orders to go to Wuchao to guard the grain stores Seeing that the raiders marched under the ensigns of Yuan Shao the guard had no suspicions and let them passAt every post this ruse was effective and they got safely throughThey reached their objective at the end of the fourth watch the straw and wood were placed in position without loss of time and the blaze started Then Cao Caos commanders beat to attackAt this time Chunyu Qiong and his companions were all asleep after a heavy drinking boutHowever when the alarm was given they sprang up and asked what was the matterThe hubbub was indescribable Very soon the fuddled officers were caught with hooks and hauled out of their campYuan Shaos generals Gui Yuanjin and Zhao Rui were just returning from taking grain to the camp and seeing the flames arise they hastened to assistSome of Cao Caos soldiers ran to him saying The enemy is coming up in the rearSend reinforcements But Cao Cao only replied Press on to the front till the enemy is actually close at hand and then face about So the attack was pressed on and they all hastened forwardVery soon the fire gained strength and thick smoke hung all around filling the skyWhen Gui Yuanjin and Zhao Rui drew near Cao Cao turned about and attacked themThey could not stand this for a moment and both generals were killed Finally the stores of grain and forage were utterly destroyedThe commander Chunyu Qiong was made prisoner and taken to Cao Cao who ordered him to be deprived of ears nose and hands He was bound on a horse and sent thus horribly mutilated to his master From Yuan Shaos camp the flames of the burning depot were seen away in the north and they knew what they meant Yuan Shao hastily summoned his officers to a council to send a rescue partyZhang He offered to go with Gao Lan but Guo Tu said You may not go it is certain that Cao Cao is there in person wherefore his camp is undefendedLet loose our soldiers on the camp and that will speedily bring Cao Cao back againThis is how Sun Bin besieged Wei and thereby rescued Hao  But Zhang He said Not so Cao Cao is too wily not to have fully prepared against a chance attackIf we attack his camp and fail and Chunyu Qiong should be caught we shall all be captured too Guo Tu said Cao Cao will be too intent on the destruction of the grain to think of leaving a guardI entreat you to attack his camp So Yuan Shao sent five thousand soldiers under Zhang He and Gao Lan to attack Cao Caos camp and he sent ten thousand with Jiang Qi to go to recover the grain storeNow after overcoming Chunyu Qiong Cao Caos troops dressed themselves in the armor and clothing of the defeated soldiers and put out their emblems thus posing as defeated force running back to their own headquartersAnd when they happened upon Jiang Qis rescue body they said they had been beaten at Wuchao and were retreating So Cao Caos troops were suffered to pass without molestation while Jiang Qi hastened onBut soon Jiang Qi came to Zhang Liao and Xu Chu who cried out Stop And before Jiang Qi could make any opposition Zhang Liao had cut him downSoon his force were killed or dispersed and the victors sent false messengers to Yuan Shaos camp to say that Jiang Qi had attacked and driven away the attackers of the granaries So no more relief were sent that wayHowever Yuan Shao sent reinforcements to GuanduIn due course the Yuan Shaos force came down upon Cao Caos camp at Guandu and the defendersXiahou Dun Cao Ren and Cao Hongat once came out and fought them on three sides so that they were worstedBy the time reinforcements arrived Cao Caos army returning from the raid had also come and Yuan Shaos army were attacked in the rear So they were quite surroundedHowever Zhang He and Gao Lan managed to force their way out and got away When the remains of the defenders of the grain stores reached their masters camp they were musteredSeeing the mutilated state of their one time leader Yuan Shao asked how Chunyu Qiong had come to betray his trust and to suffer thus and the soldiers told their lord The General was intoxicated at the time of the attack So Yuan Shao ordered Chunyu Qiong to be forthwith executedGuo Tu fearing lest Zhang He and Gao Lan would return and testify the whole truth began to intrigue against them First Guo Tu went to his lord saying Those two Zhang He and Gao Lan were certainly very glad when your armies were defeated Why do you say this asked Yuan ShaoO they have long cherished a desire to go over to Cao Cao so when you sent them on the duty of destroying his camp they did not do their best and so brought about this disaster Yuan Shao accordingly sent to recall these two to be interrogated as to their faults But Guo Tu sent a messenger in advance to warn them as though in friendly guise of the adverse fate that awaited themSo when the orders reached them to return to answer for their faults Gao Lan asked For what reason are we recalled Indeed I do not know said the messengerGao Lan drew his sword and killed the messengerZhang He was astonished at this demonstration but Gao Lan said Our lord has allowed some one to malign us and say we have been bought by Cao CaoWhat is the sense in our sitting still and awaiting destructionRather let us surrender to Cao Cao in reality and save our lives I have been wanting to do this for some time replied Zhang HeWherefore both with their companies made their way to Cao Caos camp to surrenderWhen they arrived Xiahou Dun said to his master These two have come to surrender but I have doubts about them Cao Cao replied I will meet them generously and win them over even if they have treachery in their hearts The camp gates were opened to the two officers and they were invited to enterThey laid down their weapons removed their armor and bowed to the ground before Cao Cao who said If Yuan Shao had listened to you he would not have suffered defeatNow you two coming to surrender are like Wei Zi leaving the falling House of Shang to go to Yin and Han Xin leaving Xiang Yu to go over to the rising House of Han Cao Cao made then Generals and conferred upon Zhang He the title of Lord of Duting and upon Gao Lan Lord of Donglai which pleased them muchAnd so as Yuan Shao had formerly driven sway his adviser Xu You so now he had alienated two leaders and had lost his stores at Wuchao and his army was depressed and downheartedWhen Xu You advised Cao Cao to attack Yuan Shao as promptly as he could the two newly surrendered generals volunteered to lead the waySo Cao Cao sent Zhang He and Gao Lan to make a first attack on the camp and they left in the night with three thousand troopsThe fighting went on confusedly all night but stayed at dawn Yuan Shao had lost half of his armyThen Xun You suggested a plan to Cao Cao saying Now is the moment to spread a report that an army will go to take Suanzao and attack Yejun and another to take Liyang and intercept the enemys retreatYuan Shao when he hears of this will be alarmed and tell off his troops to meet this new turn of affairs and while he is making these new dispositions we can have him at great disadvantage Cao Cao adopted the suggestion and care was taken that the report spread far aroundIt came to the ears of Yuan Shaos soldiers and they repeated it in camp Yuan Shao believed it and ordered his son Yuan Tan with fifty thousand troops to rescue Yejun and General Xin Ming with another fifty thousand to go to Liyang and they marched away at onceCao Cao heard that these armies had started and at once dispatched troops in eight divisions to make a simultaneous attack on the nearly empty campYuan Shaos troops were too dispirited to fight and gave way on all sidesYuan Shao without waiting to don his armor went forth in simple dress with an ordinary cap upon his head and mounted his steedHis youngest son Yuan Shang followed himFour of the enemy generalsZhang Liao Xu Chu Xu Huang and Yu Jinwith their forces pressed in his rear and Yuan Shao hastened across the river abandoning all his documents and papers baggage treasure and stores Only eight hundred horsemen followed him over the streamCao Caos troops followed hard but could not come up with him however they captured all his impedimenta and they slew some eighty thousands of his army so that the watercourses ran blood and the drowned corpses could not be countedIt was a most complete victory for Cao Cao and he made over all the spoil to the armyAmong the papers of Yuan Shao was found a bundle of letters showing secret correspondence between him and many persons in the capital and army Cao Caos personal staff suggested that the names of those concerned should be abstracted and the persons arrested but their lord said Yuan Shao was so strong that even I could not be sure of safety how much less other people So Cao Cao ordered the papers to be burned and nothing more was saidNow when Yuan Shaos soldiers ran away Ju Shou being a prisoner could not get away and was capturedTaken before Cao Cao who knew him Ju Shou cried aloud I will not surrender Said Cao Cao Yuan Shao was foolish and neglected your advice why still cling to the path of delusionHad I had you to help me I should have been sure of the empire Ju Shou was well treated in the camp but he stole a horse and tried to get away to Yuan ShaoThis angered Cao Cao who recaptured him and put him to death which he met with brave composureI have slain a faithful and righteous man then said Cao Cao sadlyAnd the victim was honorably buried at GuanduHis tomb bore the inscription This is the tomb of Ju Shou the Loyal and Virtuous Ju Shou was honest and virtuous The best in Yuan Shaos train From him the stars no secrets held In tactics all was plainFor him no terrors had grim deathToo lofty was his spirit His captor slew him but his tomb Bears witness to his meritCao Cao now gave orders to attack JizhouIn feeling over confident thats where ones weakness lay The other bettered him by plans which never went astrayThe following chapter will tell who won the next campaign CHAPTER Cao Cao Overcomes Yuan Shao In Cangting Liu Bei Seeks Shelter With Liu Biao In Jingzhou Cao Cao lost no time in taking advantage of Yuan Shaos flight but smote hard at the retreating armyYuan Shao without helmet or proper dress and with few followers crossed hastily to the north bank at Liyang He was met by one of his generals Jiang Yiqu who took him in and comforted him and listened to the tale of misfortunesNext Jiang Yiqu called in the scattered remnants of the army and when the soldiers heard that their old lord was alive they swarmed to him like ants so that Yuan Shao quickly became strong enough to attempt the march to JizhouSoon the army set out and at night halted at Huang HillsThat evening sitting in his tent Yuan Shao seemed to hear a far off sound of lamentationHe crept out quietly to listen and found it was his own soldiers telling each other tales of woe This one lamented an elder brother lost that one grieved for his younger brother abandoned a third mourned a companion missing a fourth a relative cut off And each beat his breast and weptAnd all said Had he but listened to Tian Feng we had not met this disaster And Yuan Shao very remorseful said I did not hearken unto Tian Feng and now my soldiers have been beaten and I was nearly lostHow can I return and look him in the face Next day the march was resumed and Yuan Shao met Peng Ji with reinforcements to whom he said I disregarded Tian Fengs advice and have brought myself to defeatNow shall I be greatly ashamed to look him in the face This tribute to Tian Fengs prescience roused the jealousy of Peng Ji who replied Yes when he heard the news of your defeat though he was a prisoner he clapped his hands for joy and said Indeed just as I foretold How dare he laugh at me the blockhead Assuredly he shall die said Yuan ShaoWhereupon Yuan Shao wrote a letter and sent therewith a sword to slay the prisonerMeanwhile Tian Fengs gaoler came to him one day saying Above all humans I felicitate you What is the joyful occasion and why felicitate said Tian FengThe gaoler replied Imperial Protector Yuan Shao has been defeated and is on his way back he will treat you with redoubled respect Now am I a dead man said Tian FengWhy say you that Sir when all people give you joy The Imperial Protector appears liberal but he is jealous and forgetful of honest adviceHad he been victorious he might have pardoned me now that he has been defeated and put to shame I may not hope to live But the gaoler did not believe Tian FengBefore long came the letter and the sword with the fatal orderThe gaoler was dismayed but the victim said I knew all too well that I should have to die The gaoler weptTian Feng said An able person born into this world who does not recognize and serve the right lord is ignorantToday I die but I am not deserving of pity Whereupon he cut his throat in the prisonJu Shou but yesterday was killed Tian Feng ends his life his fate fulfilled The North of Yellow Rivers main beams break one by one Mourn ye that Yuan House Its day is doneThus died Tian Feng pitied of all who heard of his fateWhen Yuan Shao came home in Jizhou he was with troubled mind and distorted thoughtsHe could not attend to the business of government and became so ill that his second wife who came of the Liu family and had replaced the first wife after her death besought him to make his last dispositionsNow three sons had been born to Yuan Shao Yuan Tan the eldest who was commander at Qingzhou Yuan Xi who ruled over Youzhou and Yuan Shang borne to him by Lady Liu This youngest son was very handsome and noble looking and his fathers favorite So he was kept at home After the defeat at Guandu the lads mother was constantly urging that her son should be named as successor and Yuan Shao called together four of his counselors to consider this matter These four happened to be divided in their sympathiesShen Pei and Peng Ji being in favor of the youngest son and Xin Ping and Guo Tu supporters of the eldestWhen they met to consult Yuan Shao said As there is nought but war and trouble outside our borders it is necessary that tranquillity within be early provided for and I wish to appoint my successor My eldest son is hard and cruel my second is mild and unfitThe third has the outward form of a hero appreciates the wise and is courteous to his subordinatesI wish him to succeed but I wish that you tell me your opinions Guo Tu said Yuan Tan is your first born and he is in a position of authority beyond your controlIf you pass over the eldest in favor of the youngest you sow the seeds of turbulenceThe prestige of the army has been somewhat lowered and enemies are on our border Should you add to our weakness by making strife between father and son elder and younger brothersRather consider how the enemy may be repulsed and turn to the question of the heirship later Then the natural hesitation of Yuan Shao asserted itself and he could not make up his mindSoon came news that his sons Yuan Tan was coming from Qingzhou with sixty thousand troops Yuan Xi coming from Youzhou with fifty thousand troops and his nephew Gao Gan coming from Bingzhou with fifty thousand troops to help him and he turned his attention to preparations for fighting Cao CaoWhen Cao Cao drew up his victorious army on the banks of Yellow River the aged natives brought an offering of food and sauce to bid him welcomeTheir venerable and hoary appearances led Cao Cao to treat them with the highest respect and he invited them to be seated and said to them Venerable Sirs what may be your age We are nearly a hundred replied the old villagersI should be very sorry if my army had disturbed your village said Cao CaoOne of them said In the days of the Emperor Huan a yellow star was seen over by way of the ancient states of Chu and Song in the southwestYin Kui of Liaodong who was learned in astrology happened to be passing the night here and he told us that the star foretold the arrival in these parts fifty years hence of a true and honest man here in the Yellow RiverThat is exactly fifty years agoNow Yuan Shao is very hard on the people and they hate himYou Sir having raised this army in the cause of humanity and righteousness out of pity for the people and to punish crimes and having destroyed the hordes of Yuan Shao at Guandu just fulfill the prophecy of Yin Kui and the millions of the land may look now for tranquillity How dare I presume that I am he said Cao Cao with a smileWine was served and refreshments brought in and the old gentlemen was sent away with presents of silk stuffsAnd an order was issued to the army that if any one killed so much as a fowl or a dog belonging to the villagers he should be punished as for murderAnd the soldiers obeyed with fear and trembling while Cao Cao rejoiced in his heartIt was told Cao Cao that the total army from the four regions under the Yuan family amounted to two hundred thirty thousand soldiers and they were camped at CangtingCao Cao then advanced nearer them and made a strong campNext day the two armies were arrayed over against each otherOn one side Cao Cao rode to the front surrounded by his commanders and on the other appeared Yuan Shao supported by his three sons his nephew and his leadersCao Cao spoke first Yuan Shao your schemes are poor your strength is exhausted why still refuse to think of surrenderAre you waiting till the sword shall be upon your neckThen it will be too late Yuan Shao turned to those about him saying Who dares go out His son Yuan Shang was anxious to exhibit his prowess in the presence of his father so he flourished his pair of swords and rode forthCao Cao pointed him out to his officers and asked Any one knows him He is the youngest son of Yuan Shao was the replyBefore they had finished speaking from their own side rode out Shi Huan armed with a spearThe two champions fought a little while and suddenly Yuan Shang whipped up his horse made a feint and fledHis opponent followed Yuan Shang took his bow fitted an arrow turned in his saddle and shot at Shi Huan wounding him in the left eye He fell from the saddle and died on the spotYuan Shao seeing his son thus get the better of his opponent gave the signal for attack and the whole army thundered forward The onslaught was heavy but presently the gongs on both sides sounded the retire and the battle ceasedWhen he had returned to camp Cao Cao took counsel to find a plan to overcome Yuan ShaoThen Cheng Yu proposed the plan of the Ten Ambushes and persuaded Cao Cao to retire upon the river placing troops in ambush as he went Thus would Yuan Shao be inveigled into pursuit as far as the river when Cao Caos army would be forced to make a desperate stand or be driven into the water Cao Cao accepted this suggestion and told off ten companies of five thousand soldiers each to lie in ten ambush on two sides of the road of retreatThe arrangement of the ambushes were thuson the left first company under Xiahou Dun second company Zhang Liao third company Li Dian fourth company Yue Jin fifth company Xiahou Yuan on the right first company was under Cao Hong second company Zhang He third company Xu Huang fourth company Yu Jin fifth company Gao LanXu Chu commanded the advanced frontNext day the ten companies started first and placed themselves right and left as orderedIn the night Cao Cao ordered the advanced front to feign an attack on the camp which roused all the enemy in all their campsThis done Xu Chu retreated and Yuan Shaos army came in pursuitThe roar of battle went on without cessation and at dawn Cao Caos army rested on the river and could retreat no fartherThen Cao Cao shouted There is no road in front so all must fight or die The retreating army turned about and advanced vigorouslyXu Chu simply flew to the front smote and killed ten generals and threw Yuan Shaos army into confusion They tried to turn and march back but Cao Cao was close behindThen the drums of the enemy were heard and right and left there appeared two ambush companies of Gao Lan and Xiahou YuanYuan Shao collected about him his three sons and his nephew and they were enabled to cut an arterial alley out and fleeThree miles further on they fell into another ambush of Yue Jin and Yu Jin and here many troops of Yuan Shao were lost so that their corpses lay over the countryside and the blood filled the water coursesAnother three miles and they met the third pair of Li Dian and Xu Huang barring their road Here they lost heart and bolted for an old camp of their own that was near and bade their men prepare a mealBut just as the food was ready to eat down came Zhang Liao and Zhang He and burst into the campYuan Shao mounted and fled as far as Cangting when he was tired and his steed spent But there was no rest for Cao Cao came in close pursuit It seemed now a race for lifeBut presently Yuan Shao found his onward course again blocked by Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong and he groaned aloudIf we do not make most desperate efforts we are all captives said he And they plunged forwardHis second son Yuan Xi and his nephew Gao Gan were wounded by arrows and most of his soldiers were dead or had disappearedHe gathered his sons into his arms and wept bitterly Then he fell into a swoonHe was picked up but his mouth was full of blood which ran forth in a bright scarlet stream He sighed saying Many battles have I fought and little did I think to be driven to thisHeaven is afflicting meYou would better return each to his own and swear to fight this Cao Cao to the end Then Yuan Shao bade Xin Ping and Guo Tu as quickly as possible follow Yuan Tan to Qingzhou and prepare to give battle to Cao Cao lest he should invadeYuan Xi was told to go to Youzhou and Gao Gan to Bingzhou So each started to prepare armies and horses for repulsing Cao CaoYuan Shao with his youngest son Yuan Shang and the remnant of his officers went away to Jizhou and military operations were suspended for a timeMeanwhile Cao Cao was distributing rewards to his army for the late victory and his spies were scouting all about JizhouHe soon learned that Yuan Shao was ill and that the youngest son Yuan Shang and Shen Pei were in command of the city while his brothers and cousin had returned each to his ownCao Caos advisers were in favor of a speedy attackBut he objected saying Jizhou is large and well supplied Shen Pei is an able strategist and it behooves me to be carefulI would rather wait till the autumn when the crops have been gathered in so that the people will not suffer While the attack was being talked over there came letters from Xun YuLiu Bei was strengthening himself at Runan with the force of Liu Pi and Gong Du and when he heard that you was attacking Jizhou he said he would take the opportunity to march on the capital Wherefore you Sir should hasten homeward to defend Xuchang This news disconcerted Cao CaoHe left Cao Hong in command on the river bank with orders to maintain the appearance of strength there while he led the main part of his army to meet the threatened attack from RunanMeanwhile Liu Bei his brothers and the leaders having gone forth with the intention of attacking the capital had reached a point near the Rang Mountains when Cao Cao came upon themSo Liu Bei camped by the hills and divided his army into three sending Guan Yu and Zhang Fei with ten thousand troops each to entrench themselves southeast and southwest respectively of the main body which he and Zhao Yun commandedWhen Cao Cao came near Liu Bei beat his drums and went out to where Cao Cao had already arrayed his armyCao Cao called Liu Bei to a parley and when the latter appeared under his great standard Cao Cao pointed his whip at him and railed saying I treated you as a guest of the highest consideration why then do you turn your back on righteousness and forget kindness Liu Bei replied Under the name of Prime Minister you are really a rebelI am a direct descendant of the family and I have a secret decree from the Throne to take such offenders as you As he said these words he produced and recited the decree which is known as the Girdle Mandate Cao Cao grew very angry and ordered Xu Chu to go out to battle and as Liu Beis champion out rode Zhao Yun with spear ready to thrustThe two warriors exchanged thirty bouts without advantage to eitherThen there arose an earthrending shout and up came the two brothers Guan Yu from the southeast and Zhang Fei from the southwestThe three armies then began a great attack which proved too much for Cao Caos troops fatigued by a long march and they were worsted and fledLiu Bei having scored this victory returned to campNext day he sent out Zhao Yun again to challenge the enemy but it was not accepted and Cao Caos army remained ten days without movement Then Zhang Fei offered a challenge which also was not acceptedAnd Liu Bei began to feel anxiousThen unexpectedly came news that the enemy had stopped a train of supplies brought by Gong Du and at once Zhang Fei went to the rescueWorse still was the news that followed that an army led by Xiahou Dun had got in behind to attack Runan Quite dismayed Liu Bei said If this be true I have enemies in front and rear and have no place to go He then sent Guan Yu to try to recover the city and thus both his brothers were absent from his sideOne day later a horseman rode up to say that Runan had fallen its defender Liu Pi had fled and Guan Yu was surroundedTo make the matters worse the news came that Zhang Fei who had gone to rescue Gong Du was in like caseLiu Bei tried to withdraw his troops fearing all the time an attack from Cao Cao Suddenly the sentinels came in sayingXu Chu is at the camp gate offering a challenge Liu Bei did not allow his army to go out They waited till dawn and then Liu Bei bade the soldiers get a good meal and be ready to startWhen ready the foot went out first the horsemen next leaving a few troops in the camp to beat the watches and maintain an appearance of occupationAfter traveling a some miles they passed some mounds Suddenly torches blazed out and on the summit stood one who shouted Do not let Liu Bei run away I the Prime Minister am here awaiting you Liu Bei dashed along the first clear road he sawZhao Yun said Fear not my lord only follow me And setting his spear Zhao Yun galloped in front opening an arterial alley as he went Liu Bei gripped his double swords and followed closeAs they were winning through Xu Chu came in pursuit and engaged Zhao Yun and two other companies led by Yu Jin and Li Dian bore down as wellSeeing the situation so desperate Liu Bei plunged into the wilds and fledGradually the sounds of battle became fainter and died away while he went deeper and deeper into the hills a single horseman fleeing for his lifeHe kept on his way till daybreak when a company suddenly appeared beside the roadLiu Bei saw these men with terror at first but was presently relieved to find they were led by the friendly Liu Pi They were a company of his defeated army escorting the family of their chief With them also were Sun Qian Jian Yong and Mi Fang They told him The attack on us was too strong to be resisted and so we were compelled to abandon the defense and the enemy followed and only Guan Yus timely arrival saved us from destruction I do not know where my brother is said Liu Bei All will come right if you will push on said Liu PiThey pushed onBefore they had gone far the beating of drums was heard and suddenly appeared Zhang He with a thousand soldiersHe cried Liu Bei quickly dismount and surrender Liu Bei was about to retire when he saw a red flag waving from a rampart on the hills and down came rushing another body of troops under Gao LanThus checked in front and his retreat cut off Liu Bei looked up to Heaven and cried O Heaven why am I brought to this state of miseryNothing is left me now but death And he drew his sword to slay himselfBut Liu Pi stayed his hand saying Let me try to fight a way out and save you Death is nothing to me As he spoke Gao Lans force was on the point of engaging hisThe two leaders met and in the third bout Liu Pi was cut downLiu Bei at once rushed up to fight but just then there was sudden confusion in the rear ranks of the opponents and a warrior dashed up and thrust at Gao Lan with his spear Gao Lan fell from his steedThe newcomer was Zhao YunHis arrival was most opportuneHe urged forward his steed thrusting right and left and the enemys ranks broke and scatteredThen the first force under Zhang He came into the fight and the leader and Zhao Yun fought thirty or more bouts However this proved enough for Zhang He turned his horse away recognizing that he was worstedZhao Yun vigorously attacked but was forced into a narrow space in the hills where he was hemmed inWhile seeking for some outlet they saw Guan Yu Guan Ping and Zhou Cang with three hundred men coming alongSoon Zhang He was driven off and then Liu Beis troops came out of the narrow defile and occupied a strong position among the hills where they made a camp Liu Bei sent Guan Yu for news of the missing brotherZhang Fei had been attacked by Xiahou Yuan who had killed Gong Du but had vigorously resisted beaten him off and followed him up Then Yue Jin had come along and surrounded Zhang FeiIn this pass he was found by Guan Yu who had heard of his plight from some of his scattered soldiers met on the way Now they drove off the enemy The two brothers returned Soon they heard of the approach of a large body of Cao Caos armyLiu Bei then bade Sun Qian guard his family and sent him on ahead while he and the others kept off the enemy sometimes giving battle and anon marchingSeeing that Liu Bei had retired too far Cao Cao let him go and left the pursuitWhen Liu Bei collected his army he found they numbered only a thousand and this halting and broken force marched as fast as possible to the westComing to a river they asked the natives its name and were told it was the Han River and near it Liu Bei made a temporary campWhen the local people found out who was in the camp they presented flesh and wine A feast was given upon a sandy bank of the Han RiverAfter they had drunk awhile Liu Bei addressed his faithful followers saying All you Fair Sirs have talents fitting you to be advisers to a monarch but your destiny has led you to follow poor meMy fate is distressful and full of misery Today I have not a spot to call my own and I am indeed leading you astrayTherefore I say you should abandon me and go to some illustrious lord where you may be able to become famous At these words they all covered their faces and weptGuan Yu said Brother you are wrong to speak thusWhen the great Founder of Han contended with Xiang Yu he was defeated many times but he won at the NineMile Mountains and that achievement was the foundation of a dynasty that endured for four centuriesVictory and defeat are but ordinary events in a soldiers career and why should you give up Success and failure both have their seasons said Sun Qian and we are not to grieveJingzhou which your illustrious relative Liu Biao commands is a rich and prosperous country Liu Biao is of your house why not go to him Only that I fear he may not receive me said Liu Bei Then let me go and prepare the wayI will make Liu Biao come out to his borders to welcome you So with his lords approval Sun Qian set off immediately and hastened to JingzhouWhen the ceremonies of greeting were over Liu Biao asked the reason of the visitSaid Sun Qian The princely Liu Bei is one of the heroes of the day although just at the moment he may lack soldiers and leadersHis mind is set upon restoring the dynasty to its pristine glory and at Runan the two commanders Liu Pi and Gong Du though bound to him by no ties were content to die for the sake of his idealsYou Illustrious Sir like Liu Bei are a scion of the imperial stockNow the Princely One has recently suffered defeat and thinks of seeking a home in the east with Sun Quan I have ventured to dissuade him saying that he should not turn from a relative and go to a mere acquaintance telling him that you Sir are well known as courteous to the wise and condescending to scholars so that they flock to you as the waters flow to the east sea and that certainly you would show kindness to one of the same ancestryWherefore he has sent me to explain matters and request your commands He is my brother said Liu Biao and I have long desired to see him but no opportunity has occurred I should be very happy if he would come Cai Mao who was sitting by here broke in No noLiu Bei first followed Lu Bu then he served Cao Cao and next he joined himself to Yuan Shao And he stayed with none of these so that you can see what manner of man he isIf he comes here Cao Cao will assuredly come against us and fightBetter cut off this messengers head and send it as an offering to Cao Cao who would reward you well for the service Sun Qian sat unmoved while this harangue was pronounced saying at the end I am not afraid of deathLiu Bei the Princely One is true and loyal to the state and so out of sympathy with Lu Bu or Cao Cao or Yuan ShaoIt is true he followed these three but there was no help for it Now he knows your chief is a member of the family so that both are of the same ancestry and that is why he has come far to join himHow can you slander a good man like that Liu Biao bade Cai Mao be silent and said I have decided and you need say no more Whereat Cai Mao sulkily left the audience chamberThen Sun Qian was told to return with the news that Liu Bei would be welcome and Imperial Protector Liu Biao went ten miles beyond the city to meet his guestWhen Liu Bei arrived he behaved to his host with the utmost politeness and was warmly welcomed in returnThen Liu Bei introduced his two sworn brothers and friends and they entered Jingzhou City where Liu Bei finally was lodged in the Imperial Protectors own residenceAs soon as Cao Cao knew whither his enemy had gone he wished to attack Liu Biao but Cheng Yu advised against any attempt so long as Yuan Shao the dangerous enemy was left with power to inflict damageHe said My lord should return to the capital to refresh the soldiers so that they may be ready for a north and south campaign in the mild spring weather Cao Cao accepted his advice and set out for the capitalIn the first month of the eighth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  Cao Cao once again began to think of war and sent to garrison Runan as a precaution against Liu BiaoThen after arranging for the safety of the capital he marched a large army to Guandu the camp of the year before and aimed at JizhouAs to Yuan Shao who had been suffering from bloodspitting but was now in better health he began to think of measures against Xuchang but Shen Pei dissuaded him saying You are not yet recovered from the fatigues of last yearIt would be better to make your position impregnable and set to improving the army When the news of Cao Caos approach arrived Yuan Shao said If we allow the foe to get close to the city before we march to the river we shall have missed our opportunity I must go out to repel this army Here his son Yuan Shang interposed Father you are not sufficiently recovered for a campaign and should not go so farLet me lead the army against this enemy Yuan Shao consented and he sent to Qingzhou and Youzhou and Bingzhou to call upon his other two sons and his nephew to attack Cao Cao at the same time as his own armyAgainst Runan they beat the drum And from Jizhou the armies comeTo whom the victory will be seen in the next chapter CHAPTER  Jizhou Taken Yuan Shang Strives River Zhang Cut Xun You SchemesYuan Shang was puffed up with pride after his victory over Shi Huan and without deigning to wait the arrival of his brothers he marched out with thirty thousand troops to Liyang to meet the army of Cao CaoZhang Liao came out to challenge him and Yuan Shang accepting the challenge rode out with spear set But he only lasted to the third bout when he had to give wayZhang Liao smote with full force and Yuan Shang quite broken fled pellmell to JizhouHis defeat was a heavy shock to his father Yuan Shao who had a severe fit of hemorrhage at the news and swoonedLady Liu his wife got him to bed as quickly as possible but he did not rally and she soon saw it was necessary to prepare for the end So she sent for Shen Pei and Peng Ji that the succession might be settledThey came and stood by the sick mans bed but by this time he could no longer speak he only made motions with his hands When his wife put the formal question Is Yuan Shang to succeed Yuan Shao nodded his headShen Pei at the bedside wrote out the dying mans testamentPresently Yuan Shao uttered a loud moan a fresh fit of bleeding followed and he passed awayBorn of a line of nobles famous for generations He himself in his youth was wayward always and headstrong Vainly he called to his side generals skilled and courageous Gathered beneath his banner countless legions of soldiers For he was timid at heart a lamb dressed as a tiger Merely a cowardly chicken phoenixfeathered but spurlessPitiful was the fate of his house for when he departed Brother with brother strove and quarrels arose in the householdShen Pei and some others set about the mourning ceremonies for the dead manHis wife Lady Liu put to death five of his favorite concubines and such was the bitterness of her jealousy that not content with this she shaved off the hair and slashed the faces of their poor corpses lest their spirits should meet and rejoin her late husband in the land of shades beneath the Nine Golden SpringsHer son followed up this piece of cruelty by slaying all the relatives of the unhappy concubines lest they should avenge their deathShen Pei and Peng Ji declared Yuan Shang successor with the titles of Regent Marshal and Supreme Imperial Protector of the four regions of Jizhou Qingzhou Youzhou and Bingzhou and sent in a report of the death of the late Imperial ProtectorAt this time Yuan Tan the eldest son had already marched out his army to oppose Cao Cao but hearing of his fathers death he called in Guo Tu and Xin Ping to consult as to his course of actionIn your absence my lord said Guo Tu the two advisers of your younger brother will certainly set him up as lord wherefore you must act quickly Those two Shen Pei and Peng Ji have already laid their plans said Xin PingIf you go you will meet with some misfortune Then what should I do asked Yuan TanGuo Tu replied Go and camp near the city and watch what is taking place while I enter and inquire Accordingly Guo Tu entered the city and sought an interview with the young Imperial ProtectorWhy did not my brother come asked Yuan Shang after the usual salutesGuo Tu said He cannot come as he is in the camp unwell By the command of my late father I take the lordshipNow I confer upon my brother the rank of General of the Flying Cavalry and I wish him to go at once to attack Cao Cao who is pressing on the borders I will follow as soon as my army is in order There is no one in our camp to give advice said Guo TuI wish to have the services of Shen Pei and Peng Ji I also need the help of these two said Yuan ShangAnd as I am always working at schemes I do not see how I can do without them Then let one of these two go replied Guo TuYuan Shang could do no other than accede to this request so he bade the two men cast lots who should goPeng Ji drew the lot and was appointed receiving a seal of office Then he accompanied Guo Tu to the campBut when he arrived and found Yuan Tan in perfect health he grew suspicious and resignedYuan Tan angrily refused to accept his resignation and was disposed to put him to death but Guo Tu privately dissuaded him saying Cao Cao is on the borders and Peng Ji must be kept here to allay your brothers suspicionsAfter we have beaten Cao Cao we can at once make an attempt on Jizhou Yuan Tan agreed and forthwith broke up his camp to march against the enemyHe reached Liyang and lost no time in offering battleHe chose for his champion Wang Zhao and when he rode out Cao Cao sent Xu Huang to meet himThese two had fought but a few bouts when Wang Zhao was slainAt once Cao Caos army pressed forward and Yuan Tan suffered a severe defeatYuan Tan drew off his army and retired into Liyang whence he sent to his brother for reinforcementsYuan Shang and his adviser Shen Pei discussed the matter and only five thousand troops were sentCao Cao hearing of the dispatch of this meager force sent Li Dian and Yue Jin to waylay them and the half legion was destroyedWhen Yuan Tan heard of the inadequate force sent and their destruction he was very wrath and roundly abused Peng JiPeng Ji replied Let me write to my lord and pray him to come himself So Peng Ji wrote and the letter was sent When it arrived Yuan Shang again consulted Shen Pei who said Guo Tu your elder brothers adviser is very guilefulCHAPTER Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood In The Peach Garden One Victory Shatters The Rebels In BattlegroundsDomains under heaven after a long period of division tends to unite after a long period of union tends to divide This has been so since antiquityWhen the rule of the Zhou Dynasty weakened seven contending kingdoms sprang up warring one with another until the kingdom of Qin prevailed and possessed the empireBut when Qins destiny had been fulfilled arose two opposing kingdoms Chu and Han to fight for the mastery And Han was the victorThe rise of the fortunes of Han began when Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor slew a white serpent to raise the banners of uprising which only ended when the whole empire belonged to Han  This magnificent heritage was handed down in successive Han emperors for two hundred years till the rebellion of Wang Mang caused a disruption But soon Liu Xiu the Latter Han Founder restored the empire and Han emperors continued their rule for another two hundred years till the days of Emperor Xian which were doomed to see the beginning of the empires division into three parts known to history as The Three KingdomsBut the descent into misrule hastened in the reigns of the two predecessors of Emperor XianEmperors Huan and Lingwho sat in the Dragon Throne about the middle of the second centuryEmperor Huan paid no heed to the good people of his court but gave his confidence to the Palace eunuchsHe lived and died leaving the scepter to Emperor Ling whose advisers were Regent Marshal Dou Wu and Imperial Guardian Chen FanDou Wu and Chen Fan disgusted with the abuses of the eunuchs in the affairs of the state plotted the destruction for the powerabusing eunuchs But Chief Eunuch Cao Jie was not to be disposed of easily The plot leaked out and the honest Dou Wu and Chen Fan were put to death leaving the eunuchs stronger than beforeIt fell upon the day of full moon of the fourth month the second year in the era of Established Calm  that Emperor Ling went in state to the Hall of VirtueAs he drew near the throne a rushing whirlwind arose in the corner of the hall and lofrom the roof beams floated down a monstrous black serpent that coiled itself up on the very seat of majestyThe Emperor fell in a swoon Those nearest him hastily raised and bore him to his palace while the courtiers scattered and fledThe serpent disappearedBut there followed a terrific tempest thunder hail and torrents of rain lasting till midnight and working havoc on all sidesTwo years later the earth quaked in Capital Luoyang while along the coast a huge tidal wave rushed in which in its recoil swept away all the dwellers by the sea Another evil omen was recorded ten years later when the reign title was changed to Radiant Harmony certain hens suddenly crowedAt the new moon of the sixth month a long wreath of murky cloud wound its way into the Hall of Virtue while in the following month a rainbow was seen in the Dragon ChamberAway from the capital a part of the Five Mountains collapsed leaving a mighty rift in the flankSuch were some of various omensEmperor Ling greatly moved by these signs of the displeasure of Heaven issued an edict asking his ministers for an explanation of the calamities and marvels A court counselor Cai Yong replied bluntlyFalling rainbows and changes of fowls sexes are brought about by the interference of empresses and eunuchs in state affairs The Emperor read this memorial with deep sighs and Chief Eunuch Cao Jie from his place behind the throne anxiously noted these signs of griefAn opportunity offering Cao Jie informed his fellows and a charge was trumped up against Cai Yong who was driven from the court and forced to retire to his country house With this victory the eunuchs grew bolderTen of them rivals in wickedness and associates in evil deeds formed a powerful party known as the Ten Regular AttendantsZhang Rang Zhao Zhong Cheng Kuang Duan Gui Feng Xu Guo Sheng Hou Lan Jian Shuo Cao Jie and Xia Yun One of them Zhang Rang won such influence that he became the Emperors most honored and trusted adviserThe Emperor even called him Foster Father So the corrupt state administration went quickly from bad to worse till the country was ripe for rebellion and buzzed with brigandageAt this time in the county of Julu was a certain Zhang family of whom three brothers bore the name of Zhang Jue Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang respectively The eldest Zhang Jue was an unclassed graduate who devoted himself to medicineOne day while culling simples in the woods Zhang Jue met a venerable old gentleman with very bright emerald eyes and fresh complexion who walked with an oakwood staff The old man beckoned Zhang Jue into a cave and there gave him three volumes of the Book of Heaven This book said the old gentleman is the Way of Peace With the aid of these volumes you can convert the world and rescue humankindBut you must be singleminded or rest assured you will greatly suffer With a humble obeisance Zhang Jue took the book and asked the name of his benefactorI am Saint Hermit of the Southern Land was the reply as the old gentleman disappeared in thin airZhang Jue studied the wonderful book eagerly and strove day and night to reduce its precepts to practice Before long he could summon the winds and command the rain and he became known as the Mystic of the Way of PeaceIn the first month of the first year of Central Stability  there was a terrible pestilence that ran throughout the land whereupon Zhang Jue distributed charmed remedies to the afflicted The godly medicines brought big successes and soon he gained the tittle of the Wise and Worthy MasterHe began to have a following of disciples whom he initiated into the mysteries and sent abroad throughout all the land They like their master could write charms and recite formulas and their fame increased his followingZhang Jue began to organize his disciples He established thirtysix circuits the larger with ten thousand or more members the smaller with about half that number Each circuit had its chief who took the military title of GeneralThey talked wildly of the death of the blue heaven and the setting up of the golden one they said a new cycle was beginning and would bring universal good fortune to all members and they persuaded people to chalk the symbols for the first year of the new cycle on the main door of their dwellings With the growth of the number of his supporters grew also the ambition of Zhang Jue The Wise and Worthy Master dreamed of empireOne of his partisans Ma Yuanyi was sent bearing gifts to gain the support of the eunuchs within the PalaceTo his brothers Zhang Jue said For schemes like ours always the most difficult part is to gain the popular favor But that is already oursSuch an opportunity must not pass And they began to prepareMany yellow flags and banners were made and a day was chosen for the uprisingThen Zhang Jue wrote letters to Eunuch Feng Xu and sent them by one of his followers Tang Zhou who alas betrayed his trust and reported the plot to the courtThe Emperor summoned the trusty Regent Marshal He Jin and bade him look to the issue Ma Yuanyi was at once taken and beheadedFeng Xu and many others were cast into prison The plot having thus become known the Zhang brothers were forced at once to take the field They took up grandiose titlesZhang Jue the Lord of Heaven Zhang Bao the Lord of Earth and Zhang Liang the Lord of Human And in these names they put forth this manifestoThe good fortune of the Han is exhausted and the Wise and Worthy Man has appearedDiscern the will of Heaven O ye people and walk in the way of righteousness whereby alone ye may attain to peace Support was not lackingOn every side people bound their heads with yellow scarves and joined the army of the rebel Zhang Jue so that soon his strength was nearly half a million strong and the official troops melted away at a whisper of his comingRegent Marshal and Guardian of the Throne He Jin memorialized for general preparations against the Yellow Scarves and an edict called upon every one to fight against the rebelsIn the meantime three Imperial CommandersLu Zhi Huangfu Song and Zhu Junmarched against them in three directions with veteran soldiers Meanwhile Zhang Jue led his army into Youzhou the northeastern region of the empireThe Imperial Protector of Youzhou was Liu Yan a scion of the Imperial HouseLearning of the approach of the rebels Liu Yan called in Commander Zhou Jing to consult over the position Zhou Jing said They are many and we fewWe must enlist more troops to oppose them Liu Yan agreed and he put out notices calling for volunteers to serve against the rebelsOne of these notices was posted up in the county of Zhuo where lived one man of high spiritThis man was no mere bookish scholar nor found he any pleasure in studyBut he was liberal and amiable albeit a man of few words hiding all feeling under a calm exteriorHe had always cherished a yearning for high enterprise and had cultivated the friendship of humans of markHe was tall of stature His ears were long the lobes touching his shoulders and his hands hung down below his knees His eyes were very big and prominent so that he could see backward past his ears His complexion was as clear as jade and he had rich red lipsHe was a descendant of Prince Faubus of Zhongshan whose father was the Emperor Myers the occupant of the Dragon Throne a century and a half BC His name was Liu Bei Many years before one of his forbears had been the governor of that very county but had lost his rank for remissness in ceremonial offerings However that branch of the family had remained on in the place gradually becoming poorer and poorer as the years rolled onHis father Liu Hong had been a scholar and a virtuous official but died youngThe widow and orphan were left alone and Liu Bei as a lad won a reputation for filial pietyAt this time the family had sunk deep in poverty and Liu Bei gained his living by selling straw sandals and weaving grass matsThe family home was in a village near the chief city of ZhuoNear the house stood a huge mulberry tree and seen from afar its curved profile resembled the canopy of a wagonNoting the luxuriance of its foliage a soothsayer had predicted that one day a man of distinction would come forth from the familyAs a child Liu Bei played with the other village children beneath this tree and he would climb up into it saying I am the Son of Heaven and this is my chariot  His uncle Liu Yuanqi recognized that Liu Bei was no ordinary boy and saw to it that the family did not come to actual wantWhen Liu Bei was fifteen his mother sent him traveling for his education For a time he served Zheng Xuan and Lu Zhi as masters And he became great friends with Gongsun ZanLiu Bei was twentyeight when the outbreak of the Yellow Scarves called for soldiersThe sight of the notice saddened him and he sighed as he read itSuddenly a rasping voice behind him cried Sir why sigh if you do nothing to help your country Turning quickly he saw standing there a man about his own height with a bullet head like a leopards large eyes a swallow pointed chin and whiskers like a tigers He spoke in a loud bass voice and looked as irresistible as a dashing horseAt once Liu Bei saw he was no ordinary man and asked who he wasZhang Fei is my name replied the strangerI live near here where I have a farm and I am a wine seller and a butcher as well and I like to become acquainted with worthy humansYour sighs as you read the notice drew me toward you Liu Bei replied I am of the Imperial Family Liu Bei is my nameAnd I wish I could destroy these Yellow Scarves and restore peace to the land but alas I am helpless I have the means said Zhang Fei Suppose you and I raised some troops and tried what we could do This was happy news for Liu Bei and the two betook themselves to the village inn to talk over the projectAs they were drinking a huge tall fellow appeared pushing a handcart along the road At the threshold he halted and entered the inn to rest awhile and he called for wine And be quick added he for I am in haste to get into the town and offer myself for the army Liu Bei looked over the newcomer item by item and he noted the man had a huge frame a long beard a vivid face like an apple and deep red lipsHe had eyes like a phoenixs and fine bushy eyebrows like silkworms His whole appearance was dignified and aweinspiringPresently Liu Bei crossed over sat down beside him and asked his name I am Guan Yu replied heI am a native of the east side of the river but I have been a fugitive on the waters for some five years because I slew a ruffian who since he was powerful was a bullyI have come to join the army here Then Liu Bei told Guan Yu his own intentions and all three went away to Zhang Feis farm where they could talk over the grand projectSaid Zhang Fei The peach trees in the orchard behind the house are just in full flowerTomorrow we will institute a sacrifice there and solemnly declare our intention before Heaven and Earth And we three will swear brotherhood and unity of aims and sentiments thus will we enter upon our great task Both Liu Bei and Guan Yu gladly agreedAll three being of one mind next day they prepared the sacrifices a black ox a white horse and wine for libation Beneath the smoke of the incense burning on the altar they bowed their heads and recited this oath We threeLiu Bei Guan Yu and Zhang Feithough of different families swear brotherhood and promise mutual help to one end We will rescue each other in difficulty we will aid each other in dangerWe swear to serve the state and save the peopleWe ask not the same day of birth but we seek to die togetherMay Heaven the allruling and Earth the allproducing read our hearts and if we turn aside from righteousness or forget kindliness may Heaven and Human smite us They rose from their kneesThe two others bowed before Liu Bei as their elder brother and Zhang Fei was to be the youngest of the trioThis solemn ceremony performed they slew other oxen and made a feast to which they invited the villagers Three hundred joined them and all feasted and drank deep in the Peach Garden The next day weapons were mustered But there were no horses to rideThis was a real grief but soon they were cheered by the arrival of two horse dealers with a drove of horsesThus does Heaven help us said Liu BeiAnd the three brothers went forth to welcome the merchants They were Zhang Shiping and Su Shuang from Zhongshan They went northwards every year to buy horses They were now on their way home because of the Yellow ScarvesThe brothers invited them to the farm where wine was served before them Then Liu Bei told them of the plan to strive for tranquillityZhang Shiping and Su Shuang were glad and at once gave the brothers fifty good steeds and beside five hundred ounces of gold and silver and one thousand five hundred pounds of steel fit for the forging of weapons The brothers expressed their gratitude and the merchants took their leave Then blacksmiths were summoned to forge weaponsFor Liu Bei they made a pair of ancient swords for Guan Yu they fashioned a longhandled curve blade called GreenDragon Saber which weighed a full one hundred twenty pounds and for Zhang Fei they created a tenfoot spear called OctaneSerpent HalberdEach too had a helmet and full armorWhen weapons were ready the troop now five hundred strong marched to Commander Zhou Jing who presented them to Imperial Protector Liu YanWhen the ceremony of introduction was over Liu Bei declared his ancestry and Liu Yan at once accorded him the esteem due to a relationBefore many days it was announced that the rebellion had actually broken out and a Yellow Scarves chieftain Cheng Yuanzhi had invaded the region with a body of fifty thousand rebelsLiu Yan bade Zhou Jing and the three brothers to go out to oppose them with the five hundred troopsLiu Bei joyfully undertook to lead the van and marched to the foot of the Daxing Hills where they saw the rebelsThe rebels wore their hair flying about their shoulders and their foreheads were bound with yellow scarvesWhen the two armies had been drawn up opposite each other Liu Bei rode to the front Guan Yu to his left Zhang Fei to his right Flourishing his whip Liu Bei began to hurl reproaches at the rebels crying O malcontentsWhy not dismount and be bound Their leader Cheng Yuanzhi full of rage sent out one general Deng Mao to begin the battleAt once rode forward Zhang Fei his octaneserpent halberd poised to strikeOne thrust and Deng Mao rolled off his horse pierced through the heart At this Cheng Yuanzhi himself whipped up his steed and rode forth with sword raised ready to slay Zhang FeiBut Guan Yu swung up his ponderous greendragon saber and rode at Cheng YuanzhiAt the sight fear seized upon Cheng Yuanzhi and before he could defend himself the great saber fell cutting him in halvesTwo heroes new to wars alarms Ride boldly forth to try their armsTheir doughty deeds three kingdoms tell And poets sing how these befellTheir leader fallen the rebels threw away their weapons and fled The official soldiers dashed in among them Many thousands surrendered and the victory was complete Thus this part of the rebellion was broken upOn their return Liu Yan personally met them and distributed rewardsBut the next day letters came from Imperial Protector Gong Jing of Qingzhou saying that the rebels were laying siege to the chief city and it was near falling Help was needed quickly I will go said Liu Bei as soon as he heard the newsAnd he set out at once with his own soldiers reinforced by a body of five thousand under Zhou JingThe rebels seeing help coming at once attacked most fiercelyThe relieving force being comparatively small could not prevail and retired some ten miles where they made a campThey are many and we but few said Liu Bei to his brothersWe can only beat them by superior strategy So they prepared an ambush Guan Yu and Zhang Fei each with a goodly party went behind the hills right and left and there hidWhen the gongs beat they were to move out to support the main army These preparations made the drums rolled noisily for Liu Bei to advance The rebels also came forward But Liu Bei suddenly retired Thinking this was their chance the rebels pressed forward and were led over the hills Then suddenly the gongs sounded for the ambush Guan Yu and Zhang Fei poured out from right and left as Liu Bei faced around to meet the rebelsUnder threeside attack the rebels lost heavily and fled to the walls of Qingzhou CityBut Imperial Protector Gong Jing led out an armed body to attack them and the rebels were entirely defeated and many slain Qingzhou was no longer in danger Though fierce as tigers soldiers be Battle are won by strategyA hero comes he gains renown Already destined for a crownAfter the celebrations in honor of victory were over Commander Zhou Jing proposed to return to YouzhouBut Liu Bei said We are informed that Imperial Commander Lu Zhi has been struggling with a horde of rebels led by Zhang Jue at Guangzong Lu Zhi was once my teacher and I want to go to help him So Liu Bei and Zhou Jing separated and the three brothers with their troops made their way of GuangzongThey found Lu Zhis camp were admitted to his presence and declared the reason of their comingThe Commander received them with great joy and they remained with him while he made his plansAt that time Zhang Jues one hundred fifty thousand troops and Lu Zhis fifty thousand troops were facing each other Neither had had any success Lu Zhi said to Liu Bei I am able to surround these rebels hereBut the other two brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang are strongly entrenched opposite Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun at YingchuanI will give you a thousand more troops and with these you can go to find out what is happening and we can then settle the moment for concerted attack So Liu Bei set off and marched as quickly as possible to YingchuanAt that time the imperial troops were attacking with success and the rebels had retired upon Changshe They had encamped among the thick grassSeeing this Huangfu Song said to Zhu Jun The rebels are camping in the field We can attack them by fire So the Imperial Commanders bade every man cut a bundle of dry grass and laid an ambushThat night the wind blew a gale and at the second watch they started a blazeAt the same time Huangfu Song and Zhu Juns troops attacked the rebels and set their camp on fire The flames rose to the very heaven The rebels were thrown into great confusion There was no time to saddle horses or don armor they fled in all directions The battle continued until dawnZhang Liang and Zhang Bao with a group of flying rebels found a way of escapeBut suddenly a troop of soldiers with crimson banners appeared to oppose themTheir leader was a man of medium stature with small eyes and a long beard He was Cao Cao a Beijuo man holding the rank of General of the Flying CavalryHis father was Cao Song but he was not really a Cao Cao Song had been born to the Xiahou family but he had been brought up by Eunuch Cao Teng and had taken this family nameAs a young man Cao Cao had been fond of hunting and delighted in songs and dancingHe was resourceful and full of guile An uncle seeing the young fellow so unsteady used to get angry with him and told his father of his misdeeds His father remonstrated with himBut Cao Cao made equal to the occasionOne day seeing his uncle coming he fell to the ground in a pretended fitThe uncle alarmed ran to tell his father who came and there was the youth in most perfect healthBut your uncle said you were in a fit are you better said his fatherI have never suffered from fits or any such illness said Cao CaoBut I have lost my uncles affection and he has deceived you Thereafter whatever the uncle might say of his faults his father paid no heedSo the young man grew up licentious and uncontrolledA man of the time named Qiao Xuan said to Cao Cao Rebellion is at hand and only a man of the greatest ability can succeed in restoring tranquillityThat man is yourself And Ho Yo of Nanyang said of him The dynasty of Han is about to fallHe who can restore peace is this man and only he Cao Cao went to inquire his future of a wise man of Runan named Xu ShaoWhat manner of man am I asked Cao CaoThe seer made no reply and again and again Cao Cao pressed the questionThen Xu Shao replied In peace you are an able subject in chaos you are a crafty hero Cao Cao greatly rejoiced to hear thisCao Cao graduated at twenty and earned a reputation of piety and integrity He began his career in a county near Capital LuoyangIn the four gates of the city he ruled he hung up clubs of various sorts and he would punish any breach of the law whatever the rank of the offenderNow an uncle of Eunuch Jian Shuo was found one night in the streets with a sword and was arrested In due course he was beatenThereafter no one dared to offend again and Cao Caos name became heardSoon he became a magistrate of Dunqiu At the outbreak of the Yellow Scarves Cao Cao held the rank of General and was given command of five thousand horse and foot to help fight at Yingchuan He just happened to fall in with the newly defeated rebels whom he cut to piecesThousands were slain and endless banners and drums and horses were captured together with huge sums of moneyHowever Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang got away and after an interview with Huangfu Song Cao Cao went in pursuit of them Meanwhile Liu Bei and his brothers were hastening toward Yingchuan when they heard the din of battle and saw flames rising high toward the sky However they arrived too late for the fightingThey saw Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun to whom they told the intentions of Lu ZhiThe rebel power is quite broken here said the commanders but they will surely make for Guangzong to join Zhang Jue You can do nothing better than hasten back The three brothers thus retraced their stepsHalf way along the road they met a party of soldiers escorting a prisoner in a cagecart When they drew near they saw the prisoner was no other than the man they were going to helpHastily dismounting Liu Bei asked what had happenedLu Zhi explained I had surrounded the rebels and was on the point of smashing them when Zhang Jue employed some of his supernatural powers and prevented my victoryThe court sent down Eunuch Zhuo Feng to inquire into my failure and that official demanded a bribe I told him how hard pressed we were and asked him where in the circumstances I could find a gift for himHe went away in wrath and reported that I was hiding behind my ramparts and would not give battle and that I disheartened my armySo I was superseded by Dong Zhuo and I have to go to the capital to answer the charge This story put Zhang Fei into a rageHe was for slaying the escort and setting free Lu Zhi But Liu Bei checked himThe government will take the proper course said Liu Bei You must not act hastily And the escort and the three brothers went two waysIt was useless to continue on that road to Guangzong so Guan Yu proposed to go back to Zhuo and they retook the roadTwo days later they heard the thunder of battle behind some hills Hastening to the top they beheld the government soldiers suffering great loss and they saw the countryside was full of Yellow Scarves On the rebels banners were the words Zhang Jue the Lord of Heaven written large We will attack this Zhang Jue said Liu Bei to his brothers and they galloped out to join in the battleZhang Jue had worsted Dong Zhuo and was following up his advantage He was in hot pursuit when the three brothers dashed into his army threw his ranks into confusion and drove him back fifteen miles Then the brothers returned with the rescued general to his campWhat offices have you asked Dong Zhuo when he had leisure to speak to the brothers None replied theyAnd Dong Zhuo treated them with disrespect Liu Bei retired calmly but Zhang Fei was furiousWe have just rescued this menial in a bloody fight cried Zhang Fei and now he is rude to usNothing but his death can slake my anger Zhang Fei stamped toward Dong Zhuos tent holding firmly a sharp swordAs it was in olden time so it is today The simple wight may merit well Officialdom holds sway Zhang Fei the blunt and hasty Where can you find his peerBut slaying the ungrateful would Mean many deaths a yearDong Zhuos fate will be unrolled in later chapters CHAPTER Zhang Fei Whips The Government Officer He Jin Plots To Kill The Eunuchs Dong Zhuo was born in the far northwest at Lintao in Longxi As the governor of Hedong Dong Zhuo himself was arrogant and overbearing But the day he had treated Liu Bei with contumely had been his last had not Liu Bei and Guan Yu restrained their wrathful brother Zhang FeiRemember he has the government commission said Liu Bei who are we to judge and slay It is bitter to take orders from such a wretch I would rather slay himYou may stay here if you wish to but I will seek some other place said Zhang FeiWe three are one in life and in death there is no parting for usWe will all go hence So spoke Liu Bei and his brother was satisfiedWherefore all three set out and lost no time in traveling until they came to Zhu Jun who received them well and accepted their aid in attacking Zhang BaoAt this time Cao Cao had joined himself to Huangfu Song and they were trying to destroy Zhang Liang and there was a great battle at QuyangZhang Bao was commanding some eighty thousand troops The rebel had led his army to a strong position in the rear of the hillsAn attack being decided upon Liu Bei was the van leaderOn the rebel side a general of Zhang Bao Gao Sheng came out to offer battle Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei to smite Gao ShengOut rode Zhang Fei at full speed his spear ready set After a few bouts Zhang Fei wounded Gao Sheng who was unhorsed At this Liu Bei signaled the main army to advanceThen Zhang Bao while still mounted loosened his hair grasped his sword and uttered his incantationsThereupon began the wind to howl and the thunder to roll while a dense black cloud from the heavens settled upon the field And therein seemed to be horsemen and footmen innumerable who swept to attack the imperial troopsFear came upon them and Liu Bei led off his troops but they were in disorder and returned defeated Zhu Jun and Liu Bei considered the matterZhang Bao uses magic said Zhu JunTomorrow then will I prepare counter magic in the shape of the blood of slaughtered swine and goats and dogsThis blood shall be sprinkled upon their hosts from the precipices above by soldiers in ambushThus shall we be able to break the power of their shamanic art So it was done Guan Yu and Zhang Fei took each a thousand troops and hid them on the high cliffs behind the hills and they had a plentiful supply of the blood of swine and goats and dogs and all manners of filthy thingsAnd so next day when the rebels with fluttering banners and rolling drums came out to challenge Liu Bei rode forth to meet themAt the same moment that the armies met again Zhang Bao began his magic and again the elements began to struggle together Sand flew in clouds pebbles were swept along the ground black masses of vapor filled the sky and rolling masses of foot and horse descended from on highLiu Bei turned as before to flee and the rebels rushed onBut as they pressed through the hills the trumpets blared and the hidden soldiers exploded bombs threw down filth and spattered bloodThe masses of soldiers and horses in the air fluttered to the earth as fragments of torn paper the wind ceased to blow the thunder subsided the sand sank and the pebbles lay still upon the groundZhang Bao quickly saw his magic had been countered and turned to retire Then he was attacked on the flanks by Guan Yu and Zhang Fei and in rear by Liu Bei and Zhu Jun The rebels were routedLiu Bei seeing from afar the banner of Zhang Bao The Lord of Earth galloped toward it but only succeeded in wounding Zhang Bao with an arrow in the left armWounded though he was Zhang Bao got away into the city of Yangcheng where he fortified himself and was besieged by Zhu Jun Scouts sent out to get news of Huangfu Song reportedCommander Huangfu Song had been very successful and Dong Zhuo had suffered many reverses Therefore the court put Huangfu Song in the latters placeZhang Jue had died before Huangfu Songs arrivalZhang Liang had added his brothers army to his own but no headway could be made against Huangfu Song whose army gained seven successive victories And Zhang Liang was slain at QuyangBeside this Zhang Jues coffin was exhumed the corpse beheaded and the head after exposure was sent to Capital LuoyangThe common crowd had surrenderedFor these services Huangfu Song was promoted to General of the Flying Cavalry and the Imperial Protector of Jizhou Huangfu Song did not forgotten his friendsHis first act after he had attained to power was to memorialize the Throne concerning the case of Lu Zhi who was then restored to his former rank for his meritorious conductsCao Cao also received advancement for his services and was preparing to go to Jinan to his new post Hearing these things Zhu Jun pressed harder yet upon Yangcheng and the approaching breakup of the rebellion became evidentThen one of Zhang Baos officers Yan Zheng killed his leader and brought the head in token of submissionThus rebellion in that part of the country was stamped out and Zhu Jun made his report to the government However the embers of the Yellow Scarves still smolderedThree other rebels Zhao Hong Han Zhong and Sun Zhong gathered some thirty thousand rebels and began to murder and rob and burn calling themselves the avengers of Master Zhang JueThe court commanded the successful Zhu Jun to lead his veteran and successful troops to destroy the rebelsHe at once marched toward the city of Wancheng which the rebels were holding When Zhu Jun arrived Han Zhong went to oppose himZhu Jun sent Liu Bei and his brothers to attack the southwest corner of the cityHan Zhong at once led the best of his troops to defend the cityMeanwhile Zhu Jun himself led two thousand of armored horsemen to attack the opposite cornerThe rebels thinking the city being lost abandoned the southwest and turned back into the city to help the defendersLiu Bei pressed hotly in their rear and they were utterly routedThey took refuge in the city which was then invested When famine pressed upon the besieged they sent a messenger to offer to surrender but Zhu Jun refused the offerSaid Liu Bei to Zhu Jun Seeing that the founder of the Han Dynasty Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor could welcome the submissive and receive the favorable why reject these The conditions are different replied Zhu JunIn those old days disorder was universal and the people had no fixed lord Wherefore submission was welcomed and support rewarded to encourage people to come overNow the empire is united and the Yellow Scarves are the only malcontentsTo receive their surrender is not to encourage the goodTo allow brigands when successful is to give way to every license and to let them surrender when they fail is to encourage brigandageYour plan is not a good one Liu Bei replied Not to let brigands surrender is well But the city is surrounded as by an iron barrelIf the rebels request be refused they will be desperate and fight to the death and we can hardly withstood a myriad of such menMoreover in the city there are many times that number all doomed to deathLet us withdraw from one corner and only attack the oppositeThey will all assuredly flee and have no desire to fight We shall take them Zhu Jun saw that the advice was good and followed it As predicted the rebels ran out led by Han ZhongThe besiegers fell upon them as they fled and Han Zhong was slain The rebels scattered in all directionsBut the other two rebel chieftains Zhao Hong and Sun Zhong came with large reinforcements and as they appeared very strong the imperial soldiers retired and the new body of rebels reentered WanchengZhu Jun encamped three miles from the city and prepared to attackJust then there arrived a body of horse and foot from the eastAt the lead was one general with a broad open face a body as an alert tigers and a torso as a lofty bearsHis name was Sun Jian He was a native of Fuchun in the old state of Wu a descendant of the famous Sun Zi the StrategistWhen he was seventeen Sun Jian was with his father on the River Qiantang and saw a party of pirates who had been plundering a merchant dividing their booty on the river bankWe can capture these said he to his fatherSo gripping his sword he ran boldly up the bank and cried out to this side and that as if he was calling his men to come onThis made the pirates believe the soldiers were on them and they fled leaving their booty behind themHe actually killed one of the piratesIn this way be became known and was recommended for officeThen in collaboration with the local officials he raised a band of one thousand and helped to quell the rebellion of one Xu Chang who called himself the Sun Emperor and had ten thousand supporters The rebels son Xu Shao was also slain with his fatherFor this Sun Jian was commended by Imperial Protector Zang Min in a memorial to the Throne and he received further promotion to the post of magistrate of Yandu then of Xuyi and then of XiapiWhen the Yellow Scarves rebellion began Sun Jian gathered together the youths of his village some of the merchant class got a troop of one thousand five hundred of veteran soldiers and took the field Now he had reached the fighting areaZhu Jun welcomed Sun Jian gladly and ordered him to attack the south gate of Wancheng The north and the west gates were simultaneously attacked by Liu Bei and Zhu Jun but the east gate was left free to give the rebels a chance of exitSun Jian was the first to mount the wall and cut down more than twenty rebels with his own swordThe rebels ran but the leader Zhao Hong rode directly at Sun Jian with his spear ready to thrustSun Jian leaped down from the wall snatched away the spear and with it knocked Zhao Hong from the horseThen Sun Jian mounting Zhao Hongs horse rode hither and thither slaying as he went The rebels fled north Meeting Liu Bei they declined to fight and scatteredBut Liu Bei drew his bow fitted an arrow and shot their leader Sun Zhong who fell to the groundThe main army of Zhu Jun came up and after tremendous slaughter the rebels surrenderedThus was peace brought to the ten counties about the Nanyang areaZhu Jun returned to Capital Luoyang was promoted to the General of the Flying Cavalry and received the governorship of Henan He did not forget those who had helped him to win victoryThus he reported the merits of Liu Bei and Sun Jian to the ThroneSun Jian having influential friends and connections to support him quickly got an appointment to a post of Commander of Changsha and went to assume the new officeBut Liu Bei in spite of Zhu Juns memorial waited in vain for preferment and the three brothers became very sad Walking along one day in the capital Liu Bei met a court official Zhang Jun to whom he related his services and told his sorrowsZhang Jun was much surprised at this neglect and one day at court spoke to the Emperor about it Said he The Yellow Scarves rebelled because the eunuchs sold offices and bartered ranks There was employment only for their friends punishment only for their enemies This led to rebellionWherefore it would be well to slay the Ten Eunuchs and expose their heads and proclaim what had been done throughout the whole empire Then reward the worthyThereby the land would be wholly tranquil But the eunuchs fiercely opposed this and said Zhang Jun was insulting the Emperor and the Emperor bade the guards thrust Zhang Jun outHowever the eunuchs took counsel together and one said Surely some one who rendered some service against rebels resents being passed over So they caused a list of unimportant people to be prepared for preferment by and byAmong them was Liu Bei who received the post of magistrate of the county of Anxi to which he proceeded without delay after disbanding his army and sending them home to their villages He retained two dozens or so as escortThe three brothers reached Anxi and soon the administration of the county was so reformed and the rule so wise that in a month there was no lawbreaking The three brothers lived in harmony eating at the same table and sleeping on the same couchBut when Liu Bei was in public sessions or in company of others Guan Yu and Zhang Fei would stand in attendance were it even a whole dayFour months after their arrival there came out a general order for the reduction of the number of military officers holding civil posts and Liu Bei began to fear that he would be among those thrown outIn due course the inspecting official Du Biao by name arrived and was met at the boundary but to the polite obeisance of Liu Bei he made no return save a wave of his whip as he sat on his horseThis made Guan Yu and Zhang Fei furious but worse was to followWhen the inspector had arrived at his lodging he took his seat on the dais leaving Liu Bei standing belowAfter a long time he addressed Liu BeiMagistrate what was your origin Liu Bei replied I am descended from Prince Faubus of ZhongshanSince my first fight with the Yellow Scarves rebels at Zhuo County I have been in some thirty battles wherein I gained some trifling meritMy reward was this office You lie about your descent and your statement of services is false roared the inspectorNow the court has ordered the reduction of your sort of low class and corrupt officials Liu Bei muttered to himself and withdrewOn his return to the magistracy he took council with his secretariesThis pompous attitude only means the inspector wants a bribe said theyI have never wronged the people to the value of a single coin then where is a bribe to come from Next day the inspector had the minor officials before him and forced them to bear witness that their master had oppressed the peopleLiu Bei time after time went to rebut this charge but the doorkeepers drove him away and he could not enter Now Zhang Fei had been all day drowning his sorrow in wine and had drunk far too muchCalling for his horse he rode out past the lodging of the inspector and at the gate saw a small crowd of whitehaired people weeping bitterly He asked whyThey said The inspector has compelled the underlings to bear false witness against our magistrate with the desire to injure the virtuous Liu BeiWe came to beg mercy for him but are not permitted to enter Moreover we have been beaten by the doorkeepers This provoked the irascible and half intoxicated Zhang Fei to furyHis eyes opened wide until they became circles he ground his teeth in a moment he was off his steed had forced his way past the scared doorkeepers into the building and was in the rear apartments There he saw Imperial Inspector Du Biao sitting on high with the official underlings in bonds at his feetOppressor of the people robber cried Zhang Fei Do you know me But before the inspector could reply Zhang Fei had had him by the hair and had dragged him downAnother moment he was outside and firmly lashed to the hitching post in front of the buildingThen breaking off a switch from a willow tree Zhang Fei gave his victim a severe thrashing only staying his hand when the tenth switch was too short to strike with Liu Bei was sitting alone communing with his sorrow when he heard a shouting before his doorHe asked what the matter was They told him General Zhang Fei had bound somebody to a post and was thrashing him Hastily going outside Liu Bei saw who the unhappy victim was and asked Zhang Fei the reasonIf we do not beat this sort of wretch to death what may we expect said Zhang FeiNoble Sir save me cried the inspectorNow Liu Bei had always been kindly and gracious wherefore he bade his brother release the officer and go his wayThen Guan Yu came up saying Brother after your magnificent services you only got this petty post and even here you have been insulted by this fellowA thorn bush is no place for a phoenixLet us slay this fellow leave here and go home till we can evolve a bigger scheme Liu Bei contented himself with hanging the official seal about the inspectors neck saying If I hear that you injure the people I will assuredly kill youI now spare your life and I return to you the sealWe are going The inspector went to the governor of Dingzhou and complained and orders were issued for the arrest of the brothers but they got away to Daizhou and sought refuge with Liu Hui who sheltered them because of Liu Beis noble birthBy this time the Ten Regular Attendants had everything in their hands and they put to death all who did not stand in with themFrom every officer who had helped to put down the rebels they demanded presents and if these were not forthcoming he was removed from officeImperial Commanders Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun both fell victims to these intrigues and were deprived from offices while on the other hand the eunuchs received the highest honorsThirteen eunuchs were ennobled including Zhao Zhong who was added to the rank of General of the Flying CavalryThe government grew worse and worse and every one was irritatedRebellions broke out in Changsha led by Ou Xing and in Yuyang led by Zhang Ju and Zhang Chun Memorials were sent up in number as snow flakes in winter but the Ten suppressed them allOne day the Emperor was at a feast in one of the gardens with the Ten when High Counselor Liu Tao suddenly appeared showing very great distressThe Emperor asked what the matter wasSire how can you be feasting with these when the empire is at the last gasp said Liu TaoAll is well said the EmperorWhere is anything wrong Said Liu Tao Robbers swarm on all sides and plunder the citiesAnd all is the fault of the Ten Eunuchs who sell offices and injure the people oppress loyal officials and deceive their superiorsAll virtuous ones have left the services and misfortune is before our very eyes At this the eunuchs pulled off their hats and threw themselves at their masters feet If Minister Liu Tao disapproves of us they said we are in dangerWe pray that our lives be spared and we may go to our farms We yield our property to help defray military expenses And they wept bitterlyThe Emperor turned angrily to Liu Tao saying You also have servants why cant you bear with mine And thereupon the Emperor called to the guards to eject Liu Tao and put him to deathLiu Tao cried aloud My death matters nothingThe pity is that Han Dynasty after four centuries of reign is falling fast The guards hustled him away and were just about to carry out the Emperors order when a minister stopped them shouting Strike notWait till I have spoken with His Majesty It was the Minister of the Interior Chen Dan He went in to the Emperor to whom he said For what fault is Counselor Liu Tao to be put to death He has vilified my servants and has insulted me said the EmperorAll the empire would eat the flesh of the eunuchs if they could and yet Sire you respect them as if they were your parents They have no merit but they are created noblesMoreover Feng Xu was in league with the Yellow Scarves Unless Your Majesty looks to it the state will crumble There was no proof against Feng Xu replied the EmperorAbout the Ten Eunuchs are there none faithful among them Chen Dan beat his forehead on the steps of the throne and did not desist from remonstranceThen the Emperor grew angry and commanded his removal and imprisonment with Liu TaoThat night Liu Tao and Chen Dan were murderedThen the eunuchs sent a forged edict to Sun Jian making him Governor of Changsha with orders to suppress the rebellion of Ou Xing In less than two months Sun Jian reported the county all tranquil For this he was created Lord of WuchengFurther Liu Yu was made Imperial Protector of Youzhou to move against Yuyang and suppress Zhang Ju and Zhang ChunLiu Hui of Daizhou recommended Liu Bei to Liu Yu Liu Yu welcomed Liu Bei and gave him rank of commander and sent him against the rebels He fought with and worsted them and entirely broke their spirit Zhang Chun was cruel and his leaders turned against himOne of his officers then slew him and brought in his head after which the others submittedThe other leader Zhang Ju saw that all was lost and killed himselfYuyang being now tranquil Liu Beis services were reported to the Throne and he received full pardon for the insult to the imperial inspectorHe also became Magistrate Deputy of Micheng Then Gongsun Zan praised Liu Beis former services and he was promoted to Magistrate of PingyuanThis place was very prosperous and Liu Bei recovered something of his old manner before the days of adversityLiu Yu also received preferment and was promoted to Grand CommanderIn the summer of the six year of Central Stability  Emperor Ling became seriously ill and summoned He Jin into the palace to arrange for the future He Jin had sprung from a humble family of butchers but his sister had become a concubine of rank and borne a son to the Emperor named Bian LiuAfter this she became Empress He and He Jin became the powerful Imperial Guardian and Regent MarshalThe Emperor had also greatly loved a beautiful girl Lady Wang who had borne him a son named Liu XianEmpress He had poisoned Lady Wang from jealousy and the baby had been given into the care of Empress Dong who was the mother of Emperor LingLady Dong was the wife of Liu Chang Lord of JieduAs time went on and the Emperor Huan had no son of his own he adopted the son of Liu Chang who succeeded as the Emperor LingAfter his accession Emperor Ling had taken his own mother into the palace to live and had conferred upon her the title of Empress DowagerEmpress Dong had always tried to persuade her son to name Liu Xian as the Heir Apparent and in fact the Emperor greatly loved the boy and was disposed to do as his mother desiredWhen he fell ill one of the eunuchs Jian Shuo said If Liu Xian is to succeed He Jin must be killed to prevent countermoves The Emperor saw this too and commanded Imperial Guardian He Jin to come to himBut at the very gates of the palace He Jin was warned of his danger by Commander Pan Yin who said This must be a trap of Jian Shuo to destroy you He Jin rushed back to his quarters and called many of the ministers to his side and they met to consider how to put the eunuchs to deathAt this assembly a man spoke against the plot The influence of the eunuchs dates back half a century and has spread like a noxious weed in all directions How can we hope to destroy itAbove all keep this plot secret or you will be exterminated He Jin eyed down and saw General of Military Standards Cao CaoHe Jin was very angry at this speech and cried What do inferiors like you know of the ways of government And in the midst of the confusion Pan Yin came to sayThe Emperor is no more The eunuchs have decided to keep the death a secret and forge a command to the Imperial Guardian to come into the palace to settle the successionMeanwhile to prevent trouble they have inscribed the name of Liu Xian on the roll And as Pan Yin finished speaking the edict arrivedThe matter for the moment is to set up the rightful heir said Cao CaoThe other affairs can wait Who dares to join me in supporting the rightful heirPrince Bian Liu asked He Jin the Imperial GuardianAt once one stood forward saying Give me five thousand veterans and we will break into the palace set up the true heir slay the eunuchs and sweep clean the governmentThen peace will come to the empire The energetic speaker was Yuan Shao son of the former Minister of the Interior Yuan Feng and nephew of Minister Yuan Wei Yuan Shao then held the rank of Imperial CommanderHe Jin mustered five thousand royal guardsYuan Shao put on complete armor and took commandHe Jin supported by He Yu Xun You Zheng Tai and more than thirty other ministers and highrank officials went into the palace and in the hall where lay the coffin of the late Emperor they placed Bian Liu on the throneAfter the ceremony was over and all had bowed before the new Emperor Yuan Shao went in to arrest Eunuch Jian ShuoJian Shuo in terror fled into the palace garden and hid among the shrubs where he was discovered and murdered by Guo Sheng one of the Ten EunuchsThe guards under Jian Shuos command all surrendered Yuan Shao said Their gangs have broken the most opportune moment is now to slay all the eunuchs But Zhang Rang and the eunuchs of the Ten scented the danger and rushed to see Empress HeThey said The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Jian Shuo only he was concerned and no otherNow the Imperial Guardian on Yuan Shaos advice wishes to slay every one of usWe implore your pity O Your Majesty Fear not said Empress He whose son had just become Emperor I will protect you She sent for her brother and said You and I are of lowly origin and we owe our good fortune to the eunuchsThe misguided Jian Shuo is now dead and need you really put all the others to death as Yuan Shao advises And He Jin obeyed her wish He explained to his party saying The real offender Jian Shuo has met his fate and his clan will be punishedBut we need not exterminate the whole party nor injure his colleagues Slay them root and branch cried Yuan Shao or they will ruin you I have decided said He Jin coldly say no more Within a few days He Jin became Chair of the Secretariat and his associates received high officesNow Empress Dong summoned the eunuch Zhang Rang and his party to a council Said she It was I who first brought forward the sister of He JinToday her son is on the throne and all the officials are her friends and her influence is enormousWhat can we do Zhang Rang replied Your Highness should administer the state from behind the veil create the late Emperors son Liu Xian a prince give your brother the Imperial Uncle Dong Chong a high rank and place him over the army and use usThat will do it Empress Dong approvedNext day she held a court and issued an edict in the sense proposed She made Liu Xian Prince of Chenliu and Dong Chong General of the Flying Cavalry and she allowed the eunuchs again to participate state affairsWhen Empress He saw this she prepared a banquet to which she invited her rival Empress DongIn the middle of the feast when all were well warmed with wine Empress He rose and offered a cup to her guest saying It is not fitting that we two should meddle in state affairsIn the beginning of the Han Dynasty when Empress Lu laid hands upon the government all her clans were put to deathWe ought to remain content immured in our palaces and leave state affairs to the state officialsThat would be well for the country and I trust you will act thus But Empress Dong only got angry saying You poisoned Lady Wang out of jealousyNow relying upon the fact that your son sits on the throne and that your brother is powerful you speak these wild wordsI will command that your brother be beheaded and that can be done as easily as I turn my hand Empress He in her turn waxed wroth and said I tried to persuade you with fair words why get so angry You low born daughter of a butcher what do you know of offices cried Empress Dong And the quarrel waxed hot The eunuchs persuaded the ladies to retireBut in the night Empress He summoned her brother into the palace and told him what had occurred He went out and took counsel with the principal officers of stateNext morning a court was held and a memorial was presented sayingEmpress Dong being the foster mother of Liu Xian Prince of Chenliu a regional princeonly a collateralcannot properly occupy any part of the Palace She is to be removed into her original fief of Hejian and is to depart immediately And while they sent an escort to remove Empress Dong a strong guard was placed about the Imperial Uncle Dong Chongs dwellingThey took away his seal of office and he knowing this was the end killed himself in his private apartmentsHis dependents who wailed his death were driven off by the guardsThe eunuchs Zhang Rang and Duan Gui having lost their patroness sent large gifts to He Jins younger brother He Miao and his mother Lady Wuyang and thus got them to put in a good word to Empress He so as to gain her protection And so they gained favor once more at courtIn the sixth month of that year the secret emissaries of He Jin poisoned Empress Dong in her residence in the country Her remains were brought to the capital and buried in Wen TombsHe Jin feigned illness and did not attend the funeralCommander Yuan Shao went one day to see He Jin saying The two eunuchs Zhang Rang and Duan Gui are spreading the report outside that you has caused the death of the late empress and is aiming at the throneThis is an excuse for you to destroy themDo not spare them this time or you will pay like Dou Wu and Chen Fan who in the previous reign missed their chance because the secret had not been kept and they paid by their own deathsNow you and your brother have many commanders and officers behind so that the destruction of the eunuchs can be but an easeIt is a heavensent opportunityDelay no further But He Jin replied Let me think it over He Jins servants overheard the discussion and secretly informed the intended victims who sent further gifts to the younger brother He MiaoCorrupted by these he went in to speak with his sister Empress He and said The General is the chief support of the new Emperor yet he is not gracious and merciful but thinks wholly of slaughterIf he slays the eunuchs without cause it may bring about revolution Soon after He Jin entered and told her of his design to put the eunuchs to deathShe argued with him Those officials look after palace affairs and are old servantsTo kill the old servants just after the death of their master would appear disrespectful to the dynastys ancestral temple And as He Jin was of a vacillating mind he murmured assent and left her What about it said Yuan Shao on meeting himShe will not consent what can be done Call up an army and slay them it is imperative Never mind her consent That is an excellent plan said He JinAnd he sent orders all round to march soldiers to the capitalBut Counselor Chen Lin objected Nay do not act blindlyThe proverb says To cover the eyes and snatch at swallows is to fool oneself If in so small a matter you cannot attain your wish with covered eyes what of great affairsNow by virtue of the imperial prestige and with the army under your hand you may do as you please To use such enormous powers against the eunuchs would resemble lighting up a furnace to burn a hairBut act promptly use your powers and smite at once and all the empire will be with youBut to summon forces to the capital to gather many bold persons into one spot each with ones own schemes is to turn our weapons against our own person to place ourselves in the power of anotherNothing but failure can come of it nothing but confusion The view of a mere bookworm said He Jin with a smileThen one of those about He Jin suddenly clapped his hands laughing Solving this issue is as easy as turning over ones handWhy so much talk The speaker was Cao CaoWouldst thou withdraw wicked people from thy princes side Then seek counsel of the wise people of the stateWhat Cao Cao said will be disclosed in later chapters CHAPTER In Wenming Garden Dong Zhuo Denounces Ding Yuan With RedHare Li Su Bribes Lu Bu What Cao Cao said was thisThe eunuch evil is of very old standing but the real cause of the present trouble is in the improper influence allowed them by the emperors and the misplaced favoritism they have enjoyedBut a gaoler would be ample force to employ against this kind of evil and getting rid of the main culprits is quite enough Why increase confusion by summoning troops from the regionsAny desire to slay all of them will speedily become known and the plan will fail Then Cao Cao you have some scheme of your own to further said He Jin with a sneerCao Cao left the meeting proclaiming The one throwing the world into chaos is He Jin Then He Jin sent swift secret letters far and wide to several bases It must be recalled that Dong Zhuo had failed in his attempt to destroy the Yellow Scarves rebellionHe would have been punished if he had not bribed the Ten Eunuchs heavily for their protection Later he obtained the rank of Imperial Protector in the westernmost region of Xizhou and an army of two hundred thousand troops But Dong Zhuo was treacherous and disloyal at heartSo when he received the summons to the capital he rejoiced greatly and lost no time in obeying itHe left a soninlaw Commander Niu Fu to look after the affairs of Xizhou and set out for LuoyangDong Zhuo took with him a huge army and four generalsLi Jue Guo Si Zhang Ji and Fan ChouDong Zhuos adviser and soninlaw Li Ru said Though a formal summons has come there are many obscurities in itIt would be well to send up a memorial stating plainly our aims and intentionsThen we can proceed So Dong Zhuo composed something like thisThy servant knows that the continual rebellions owe their origin to the eunuchs who act counter to all recognized preceptsNow to stop the ebullition of a pot the best way is to withdraw the fire to cut out an abscess though painful is better than to nourish the evilI have dared to undertake a military advance on the capital with thy permission and now pray that Zhang Rang and the other eunuchs be removed for the happiness of the dynasty and of the empire He Jin read this memorial and showed it to his partisansThen said Minister Zheng Tai A fierce wild beast if he comes his prey will be humans He Jin replied You are too timorous you are unequal to great schemes But Lu Zhi also said Long have I known this man in appearance innocent he is a very wolf at heartLet him in and calamity enters with himStop him do not let him come and thus will you avoid chaos He Jin was obstinate and both Zheng Tai and Lu Zhi gave up their posts and retired as did more than half the ministers of state while He Jin sent a warm welcome to Dong Zhuo who soon camped at Shengchi Lake and stationed there without further actionThe eunuchs knew this move was directed against them and recognized that their only chance for safety was to strike the first blowSo they first hid a band of fifty armed ruffians at the Gate of Grand Virtue in the Palace of Happiness then they went in to see Empress He They said The General feigning to act under command has called up armies to the capital to destroy usWe pray you Your Majesty pity and save us Go to the General and confess your faults said the EmpressIf we did then should we be cut to mincemeatRather summon the General into your presence and command him to ceaseIf he will not then we pray but die in your presence The Empress issued the requisite command and He Jin was just going to her when Counselor Chen Lin advised him not to enter saying The eunuchs are certainly behind the order and mean your harm But He Jin could only see the command of the Empress and was blind to all elseOur plot is no longer a secret said Yuan Shao still you may go if you are ready to fight your way in Get the eunuchs out first said Cao Cao Silly children said He JinWhat can they do against the man who holds the forces of the empire in the palm of his hand Yuan Shao said If you will go then we will come as a guard just as a precaution Whereupon both Yuan Shao and Cao Cao chose five hundred best men under their command at whose head they placed a brother of Yuan Shao named Yuan ShuYuan Shu clad in mail drew up his troops outside the palace entrance while Yuan Shao and Cao Cao holding swords went as escortWhen He Jin neared the palace the eunuchs said The orders are to admit the Imperial Guardian and none other So the escort was detained outsideHe Jin went in proudlyAt the Gate of Grand Virtue he was met by Zhang Rang and Duan Gui and their followers quickly closed in around him He Jin began to feel alarmedThen Zhang Rang in a harsh voice began to revile him What crime had Empress Dong committed that she should have been put to deathAnd when the Mother of the Country was buried who feigned sickness and did not attendWe raised you and your paltry huckstering family to all the dignity and wealth you have and this is your gratitude You would slay usYou call us sordid and dirty who is the cleaner He Jin was panic stricken and looked about for a way to escape but the eunuchs closed him in and then the assassins appeared and cut He Jin into halvesClosing the days of the Hans and the years of their rule were near spent Stupid and tactless was He Jin yet stood he highest in office Many were they who advised him but he was deaf as he heard not Wherefore fell he a victim under the swords of the eunuchs So He Jin died Yuan Shao and Cao Cao waited longBy and by impatient at the delay they called through the gate Thy carriage waits O General For reply the head of He Jin was flung over the wall A decree was proclaimed He Jin has contemplated treachery and therefore has been slainIt pardons his adherents Yuan Shao shouted The eunuchs have slain the High MinisterLet those who will slay this wicked party come and help me Then one of He Jins generals Wu Kuang set fire to the gateYuan Shu at the head of his guards burst in and fell to slaying the eunuchs without regard to age or rankYuan Shao and Cao Cao broke into the inner part of the palaceFour of the eunuchsZhao Zhong Cheng Kuang Xia Yun and Guo Shengfled to the Blue Flower Lodge where they were hacked to piecesFire raged destroying the buildingsFour of the Ten Regular AttendantsZhang Rang Duan Gui Cao Jie and Hou Lanled by Zhang Rang carried off the Empress Emperor Bian and Prince Xian of Chenliu toward the north palaceLu Zhi since he had resigned office was at home but hearing of the revolution in the Palace he donned his armor took his spear and prepared to fightHe saw the eunuch Duan Gui hurrying the Empress along and called out You rebel how dare you abduct the Empress The eunuch fledThe Empress leaped out of a window and was taken to a place of safetyGeneral Wu Kuang burst into one of the inner halls where he found He Miao sword in handYou also were in the plot to slay your own brother cried Wu KuangYou shall die with the others Let us kill the plotter against his elder brother cried manyHe Miao looked around his enemies hemmed him in on every sideHe was hacked to piecesYuan Shu bade his soldiers scatter and seek out all the families of the eunuchs sparing none In that slaughter many beardless men were killed in errorCao Cao set himself to extinguish the fires He then begged Empress He to undertake the direction of affairs and soldiers were sent to pursue Zhang Rang and rescue the young Emperor and the young Prince of ChenliuMeanwhile Zhang Rang and Duan Gui had hustled away the Emperor and the Prince They burst through the smoke and fire and traveled without stopping till they reached the Beimang Hills It was then the third watch They heard a great shouting behind them and saw soldiers in pursuitTheir leader Min Gong a commander in Henan was shouting Traitors stop stop Zhang Rang seeing that he was lost jumped into the river where he was drownedThe two boys ignorant of the meaning of all this confusion and terrified out of their senses dared not utter a cry they crept in among the rank grass on the river bank and hidThe soldiers scattered in all directions but failed to find themSo they remained till the fourth watch shivering with cold from the drenching dew and very hungryThey lay down in the thick grass and wept in each others arms silently lest any one should discover themThis is no a place to stay in said Prince Xian we must find some way out So the two children knotted their clothes together and managed to crawl up the bankThey were in a thicket of thorn bushes and it was quite dark They could not see any pathThey were in despair when all at once millions of fireflies sprang up all about them and circled in the air in front of the EmperorGod is helping us said Prince XianThey followed whither the fireflies led and gradually got into a roadThey walked till their feet were too sore to go further when seeing a heap of straw near the road they crept to it and lay downThis heap of straw was close to a farm houseIn the night as the farmer was sleeping he saw in a vision two bright red suns drop behind his dwelling Alarmed by the portent he hastily dressed and went forth to look about him Then he saw a bright light shooting up from a heap of straw He hastened thither and then saw two youths lying behind itTo what household do you belong young gentlemen asked the farmerThe Emperor was too frightened to reply but his companion said He is the Emperor There was a revolution in the palace and we ran awayI am his brother Prince of Chenliu The farmer bowed again and again and said My name is Sui Lie My brother Sui Yi is the former minister of the interior My brother was disgusted with the behavior of the eunuchs and so resigned and hid away here The two lads were taken into the farm and their host on his knees served them with refreshmentIt has been said that Min Gong had gone in pursuit of Eunuch Duan GuiBy and by Min Gong overtook Duan Gui and cried Where is the Emperor He disappearedI do not know where he is Min Gong slew Duan Gui and hung the bleeding head on his horses neck Then he sent his troops searching in all directions and he rode off by himself on the same quest Presently he came to the farmSui Lie seeing what hung on his horses neck questioned him and satisfied with his story led him to the Emperor The meeting was affecting all were moved to tearsThe state cannot be without its ruler said Min GongI pray Your Majesty return to the city At the farm they had but one sorry nag and this they saddled for the EmperorThe young Prince was taken on Min Gongs charger And thus they left the farmNot beyond one mile from the farm they fell in with other officials and several hundred guards and soldiers made up an imposing cavalcade In the cavalcade were Wang Yun Minister of the Interior Yang Biao Regent Marshal Chunyu Qiong Commander of the Left Army Zhao Meng Commander of the Right Army Bao Xin Commander of the Rear Army and Yuan Shao Commander of the Central ArmyTears were shed freely as the ministers met their EmperorA man was sent on in front to the capital there to expose the head of Eunuch Duan Gui As soon as they could they placed the Emperor on a better steed and the young Prince had a horse to himself Thus the Emperor returned to Luoyang and so it happened after all as the street childrens ditty ranThough the emperor doesnt rule though the prince no office fills Yet a brilliant cavalcade comes along from Beimang HillsThe cavalcade had not proceeded far when they saw coming towards them a large body of soldiers with fluttering banners hiding the sun and raising a huge cloud of dustThe officials turned pale and the Emperor was greatly alarmed Yuan Shao rode out in advanceWho are you said Yuan ShaoFrom under the shade of an embroidered banner rode out a general saying Do you have the Emperor The Emperor was too panic stricken to respond but the Prince of Chenliu rode to the front and cried Who are you Dong Zhuo Imperial Protector of Xizhou Have you come to protect the Chariot or to steal it said Prince XianI have come to protect said Dong ZhuoIf that is so the Emperor is here why do you not dismount Dong Zhuo hastily dismounted and made obeisance on the left of the road Then Prince Xian spoke graciously to himFrom first to last the Prince had carried himself most perfectly so that Dong Zhuo in his heart admired his behavior and then arose the first desire to set aside the Emperor in favor of the Prince of ChenliuThey reached the Palace the same day and there was an affecting interview with Empress HeBut when they had restored order in the palace the Imperial Hereditary Seal the special seal of the Emperor was missingDong Zhuo camped without the walls but every day he was to be seen in the streets with an escort of mailed soldiers so that the common people were in a state of constant trepidationHe also went in and out of the Palace careless of all the rules of proprietyImperial Commander Bao Xin spoke of Dong Zhuos behavior to Yuan Shao saying This man harbors some evil design and should be removed Nothing can he done till the government is more settled said Yuan ShaoThen Bao Xin saw Minister of the Interior Wang Yun and asked what he thoughtLet us talk it over was the replyBao Xin said no more but he left the capital and retired to the Taishan MountainsDong Zhuo induced the soldiers of the two brothers He Jin and He Miao to join his command and privately spoke to his adviser Li Ru about deposing the Emperor in favor of the Prince of Chenliu The government is really without a head there can be no better time than this to carry out your plan Delay will spoil allTomorrow assemble the officials in the Wenming Garden and address them on the subjectPut all opponents to death and your prestige is settled So spoke Li Ru and the words pleased Dong Zhuo mightilySo the next day Dong Zhuo spread a feast and invited many guestsAs all the officers went in terror of him no one dared be absentDong Zhuo himself rode up to the garden last of all and took his place with his sword girded onWhen the wine had gone round several times Dong Zhuo stopped the service and the music and began to speak I have something to say listen quietly all of you All turned towards himThe emperor is lord of all and if he lacks dignity and behaves in an unseemly manner he is no fitting inheritor of the ancestral prerogativesHe who is now on the throne is a weakling inferior to the Prince of Chenliu in intelligence and love of learningThe Prince is in every way fitted for the throne I desire to depose the Emperor and set up the Prince in his placeWhat think you The assembly listened in perfect silence none daring at first to utter a word of dissentBut one dared for suddenly a guest stood up in his place smote the table and criedWho are you that you dare utter such bold wordsThe Emperor is the son of the lawful consort and has done no wrong Why then should he be deposedAre you a rebel The speaker was Ding Yuan Imperial Protector of JingzhouDong Zhuo glared at Ding Yuan roaring There is life for those who are with me death for those against Dong Zhuo drew his sword and made for the objectorBut the watchful Li Ru had noticed standing behind Ding Yuan a particularly dangerous looking henchman of his who was now handling his halberd threateningly and whose eyes were blazing with angerSo Li Ru hastily interposed saying But this is the banquet chamber and state affairs should be left outsideThe matters can be fully discussed tomorrow His fellow guests persuaded Ding Yuan to leave and after his departure Dong Zhuo said Is what I said just and reasonable You are mistaken Illustrious Sir said Lu Zhi Of old Emperor Tai Jia of the Shang Dynasty was unenlightenedWherefore the sage Minister Yi Yin immured him in the Tung Palace till he reformedLater Prince Changyi ascended the throne and in twentyseven days he committed more than three thousand categorical faults Wherefore Regent Marshal Huo Guang declared in the ancestral temple that Prince Changyi was deposedOur present Emperor is young but he is intelligent benevolent and wise He has not committed a single faultYou Sir are an imperial protector of a frontier region and not a metropolitan official and have had no experience in state administrationNeither have you the pure intentions of Yi Yin and Huo Guang which qualified their actionsWithout that justification such an act is presumption Dong Zhuo angrily drew his sword to slay the bold Lu Zhi but two other officials remonstratedMinister Lu Zhi is the cynosure of the whole country and his violent death would stir the hearts of all humans said Court Counselors Cai Yong and Peng BoDong Zhuo then stayed his handThen said Wang Yun A great question like the deposition and substitution of emperors is not one to be decided after a wine party Let it be put off till another time So the guests dispersedDong Zhuo stood at the gate with drawn sword watching them depart Standing thus Dong Zhuo noticed a spearman galloping to and fro on a fiery steed and asked Li Ru who that wasThat is Lu Bu the adopted son of Ding YuanYou must keep out of his way my lord Dong Zhuo went inside the gate so that he could not be seenBut next day a man reported to him that Ding Yuan had come out of the city with a small army and was challenging to a battleDong Zhuo with his army went forth to accept the challengeAnd the two armies were drawn up in proper array Lu Bu was a conspicuous figure in the forefront His hair was arranged under a handsome headdress of gold and he had donned a embroidered thousandflower fighting robe a pheasanttailed helmet and breast plate and round his waist was a gleaming jade belt with a lions head clasp With spear set he rode close behind his master Ding Yuan Ding Yuan riding forth pointing his finger at Dong Zhuo began to revile himUnhappy indeed was this state when the eunuchs became so powerful that the people were as if trodden into the mire under their feet Now you devoid of the least merit dare to talk of deposing the rightful emperor and setting up anotherThis is to desire rebellion and no less Dong Zhuo could not reply for Lu Bu eager for the fight rode straight at himDong Zhuo fled and Ding Yuans army came onThe battle went in Ding Yuans favor and the beaten troops retired ten miles and made another camp Here Dong Zhuo called his officers to a councilThis Lu Bu is a marvel said Dong ZhuoIf he were only on my side I would defy the whole world At this a man advanced saying Be content O my lordI am a fellow villager of his and know him well his bravery his prowess his cupidity and his unscrupulousnessWith this little blarneying tongue of mine I can persuade him to put up his hands and come over to your side Dong Zhuo was delighted and gazed admiringly at the speakerIt was Li Su a general in the Imperial Tiger ArmyWhat arguments will you use with him asked Dong ZhuoYou have a fine horse RedHare one of the best ever bred I must have this steed and gold and pearls to win his heart Then will I go and persuade himHe will certainly abandon Ding Yuans service for yours What think you said Dong Zhuo to his adviser Li RuOne cannot grudge a horse to win an empire was the replySo they grave Li Su what he demandeda thousand ounces of gold ten strings of beautiful pearls a jeweled belt and RedHareand these accompanied Li Su on his visit to his fellow villagerLi Su reached the camp and said to the guard Please tell General Lu Bu that a very old friend has come to visit him He was admitted forthwithWorthy brother have you been well since we last met greeted Li Su while bowingHow long it is since we last saw each other replied Lu Bu bowing in returnAnd where are you now I am a general in the Imperial Tiger ArmyWhen I learned you were a strong supporter of the Throne I could not say how I rejoicedI have come now to present to you a really fine horse a fivehundredmileaday horse one that crosses rivers and goes up mountains as if they were the level plain Its name is RedHareIt will be a fitting aid to your valor Lu Bu bade his guards lead out the horseIt was of a uniform color like glowing sun red not a hair of another colorIt measured ten spans from head to tail and from hoof to neck eight spansWhen it neighed the sound filled the empyrean and shook the oceanMark ye the steed swift and tireless see the dust spurned by his hoofs rising in clouds Now it swims the river anon climbs the hill rending the purple mist asunder Scornful it breaks the rein shakes from its head the jeweled bridle It is as a fiery dragon descending from the highest heavenLu Bu was delighted with the horse and said What return can I hope to make for such a creature What return can I hope forI came to you out of a sense of what is right replied Li SuWine was brought in and they drankWe have seen very little of each other but I am constantly meeting your honorable father said Li SuYou are drunk said Lu BuMy father has been dead for years Not so I spoke of Ding Yuan the man of the day Lu Bu startedYes I am with him but only because I can do no better Sir your talent is higher than the heavens deeper than the seas Who in all the world does not bow before your nameFame and riches and honors are yours for the takingAnd you say you can do no better than remain a subordinate If I could only find a master to serve said Lu BuThe clever bird chooses the branch whereon to perch the wise servant selects the master to serveSeize the chance when it comes for repentance ever comes too late Now you are in the governmentWho think you is really the bravest of all asked Lu BuI despise the whole lot except Dong Zhuo He is one who respects wisdom and reveres scholarship he is discriminating in his rewards and punishmentsSurely he is destined to be a really great man Lu Bu said I wish that I could serve him but there is no way I fear Then Li Su produced his pearls and gold and the jeweled belt and laid them out before his hostWhat is this What does it mean said Lu Bu Send away the attendants requested Li SuAnd he went on Dong Zhuo has long respected your valor and sent these by my handRedHare was also from him But if he loves me like this what can I do in return Li Su said If a stupid fellow like me can be a general in the Imperial Tiger Army it is impossible to say what honors await you I am sorry I can offer him no service worth mentioning Li Su said There is one service you can do and an extremely easy one to perform but you would not render that Lu Bu pondered long in silence then he said I might slay Ding Yuan and bring over his soldiers to Dong Zhuos side what think you of that If you would do that there could be no greater serviceBut such a thing must be done quickly And Lu Bu promised his friend that he would do the deed and come over on the morrow So Li Su took his leaveThat very night at the second watch Lu Bu entered sword in hand into his masters tent He found Ding Yuan reading by the light of a solitary candleSeeing who came in Ding Yuan said My son what is afoot I am a bold hero said Lu BuDont you think I am willing to be a son of yours Why this change Lu Bu As a reply Lu Bu made one cut and Ding Yuans head fell to the earthThen Lu Bu called the attendants and said He was an unjust man and I have slain himLet those who back me stay the others may depart Most ran awayNext day with the head of the murdered man as his gift Lu Bu betook himself to Li Su who led him to Dong ZhuoDong Zhuo received him with a warm welcome and had wine set before himYour coming is welcome as the gentle dew to the parched grass said Dong ZhuoLu Bu made Dong Zhuo seat himself and then made an obeisance saying Pray let me bow to you as my adopted father Dong Zhuo gave his newly won ally gold and armor and silken robes and spread the feast of welcome They then separatedThence Dong Zhuos power and influence increased rapidly He gave the lordship of Hu  and the rank Commander of the Left Army to his brother Dong Min He appointed Lu Bu Lord of Luoyang Commander of Capital District and Commander of the Right Army Dong Zhuo made himself Commander of the Central ArmyThe adviser Li Ru never ceased from urging him to carry out the design of deposing the young EmperorThe now allpowerful Dong Zhuo prepared a banquet in the capital at which all the officers of state were guests He also bade Lu Bu post a company of armed men right and left ready for action The feast began and several courses were served with nothing to distinguish that banquet from any otherThen suddenly the host arose and drew his sword saying He who is above us being weak and irresolute is unfit for the duties of his high placeWherefore I as of old did Yi Yin and Huo Guang will set aside this Emperor giving him the title of Prince of Hongnong and I will place on the throne the present Prince of Chenliu And those who do not support me will suffer death Fear seized them in its grip and they were silent all but Yuan Shao who said The Emperor was innocent of any fault and to set him aside in favor of a commoner was rebellion and nothing else The empire is in my hands cried Dong Zhuo and when I choose to do this thing who will dare say nay Think you my sword lacks an edge If your sword is sharp mine is never blunt said Yuan Shao as his sword flashed out of the sheathThe two men stood face to face amid the feastersWhen Ding Yuan by treacherous murder died The loss was great to Yuan Shaos sideThe fate of Yuan Shao will be disclosed in later chapters CHAPTER  The Deposition Of The Emperor Prince Of Chenliu Becomes Emperor Schemes Against Dong Zhuo Cao Cao Presents A SwordDong Zhuo was on the point of slaying Yuan Shao but Li Ru checked him saying You must not kill rashly while the business hangs in the balance Yuan Shao his sword still unsheathed left the assemblyHe hung up the seals of his office at the east gate and went to Jizhou RegionDong Zhuo said to Imperial Guardian Yuan Wei Your nephew behaved improperly but I pardon him for your sake what think you of my scheme What you think is right was the replyIf any one opposes the great scheme he will be dealt with by military law said Dong ZhuoThe ministers thoroughly dreaded promised obedience and the feast came to an endDong Zhuo asked Counselor Zhou Bi and Commandant Wu Qiong what they thought of the flight of Yuan ShaoZhou Bi said He left in a state of great angerIn such a state of excitement much harm may ensue to the present state of affairs especially as the Yuan family have been noted for their high offices for four generations and their proteges and dependents are everywhereIf they assemble bold spirits and call up their clients all the valiant warriors will be in arms and the east region of the Huashang Mountains will be lost You would better pardon Yuan Shao and give him a postHe will be glad at being forgiven and will do no harm Wu Qiong said Yuan Shao is fond of scheming but he fails in decision and so is not to be fearedBut it would be well to give him rank and thus win popular favor Dong Zhuo followed this advice and thereupon sent a messenger to offer Yuan Shao the governorship of BohaiOn the first day of the ninth month the Emperor was invited to proceed to the Hall of Virtue where was a great assembly of officialsThere Dong Zhuo sword in hand faced the gathering and said The Emperor is a weakling unequal to the burden of ruling this landNow listen ye to the document I have prepared And Li Ru read as followsThe dutiful Emperor Ling too soon left his peopleThe emperor is the cynosure of all the people of this landUpon the present Emperor Bian the Heaven has conferred but small gifts in dignity and deportment he is deficient and in mourning he is remiss Only the most complete virtue can grace imperial dignityEmpress He has trained him improperly and the whole state administration has fallen into confusionEmpress Dong died suddenly and no one knew whyThe doctrine of the three bondsHeaven Earth and Humanand the continuity of Heaven and Earth interdependence have both been injured But Liu Xian Prince of Chenliu is sage and virtuous beside being of handsome exterior He conforms to all the rules of proprietyhis mourning is sincere and his speech is always correctEulogies of him fill the empireHe is well fitted for the great duty of consolidating the rule of Han Now therefore the Emperor is deposed and created Prince of Hongnong and Empress He retires from the administration I pray the Prince of Chenliu to accept the throne in conformity with the decrees of Heaven and Earth the desires of people and the fulfillment of the hopes of humankind This having been read Dong Zhuo bade the attendants lead the Emperor down from the throne remove his seal and cause him to kneel facing the north styling himself faithful servant of the Throne and requesting commandsMoreover Dong Zhuo bade Empress He strip off her royal dress of ceremony and await the imperial commandBoth victims of this oppression wept bitterly and every minister present was deeply affectedOne minister put his discontent into words crying The false Dong Zhuo is the author of this insult which I will risk my life to wipe away And with this he rushed at Dong Zhuo threatening with his ivory baton of officeIt was Secretary Ding GuanDong Zhuo had Ding Guan removed and summarily put to deathBefore his death Ding Guan ceased not to rail at the oppressor nor was he frightened at deathThe rebel Dong Zhuo conceived the foul design To thrust the King aside and wrong his line With folded arms the courtiers stood save one Ding Guan who dared to cry that wrong was doneThen the Emperor designate Prince of Chenliu went to the upper part of the hall to receive congratulationsAfter this the late Emperornow Prince of Hongnong his mother and the Imperial Consort Lady Tang were removed to the Palace of Forever Calm The entrance gates were locked against all comers It was pitifulThere was the young emperor after reigning less than half a year deposed and another put in his placeThe new Emperor was Liu Xian the second son of the late Emperor LingHe was nine years of age five years younger than his deposed brotherThe new reignstyle was changed to Inauguration of Tranquillity the first year Becoming the Prime Minister Dong Zhuo was most powerful and arrogant When he bowed before the Throne he did not declare his name in going to court he did not hasten Booted and armed he entered the reception halls He amassed a wealth exceeding any othersHis adviser Li Ru impressed upon Dong Zhuo constantly to employ people of reputation so that he should gain public esteemSo when they told him Cai Yong was a man of talent Dong Zhuo summoned him But Cai Yong would not goDong Zhuo sent a message to him that if he did not come he and his whole clan should be exterminatedThen Cai Yong gave in and appearedDong Zhuo was very gracious to him and promoted him thrice in a month Cai Yong became High Minister Such was the generosity of the tyrantMeanwhile the deposed ruler his mother and his consort were immured in the Palace of Forever Calm and found their daily supplies gradually diminishingThe deposed Emperor wept incessantlyOne day a pair of wallows gliding to and fro moved him to verse Spring and the green of the tender grass Flushes with joy as the swallows pass The wayfarers pause by the rippling stream And their eyes will new born gladness gleam With lingering gaze the roofs I see Of the palace that one time sheltered me But those whom I sheltered in all righteousness Lets not stay in silence when the days pass uselessThe messenger sent by Dong Zhuo from time to time to the palace for news of the prisoners got hold of this poem and showed it to his master So he shows his resentment by writing poems ehA fair excuse to put them all out of the way said Dong ZhuoLi Ru was sent with ten men into the palace to consummate the deed The three were in one of the upper rooms when Li Ru arrived The Emperor shuddered when the maid announced the visitors name Presently Li Ru entered and offered a cup of poisoned wine to the EmperorThe Emperor asked what this meantSpring is the season of blending and harmonious interchange and the Prime Minister sends a cup of the wine of longevity said Li RuIf it be the wine of longevity you may share it too said Empress He Then Li Ru became brutally frankYou will not drink asked heHe called the men with daggers and cords and bade the Emperor look at themThe cup or these said he Then said Lady Tang Let the handmaiden drink in place of her lord Spare the mother and her son I pray And who may you be to die for a prince said Li RuThen he presented the cup to the Empress once more and bade her drink She railed against her brother the feckless He Jin the author of all this trouble She would not drinkNext Li Ru approached the EmperorLet me say farewell to my mother begged he and he did so in these lines The heaven and earth are changed Alas the sun and the moon leave their courses I once the center of all eyes am driven to the farthest confinesOppressed by an arrogant minister my life nears its end Everything fails me and vain are my falling tears Lady Tang sangHeaven is to be rent asunder Earth to fall away I handmaid of an Emperor would grieve if I followed him notWe have come to the parting of ways the quick and the dead walk not together AlasI am left alone with the grief in my heart When they had sung these lines they fell weeping into each others arms The Prime Minister is awaiting my report said Li Ru and you delay too longThink you that there is any hope of succor The Empress broke into another fit of railing The rebel forces us to death mother and son and Heaven has abandoned usBut you the tool of his crime will assuredly perish Thereupon Li Ru grew more angry laid hands on the Empress and threw her out of the windowThen he bade the soldiers strangle Lady Tang and forced the lad to swallow the wine of deathLi Ru reported the achievement to his master who bade them bury the victims without the city After this Dong Zhuos behavior was more atrocious than beforeHe spent his nights in the Palace defiled the imperial concubines there and even slept on the Dragon CouchOnce he led his soldiers out of the city to Yangcheng when the villagers men and women were assembled from all sides for the annual spring festival His troops surrounded the place and plundered itThey took away booty by the cart load and women prisoners and more than one thousand severed heads The procession returned to Capital Luoyang and published a story that they had obtained a great victory over some rebelsThey burned the heads beneath the walls and the women and jewelry were shared out among the soldiersA general named Wu Fu was disgusted at this ferocity and sought a chance to slay Dong Zhuo Wu Fu constantly wore a breastplate underneath his court dress and carried in conceal a sharp daggerOne day when Dong Zhuo came to court Wu Fu met him on the steps and tried to stab him But Dong Zhuo was a very powerful man and held Wu Fu off till Lu Bu came to his helpLu Bu struck down the assailantWho told you to rebel said Dong ZhuoWu Fu glared at him and cried You are not my prince I am not your minister where is the rebellionYour crimes fill the heavens and every man would slay youI am sorry I cannot tear you asunder with chariots to appease the wrath of the world Dong Zhuo bade the guards take him out and hack him to piecesWu Fu only ceased railing as he ceased to liveThat loyal servant of the latter days of HanHis valor was high as the Heavens in all ages unequaled In the court itself would he slay the rebel great is his fame Throughout all time will people call him a heroThereafter Dong Zhuo always went well guardedAt Bohai Yuan Shao heard of Dong Zhuos misuse of power and sent a secret letter to Minister of the Interior Wang YunThat rebel Dong Zhuo outrages Heaven and has deposed his rulerCommon people dare not speak of him that is understandable Yet you suffer his aggressions as if you knew naught of them How then are you a dutiful and loyal ministerI have assembled an army and desire to sweep clean the royal habitation but I dare not lightly begin the taskIf you are willing then find an opportunity to plot against this manIf you would use force I am at your command The letter arrived but Wang Yun could see no chance to plot against Dong ZhuoOne day while among the throng in attendance mostly people of long service Wang Yun said to his colleagues This is my birthday I pray you come to a little party in my humble cot this evening We certainly will they cried and wish you long life That night the tables were spread in an inner room and his friends gathered thereWhen the wine had made a few rounds the host suddenly covered his face and began to weepThe guests were aghast Sir on your birthday too why do you weep said they It is not my birthday replied Wang YunBut I wished to call you together and I feared lest Dong Zhuo should suspect so I made that the excuseThis man insults the Emperor and does as he wishes so that the imperial prerogatives are in imminent perilI think of the days when our illustrious founder destroyed the Qin annihilated Chu and obtained the empireWho could have foreseen this day when that Dong Zhuo has subjugated all to his willThat is why I weep Then they all wept with himSeated among the guests however was Cao Cao who did not join in the weeping but clapped his hands and laughed aloud If all the officers of the government weep till dawn and from dawn weep till dark will that slay Dong Zhuo said Cao Cao Wang Yun turned on him angrilyYour forbears ate the bounty of the Hans do you feel no gratitudeYou can laugh I laughed at the absurdity of an assembly like this being unable to compass the death of one manFoolish and incapable as I am I will cut off his head and hang it at the gate as an offering to the people Wang Yun left his seat and went over to Cao CaoThese later days Cao Cao continued I have bowed my head to Dong Zhuo with the sole desire of finding a chance to destroy himNow he begins to trust me and so I can approach him sometimesYou have a sword with seven precious jewels which I would borrow and I will go into his palace and kill himI care not if I die for it What good fortune for the world that this is so said Wang YunWith this Wang Yun himself poured out a goblet for Cao Cao who drained it and swore an oathAfter this the treasured sword was brought out and given to Cao Cao who hid it under his dress He finished his wine took leave of the guests and left the hall Before long the others dispersedThe next day Cao Cao with this short sword girded on came to the palace of the Prime Minister Where is the Prime Minister asked heIn the small guest room replied the attendantsSo Cao Cao went in and found his host seated on a couch Lu Bu was at his sideWhy so late Cao Cao said Dong ZhuoMy horse is out of condition and slow replied Cao Cao Dong Zhuo turned to his henchman Lu BuSome good horses have come in from the westYou go and pick out a good one as a present for him And Lu Bu leftThis traitor is doomed thought Cao CaoHe ought to have struck then but Cao Cao knew Dong Zhuo was very powerful and he was afraid to act he wanted to make sure of his blowNow Dong Zhuos corpulence was such that he could not remain long sitting so he rolled over couch and lay face inwardsNow is the time thought the assassin and he gripped the good sword firmlyBut just as Cao Cao was going to strike Dong Zhuo happened to look up and in a mirror he saw the reflection of Cao Cao behind him with a sword in the hand What are you doing Cao Cao said Dong Zhuo turning suddenlyAnd at that moment Lu Bu came along leading a horseCao Cao in a flurry dropped on his knees and said I have a precious sword here which I wish to present to Your Benevolence Dong Zhuo took itIt was a fine blade over a foot in length inlaid with the seven precious signs and very keena fine sword in very truthDong Zhuo handed the weapon to Lu Bu while Cao Cao took off the sheath which he also gave to Lu BuThen they went out to look at the horse Cao Cao was profuse in his thanks and said he would like to try the horse So Dong Zhuo bade the guards bring saddle and bridleCao Cao led the creature outside leapt into the saddle laid on his whip vigorously and galloped away eastwardLu Bu said Just as I was coming up it seemed to me as if that fellow was going to stab you only a sudden panic seized him and he presented the weapon instead I suspected him too said Dong ZhuoJust then Li Ru came in and they told himCao Cao has no family here in the capital but lodges quite alone and not far away said Li RuSend for him If he comes forthwith the sword was meant as a gift but if he makes any excuses he had bad intentionsAnd you can arrest him They sent four prison warders to call Cao CaoThey were absent a long time and then came back saying Cao Cao had not returned to his lodging but rode in hot haste out of the eastern gateTo the gate commanders questions he replied that he was on a special message for the Prime MinisterHe went off at full speed His conscience pricked him and so he fled there is no doubt that he meant assassination said Li RuAnd I trusted him so well said Dong Zhuo in a rage There must be a conspiracy afootWhen we catch him we shall know all about it said Li RuLetters and pictures of the fugitive Cao Cao were sent everywhere with orders to catch himA large reward in money was offered and a patent of nobility while those who sheltered him would be held to share his guiltCao Cao traveled in hot haste toward Qiao his home countyOn the road at Zhongmou he was recognized by the guards at the gate and made prisoner They took him to the MagistrateCao Cao declared he was a merchant named Huang FuThe Magistrate scanned his face most closely and remained in deep thought Presently the Magistrate said When I was at the capital seeking a post I knew you as Cao CaoWhy do you try to conceal your identity The Magistrate ordered Cao Cao to the prison till the morrow when he could send Cao Cao to the capital and claim the rewardHe gave the soldiers wine and food as a rewardAbout midnight the Magistrate sent a trusty servant to bring the prisoner into his private rooms for interrogationThey say the Prime Minister treated you well why did you try to harm him said MagistrateHow can swallows and sparrows understand the flight of the crane and the wild gooseI am your prisoner and to be sent to the capital for a rewardWhy so many questions The Magistrate sent away the attendants and turning to the prisoner said Do not despise meI am no mere hireling only I have not yet found the lord to serve Said Cao Cao My ancestors enjoyed the bounty of Han and should I differ from a bird or a beast if I did not desire to repay them with gratitudeI have bowed the knee to Dong Zhuo that thereby I might find an opportunity against him and so remove this evil from the stateI have failed for this timeSuch is the will of heaven And where are you going Home to my countyThence I shall issue a summons calling all the bold spirits to come with forces to kill the tyrantThis is my desire Thereupon the Magistrate himself loosened the bonds of the prisoner led him to the upper seat and bowed saying I am called Chen GongMy aged mother and family are in the east county of DongjunI am deeply affected by your loyalty and uprightness and I will abandon my office and follow you Cao Cao was delighted with this turn of affairsChen Gong at once collected some money for the expenses of their journey and gave Cao Cao a different dress Then each took a sword and rode away toward QiaoThree days later at eventide they reached ChenggaoCao Cao pointed with his whip to a hamlet deep in the woods and said There lives my uncle Lu Boshe a swornbrother of my fatherSuppose we go and ask news of my family and seek shelter for the night Excellent said his companion Chen Gong and they rode over dismounted at the farm gate and enteredLu Boshe greeted them and said to Cao Cao I hear the government has sent stringent orders on all sides to arrest you Your father has gone into hiding to ChenliuHow has this all come about Cao Cao told him and said Had it not been for this man here with me I should have been already hacked to pieces Lu Boshe bowed low to Chen Gong saying You are the salvation of the Cao familyBut be at ease and rest I will find you a bed in my humble cottage Lu Boshe then rose and went into the inner chamber where he stayed a long timeWhen he came out he said There is no good wine in the houseI am going over to the village to get some for you And he hastily mounted his donkey and rode awayThe two travelers sat a long time Suddenly they heard at the back of the house the sound of sharpening a knifeCao Cao said to Chen Gong He is not my real uncle I am beginning to doubt the meaning of his going off Let us listen So they silently stepped out into a straw hut at the backPresently some one said Bind before killing eh As I thought said Cao Cao now unless we strike first we shall be taken Suddenly Cao Cao and Chen Gong dashed in sword in hand and slew the whole household male and female in all eight personsAfter this they searched the house In the kitchen they found a pig bound ready to kill You have made a huge mistake said Chen Gong and we have slain honest folks Cao Cao and Chen Gong at once mounted and rode awaySoon they met their host Lu Boshe coming home and over the saddle in front of him they saw two vessels of wine In his hands he carried fruit and vegetables Why are you going Sirs Lu Boshe called to themAccused people dare not linger said Cao Cao But I have bidden them kill a pig Why do you refuse my poor hospitalityI pray you ride back with me Cao Cao paid no heed urging his horse forward But he suddenly drew his sword and rode back after Lu Boshe Who is that coming along called Cao CaoLu Boshe turned and looked back and Cao Cao at the same instant cut Lu Boshe down Chen Gong was frightened You were wrong enough before cried Chen GongWhat now is this When he got home and saw his family killed think you he would bear it patientlyIf he had raised an alarm and followed us we should have been killed To kill deliberately is very wrong said Chen GongI would rather betray the world than let the world betray me was the replyChen Gong only thoughtThey rode on some distance by moonlight and presently knocked up an inn for shelterHaving first fed their horses Cao Cao was soon asleep but Chen Gong lay thinkingI took him for a true man and left all to follow him but he is as cruel as a wolf If I spare him he will do more harm later thought Chen GongAnd Chen Gong rose intending to kill his companionIn his heart lie cruelty and venom he is no true man In nought does he differ from his enemy Dong ZhuoThe further fortunes of Cao Cao will be told in later chaptersCHAPTER  Cao Cao Appeals To The Powerful Lords The Three Brothers Fight Against Lu Bu At the close of the last chapter Chen Gong was about to slay Cao Cao But Chen Gong reflected I joined him to do righteous things Now if I killed him I would only do unrighteousness and the people would condemn meI rather leave in silence Rising from his bed before the sunrise Chen Gong mounted his horse and rode away eastward to his home county of Dongjun Cao Cao awoke with the day and missed his companionThought he Chen Gong thinks me brutal because of a couple of egoistic phrases I used and so he has goneI ought to push on too and not linger here So Cao Cao traveled as quickly as possible toward QiaoWhen he saw his father he related what had happened and said he wanted to dispose of all the family property and enlist soldiers with the moneyOur possessions are but small said his father and not enough to do anything withHowever there is a graduate here one Wei Hong careless of wealth but careful of virtue whose family is very rich With his help we might hope for success A feast was prepared and Wei Hong was invited Cao Cao made him a speech The Hans have lost their lordship and Dong Zhuo is really a tyrant He flouts his prince and is cruel to the people who gnash their teeth with rageI would restore the Hans but my means are insufficientSir I appeal to your loyalty and public spirit Wei Hong replied I have long desired this but so far have not found a person fit to undertake the task Since you Cao Cao have so noble a desire I willingly devote all my property to the cause This was joyful news and the call to arms was forthwith prepared and sent far and nearSo they established a corps of volunteers and set up a large white recruiting banner with the words Loyalty and Honor inscribed thereonThe response was rapid and volunteers came in like rain drops in numberOne day came a certain Yue Jin from Yangping and another Li Dian from Julu These two were appointed to Cao Caos personal staffAnother was one Xiahou Dun from Qiao He was descended from Xiahou Ying of oldXiahou Dun had been trained from his early boyhood to use the spear and the clubWhen only fourteen he had been attached to a certain masterinarms One day one person spoke disrespectfully of his master and Xiahou Dun killed that person For this deed however he had to flee and had been an exile for some timeNow he came to offer his services accompanied by his cousin Xiahou Yuan Each brought a thousand trained soldiersReally these two were brothers of Cao Cao by birth since Cao Caos father was originally of the Xiahou family and had only been adopted into the Cao familyA few days later came Cao Caos two cousins Cao Ren and Cao Hong each with one thousand followersThese two were accomplished horsemen and trained in the use of armsThen drill began and Wei Hong spent his treasure freely in buying clothing armor flags and bannersFrom all sides poured in gifts of grainWhen Yuan Shao received Cao Caos call to arms he collected all those under his command to the number of thirty thousandThen he marched from Bohai to Qiao to take the oath to Cao Cao Next a manifesto was issuedCao Cao and his associates moved by a sense of duty now make this proclamation Dong Zhuo defies Heaven and Earth He is destroying the state and injuring his princeHe pollutes the Palace and oppresses the peopleHe is vicious and cruel His crimes are heaped upNow we have received a secret command to call up soldiers and we are pledged to cleanse the empire and destroy the evildoersWe will raise a volunteer army and exert all our efforts to maintain the dynasty and succor the peopleRespond to this O Nobles by mustering your soldiers Many from every side answered the summons as the following list shows Governor of NanyangYuan Shu Imperial Protector of Jizhou RegionHan Fu Imperial Protector of Yuzhou RegionKong Zhou Imperial Protector of Yanzhou RegionLiu Dai Governor of HeneiWang Kuang Governor of ChenliuZhang Miao Governor of DongjunQiao Mao Governor of ShanyangYuan Yi  Lord of JibeiBao Xin Governor of BeihaiKong Rong Governor of Guangling Zhang Chao Imperial Protector of Xuzhou RegionTao Qian Governor of XiliangMa Teng  Governor of BeipingGongsun Zan Governor of ShangdangZhang Yang Governor of ChangshaSun Jian Governor of BohaiYuan ShaoThese contingents varied in size from ten thousand to thirty thousand but each was complete in itself with its officers civil and military and battleleaders They were heading for Capital LuoyangThe Governor of Beiping Gongsun Zan while on his way with his force of fifteen thousand passed through the county of PingyuanThere he saw among the mulberry trees a yellow flag under which marched a small companyWhen they drew nearer he saw the leader was Liu BeiGood brother what do you here asked Gongsun ZanYou were kind to me once and on your recommendation I was made the magistrate of this county I heard you were passing through and came to salute you May I pray you my elder brother enter into the city and rest your steed Who are these two said Gongsun Zan pointing to Liu Beis brothersThese are Guan Yu and Zhang Fei my sworn brothers Were they fighting with you against the Yellow Scarves rebels asked Gongsun Zan All my success was due to their efforts said Liu BeiAnd what offices do they fill Guan Yu is a mounted archer Zhang Fei is a foot archer Thus are able humans buried said Gongsun Zan sighing Then he continuedAll the highest in the land are now going to destroy the rebellious Dong ZhuoMy brother you would do better to abandon this petty place and join us in restoring the House of Han Why not I should like to go said Liu BeiIf you had let me kill him that other time you would not have this trouble today said Zhang Fei to Liu Bei and Guan YuSince things are so let us pack and go said Guan Yu So without more ado the three brothers with a few horsemen joined Gongsun Zan and marched with him to join the great armyOne after another the feudal lords came up and encamped Their camps extended over seventy miles and moreWhen all had arrived Cao Cao as the head prepared sacrificial bullocks and horses and called all the lords to a great assembly to decide upon their plan of attackThen spoke the Governor of Henei Wang Kuang We have been moved by a noble sense of right to assemble hereNow must we first choose a chief and bind ourselves to obedience Then said Cao Cao For four generations the highest offices of state have been filled by members of the Yuan family and its clients and supporters are everywhere As a descendant of ancient ministers of Han Yuan Shao is a suitable man to be our chief lord Yuan Shao again and again declined this honorBut they all said It must be he there is no other And then he agreedSo the next day a threestory altar was built and they planted about it the banners of all parties in five directions of space And they set up white yaks tails and golden axes and emblems of military authority and the seals of leadership round aboutAll being ready the chief lord was invited to ascend the altar Clad in ceremonial robes and girded with a sword Yuan Shao reverently ascended There he burned incense made obeisance and recited the oathThe House of Han has fallen upon evil days the bands of imperial authority are loosenedThe rebel minister Dong Zhuo takes advantage of the discord to work evil and calamity falls upon honorable families Cruelty overwhelms simple folksWe Yuan Shao and his confederates fearing for the safety of the imperial prerogatives have assembled military forces to rescue the stateWe now pledge ourselves to exert our whole strength and act in concord to the utmost limit of our powers There must be no disconcerted or selfish actionShould any depart from this pledge may he lose his life and leave no posterityAlmighty Heaven and Universal Earth and the enlightened spirits of our forebears be ye our witnesses The reading finished Yuan Shao smeared the blood of the sacrifice upon his lips and upon the lips of those who shared the pledgeAll were deeply affected by the ceremony and many shed tearsThis done the chief lord was supported down from the high place and led to his tent where he took the highest place and the others arranged themselves according to rank and age Here wine was servedPresently Cao Cao said It behooves us all to obey the chief we have this day set up and support the stateThere must be no feeling of rivalry or superiority based upon numbers Yuan Shao replied Unworthy as I am yet as elected chief I must impartially reward merit and punish offensesLet each see to it that he obeys the national laws and the army preceptsThese must not be broken Only thy commands are to be obeyed cried allThen Yuan Shao said My brother Yuan Shu is appointed Chief of the Commissariat He must see to it that the whole camp is well suppliedBut the need of the moment is a van leader who shall go to River Si Pass and provoke a battleThe other forces must take up strategic positions in support Then the Governor of Changsha Sun Jian offered himself for this serviceYou are valiant and fierce and equal to this service said Yuan ShaoThe force under Sun Jian set out and presently came to River Si PassThe guard there sent a swift rider to the capital to announce to the Prime Minister the urgency of the situationEver since Dong Zhuo had secured his position he had given himself up to luxury without stintWhen the urgent news reached the adviser Li Ru he at once went to his master who much alarmed called a great councilLu Bu stood forth and said Do not fear my father I look upon all the lords beyond the passes as so much stubbleAnd with the warriors of our fierce army I will put every one of them to death and hang their heads at the gates of the capital With your aid I can sleep secure said Dong ZhuoBut some one behind Lu Bu broke in upon his speech saying An oxcleaver to kill a chickenThere is no need for the General to go I will cut off their heads as easily as I would take a thing out of my pocket Dong Zhuo looked up and his eyes rested on a stalwart man of fierce mien lithe and supple as a beastHe had round head like a leopard and shoulders like an apesHis name was Hua Xiong of GuanxiDong Zhuo rejoiced at Hua Xiongs bold words and at once appointed him Commander of Royal Cavaliers and gave him fifty thousand of horse and foot Hua Xiong and three other generalsLi Su Hu Zhen and Zhao Cenhastily moved toward River Si PassAmong the feudal lords Bao Xin the Lord of Jibei was jealous lest the chosen Van Leader Sun Jian should win too great honors Wherefore Bao Xin endeavored to meet the foe first and so he secretly dispatched his brother Bao Zhong with three thousand by a bye road As soon as this small force reached the Pass they offered battleFast reacting Hua Xiong at the head of five hundred armored horsemen swept down from the Pass crying Flee not rebel But Bao Zhong was afraid and turned backHua Xiong came on his arm rose the sword fell and Bao Zhong was cut down from his horse Most of Bao Zhongs company were capturedBao Zhongs head was sent to the Prime Ministers palace Hua Xiong was promoted to Commander in ChiefSun Jian presently approached the PassHe had four generalsCheng Pu of Tuyin whose weapon was an ironspined lance with snakeheaded blade Huang Gai of Lingling who wielded an iron whip Han Dang of Lingzhi using a heavy saber and Zu Mao of Wujun who fought with a pair of swordsCommander Sun Jian wore a helmet of fine silver wrapped round with a purple turban He carried across his body his sword of ancient ingot iron and rode a dappled horse with flowing mane Sun Jian advanced to the Pass and hailed the defenders crying Helpers of a villainBe quick to surrender Hua Xiong bade Hu Zhen lead five thousand out against Sun JianCheng Pu with the snaky lance rode out from Sun Jians side and engagedAfter a very few bouts Cheng Pu killed Hu Zhen on the spot by a thrust through the throat Then Sun Jian gave the signal for the main army to advanceBut from the Pass Hua Xiongs troops rained down showers of stones which proved too much for the assailants and they retired into camp at LiangdongSun Jian sent the report of victory to Yuan Shao Sun Jian also sent an urgent message for supplies to the commissaryBut a counselor said to the Controller Yuan Shu This Sun Jian is a very tiger in the eastShould he take the capital and destroy Dong Zhuo we should have a tiger in place of a wolfDo not send him grainStarve his troops and that will decide the fate of that army And Yuan Shu gave ears to the detractor and sent no grain or forage Soon Sun Jians hungry soldiers showed their disaffection by indiscipline and the spies bore the news to the defenders of the PassLi Ru made a plot with Hua Xiong saying We will launch tonight a speedy attack against Sun Jian in front and rear so that we can capture him Hua Xiong agreed and prepared for the attackSo the soldiers of the attacking force were told off and given a full meal At dark they left the Pass and crept by secret paths to the rear of Sun Jians campThe moon was bright and the wind coolThey arrived about midnight and the drums beat an immediate attack Sun Jian hastily donned his fighting gear and rode outHe ran straight into Hua Xiong and the two warriors engagedBut before they had exchanged many passes Li Rus army came up from behind and set fire to whatever would burnSun Jians army were thrown into confusion and fled in disorder A general melee ensued and soon only Zu Mao was left at Sun Jians side These two broke through the Pass and fledHua Xiong coming in hot pursuit Sun Jian took his bow and let fly two arrows in quick succession but both missedHe fitted a third arrow to the string but drew the bow so fiercely that it snapped He cast the bow to the earth and set off at full gallopThen spoke Zu Mao My lords purple turban is a mark that the rebels will too easily recognizeGive it to me and I will wear it So Sun Jian exchanged his silver helmet with the turban for his generals headpiece and the two men parted riding different waysThe pursuers looking only for the purple turban went after its wearer and Sun Jian escaped along a byroadZu Mao hotly pursued then tore off the headdress which he hung on the post of a halfburned house as he passed and dashed into the thick woodsHua Xiongs troops seeing the purple turban standing motionless dared not approach but they surrounded it on every side and shot at it with arrowsPresently they discovered the trick went up and seized it This was the moment that Zu Mao awaitedAt once he rushed forth his two swords whirling about and dashed at the leader But Hua Xiong was too quickWith a loud yell Hua Xiong slashed at Zu Mao and cut him down the horseHua Xiong and Li Ru continued the slaughter till the day broke and they led their troops back to the PassCheng Pu Huang Gai and Han Dang in time found their chief and the soldiers gatheredSun Jian was much grieved at the loss of Zu Mao When news of the disaster reached Yuan Shao he was greatly chagrined and called all the lords to a councilThey assembled and Gongsun Zan was the last to arriveWhen all were seated in the tent Yuan Shao said The brother of General Bao Xin disobeying the rules we made for our guidance rashly went to attack the enemy he was slain and with him many of our soldiersNow Sun Jian has been defeated Thus our fighting spirit has suffered and what is to be done Every one was silentLifting his eyes Yuan Shao looked round from one to another till he came to Gongsun Zan and then he remarked three men who stood behind Gongsun Zans seat They were of striking appearance as they stood there all three smiling cynicallyWho are those men behind you said Yuan ShaoGongsun Zan told Liu Bei to come forward and said This is Liu Bei Magistrate of Pingyuan and a brother of mine who shared my humble cottage when we were students It must be the Liu Bei who broke up the Yellow Scarves rebellion said Cao CaoIt is he said Gongsun Zan and he ordered Liu Bei to make his obeisance to the assembly to whom Liu Bei then related his services and his origin all in full detailSince he is of the Han line he should be seated said Yuan Shao and he bade Liu Bei sitLiu Bei modestly thanked him decliningSaid Yuan Shao This consideration is not for your fame and office I respect you as a scion of the imperial family So Liu Bei took his seat in the lowest place of the long line of lords And his two brothers with folded arms took their stations behind himEven as they were at this meeting came in a scout to say that Hua Xiong with a company of mailclad horsemen was coming down from the Pass They were flaunting Sun Jians captured purple turban on the end of a bamboo pole The enemy was soon hurling insults at those within the stockade and challenging them to fightWho dares go out to give battle said Yuan ShaoI will go said Yu She a renown general of Yuan Shu stepping forwardSo Yu She went and almost immediately one came back to say that Yu She had fallen in the third bout of Hua Xiong Fear began to lay its cold hand on the assemblyThen Imperial Protector Han Fu said I have a brave warrior among my army Pan Feng is his name and he could slay this Hua Xiong So Pan Feng was ordered out to meet the foeWith his great battleax in his hand Pan Feng mounted and rode forthBut soon came the direful tidings that General Pan Feng too had fallenThe faces of the gathering paled at thisWhat a pity my two able generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou are not hereThen should we have some one who would not fear this Hua Xiong said Yuan ShaoHe had not finished when from the lower end a voice tolled I will go take Hua Xiongs head and lay it before you here All turned to look at the speaker He was tall and had a long beard His eyes were those of a phoenix and his eyebrows thick and bushy like silkworms His face was a swarthy red and his voice deep as the sound of a great bellWho is he asked Yuan ShaoGongsun Zan told them it was Guan Yu brother of Liu BeiAnd what is he asked Yuan ShaoHe is in the train of Liu Bei as a mounted archer What An insult to us all roared Yuan Shu from his place Have we no leaderHow dare an archer speak thus before usLet us beat him forth But Cao Cao intervened Peace O Yuan ShuSince this man speaks great words he is certainly valiant Let him tryIf he fails then we may reproach him Hua Xiong will laugh at us if we send a mere archer to fight him said Yuan ShaoThis man looks no common person And how can the enemy know he is but a bowman said Cao CaoIf I fail then can you take my head spoke Guan YuCao Cao bade them heat some wine and offered a cup to Guan Yu as he went out Pour it out said Guan YuI shall return in a little space Guan Yu went with his weapon in his hand and vaulted into the saddleThose in the tent heard the fierce roll of the drums and then a mighty sound as if skies were falling and earth rising hills trembling and mountains tearing asunder And they were sore afraid And while they were listening with ears intent lothe gentle tinkle of horse bells and Guan Yu returned throwing at their feet the head of the slain leader their enemy Hua XiongThe wine was still warm This doughty deed has been celebrated in verseThe power of the man stands first in all the world At the gate of the camp was heard the rolling of the battle drums Then Guan Yu set aside the wine cup till he should have displayed his valor And the wine was still warm when Hua Xiong had been slainCao Cao was greatly excited at this successBut Zhang Feis voice was heard shouting My brother has slain Hua Xiong What are we waiting for Why not break through the Pass and seize Dong ZhuoCould there have been a better time Again arose the angry voice of Yuan Shu We high officials are too meek and yielding Here is the petty follower of a small magistrate daring to flaunt his prowess before usExpel him from the tent I say But again Cao Cao interposed Shall we consider the station of him who has done a great service If you hold a mere magistrate in such honor then I simply withdraw said Yuan ShuIs a word enough to defeat a grand enterprise said Cao CaoThen he told Gongsun Zan to lead the three brothers back to their own camp and the other chiefs then dispersedThat night Cao Cao secretly sent presents of meat and wine to soothe the three after this adventureWhen Hua Xiongs troops straggled back and told the story of defeat and death Li Ru was greatly distressed He wrote urgent letters to his master who called in his trusted advisers to a councilLi Ru summed up the situation saying We have lost our best leader and the rebel power has thereby become very greatYuan Shao is at the head of this confederacy and his uncle Yuan Wei is holder of the office of Imperial Guardianship If those in the capital combine with those in the country we may sufferTherefore we must remove themSo I request you Sir Prime Minister to place yourself at the head of your army and break this confederation Dong Zhuo agreed and at once ordered his two generals Li Jue and Guo Si to take five hundred troops and surround the residence of Imperial Guardian Yuan Wei slay every soul regardless of age and hang the head of Yuan Wei outside the gate as trophyAnd Dong Zhuo commanded two hundred thousand troops to advance in two armies The first fifty thousand were under Li Jue and Guo Si and they were to hold River Si Pass They should not necessarily fightThe other one hundred fifty thousand under Dong Zhuo himself went to Tiger Trap Pass His counselors and commanders Li Ru Lu Bu Fan Chou Zhang Ji and othersmarched with the main armyTiger Trap Pass is fifteen miles from Capital LuoyangAs soon as they arrived Dong Zhuo bade Lu Bu take thirty thousand soldiers and make a strong stockade on the outside of the PassThe main body with Dong Zhuo would occupy the PassNews of this movement reaching the confederate lordsYuan Shao summoned a councilSaid Cao Cao The occupation of the Pass would cut our armies in two therefore must we oppose Dong Zhuos army on the way So eight of the commandersWang Kuang Qiao Mao Bao Xin Yuan Yi Kong Rong Zhang Yang Tao Qian and Gongsun Zanwere ordered to go in the direction of the Tiger Trap Pass to oppose their enemyCao Cao and his troops moved among them as reserve to render help where neededOf the eight Wang Kuang the Governor of Henei was the first to arrive and Lu Bu went to give battle with three thousand armored horsemenWhen Wang Kuang had ordered his army horse and foot in battle array he took his station under the great banner and looked over at his foe Lu Bu was a conspicuous figure in front of the line On his head was a triple curved headdress of ruddy gold with pheasant tails He wore a warring velvetred robe of Xichuan silk embroidered with thousand flowers which was overlapped by golden mail adorned with a gaping animals head joined by rings at the sides and girt to his waist with a belt fastened by a beautiful lionhead claspHis bow and arrows were slung on his shoulders and he carried a long heavy trident halberd He was seated on his snorting steed RedHare Indeed Lu Bu was the man among humans as RedHare was the horse among horsesWho dares go out to fight him asked Wang Kuang turning to those behind himIn response a valiant general from Henei named Fang Yue spurred to the front his spear set ready for battle Lu Bu and Fang Yue metbefore the fifth bout Fang Yue fell under a thrust of the trident halberd and Lu Bu dashed forwardWang Kuangs troops could not stand and scattered in all directionsLu Bu went to and fro slaying all he met He was irresistibleLuckily two other troops led by Qiao Mao and Yuan Yi came up and rescued the wounded Wang Kuang and Lu Bu pulled backThe three having lost many troops withdrew ten miles and made a stockade And before long the remaining five commanders came up and joined themThey held a council and agreed Lu Bu was a hero no one could matchAnd while they sat there anxious and uncertain it was announced that Lu Bu had returned to challenge themThey mounted their horses and placed themselves at the heads of eight forces each body in its station on the high groundAround them was the opposing army in formation commanded by Lu Bu innumerable horse and foot with splendid embroidered banners waving in the breeze They attacked Lu BuMu Shun a general of Governor Zhang Yang rode out with his spear set but soon fell at the first encounter with Lu BuThis frightened the others Then galloped forth Wu Anguo a general under Governor Kong RongWu Anguo raised his iron mace ready at his rivalLu Bu whirling his halberd and urging on his steed came to meet Wu AnguoThe two fought well matched for ten bouts when a blow from the trident halberd broke Wu Anguos wrist Letting his mace fall to the ground he fledThen all eight of the lords led forth their armies to his rescue and Lu Bu retired to his lineThe fighting then ceased and after their return to camp another council metCao Cao said No one can stand against the prowess of Lu Bu Let us call up all the lords and evolve some good planIf only Lu Bu were taken Dong Zhuo could easily be killed While the council was in progress again came Lu Bu to challenge them and again the commanders moved out against himThis time Gongsun Zan flourishing his spear went to meet the enemyAfter a very few bouts Gongsun Zan turned and fled Lu Bu following at the topmost speed of RedHareRedHare was a fivehundredmileaday horse swift as the windThe lords watched RedHare gained rapidly upon the flying horseman and Lu Bus halberd was poised ready to strike Gongsun Zan just behind the heartJust then dashed in a third rider with round glaring eyes and a bristling mustache and armed with a tenfoot octaneserpent halberdStay O twice bastard roared he I Zhang Fei of Yan await you  Seeing this opponent Lu Bu left the pursuit of Gongsun Zan and engaged the new adversary Zhang Fei was elated and he rode forth with all his energiesThey two were worthily matched and they exchanged half a hundred bouts with no advantage to either sideThen Guan Yu impatient rode out with his huge and weighty greendragon saber and attacked Lu Bu on the other flankThe three steeds formed a triangle and their riders battered away at each other for thirty bouts yet still Lu Bu stood firmThen Liu Bei rode out to his brothers aid his double swords raised ready to strike The steed with the flowing mane was urged in at an angle and now Lu Bu had to contend with three surrounding warriors at whom he struck one after another and they at him the flashing of the warriors weapons looking like the revolving lamps suspended at the new yearAnd the warriors of the eight armies gazed rapt with amazement at such a battle But Lu Bus guard began to weaken and fatigue seized himLooking hard in the face of Liu Bei Lu Bu feigned a fierce thrust thus making Liu Bei suddenly draw backThen lowering his halberd Lu Bu dashed through the angle thus opened and got away But was it likely they would allow him to escapeThey whipped their steeds and followed hardThe soldiers of the eight armies cracked their throats with thunderous cheers and all dashed forward pressing after Lu Bu as he made for the shelter of the Tiger Trap Pass And first among his pursuers were the three brothers An ancient poet has told of this famous fight in these lines The fateful day of Han came in the reigns of Huan and Ling Their glory declined as the sun sinks at the close of dayDong Zhuo infamous minister of state pulled down the youthful Bian It is true the new Xian was a weakling too timid for his timesThen Cao Cao proclaimed abroad these wicked deeds And the great lords moved with anger assembled their forcesIn council met they and chose as their oathchief Yuan Shao Pledged themselves to maintain the ruling house and tranquillityOf the warriors of that time matchless Lu Bu was the boldest His valor and prowess are sung by all within the four seasHe clothed his body in silver armor like the scales of a dragon On his head was a golden headdress with pheasant tails About his waist a shaggy belt the clasp two wild beasts heads with gripping jaws His flowing embroidered robe fluttered about his form His swift courser bounded over the plain a mighty wind following His terrible trident halberd flashed in the sunlight bright as a placid lakeWho dared face him as he rode forth to challengeThe bowels of the confederate lords were torn with fear and their hearts trembledThen leaped forth Zhang Fei the valiant warrior of the north Gripped in his mighty hand the long octaneserpent halberd His mustache bristled with anger standing stiff like wireHis round eyes glared lightning flashes darted from them Neither quailed in the fight but the issue was undecidedGuan Yu stood out in front his soul vexed within him His greendragon saber shone white as frost in the sunlight His bright colored fighting robe fluttered like butterfly wings Demons and angels shrieked at the thunder of his horse hoofs In his eyes was fierce anger a fire to be quenched only in bloodNext Liu Bei joined the battle gripping his twin sword blades The heavens themselves trembled at the majesty of his wrathThese three closely beset Lu Bu and long drawn out was the battle Always he warded their blows never faltering a momentThe noise of their shouting rose to the sky and the earth reechoed it The heat of battle ranged to the frozen pole starWorn out feeling his strength fast ebbing Lu Bu thought to flee He glanced at the hills around and thither would fly for shelter Then reversing his halberd and lowering its lofty point Hastily he fled loosing himself from the battle With head low bent he gave the rein to his courser Turned his face away and fled to Tiger Trap PassThe three brothers maintained the pursuit to the Pass Looking up they saw an immense umbrella of black gauze fluttering in the west windCertainly there is Dong Zhuo cried Zhang FeiWhat is the use of pursuing Lu BuBetter far seize the chiefest rebel and so pluck up the evil by the roots And he whipped up his steed toward the PassTo quell rebellion seize the leader if you can If you need a wondrous service then first find a wondrous manThe following chapters will unfold the result of the battleCHAPTER  Burning The Capital Dong Zhuo Commits An Atrocity Hiding The Imperial Hereditary Seal Sun Jian Breaks Faith Zhang Fei rode hard up to the Pass but the defenders sent down stones and arrows like rain so that he could not enter and he returned The eight lords all joined in felicitations to the three brothers for their services and the story of victory was sent to Yuan Shao who ordered Sun Jian to make an immediate advanceThereupon Sun Jian with two trusty generals Cheng Pu and Huang Gai went over to the camp of Yuan ShuTracing figures on the ground with his staff Sun Jian said Dong Zhuo and I had no personal quarrelYet now I have thrown myself into the battle regardless of consequences exposed my person to the risk of wounds and fought bloody battles to their bitter end And why That I might be the means of ridding my country of a rebel and for the private advantage of your familyYet you heeding the slanderous tongue of certain counselor formerly withheld the supplies absolutely necessary to me and so I suffered defeat How can you explain General Yuan Shu confused and frightened had no word to replyHe ordered the death of the slanderer to placate Sun JianThen suddenly they told Sun Jian Some officer has come riding down from the Pass to see you General he is in the camp Sun Jian therefore took his leave and returned to his own camp where he found the visitor was Li Jue one of the much trusted commanders of Dong ZhuoWherefore come you said Sun JianLi Jue replied You are the one person for whom my master has respect and admiration and he sends me to arrange a matrimonial alliance between the two familiesHe wishes that his daughter may become the wife of your son What Dong Zhuo that rebel and renegade that subverter of the throne I wish I could destroy his nine generations as a thankoffering to the empire Think you I would be willing to have an alliance with such a familyI will not slay you as I ought but go and go quickly Yield the Pass and I may spare your livesIf you delay I will grind your bones to powder and make mincemeat of your flesh Li Jue threw his arms over his head and ran out He returned to his master and told him what a rude reception he had met withDong Zhuo asked his adviser Li Ru how to reply to thisLi Ru said Lu Bus late defeat had somewhat blunted the edge of our armys desire for battleIt would be well to return to the capital and remove the Emperor to Changan as the street children had been lately singingA Han on the west a Han on the eastThe deer  will be safe in Changan Li Ru continued If you think out this couplet it applies to the present junctureHalf the first line refers to the founder of the dynasty Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor who became ruler in the western city of Changan which was the capital during twelve reignsThe other half corresponds to Liu Xiu the Latter Han Founder who ruled from Luoyang the eastern capital during twelve latter reignsThe revolution of the heavens brings us back to this starting momentThus if you remove to Changan there will be no need for anxiety Dong Zhuo was exceedingly pleased and said Had you not spoken thus I should not have understood Then taking Lu Bu with him Dong Zhuo started at once for Capital LuoyangHere he called all the officials to a great council in the palace and addressed them After two centuries of rule here the royal fortune has been exhausted and I perceive that the aura of rule has migrated to Changan whither I now desire to move the courtAll you would better pack up for the journey Yang Biao Minister of the Interior said I pray you reflect Within that city all is destructionThere is no reason to renounce the ancestral temples and abandon the imperial tombs here I fear the people will be alarmedIt is easy to alarm them but difficult to pacify them Do you oppose the state plans said Dong Zhuo angrilyAnother official Grand Commander Huang Wan supported his colleague In the era of Recommencement  Fan Chong of the Red Eyebrows rebels burned Changan to the ground and reduced the place to broken tilesThe inhabitants scattered all but a fewIt is wrong to abandon these palaces here for a wasteland Dong Zhuo replied The East of the Pass is full of sedition and all the empire is in rebellion The city of Changan is protected by the Yaohan Mountains and the Hangu PassMoreover it is near Longyou whence can be easily brought timber stone brick and building materials In a month or so palaces can be erectedSo an end to your wild words Yet Minister of Works Xun Shuang raised another protest against disturbing the people but Dong Zhuo overbore him alsoHow can I stop to consider a few common people when my scheme affects the empire said Dong ZhuoThat day the three objectorsYang Biao Huang Wan and Xun Shuang were removed from their offices and reduced to the rank of commonersAs Dong Zhuo went out to get into his coach he met two other officers who made obeisance They were the Secretary General Zhou Bi and the Commander of the City Gate Wu Qiong Dong Zhuo stopped and asked them what they wantedSaid Zhou Bi We venture to try to dissuade you from moving the capital to Changan Dong Zhuo replied They used to say you two were supporters of Yuan Shao now he has already turned traitor and you are of the same party And without more ado he bade his guards take both outside the city and put them to deathThe command to remove to the new capital immediately was issuedSpeaking to Dong Zhuo Li Ru pointed out We are short of money and food and the rich people of Luoyang could be easily plunderedThis is a good occasion to link them to the rebels and to confiscate their properties Dong Zhuo sent five thousand troops out to plunder and slay They captured many thousand wealthy householders and having stuck flags on their heads saying they were Traitors and Rebels drove them out of the city and put them to death Their properties were all seizedThe task of driving forth the inhabitants some millions was given to two of Dong Zhuos commanders Li Jue and Guo SiThe people were sent off in bands each band between two parties of soldiers who drove them forward ChanganEnormous numbers fell by the road side and died in the ditches and the escort plundered the fugitives and defiled the womenA wail of sorrow arose to the very skyDong Zhuos final orders as he left Capital Luoyang were to burn the whole city houses palaces temples and everything was devoured by the flamesThe capital became but a patch of scorched earthDong Zhuo sent Lu Bu to desecrate the tombs of the emperors and their consorts for the jewels therein and the common soldiers took the occasion to dig up the graves of officers and plunder the cemeteries of the wealthy The spoil of the city gold and silver pearls and silks and beautiful ornaments filled many cartsWith these and the persons of the Emperor and his household Dong Zhuo moved off to the new capital in the first year of Inauguration of Tranquillity Luoyang being thus abandoned the general of Dong Zhuo at River Si Pass Zhao Cen evacuated that post of vantage which Sun Jian at once occupied Liu Bei and his brothers took Tiger Trap Pass and the confederate lords advancedSun Jian hastened to the late capital which was still in flamesWhen he arrived dense smoke hung all over it and spread for miles around No living thing not a fowl or a dog or a human being remainedSun Jian told off his soldiers to extinguish the fires and set out camping places for the confederate lordsCao Cao went to see Yuan Shao and said Dong Zhuo has gone west we ought to follow and attack his rear without loss of time why do you remain inactive All our colleagues are worn out and there is nothing to be gained by attack said Yuan ShaoCao Cao said This moment was most propitious in the utter confusion that reigned palaces burned the Emperor abducted the whole world upset and no one knowing whither to turn The villain will soon be ended and a single blow could exterminate Dong Zhuo Why not pursue But all the confederate lords seemed of one mind and that mind was to postpone action So they did nothingThose unworthy ones cannot discuss worthy thing cried Cao CaoThen he and his six generalsXiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Cao Ren Cao Hong Li Dian and Yue Jinand ten thousand troops started in pursuit The road to the new capital led through YingyangWhen Dong Zhuo reached it Governor Xu Rong went to welcome the cavalcadeLi Ru said As there is some danger of pursuit it would be well to order the Governor of this place to lay an ambush outside the cityHe is to let the pursuers pass and be ready to cut off their retreat when our army beats them offThat will teach any others not to follow Then Dong Zhuo ordered Lu Bu to command the rear guardVery soon they saw Cao Cao coming up and Lu Bu laughed at his colleagues foresightHe set out his troops in fighting orderCao Cao rode forward crying Rebels abductors drovers of the people where are you going Lu Bu replied Treacherous simpleton what mad words are these Then from Cao Cao army rode forth Xiahou Dun with his spear set and Lu Bu and Xiahou Dun engagedThe combat had hardly begun when Li Ru with a cohort came in from the leftCao Cao bade Xiahou Yuan meet this onslaught However on the other side appeared Guo Si and his company Cao Cao sent Cao Ren against Guo SiThe onrush on three sides was too much to withstand and Lu Bus army was overwhelming so Xiahou Dun had to retire to the main lineThereupon Lu Bus armored troops attacked and completed the defeat The beaten army of Cao Cao turned toward YingyangThey got as far as the foot of a hill in the evening about the second watch and the moon made it as light as day Here they halted to reformJust as they were burying the boilers to prepare a meal there arose a great noise of shouting on all sides and out came the troops of Governor Xu Rong from the ambush fresh to attackCao Cao thrown into a flurry mounted and fled He ran right in the way of the waiting Xu RongThen he dashed off in another direction but Xu Rong shot an arrow after him which struck him in the shoulderThe arrow still in the wound Cao Cao fled for his lifeAs he went over the hill two soldiers lying in wait among the grass suddenly dashed out and wounded his horse which fell and rolled overAnd as he slipped from the saddle he was seized and made prisonerJust then a horseman came riding at full speed and whirling his sword up cut down both the captors and rescued Cao CaoIt was Cao Hong Cao Cao said I am doomed Good Brother go and save yourself My lord mount my horse quickly I will go afoot said Cao HongIf those wretches come up what then said Cao CaoThe world can do without Cao Hong but not without you my lord If I live I shall owe you my life said Cao Cao So he mountedCao Hong tore off his own breastplate gripped his sword and went on foot after the horseThus they proceeded till the fourth watch when they saw before them a broad stream and behind they still heard the shouts of pursuers drawing nearer and nearer This is my fate said Cao Cao I am really doomed Cao Hong helped Cao Cao down from his horseThen taking off his fighting robe and helmet Cao Hong took the wounded man on his back and waded into the streamWhen they reached the further side the pursuers had already gained the bank whence they shot arrows Cao Cao all wet pushed onDawn was near They went on another ten miles and then sat down to rest under a precipiceSuddenly loud shouting was heard and a party of horse appeared It was Governor Xu Rong who had forded the river higher upJust at this moment Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan with several dozens men came alongHurt not my lord cried Xiahou Dun to Xu Rong who at once rushed at him But the combat was shortXu Rong speedily fell under a spear thrust of Xiahou Dun and his troops were driven off Before long Cao Caos other generals arrived Sadness and joy mingled in the greetingsThey gathered together the few hundreds of soldiers left and then returned to LuoyangWhen the confederate lords entered Luoyang Sun Jian after extinguishing the fires camped within the walls his own tent being set up near the Dynastic TempleHis people cleared away the debris and closed the rifted tombsThe gates were barredOn the site of the Dynastic Temple he put up a mat shed containing three apartments and here he begged the lords to meet and replace the sacred tablets with solemn sacrifices and prayersThis ceremony over the others left and Sun Jian returned to his camp That night the stars and moon vied with each other in brightness As Sun Jian sat in the open air looking up at the heavens he noticed a mist spreading over the stars of the Constellation Draco The Emperors star is dulled said Sun Jian with a sighNo wonder a rebellious minister disturbs the state the people sit in dust and ashes and the capital is a waste And his tears began to fallThen a soldier pointing to the south said There is a beam of colored light rising from a well Sun Jian bade his people light torches and descend into the wellSoon they brought up the corpse of a woman not in the least decayed although it had been there many days She was dressed in palace clothing and from her neck hung an embroidered bagOpening this a red box was found with a golden lock and when the box was opened they saw a jade seal square in shape an inch each way On it were delicately engraved five dragons intertwinedOne corner had been broken off and repaired with goldThere were eight characters in the seal style of engraving which interpreted read I have received the command from Heavenmay my time be always long and prosperous Sun Jian showed this to his adviser General Cheng Pu who at once recognized it as the Imperial Hereditary Seal of the EmperorCheng Pu said This seal has a historyIn olden days Bian He saw a phoenix sitting on a certain stone at the foot of the Jing Mountains He offered the stone at court The king of Chu split open the stone and found a piece of jadeIn the twentysixth year of Qin Dynasty  a jade cutter made a seal from it and Li Si the First Emperors Prime Minister engraved the charactersTwo years later while the First Emperor was sailing in the Dongting Lake a terrific storm arrivedThe Emperor threw the seal to the water as a propitiatory offering and the storm immediately ceasedTen years later again when the First Emperor was making a progress and had reached Huaying an old man by the road side handed a seal to one of the attendants saying This is now restored to the ancestral dragon and had then disappearedThus the jewel returned to QinThe next year the First Emperor diedLater Zi Ying the grandson of the First Emperor presented the seal to Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor the founder of the Han DynastyTwo hundred years later in Wang Mangs rebellion the Emperors mother Lady Yuan struck two of the rebels Wang Xun and Su Xian with the seal and broke off a corner which was repaired with goldLiu Xiu the Latter Han Founder got possession of it at Yiyang and it has been regularly bequeathed hereafterI heard this treasured seal had been lost during the trouble in the Palace when the Ten Regular Attendants hurried off the Emperor It was missed on His Majestys returnNow my lord has it and certainly will come to the imperial dignity But you must not remain here in the northQuickly go home Changsha south of the Great River where you can lay plans for the accomplishment of the great design Your words exactly accord with my thoughts said Sun JianTomorrow I will make an excuse that I am unwell and get away The soldiers were told to keep the discovery a secret But one among them was a compatriot of the elected chief of the confederacyYuan Shao He thought this might be of great advantage to him so he stole away out of the camp and betrayed his masterHe went to Yuan Shaos camp informed the secret and received a liberal reward Yuan Shao kept the informant in his own campNext morning Sun Jian came to take leave saying  I am rather unwell and wish to return to Changsha Yuan Shao laughed saying I know what you are suffering from it is called the Imperial Hereditary Seal This was a shock to Sun Jian and he paled but said Whence these words Yuan Shao said The armies were raised for the good of the state and to relieve it from oppressionThe seal is state property and since you have got hold of it you should publicly hand it over to me as chief When Dong Zhuo has been slain it must go back to the governmentWhat do you mean by concealing it and going away How could the seal get into my hands said Sun JianWhere is the article out of the well I have it not why harass me thus Quickly produce it or it will be the worst for you Sun Jian pointing toward the heavens as an oath said If I have this jewel and am hiding it myself may my end be unhappy and my death violent The lords all said After an oath like this we think he cannot have it Then Yuan Shao called out his informantWhen you pulled that thing out of the well was this man there asked he of Sun JianSun Jians anger burst forth and he sprang forward to kill the manYuan Shao also drew his sword saying You touch that soldier and it is an insult to me Behind Sun Jian Generals Cheng Pu Huang Gai and Han Dang stepped forth behind Yuan Shao Generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou were ready to act In a moment on all sides swords flew from their scabbardsBut the confusion was stayed by the efforts of the others and Sun Jian left the assemblySoon he broke up his camp and marched to his own place Yuan Shao was not satisfiedHe wrote to Jingzhou and sent the letter by a trusty hand to tell Imperial Protector Liu Biao to stop Sun Jian and take away the sealJust after this came the news of the defeat and misfortune of Cao Cao and when he was coming home Yuan Shao sent out to welcome him and conduct him into camp They also prepared a feast to console himDuring the feast Cao Cao said sadly My object was for the public good and all you gentlemen nobly supported meMy plan was to get Yuan Shao with his Henei troops to approach Mengching and my force at Qiao to keep Chenggao while the others of you to hold Suanzao to close the passes of Huanyuan and Daigu and to take possession of the granaries to control the points of vantage and thus to secure the Capital DistrictI planned for Yuan Shu with his Nanyang army to occupy the counties of Danshi and Xilin and go into Wu Pass to help the three supportsAll were to fortify their positions and not fight Advantage lay in an uncertain military force showing the empires possibilities of dealing with the rebellionVictory would have been ours at onceBut then came delays and doubts and inaction and the confidence of the people was lost and I am ashamed No reply was possible and the guests dispersedCao Cao saw that the others mistrusted him and in his heart knew that nothing could be accomplished So he led off his force to YanzhouThen Gongsun Zan said to Liu Bei This Yuan Shao is an incapable and things will turns chaoticWe would better go too So he broke camp and went northAt Pingyuan he left Liu Bei in command and went to strengthen his own position and refresh his troopsThe Imperial Protector of Yanzhou Liu Dai wished to borrow grain of the Governor of Dongjun Qiao MaoBeing denied Liu Dai attacked the camp killed Qiao Mao and took over all his armyYuan Shao seeing the confederacy breaking up also marched away and went east On the way home Sun Jian was passing through JingzhouThe Imperial Protector of Jingzhou Liu Biao was a scion of the imperial house and a native of ShanyangAs a young man he had made friends with many famous persons and he and his companions were called the Eight Wise OnesThe other seven were Chen Xiang from Runan Fan Pang from Runan Kong Yu from Luting Fan Kang from Bohai Tan Fu from Shanyang  Zhang Jian from Shanyang  Cen Zhi from NanyangLiu Biao was friends with all these He had three famous persons who helped him in the government of his regionThey were Kuai Liang and Kuai Yue from Yanping and Cai Mao from XiangyangWhen Yuan Shaos letter detailing the fault of Sun Jian arrived Liu Biao ordered Kuai Yue and Cai Mao with ten thousand soldiers to bar the wayWhen Sun Jian drew near the force was arranged in fighting order and the leaders were in the frontWhy are you thus barring the road with armed troops asked Sun JianWhy do you a servant of Han secrete the Emperors special seal Leave it with me at once and you go free said Kuai YueSun Jian angrily ordered out General Huang GaiOn the other side Cai Mao rode forth with his sword set to strikeBut after a few bouts Huang Gai dealt Cai Mao a blow with the iron whip on the armor just over the heartCai Mao turned his steed and fled and Sun Jian got through with a sudden rushHowever there arose the sound of gongs and drums on the hills behind and there was Liu Biao in person with a large armySun Jian rode straight up to him and bowing low spoke Why did you on the faith of a letter from Yuan Shao try to coerce the chief of a neighboring region You have concealed the state jewel and I want you to restore it was Liu Biaos replyIf I have this thing may I die a violent death If you want me to believe you let me search your baggage What force have you that you dare come to flout me thus And only Liu Biaos prompt retirement prevented a battle Sun Jian proceeded on his wayBut from the rear of the second hill an ambush suddenly discovered itself and Kuai Yue and Cai Mao were still pursuing Sun Jian seemed entirely hemmed inWhat does a man to hold the state jewel for If its possession lead to strifeHow Sun Jian got clear of the difficulty will presently be told CHAPTER Yuan Shao Fights Gongsun Zan At The River Pan Sun Jian Attacks Liu Biao Across The Great River At the close of the last chapter Sun Jian was surrounded However aided by Cheng Pu Huang Gai and Han Dang he eventually fought his way through though with the loss of more than half his troops Sun Jian he returned to the South Land southeast of the Great River Henceforward Sun Jian and Liu Biao were open enemiesYuan Shao was in HeneiBeing short of supplies he sent to borrow from the Imperial Protector of Jizhou Han Fu whence he obtained the wherewithal to support his armyThen one of Yuan Shaos advisers Peng Ji said to him You are really the strongest power here about why then depend upon another for foodJizhou is rich and wide why not seize it I have no good plan replied Yuan ShaoYou could secretly send a letter to Gongsun Zan asking him to attack promising him your supportImperial Protector Han Fu of Jizhou being incapable must ask you to take over his region and you will get it without lifting a finger So the letter was sentWhen Gongsun Zan saw therein the proposal to make a joint attack and divide the territory he agreed to give his helpIn the meantime Yuan Shao had sent to warn Han Fu of Gongsun Zans threatHan Fu sought advice from Advisers Xun Chang and Xin Ping Xun Chang said Governor Gongsun Zan of Beiping is commanding a huge and strong armyIf he came to attack us we could not stand against him especially if he had the help of Liu Bei and his brothersAt present Yuan Shao is bolder than most and he has many able and famous leaders under him You cannot do better than ask him to assist in administering this regionYuan Shao will certainly treat you with generosity and you need have no fear from Gongsun Zan Han Fu agreed and sent a message to Yuan Shao by the hand of Guan ChunBut the commander of the palace Geng Wu remonstrated with his master saying Yuan Shao is a needy man with a hungry army and as dependent on us for existence as an infant in arms on its mother Stop the flow of milk and the infant diesWhy should you hand the region over to himIt is nothing less than letting a tiger into the sheepfold Han Fu replied I am one of the clients of the Yuan family and I know the abilities of Yuan Shao which is far better than mineWhy are you all so jealousThe ancients counseled yielding to the sage Geng Wu sighed Jizhou is lost When the news got abroad more than thirty officers of Jizhou left their employment and the cityHowever Geng Wu and Guan Chun hid in the suburbs to await the arrival of Yuan Shao They had not long to waitSome days later Yuan Shao with his soldiers came and Geng Wu and Guan Chun tried to assassinate him with knives This attempt failedYuan Shaos generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou beheaded Geng Wu and Guan Chun instantly Thus both of them died and the object of their hatred entered Jizhou CityYuan Shaos first act was to confer on Han Fu a high sounding title General Who Demonstrates Grand and Vigor Courage in Arms but the administration was entrusted to four of Yuan Shaos confidantsTian Feng Ju Shou Xu You and Peng Jiwho speedily deprived the Imperial Protector of all powerFull of chagrin Han Fu soon abandoned all even his family and rode alone to take refuge with the Governor of Chenliu Zhang MiaoHearing of Yuan Shaos invasion Gongsun Zan sent his brother Gongsun Yue to see the usurper and demand his share of the region I want to see your elder brother himselfHe and I have things to discuss said Yuan ShaoThus Gongsun Yue was sent backBut after traveling some fifteen miles on the homeward road Gongsun Yue saw a group of soldiers appear We are guards of Prime Minister Dong Zhuo cried the soldiersInstantly Gongsun Yue was killed by a flight of arrowsThose of Gongsun Yues followers who escaped carried the news to their late masters brotherGongsun Zan was very angry and said Yuan Shao prevailed on me to attack and now he has taken possessionAlso he pretends the murderers of my brother were not his people Shall I not avenge my brothers injury Gongsun Zan brought up all his force to the attackLearning the movement Yuan Shao sent out his army and they met at River Pan They halted on opposite sides of the river over which was a bridgeGongsun Zan took his station on the bridge and cried to his enemy Renegade how dared you mislead me Yuan Shao rode to the other end of the bridge and pointing at Gongsun Zan replied Han Fu yielded place to me because he was unequal to the ruleWhat concern is it of yours Gongsun Zan replied Formerly you were regarded as loyal and public spirited and we chose you chief of the confederacyNow your deeds prove you cruel and base and wolfhearted in behaviorHow can you look the world in the face Who will capture him cried Yuan Shao in a rageAt once Wen Chou rode out with his spear setGongsun Zan rode down the bridge to the enemys side where the two engagedTen bouts showed Gongsun Zan the terrible power of Wen Chou and so he drew offThe enemy came onGongsun Zan took refuge within his formation but Wen Chou cut his way in and rode this way and that slaying right and leftThe four best of Gongsun Zans generals offered joint battle but one fell under the first stroke of the doughty warrior and the other three fledWen Chou followed clearing through to the rear of the army Gongsun Zan made for the mountains Wen Chou forced his horse to its utmost pace crying hoarsely Down Dismount and surrender Gongsun Zan fled for lifeHis bow and quiver dropped from his shoulders his helmet fell off and his hair streamed straight behind him as he rode in and out between the sloping hillsThen his steed stumbled and he was thrown rolling over and over to the foot of the slopeWen Chou was now very near and poising his spear for the thrustThen suddenly came out from the shelter of a grassy mound on the left a general of youthful mien but sitting his steed bravely and holding a sturdy spear He rode directly at Wen Chou and Gongsun Zan crawled up the slope to look on The new warrior was of middle height with bushy eyebrows and large eyes a broad face and a heavy jowl a youth of commanding presence The two exchanged some fifty bouts and yet neither had the advantageThen Gongsun Zans rescue force came along and Wen Chou turned and rode awayThe youth did not pursueGongsun Zan hurried down the hill and asked the young fellow who he wasHe bowed low and replied My name is Zhao Yun from ChangshanI first served Yuan Shao but when I saw that he was disloyal to his prince and careless of the welfare of the people I left him and I was on my way to offer service to youThis meeting in this place is most unexpected Gongsun Zan was very pleased and the two went together to the camp where they at once busied themselves with preparations for a new battleNext day Gongsun Zan prepared for fight by dividing his army into two wingsHe had five thousand cavalry in the center all mounted on white horsesGongsun Zan had formerly seen service against the frontier tribes the Qiang Peoples where he always placed his white horses in the van of his army and thus he had won the sobriquet of General Who Commands White HorsesThe tribes held him so much in fear that they always fled as soon as the white horses their sacred creatures appearedOn Yuan Shaos side Yan Liang and Wen Chou were Leaders of the Van Each had one thousand of archers and crossbowmenThey were set out half on either side those on the left to shoot at Gongsun Zans right and those on the right to shoot at his leftIn the center was Qu Yi with eight hundred bowmen and ten thousand of foot and horse Yuan Shao took command of the reserve force in the rearIn this fight Gongsun Zan employed his new adherent Zhao Yun for the first time and as Gongsun Zan did not feel assured of Zhao Yuns good faith put him in command of a company at the rearThe Van Leader was Yan Guang and Gongsun Zan himself commanded the centerHe took his place on horseback on the bridge beside an enormous red standard on which was displayed the word Commanding General in gold embroideryFrom sunrise to noon the drums rolled for the attack but Yuan Shaos army made no moveQu Yi made his bowmen hide under their shieldsThey heard the roar of explosions the whistling of arrows and the rattle of the drums as Yan Guang approached from the other side but Qu Yi and his men lay closer than ever and never stirredThey waited till Yan Guang had got close on them and then as the sound of a bomb rent the air the whole eight hundred men let fly their arrows in a cloudYan Guang was quite taken aback and would have retired but Qu Yi rode furiously toward him whirled up his sword and cut him down So Gongsun Zans army lost that battleThe two wings that should have come to the rescue were kept back by the bowmen under Yan Liang and Wen ChouYuan Shaos troops advanced right up to the bridgeThen Qu Yi rode forward slew the standard bearer and hacked through the staff of the embroidered bannerSeeing this Gongsun Zan turned his steed and galloped away Qu Yi followedBut just as he caught up the fugitive there came prancing forth Zhao Yun who rode directly at him with spear ready to strikeAfter a few bouts Qu Yi was laid in the dustThen Zhao Yun attacked the soldiers and turned the tide Plunging forward on this side dashing in on that he went through as if there were no antagonists and seeing this Gongsun Zan turned and came again into the fight The final victory was on his sideFrom the scouts sent to find out how the battle went Yuan Shao heard the good news of Qu Yis success in slaying the standard bearer capturing the flag and his pursuitSo Yuan Shao took no further care but rode out with his General Tian Feng and a few guards to look on at the enemy and enjoy his victory Ha ha Yuan Shao laughedGongsun Zan is an incapable But even as Yuan Shao spoke he saw in front the redoubtable Zhao YunHis guards hastened to prepare their bows but before they could shoot Zhao Yun was in their midst and men were falling before him wherever he went The others fledGongsun Zans army then gathered round and hemmed in Yuan ShaoTian Feng then said to his master Sir take refuge in this empty building here But Yuan Shao dashed his helmet to the ground crying The brave man rather faces death in the battle than seeks safety behind a wall This bold speech gave new courage to his soldiers who now fought fiercely and with such success that Zhao Yun could nowhere force his way in Yuan Shao was soon reinforced by the arrival of his main body and Yan Liang and the two armies pressed forwardZhao Yun could only just get Gongsun Zan safe out of the press Then they fought their way back to the bridgeBut Yuan Shaos troops still came on and fought their way across the bridge forcing multitudes of their adversaries into the water where many were drowned Yuan Shao was leading in person and his troops still advancedBut not more than two miles for soon a great shouting was heard behind some hills whence suddenly burst out a body of troops led by Liu Bei Guan Yu and Zhang FeiAt Pingyuan they had heard of the struggle between their protector and his enemy Yuan Shao and had at once set out to helpNow the three riders each with his peculiar weapon flew straight at Yuan Shao who was so frightened that his soul seemed to leave his body and fly beyond the confines of heaven His sword fell from his hand and he fled for his lifeHe was chased across the bridge when Gongsun Zan called in his army and they returned to campAfter the usual greetings Gongsun Zan said If you had not come to our help we should have been in very bad case Liu Bei and Zhao Yun were made acquainted with each other and a warm affection sprang up from the very first so that they were always togetherYuan Shao had lost that battle and Gongsun Zan would not risk another They strengthened their defenses and the armies lay inactive for over a monthIn the meantime news of the fighting had reached Capital Changan and Dong Zhuo was toldHis adviser Li Ru went to see his master and said The two active leaders of today are Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan who are at grips at River PanPretend you have an imperial command to make peace between them and both will support you out of gratitude for your intervention Good said Dong ZhuoSo he sent the Imperial Guardian Ma Midi and the Minister of the Palace Bureau Zhao Qi on the missionWhen these men were arriving the North of Yellow River Yuan Shao sent out to welcome them thirty miles from his headquarters and received the imperial command with the greatest respectThen the two officers went to Gongsun Zan and made known their errand Gongsun Zan sent letters to his adversary proposing friendshipThe two emissaries returned to report their task accomplished Gongsun Zan drew off his armyHe also sent up a memorial eulogizing Liu Bei who was raised to the rank of Governor of PingyuanThe farewell between Liu Bei and Zhao Yun was affecting They held each others hands a long time their eyes streaming with tears and could not tear themselves apartZhao Yun said with a sob I used to think Gongsun Zan a true hero but  see now that he is no different from Yuan ShaoThey are both alike But you are now in his service we shall surely meet again said Liu BeiBoth men wept freely as they separatedNow Yuan Shu in Nanyang hearing that his brother had come into Jizhou sent to beg a thousand horsesThe request was refused and enmity sprang up between the brothersYuan Shu also sent to Jingzhou to borrow grain which Imperial Protector Liu Biao would not sendIn his resentment Yuan Shu wrote to Sun Jian trying to get him to attack Liu Biao The letter ran like thisWhen Liu Biao stopped you on your way home it was at the instigation of my brotherNow the same two have planned to fall upon your territories southeast of the Great River wherefore you should at once strike at Liu BiaoI will capture my brother for you and both resentments will be appeasedYou will get Jingzhou and I shall have Jizhou I cannot bear Liu Biao said Sun Jian as he finished reading this letterHe certainly did bar my way home and I may wait many years for my revenge if I let slip this chance He called a councilYou may not trust Yuan Shu he is very deceitful said Cheng PuI want revenge on my own part what care I for his help said Sun JianHe dispatched Huang Gai to prepare a river fleet arm and provision them Big warships were to take horses on board The force soon set outNews of these preparations came to Liu Biao and he hastily summoned his advisers and warriorsKuai Liang told him to be free from anxiety and said Put General Huang Zu at the head of the Jiangxia army to make the first attack and you Sir support him with the forces from XiangyangLet Sun Jian come riding the rivers and straddling the lakes what strength will he have left after arriving here So Liu Biao bade Huang Zu prepare to march and a great army was assembledHere it may be said that Sun Jian had four sons all the issue of his wife who was of the Wu familyTheir names in order were Sun Ce Sun Quan Sun Yi and Sun KuangSun Jian had a second wife who was the sister of his first wife And the second wife bore him a son and a daughter the former called Sun Lang the latter Sun RenSun Jian had also adopted a son from the Yu family named Sun ShaoAnd he had a younger brother named Sun Jing As Sun Jian was leaving on this expedition his brother Sun Jing with all his six sons stood in front of Sun Jians steed and dissuaded him saying Dong Zhuo is the real ruler of the state for the Emperor is a weakling The whole country is in rebellion every one is scrambling for territoryOur area is comparatively peaceful and it is wrong to begin a war merely for the sake of a little resentmentI pray you Brother think before you start Sun Jian replied Brother say no moreI desire to make my strength felt throughout the empire and shall I not avenge my injuries Then father if you must go let me accompany you said the eldest son Sun CeThis request was granted and father and son embarked to go to ravage the city of FankouNow Huang Zu had placed archers and crossbowmen along the river bank When the ships approached a flight of arrows met themSun Jian ordered his troops to remain under cover in the ships which then sailed to and fro drawing the fire for three daysSeveral times the ships pretended to land and this drew showers of arrows from the bankAt last the arrows of the defenders were all shot away and Sun Jian who collected them found he had many myriadsThen with a fair wind Sun Jians troops shot them back to the enemyThose on the bank were thrown into great disorder and retiredThe army then landed Two divisions led by Cheng Pu and Huang Gai set out for Huang Zus camp along different roads and between them marched Han DangUnder this triple attack Huang Zu was worsted He left Fankou and hastened to DengchengLeaving the ships under the command of Huang Gai Sun Jian led the pursuing forceHuang Zu came out of his city and drew up for battle in the open countryWhen Sun Jian had disposed his army he rode out to the standardSun Ce clad in armor placed himself beside his fatherHuang Zu rode out with two generalsZhang Hu from Jiangxia and Chen Sheng from XiangyangFlourishing his whip Huang Zu abused his enemy You swarm of rebels from ChangshaWhy do you invade the land of a scion of the ruling house Zhang Hu challenged to combat and Han Dang went out to acceptThe two champions fought thirty bouts and then Chen Sheng seeing his fellow general becoming exhausted rode to his aidSun Jian saw Chen Sheng coming laid aside his spear reached for his bow and shot an arrow wounding Chen Sheng in the face He fell from his horse Panic seized upon Zhang Hu at the fall of his comrade and he could no longer defend himselfThen Han Dang with a slash of his sword clove Zhang Hus skull in twainBoth having fallen Cheng Pu galloped up to make prisoner of Huang Zu who threw off his helmet slipped from his steed and mingled for safety among his troopsSun Jian led on the attack and drove the enemy to the Han River where he ordered Huang Gai to move the fleet upriver and moor thereHuang Zu led his defeated troops back and told Liu Biao saying Sun Jian was too strong for my army Kuai Liang was called in to advise and he said Our newly defeated soldiers have no heart for fighting nowTherefore we must fortify our position while we seek help from Yuan ShaoThen we can extricate ourselves A stupid move said Cai MaoThe enemy is at the city gates shall we fold our hands and wait to be slainGive me troops and I will go out and fight to the finish So Cai Mao was placed in command of ten thousand troops and went out to the Xian Hills where he drew up his battle lineSun Jian led the invaders now flushed with successWhen Cai Mao approached Sun Jian looked at him and said He is brotherinlaw to Liu Biao who will capture him Cheng Pu set his ironspined lance and rode outAfter a few bouts Cai Mao turned and fledSun Jians army rode in and slaughtered till corpses filled the countryside and Cai Mao took refuge in XiangyangKuai Liang said Cai Mao ought to be put to death by military lawThis defeat was due to his obstinacy But Liu Biao was unwilling to punish the brother of his newly wedded wifeSun Jian surrounded Xiangyang and assailed the walls dailyOne day a fierce gale sprang up and the pole bearing his standard was broken Very inauspicious said Han DangWe ought to go back Sun Jian said I have won every battle and the city is on the point of fallingShall I return because the wind breaks a flagstaff He flouted the advice and attacked the walls still more vigorously Within the city the defenders had seen an omenKuai Liang told Liu Biao Last night I saw that a great star fall into the sky corresponding to Sun Jians territoryI calculated that it inferred the fall of Sun Jian Then Kuai Liang advised Liu Biao to seek help from Yuan Shao as quickly as possibleSo Liu Biao wrote Then he asked who would undertake to fight his way through the blockade with the letterOne Lu Gong a warrior of great strength offered himself for this serviceKuai Liang said If you undertake this service listen to my advice You will have five hundred soldiers choose good bowmen Dash through the enemys formation and make for Xian HillsYou will be pursued but send a hundred soldiers up the hill to prepare large stones and place a hundred archers in ambush in the woodsThese are not to flee from the pursuers but to beguile them along devious ways round to the place where the boulders have been prepared There stones will be rolled down and arrows shotIf you succeed fire off a series of bombs as a signal and the armies in the city will come out to helpIf you are not pursued get away as fast as possibleTonight will be suitable as there is very little moon Start at dusk Lu Gong having received these directions prepared his force to carry them outAs soon as day began to close in he went quietly out at the east gateSun Jian was in his tent when he heard shouting and a soldier came to report There was a group of horsemen going out from the city Sun Jian at once mounted and rode out with thirty horsemen to discover the causeLu Gongs troops had already hidden themselves in the thick woodsSun Jian rode ahead of his escort and soon he found himself alone and close to the enemyHe called out to them to haltLu Gong at once turned back and came as if to fightBut they had only exchanged a single pass when Lu Gong again fled taking the road among the hillsSun Jian followed but soon lost sight of his foeSun Jian turned up the hill Then the gongs clanged and down the hills fell showers of stones while from among the trees the arrows flew in clouds Sun Jian was hit by several arrows and a huge stone crushed in his head Both he and his steed were killedSun Jian was only thirtyseven years old at his deathHis escort was overpowered and every man of them slain Then Lu Gong let off a series of bombs the sign of success as agreedAt this signal Huang Zu Kuai Yue and Cai Mao led three armies out of the city and fell upon the Changsha troops throwing them into the utmost confusionWhen Huang Gai heard the sound of battle he led up the troops from the shipsHe met Huang Zu and took Huang Zu prisoner after a brief fightCheng Pu set out to bear the sad news to Sun Ce While he was seeking a way out he came across Lu GongCheng Pu at once put his horse at full speed and engaged Lu Gong After a few bouts Lu Gong went down under a spear thrustThe battle became general and continued till daylight broke when each drew off his armyLiu Biao withdrew into the cityWhen Sun Ce returned to the river he heard that his father had perished in the fight and his body had been carried within the enemys wallsHe uttered a great cry and the army joined him with wailing and tearsHow can I return home leaving my fathers corpse with them cried Sun CeHuang Gai said We have Huang Zu as our prisonerLet one enter the city and discuss peace giving up our prisoner for our lords body He had barely finished speaking when an officer in the army Huan Jie offered himself as messenger saying I am an old friend of Liu BiaoI volunteer to take the mission Sun Ce agreed So Huan Jie went and peace was discussedLiu Biao told Huan Jie saying The body is already laid in a coffin and ready to be delivered as soon as Huang Zu returnedLet us both cease fighting and never again invade each others territories Huan Jie thanked him and took his leaveBut as Huan Jie went down the steps Kuai Liang suddenly broke in saying No noLet me speak and I will see to it that not a single enemy can surviveI pray you first put this person to death and then to employ my means Pursuing his enemy Sun Jian dies On a peaceful mission Huan Jie is threatenedThe fate of the ambassador will be disclosed in a later chapter CHAPTER  Wang Yun Prepares The Chaining Scheme Dong Zhuo Rages At Phoenix PavilionThis is what Kuai Liang said Sun Jian is now gone and his sons are but youthsSeize this moment of weakness to break into Changsha and it is yours in one beat of the drumIf you return the corpse and make peace you give them time to grow powerful and evil will ensue to Jingzhou How can I leave Huang Zu in their hands said Liu BiaoWhy not sacrifice this blundering warrior for a region But he is my dear friend and to abandon him is wrong So Huan Jie was allowed to return to his own side with the understanding that Sun Jians dead body should be given in exchange Sun Ce freed his prisoner brought away his fathers coffin and the fighting ceasedSun Jian was interred in the plains of QueWhen the ceremonies were over Sun Ce led his army home againIn Changsha the southern territory of the Great River  Sun Ce set himself to the task of ruling wellBeing humble and generous he invited to his side humans of wisdom and valor and so bore himself that all the best and bravest of the country gathered about himMeanwhile Dong Zhuo at Capital Changan when he heard of the death of the turbulent Sun Jian said An evil that pressed hard upon my heart has been removed He asked what children Sun Jian had left and when they told him the eldest was but seventeen he dismissed all anxiety from his thoughtsFrom this time forward his arrogance and domineering spirit waxed worse and worse He styled himself Imperial Rector a name full of honor and in all his behavior aped imperial stateHe created his younger brother Dong Min Lord of Huazhou and made him Commander of the Left ArmyA nephew Dong Huang was made Court Counselor and placed in command of the Palace Guard and everyone of his clan young or old was ennobledEighty miles from the capital Dong Zhuo laid out a city called Meiwo an exact replica of Changan with its palaces granaries treasuries and magazines and employed a quarter of a million people to build it Here he accumulated supplies sufficient for twenty yearsHe selected eight hundred of the most beautiful maidens and sent them to dwell in his new city The stores of wealth in every form were incalculableAll his family and retainers found quarters in this new cityDong Zhuo visited his city at intervals of a month or so and every visit was like an imperial progress with booths by the roadside to refresh the officials and courtiers who attended him to the northwest Royal Gate and saw him startOn one occasion Dong Zhuo spread a great feast for all those assembled to witness his departure and while it was in progress there arrived a large number of rebels from the north who had voluntarily surrenderedThe tyrant had them brought before him as he sat at table and meted out to them wanton cruelties The hands of this one were lopped off the feet of that one had his eyes gouged out another lost his tongue Some were boiled to deathShrieks of agony arose to the very heavens and the courtiers were faint with terror But the author of the misery ate and drank chatted and smiled as if nothing was going onAnother day Dong Zhuo was presiding at a great gathering of officers who were seated in two long rowsAfter the wine had gone up and down several times Lu Bu entered and whispered a few words in his masters ear Dong Zhuo smiled and said He was always so Take Minister Zhang Wen outside The others all turned paleIn a little time a serving man brought the head of their fellow guest on a red dish and showed it to their host They nearly died with frightDo not fear said Dong Zhuo smilingMinister Zhang Wen was in league with Yuan Shu to assassinate me A letter he wrote fell by mistake into the hands of my son so I have had him put to deathYou gentlemen who have no reason need have no fear The officials hastened to disperseOne of them Minister of the Interior Wang Yun who had witnessed all this returned to his palace very pensive and much distressedThe same evening a bright moonlight night he took his staff and went strolling in his private garden Standing near one of the creeper trellises he gazed up at the sky and the tears rolled down his cheeksSuddenly he heard a rustle in the Peony Pavilion and someone sighing deeplyStealthily creeping near he saw there one of the household singing girls named Diao ChanThis maiden had been brought up in his palace where she had been taught to sing and dance At twentyone she was then just bursting into womanhood a pretty and clever girl whom Wang Yun regarded more as a daughter than a dependantAfter listening for some time Wang Yun suddenly called out What mischief are you up to there you naughty girl The maiden dropped on her knees in terror saying Would thy unworthy handmaid dare to do anything wrong Then what are you sighing about out here in the darkness May thy handmaid speak from the bottom of her heart Tell me the whole truth do not conceal anything And the girl said Thy handmaid has been the recipient of bountiful kindnessShe has been taught to sing and dance and been treated so kindly that were she torn in pieces for her lords sake it would not repay a thousandth partShe has noticed lately that her lords brows have been knit in distress and knows it is on account of the state troubles But she has not dared to askThis evening he seemed more sad than ever and she was miserable on her lords account But she did not know she would be seenCould she be of any use she would not shrink from a myriad deaths A sudden idea came to Wang Yun and he stuck the ground with his staffAnd he said Who would think that the fate of Han lay on your palmCome with me The girl followed him into the houseThen he dismissed all the waiting attendants placed Diao Chan on a chair and bowed before her She was frightened and threw herself on the ground asking in terror what it all meantSaid Wang Yun You can sympathize with the people of Han and the fount of his tears opened afreshMy lord as thy handmaid said just now use her in any way thy handmaid will never shrink said the girlWang Yun knelt saying The people are on the brink of destruction the prince and his officers are in jeopardy and you you are the only saviorThat wretch Dong Zhuo wants to depose the Emperor and not a person among us can find means to stop him Now he has a son a bold warrior it is true but both father and son have a weakness for beauty and I am going to use what I may call the chaining planI shall first propose you in marriage to Lu Bu and then after you are betrothed I shall present you to Dong Zhuo and you will take every opportunity to force them asunder and turn sway their countenances from each other cause the son to kill his adopted father and so put an end to the great evilThus you may restore the altars of the land that it may live againAll this lies within your power will you do it Thy handmaid has promised not to recoil from death itselfYou may use my poor self in any way and I must do my best But if this gets abroad then we are all lost Fear not said she if thy handmaid does not show gratitude may she perish beneath a myriad swords Thank you thank you said Wang YunThen Wang Yun took from the family treasury many pearls and bade a cunning jeweler make therewith a fine golden headdress which was sent as a present to Lu BuHe was delighted and came to thank the donorWhen Lu Bu arrived he was met at the gate by Wang Yun himself and within found a table full of dainties for his delectation He was conducted into the private apartments and placed in the seat of honorLu Bu said I am but a simple officer in the palace of a minister you are an exalted officer of state why am I treated thus Because in the whole land there is no hero your equalPoor Wang Yun bows not to an officers rank poor Wang Yun bows to his ability  This gratified Lu Bu mightily and his host continued to praise and flatter and ply him with wine and to talk of the virtues of the Prime Minister and his henchmanLu Bu laughed and drank huge gobletsPresently most of the attendants were sent away only a few kept to press the guest to drinkWhen the guest was very mellow Wang Yun suddenly said Let the child come in Soon appeared two attendants dressed in white leading between them the exquisite and fascinating Diao ChanWho is this said Lu Bu startled into sobrietyThis is my little girl Diao Chan You will not be annoyed at my familiarity will youBut you have been so very friendly I thought you would like to see her Wang Yun bade Diao Chan present a goblet of wine and her eyes met those of the warriorWang Yun feigning intoxication said My little child begs you General to take a cup or twoWe all depend upon you all our house Lu Bu begged Diao Chan to sit down She pretended to wish to retireHer master pressed her to remain saying that she might do so since the guest was a dear friendSo she took a seat modestly near her masterLu Bu kept his gaze fixed upon the maid while he swallowed cup after cup of wine I should like to present her to you as a handmaid would you accept said Wang Yun The guest started upIf that is so you may rely upon my abject gratitude said Lu BuWe will choose a propitious day ere long and send her to the palace Lu Bu was overjoyedHe could not keep his eyes off Diao Chan and loving glances flashed from her liquid eyesHowever the time came for the guest to leave and Wang Yun said I would ask you to remain the night but the Prime Minister might suspect something Lu Bu thanked him again and again and departedSome few days later when Wang Yun was at court and Lu Bu was absent Wang Yun bowed low before Dong Zhuo and said I wish that you would deign to come to dine at my lowly cottage could your noble thought bend that way Should you invite me I would certainly hasten was the replyWang Yun thanked him Then Wang Yun went home and prepared in the reception hall a feast in which figured every delicacy from land and sea Beautiful embroideries surrounded the chief seat in the center and elegant curtains were hung within and withoutAt noon next day when the Prime Minister arrived Wang Yun met him at the gate in full court costumeWang Yun stood by while Dong Zhuo stepped out of his chariot and Dong Zhuo and a host of one hundred armed guards crowded into the hallDong Zhuo took his seat at the top his suite fell into two lines right and left while Wang Yun stood humbly at the lower end Dong Zhuo bade his people conduct Wang Yun to a place beside himselfSaid Wang Yun The great Prime Ministers abundant virtue is as the high mountains neither the ancient sagesYi Yin and Duke Zhoucould attain thereto Dong Zhuo smiledThey bore in the dishes and the wine and the music began Wang Yun plied his guest with assiduous flattery and studied deferenceWhen it grew late and the wine had done its work Dong Zhuo was invited to the inner chamberSo he sent away his guards and wentHere the host raised a goblet and drank to his guest saying From my youth up I have understood something of astrology and have been studying the aspect of the heavensI read that the days of Han are numbered and that the great Prime Ministers merits command the regard of all the world as when King Shun succeeded King Yao and King Yu continued the work of King Shun all by the strength of their own merits conforming to the mind of Heaven and the desire of people How dare I expect this said Dong ZhuoFrom the days of old those who walk in the way have replaced those who deviate therefrom those who lack virtue have fallen before those who possess itCan one escape fate If indeed the decree of Heaven devolves on me you shall be held the first in merit said Dong Zhuo Wang Yun bowedThen lights were brought in and all the attendants were dismissed save the serving maids to hand the wine So the evening went onPresently Wang Yun said The music of these everyday musicians is too commonplace for your ear but there happens to be in the house a little maid that might please you Excellent said the guestThen a curtain was loweredThe shrill tones of reed instruments rang through the room and presently some attendants led forward Diao Chan who then danced on the outside of the curtain A poem praises herFor a palace this maiden was born So timid so graceful so slender Like a tiny bird flitting at morn Over the dewladen lily buds tender Were this exquisite maid only mine For never a mansion Id pine Another poem runs thusThe music falls the dancer comes a swallow gliding in A dainty little damsel soft as silk Her beauty captivates the guest yet saddens him within For he must soon depart and leave her thereShe smiles no gold could buy that smile no other smiled so No need to deck her form with jewels rareBut when the dance is over and coy glances come and go Then who shall be the chosen of the fairThe dance endedDong Zhuo bade them lead the maiden in and she came bowing low as she approached him He was much taken with her beauty and modest graceWho is she said Dong ZhuoA singing girl her name is Diao Chan Then can she sing The master bade her sing and she did so to the accompaniment of castanets There is a measure describing her youthful beautyYou stand a dainty maiden Your cherry lips so bright Your teeth so pearly white Your fragrant breath loveladen Yet is your tongue a sword Cold death is the reward Of loving thee O maidenDong Zhuo was delighted and praised her warmlyShe was told to present a goblet of wine to the guest which he took from her hands and then asked her ageShe replied Thy unworthy handmaid is twentyone A perfect little fairy said Dong ZhuoThen Wang Yun rose and said If the Prime Minister would not mind I should like to offer him this little maid How could I be grateful enough for such a kindness She would be most fortunate if she could be your servant said Wang YunDong Zhuo thanked his host warmlyThen the orders were given to prepare a closed carriage and convey Diao Chan to the Prime Ministers palaceSoon after Dong Zhuo took his leave and Wang Yun accompanied him the whole wayAfter he had taken leave Wang Yun mounted to ride homeward Half way he met two lines of guards with red lamps who were escorting Lu Bu who was on horseback and armed with his trident halberd Seeing Wang Yun Lu Bu at once reined in stopped seized him by the sleeve and said angrily You promised Diao Chan to me and now you have given her to the Prime Ministerwhat foolery is this Wang Yun checked him saying This is no place to talk I pray you come to my house So they went together and Wang Yun led Lu Bu into a private roomAfter the usual exchange of polite greetings Wang Yun said Why do you find fault with me General Somebody told me that you had sent Diao Chan to the Prime Ministers palace in a covered carriage what does it mean Of course you do not understandYesterday when I was at court the Prime Minister told me he had something to talk to me about in my own houseSo naturally I prepared for his coming and while we were at dinner he said I have heard something of a girl named Diao Chan whom you have promised to my son Lu BuI thought it was mere rumor so I wanted to ask if it was trueBeside I should like to see her I could not say no so she came in and made her bow to the lord of lordsThen he said that it was a lucky day and he would take her away with him and betroth her to you Just think Sirwhen the Prime Minister had come himself could I stop him You were not so very wrong said Lu Bu but for a time I had misunderstood youI owe you an apology The girl has a small trousseau which I will send as soon as she has gone over to your dwelling Lu Bu thanked him and went awayNext day he went into the Palace to find out the truth but could hear nothingThen he made his way into the private quarters and questioned the maidsPresently one told him that the Prime Minister had brought home a new bedfellow the night before and was not up yetLu Bu was very angry Next he crept round behind his masters sleeping apartmentBy this time Diao Chan had risen and was dressing her hair at the window Looking out she saw a long shadow fall across the little lakeShe recognized the headdress and peeping around she saw it was indeed no other than Lu BuThereupon she contracted her eyebrows simulating the deepest grief and with her dainty handkerchief she wiped her eyes again and againLu Bu stood watching her a long timeSoon after he went in to give morning greetingDong Zhuo was sitting in the reception room Seeing his henchman Dong Zhuo asked if there was anything new Nothing was the reply Lu Bu waited while Dong Zhuo took his morning mealAs he stood beside his master he glanced over at the curtain and saw a woman there behind the screen showing a half face from time to time and throwing amorous glances at him He felt it was his beloved and his thoughts flew to herPresently Dong Zhuo noticed his expression and began to feel suspicious If there is nothing you may go said Dong ZhuoLu Bu sulkily withdrewDong Zhuo now thought of nothing but his new mistress and for more than a month neglected all affairs devoting himself entirely to pleasureOnce he was a little indisposed and Diao Chan was constantly at his side never even undressing to show her solicitude She gratified his every whim Dong Zhuo grew more and more fond of herOne day Lu Bu went to inquire after his fathers healthDong Zhuo was asleep and Diao Chan was sitting at the head of his couch Leaning forward she gazed at the visitor with one hand pointed to her heart the other at Dong Zhuo asleep and her tears fellLu Bu felt heartbrokenDong Zhuo drowsily opened his eyes and seeing his sons gaze fixed on something behind him he turned over and saw who it wasHe angrily rebuked his son saying Dare you make love to my beauty He told the servants to turn Lu Bu out shouting Never let him enter here again Lu Bu went off home very wrathMeeting Li Ru he told Li Ru the cause of his angerThe adviser hastened to see his master and said Sir you aspire to be ruler of the empire why then for a small fault do you blame the GeneralIf he turns against you it is all over Then what can I do said Dong ZhuoRecall him tomorrow treat him well overwhelm him with gifts and fair words and all will be well So Dong Zhuo did soHe sent for Lu Bu and was very gracious and said I was irritable and hasty yesterday owing to my illness and I wronged you I knowForget it He gave Lu Bu three hundred ounces of gold and twenty rolls of brocade And so the quarrel was made upBut though Lu Bus body was with his adopted father Dong Zhuo his heart was with his promised bride Diao ChanDong Zhuo having quite recovered went to court again and Lu Bu followed him as usualSeeing Dong Zhuo deep in conversation with the Emperor Lu Bu armed as he was went out of the Palace and rode off to his chiefs residenceHe tied up his steed at the entrance and halberd in hand went to the private apartment to seek his loveHe found Diao Chan and she told him to go out into the garden where she would join him soonHe went taking his halberd with him and he leaned against the rail of the Phoenix Pavilion to wait for Diao ChanAfter a long time she appeared swaying gracefully as she made her way under the drooping willows and parting the flowers as she passed She was exquisite a perfect little fairy from the Palace of the Moon Tears were in her eyes as she came up and said Though I am not the Ministers real daughter yet he treated me as his own childThe desire of my life was fulfilled when he plighted me to you But ohto think of the wickedness of the Prime Minister stealing my poor self as he did I suffered so much I longed to die only that I had not told you the real truthSo I lived on bearing my shame as best as I could but feeling it mean still to liveNow that I have seen you I can end it allMy poor sullied body is no longer fit to serve a heroI can die before your eyes and so prove how true I am Thus speaking she seized the curving rail and started into the lily pondLu Bu caught her in his strong arms and wept as he held her close I knew it I always knew your heart he sobbedOnly we never had a chance to speak She threw her arms about Lu BuIf I cannot be your wife in this life I will in the ages to come she whisperedIf I do not marry you in this life I am no hero said heEvery day is a year long O pity me Rescue meMy lord I have only stolen away for a brief moment and I am afraid that old rebel will suspect something so I must not stay too long said Lu BuDiao Chan clung to his robe saying If you fear the old thief so much I shall never see another sunrise Lu Bu stoppedGive me a little time to think said he And he picked up his halberd to goIn the deep seclusion of the harem I heard the stories of your prowess you were the one man who excelled all othersLittle did I think that you of all heroes would rest content under the dominion of another And tears rained againA wave of shame flooded his face Leaning his halberd against the railing he turned and clasped the girl to his breast soothing her with fond wordsThe lovers held each other close swaying to and fro with emotion How could they bring themselves to say farewellIn the meantime Dong Zhuo missed his henchman and doubt filled his heart Hastily taking leave of the Emperor he mounted his chariot and returned to his palace There at the gate stood Lu Bus well known steed RedHare riderlessDong Zhuo questioned the doorkeepers and they told him the General was within He sent away his attendants and went alone to the private apartments Lu Bu was not thereHe called Diao Chan but there was no replyHe asked where she was and the waiting maids told him she was in the garden among the flowersSo Dong Zhuo went into the garden and there he saw the lovers in the pavilion in most tender talk Lu Bus trident halberd was leaning on the railing beside himA howl of rage escaped Dong Zhuo and startled the loversLu Bu turned saw who it was and ran awayDong Zhuo caught up the halberd and ran in pursuitBut Lu Bu was fleet of foot while his master was very stout Seeing no hope of catching the runaway Dong Zhuo hurled the halberdLu Bu fended it off and it fell to the ground Dong Zhuo picked it up and ran onBut by this time Lu Bu was far aheadJust as Dong Zhuo was running out at the garden gate he dashed full tilt against another man running in and down he wentSurged up his wrath within him as the billows heavenward leap Crashed his unwieldy body to earth in a shapeless heapWe shall presently see who the other runner was CHAPTER Lu Bu Kills Dong Zhuo For Wang Yun Li Jue Attacks The Capital On Jia Xus Advice The person who collided with the irate Dong Zhuo was his most trusty adviser Li RuLi Ru had not fallen in spite of the shock and at once scrambled to help Dong Zhuo to regain his feet and led him inside to the library where they sat down What were you coming about said Dong ZhuoHappening to be passing your gates I heard that you had gone into your private garden to look for your adopted sonThen came Lu Bu running and crying out that you wanted to kill him and I was coming in as fast as I could to intercede for him when I accidentally collided with youI am very sorryI deserve death The wretchHow could I bear to see him toying with my fair oneI will be the death of his yet Your Graciousness is making a mistake It is the plucked tassel story over again But if you remember the banquet of old time where all guests were to tear the tassels of their hatsIn that banquet King Zhuang of Chu made no fuss about the liberties taken with his queen although the hattassel in her hand betrayed the culprit Jiang Xiong His restraint stood him good stead for the same Jiang Xiong saved his life when he was hemmed in by the soldiers of QinAfter all Diao Chan is only a handmaid but Lu Bu is your trustiest friend and most dreaded commanderIf you took this chance of making the girl over to him your kindness would win his undying gratitudeI beg you Sir to think over it well Dong Zhuo hesitated a long time he sat murmuring to himself Presently he said What you say is right I must think over it Li Ru felt satisfiedHe took leave of his master and went awayDong Zhuo went to his private rooms and called Diao Chan What were you doing there with Lu Bu said heShe began to weep saying Thy handmaid was in the garden among the flowers when he rushed in on me I was frightened and ran awayHe asked why I ran away from a son of the family and pursued me right to the pavilion where you saw us He had that halberd in his hand all the timeI felt he was a vicious man and would force me to his will so I tried to throw myself into the lily pond but he caught me in his arms and held me so that I was helplessLuckily just at that moment you came and saved my life Suppose I send you to him said Dong ZhuoStunned she said in tears What have thy handmaid done The honor of serving only Your Highness could not stand being given to a mere underlingI would rather die And with this she snatched down a dagger hanging on the wall to kill herselfDong Zhuo plucked it from her hand and throwing his arms about her and cried I was only joking She lay back on his breast hiding her face and sobbing bitterlyThis is the doing of that Li Ru said sheHe is much too thick with Lu Bu He suggested that I knowLittle he cares for the Imperial Rectors reputation or my lifeI could eat him alive Do you think I could bear to lose you said Dong ZhuoThough you love me yet I must not stay here That Lu Bu will try to ruin me if I doI fear him We will go to Meiwo tomorrow you and I and we will be happy together and have no cares She dried her tears and thanked himNext day Li Ru came again to persuade Dong Zhuo to send the damsel to Lu Bu This is a propitious day said Li RuHe and I standing in the relation of father and son I cannot very well do that said Dong ZhuoBut I will say no more about his faultYou may tell him so and soothe him as well as you can You are not being beguiled by the woman are you said Li RuDong Zhuo colored saying Would you like to give your wife to some body elseDo not talk about this any furtherIt would be better not to Li Ru left the chamber When he got outside he cast his eyes up to heaven saying We are dead people slain by the hand of this girl When a scholar of history reached this episode he wrote a verse or two Just introduce a woman Conspiracies succeed Of soldiers or their weapons There really is no need They fought their bloody battles And doughty deeds were done But in a garden summer house The victory was wonThe order was given to journey to Meiwo and the whole body of officers assembled to add luster to the startDiao Chan from her carriage saw Lu Bu among the crowdShe at once dropped her eyes and assumed an appearance of deepest melancholyAfter the cavalcade started and when her carriage had almost disappeared in the distance the disappointed lover reined in his steed on a mount whence he could watch the dust that rose around it Unutterable sadness filled his heartSuddenly a voice said Why do you not accompany the Prime Minister General instead of standing here and sighing It was Wang YunI have been confined to the house by illness these few days continued he so I have not seen youBut I had to struggle out today to see the Prime Minister set off This meeting is most fortunateBut why were you sighing Just on account of that daughter of yours said Lu BuFeigning great astonishment Wang Yun said So long a time and yet not given to you The old ruffian has fallen in love with her himself Surely this cannot be true Lu Bu related the whole story while Wang Yun listened silent but stamping on the ground as with irritation and perplexityAfter a long time Wang Yun said I did not think he was such a beast Taking Lu Bu by the hand Wang Yun said Come to my house and we will talk it over So they went away together to the house and retired to a secret roomAfter some refreshments Lu Bu told the whole story of the episode in Phoenix Pavilion just as it happenedWang Yun said He seems to have corrupted my little girl and has stolen your wife He will be an object of shame and ridicule to the whole worldAnd those who do not laugh at him will laugh at you and meI am old and powerless and can do nothing More pitied than blamedBut you General you are a warrior the greatest hero in the world Yet you have been put to this shame and exposed to this contempt A wave of fierce wrath rolled up in Lu BuBanging the table he shouted and roaredHis host ostentatiously tried to calm him saying I forgot myself I should not have spoken like thatDo not be so angry I pray I will kill the wretch I swear it In no other way can I wash away my shame No noDo not say such a thing said Wang Yun putting his hand over the others mouthYou will bring trouble on poor me and my family When one is born great one cannot be patient for long under another persons domination said Lu BuIt needs some one greater than the Prime Minister to limit the scope of such talents as yours Lu Bu said I would not mind killing the old wretch were it not for the relation in which we standI fear to provoke the hostile criticism of posterity Wang Yun smiled saying Your name is Lu Bu his is Dong ZhuoWhere was the paternal feeling when he threw the halberd at you I had been misled if you had not said that said Lu Bu hotlyWang Yun saw the effect of his words and continued It would be a loyal deed to restore the House of Han and history would hand down your name to posterity perpetually fragrantIf you lend your aid to Dong Zhuo you will be a traitor and your name will be tainted through all ages Lu Bu rose from his place and bowed to Wang Yun I have decided said heYou need not fear Sir But yet you may fail and bring upon yourself misfortune said Wang YunLu Bu drew his dagger pricking his arm and swearing by the blood that flowed Wang Yun fell on his knees and thanked himThen the Han sacrifices will not be cut off and you will be their saviorBut this must remain a secret and I will tell you how the plot shall be worked out Lu Bu took leave with great emotionWang Yun took into his confidence two colleagues Minister Shisun Rui and Imperial Commander Huang WanShisun Rui said The moment is favorable The Emperor has just recovered from his illness and we can dispatch an able talker to Meiwo to persuade Dong Zhuo to come here to discuss affairsMeanwhile we will obtain a secret decree as authority for Lu Bu to lay an ambush just inside the palace gates to kill Dong Zhuo as he entersThis is the best plan to adopt But who would dare to go said Huang WanLi Su General of the Imperial Tiger Army would go He belongs to the same region as Lu Bu and is very angry with the Prime Minister for not advancing himHis going would assure us the plan would be completed Good said Wang YunLet us see what Lu Bu thinks of it When Lu Bu was consulted he told them that this Li Sus persuasion had led him to kill Ding Yuan his former benefactorIf Li Su refuses this mission I will kill him said Lu Bu So they sent for Li SuWhen Li Su arrived Lu Bu said Formerly you talked me into killing Ding Yuan and going over to Dong ZhuoNow we find Dong Zhuo means evil for the Emperor and is an oppressor of the people His iniquities are many and he is hated by gods and humansYou go to Meiwo say you have a command from the Emperor to summon the Prime Minister to the Palace He will come and he will be put to death You will have the credit of being loyal and restoring the Hans Will you undertake this I also wish to slay him was the reply But I could not find anyone to assist meHow can I hesitateYour intervention is directly from Heaven And Li Su snapped an arrow in twain as register of his oathIf this succeeds what glorious rank will be yours said Wang YunNext day Li Su with a small escort set out for Meiwo and announced himself as bearer of a decree He was conducted into Dong Zhuos presenceAfter he had made his obeisance Dong Zhuo asked what the decree wasHis Majesty has recovered and wishes his ministers to meet him in the Palace to consider the question of his abdication in your favorThat is what this summons means What does Wang Yun think of the scheme Wang Yun has already begun the construction of the Terrace of Abdication and only awaits my lords arrival Last night I dreamed a dragon coiled round my body said Dong Zhuo greatly pleased and now I get this happy tidingsI must not neglect the opportunity So Dong Zhuo gave instructions to his four trusted generals for the safekeeping of his city Li Jue Guo Si Fan Chou and Zhang Ji were to guard Meiwo with three thousand troops of the Flying Bear Army Then Dong Zhuo announced his intention of starting on the morrowWhen I am Emperor you shall be Commander of the Capital District said heYour minister thanks you said Li SuDong Zhuo went to bid farewell to his ninetyyearold mother Whither are you going my son asked sheI go to receive the abdication of Han and soon you will be the Empress I have been feeling nervous and creepy these few daysIt is a bad sign Any one about to become the Mother of the State must have premonitions said her sonHe left her with these wordsJust before starting he said to Diao Chan When I am Emperor you shall be Lady of the Palace She bowed low thanking him but she knew and inwardly rejoicedDong Zhuo went out mounted his carriage and began his journey to Capital Changan with an imposing escortLess than ten miles the wheel of his carriage broke He left it and mounted a horseAnother ten miles the horse snorted and neighed threw up his head and snapped the reins Dong Zhuo turned to Li Su and asked what these things portendedIt means that you are going to receive the abdication of the Hans which is to renew all things to mount the jeweled chariot and sit in the golden saddle And Dong Zhuo was pleased and convinced with this answerDuring the second days journey a violent gale sprang up and the sky became covered with a thick mist What does this mean said Dong ZhuoThe wily Li Su had an interpretation for this also saying You are ascending to the place of the dragon there must be bright light and lurid vapor to dignify your majestic approach Dong Zhuo had no more doubtsHe presently arrived and found many officials waiting without the city gate to receive him all but Li Ru who was ill and unable to leave his chamberHe entered and proceeded to his own palace where Lu Bu came to congratulate himWhen I sit on the throne you shall command the whole armies of the empire horse and foot said Dong Zhuo That night Dong Zhuo slept in the midst of his escortIn the suburbs that evening some children at play were singing a little ditty and the words drifted into the bedchamber on the windThe grass in the meadow looks fresh now and green Yet wait but ten days not a blade will be seen The song sounded ominous but Li Su was again prepared with a happy interpretationIt only means that the Lius are about to disappear and the Dongs to be exalted Next morning at the first streak of dawn Dong Zhuo prepared for his appearance at courtOn the way he saw a Taoist dressed in a black robe and wearing a white turban who carried in his hand a tall staff with a long strip of white cloth attached At each end of the cloth was drawn a mouthWhat is the meaning of this said Dong ZhuoHe is a madman said Li Su and he told the guards to drive the fellow awayDong Zhuo went in and found all the officials in court dress lining the roadLi Su walked beside his carriage a sword in his handWhen Li Su reached the north gate of the Palace he found the soldiers of Dong Zhuo drawn up outside and only the pushers of the palace carriage a twenty or so were allowed to proceed furtherWhen Dong Zhuo arrived near the Reception Hall he saw that Wang Yun and all the other officials standing at the door were armed Why are they all armed said Dong Zhuo to Li SuLi Su was silent as he helped push the carriage forward swiftly to the entranceSuddenly Wang Yun shouted The rebel is hereWhere are the executioners At this call sprang from both sides soldiers armed with halberds and spears who attacked Dong Zhuo He had not put on the breastplate he usually wore and a spear pierced his breastHe sank down in the carriage calling loudly for his son Where is Lu Bu Here and with a decree to deal with a rebel said Lu Bu as he appeared in front of his father Thereupon he thrust his trident halberd through the victims throatThen Li Su hacked off the head and held it upLu Bu his left hand holding his halberd thrust his right hand into his bosom whence he drew the decree crying The decree was to slay the rebel Dong Zhuo no other The whole assembly shouted Live forever O Emperor A sympathetic poet has written a few lines in pity Await the time O noble and be king Or failing reap the solace riches bring Heaven never is partial but severely just Meiwo stood strong yet now it lies in dustThe lust of blood awakened Lu Bu urged the slaughter of Li Ru who had been the confidant of the murdered Prime Minister and Li Su volunteered to go in search of himBut just then a shouting was heard at the gates and it was told them that a household servant had brought Li Ru in bondsWang Yun ordered his immediate execution in the market placeDong Zhuos head was exposed in a crowded thoroughfareHe was very fat and the guards made torches by sticking splints into the body spilling the corpses grease over the groundThe passersby pelted the head and spurned the body with their feetWang Yun ordered a force of fifty thousand under Lu Bu Huangfu Song and Li Su to destroy MeiwoLearning the news of their master Li Jue Guo Si Fan Chou and Zhang Ji fled west swiftly through the night with their Flying Bear Army to LiangzhouWhen arriving Meiwo Lu Bus first deed was to take Diao Chan into his chargeThen they slew every member of the Dong family sparing none not even Dong Zhuos aged motherThe heads of Dong Zhuos brother Dong Min and his nephew Dong Huang were publicly displayed in the market place In Meiwo were hidden many young ladies of good family These were set free All properties were confiscatedThe wealth was enormousseveral hundred thousand ounces of gold millions of silver coins pearls gems silks velvets furs grain storesWhen they returned to report success Wang Yun rewarded and feasted the soldiers Banquets were held in the Ministry Hall to which all the officials were invited They drank and congratulated each otherWhile the feasting was in progress it was announced that some one had come and was wailing over Dong Zhuos corpse exposed in the market placeDong Zhuo has been put to death said Wang Yun angrily Every body is glad to be rid of him and yet one is found to lament over himWho is this So Wang Yun gave orders to arrest the mourner and bring him in Soon he was brought in and when they saw him all were startled For he was no other than Imperial Historian Cai YongWang Yun spoke to Cai Yong angrily Dong Zhuo has been put to death as a rebel and all the land rejoicesYou a Han minister instead of rejoicing weep for himWhy Cai Yong confessed his fault saying I am without talent yet know what is right I am the man to turn my back on my country and toward Dong ZhuoYet once I experienced his kindness and I could not help mourning for him I know my fault is grave but I pray you regard the reasonsIf you will leave my head and only cut off my feet you may use me to continue the History of Han whereby I may have the good fortune to be allowed to expiate my fault All were sorry for Cai Yong for he was a man of great talents and they begged that he might be sparedThe Imperial Guardian Ma Midi secretly interceded for him saying Cai Yong is famous as a scholar and he can write glorious history and it is inadvisable to put to death a man renowned for rectitude without consideration But in vain for the High Minister was now strong and obdurateWang Yun said Centuries ago Emperor Wu spared Sima Qian and employed him on the annals with the result that many slanderous stories have been handed down to usThis is a trying period of great perplexity and we dare not let a specious fellow like this wield his pen in criticism of those about the court of a youthful prince and abuse us as he will Remonstrance and appeal being vain Ma Midi retiredBut he said to his colleagues Is Wang Yun then careless of the futureWorthy people are the mainstay of the state laws are the canons of action To destroy the mainstay and nullify the laws is to hasten destruction As was just said Wang Yun was obdurateCai Yong whose offense was an expression of gratitude was thrown into prison and there strangledThe people of that day wept for Cai Yong for they refused to see any offense in what he had done and death was a harsh punishmentDong Zhuo the dictator Tyrannized the state Fell and his sole mourner Shared his direful fateZhuge Liang in seclusion Was content to dream Felt his worth and never Helped a traitors schemeThose generalsLi Jue Guo Si Fan Chou and Zhang Jiwhom Dong Zhuo had left to guard Meiwo fled when their master was slain and went into the county of Shanxi in Liangzhou Region Thence they sent in a memorial entreating amnesty But Wang Yun would not hear of itFour of them were the chief instruments of Dong Zhuos aggressions Now though a general amnesty were proclaimed these men should be excluded from its benefit said Wang YunThe messenger returned and told the four there was no hope of pardon and they could only fleeThen their adviser Jia Xu said If we throw away our arms and flee singly then we shall fall easy victims to any village beadle who may seize usRather let us cajole the Shanxi people to throw in their lot with us and make a sudden onslaught on the capital and so avenge Dong ZhuoIf we succeed we control the court and the empireThere will be enough time to run away if we fail The plan was adopted and they spread abroad the story that Wang Yun intended to massacre the countyHaving thus thrown the people into a state of terror they went a step farther and said There is no advantage in dying for nothingRevolt and join us So they cajoled the people into joining them and gathered a host equal to one hundred thousand This horde was divided into four parts and they all set out to raid Capital ChanganOn the way they fell in with a soninlaw of their late chief Imperial Commander Niu Fu who marched five thousand troop from Xiliang Niu Fu had set out to avenge his fatherinlaw and he became the van leader of the hordeAs they advanced the news came to Wang Yun and he consulted Lu BuThey are a lot of rats said Lu Bu Never mind how many there are of themBe not in the least anxious So Lu Bu and Li Su went to oppose themThe latter was in advance and met Niu FuThey fought Niu Fu was outmatched and retired after suffering a slaughterBut unexpectedly Niu Fu returned in a night attack found Li Su quite unprepared and drove Li Sus force some ten miles slaying manyLi Su reported the defeat and Lu Bu raged at him saying You have sullied my reputation as a warrior and destroyed our fighting spirit And Lu Bu put Li Su to death exposing his head at the camp gateNext day Lu Bu advanced his own force and engaged Niu FuHe overwhelmed Niu Fu and drove him offThat night Niu Fu called in his most trusted man Hu Chier to advise him Hu Chier said Lu Bu is too doughty a fighter for us to hope to overcome him Our case is hopelessOur best course is to desert these four generals secrete their valuables and leave the army with just a few of our followers The plan of Hu Chier was adopted and the two traitors and some others that very night packed up and made their way out of camp They were only half a dozenThey came to a river and while crossing Hu Chier tempted by the lust of wealth slew his companion Then he went to offer the head of Niu Fu to Lu BuLu Bu inquired into the matter and when a follower told him the truth he put the double traitor Hu Chier to deathThen Lu Bu advanced against the rebels and fell in with Li Jues forceWithout giving them time to form in battle Lu Bu attacked Horses curvetting and spears set the army dashed in irresistibly and Li Jue making no stand fell back a long way Li Jue took up a position under a hill fifteen miles away and thence sent to call his fellows to council Li Jue said Lu Bu though brave in battle is no strategist and so not really formidableI will lead my troops to hold the mouth of the gorge and every day I will incite him to attack and when he comes toward me General Guo Si can smite his rear after the manner of Peng Yue when he fought against ChuWhile thus I am alternating attack and retreat Generals Fan Chou and Zhang Ji will march off in different directions toward Changan Such an attack at two points must end both Wang Yun and Lu Bu They set themselves to carry out this schemeAs soon as Lu Bu reached the hills a force of Li Jue came out to attack himLu Bu made an angry dash toward the enemy who retired up the hills whence they shot arrows and hurled stones like rain Lu Bus troops haltedAt this moment the report came that the rear was being attacked and there appeared Guo SiAt once Lu Bu wheeled toward the new enemy but immediately the rolling drums gave the signal to retire and Lu Bu could not come to blows with themAs he called in his army the gongs clanged on the other side and his former opponent Li Jue came to attack his frontBut before Lu Bu could join battle his rear was again assaulted by Guo Si who in his turn drew off immediatelyThus Lu Bu was baited till his bosom was near bursting with rageThe same tactics continued for several days He could neither strike his enemies nor escape them his troops had no rest In the midst of these distracting maneuver a messenger rode up in hot haste to reportThe capital is in imminent danger from a double attack of Fan Chou and Zhang Ji Lu Bu at once ordered a march to save the capital which became a rout when both his opponents Li Jue and Guo Si came in pursuit His loss was heavyHe soon reached Changan and found the rebels there in enormous numbers and the city quite surroundedLu Bus attack had but little effect and as his temper became more savage under defeat many of his soldiers went over to the rebels He fell into deep melancholyThen a remnant of Dong Zhuos adherents still in the city led by Li Meng and Wang Fang began to lend aid to the attackers and by and by they secretly opened the city gate and the besiegers poured in Lu Bu exerted himself to the utmost but could not stem the tideAt the head of some hundred horse he dashed over to the Black Lock Gate and called out to Wang Yun who was on the other side The case is desperate nowRide with me to a place of safety Wang Yun replied If I am gifted with the holy spirit of the state I shall succeed in restoring the tranquillity which I desire but if I have it not then I offer my body a sacrificeI will not quail before dangersThank the noble supporters beyond the Pass for their efforts and bid them remember their country Lu Bu urged Wang Yun again and again but Wang Yun would not leaveSoon flames started up ail over the city and Lu Bu had to leave abandoning his family to their fate He fled to seek refuge with Yuan ShuLi Jue Guo Si and his fellow leaders gave full license to their ruffians who robbed and murdered their fillMany high officers perished Ministers Chong Fu Lu Kui and Zhou Huan Imperial Commanders Cui Lie and Wang Qi all died in the fightingIn time the rebels penetrated to the inner palace and the courtiers begged the Emperor to proceed to the Gate of Pervading Peace to try to quell the riotingAt sight of the yellow umbrella Li Jue and Fan Chou checked their armies and they all shouted Long life O Emperor The Emperor stood by the tower and addressed them Nobles what means it that you enter the capital in this unruly manner and without my summons The two leaders looked up and said Dong Zhuo Your Majestys Prime Minister has been slain by Wang Yun and we are here to avenge him We are no rebels SireLet us only have Wang Yun and we draw off our troops Wang Yun was actually among the courtiers and at the Emperors sideHearing this demand he said The plan was made for the benefit of the Throne but as this evil has grown therefrom Your Majesty will not grudge losing meI have brought about evil and I will go down to these rebels The Emperor was torn with sorrow and waveredBut the faithful minister leaped from the wall crying Wang Yun is here The two leaders drew their swords crying For what crime was our master slain His crimes filled the heavens and covered the earth no tongue can tell themThe day he died was a day of rejoicing in the whole city as you well know said Wang YunAnd if he was guilty of some crime what had we done not to be forgiven Seditious rebels why bandy wordsI am ready to die And Wang Yun was slain at the foot of the towerMoved by the peoples sufferings Vexed at his princes grief Wang Yun compassed the traitors death That they might find reliefEvery one knows him a hero Leal to the state alwaysLiving he guarded the princely towers His soul keeps guard today Having done the loyal minister to death at the Emperors feet they proceeded to exterminate also his whole familyEvery one mournedThen said the ruffians to each other Having gone so far what could be better than to make away with the Emperor and complete our scheme The traitor condoned his crime Rebellion ought to cease But his licentious followers Disturb the empires peaceThe fate of the Emperor will be disclosed in the next chapterCHAPTER  Gathering Arms Ma Teng Moves To Rescue The Emperor Commanding An Army Cao Cao Marches to Avenges His Father In the last chapter the two arch rebels Li Jue and Guo Si proposed to murder Emperor Xian but their followers Zhang Ji and Fan Chou opposed this No the people will not approve of his death now Restore him to power and get the leaguers inside Changans control Remove his supporters and then we can compass his death And the empire shall be in our hands So they ceased the attackThe Emperor again spoke from the tower saying Why do you still remainYou have slain Wang Yun now withdraw these soldiers Then Li Jue and Guo Si replied Your servants desire rank us a reward for their good service to your dynasty And what rank Sirs All four wrote their wishes and handed them up to the Emperor who had no choice but to accede to the request and they were createdLi Jue was appointed General of the Flying Cavalry Lord of Chiyang Commander of Capital District Court Administrator and granted Military Insignia Guo Si was appointed General of the Rear Army Lord of Meiyang Court Administrator and granted Military InsigniaFan Chou was appointed General of the Right Army and Lord of Wanian Zhang Ji was appointed General of the Flying Cavalry and Lord of PingyanLi Meng and Wang Fang for opening the city gates were appointed Imperial CommanderAfter receiving ranks of nobility Li Jue and Guo Si thanked the Emperor and went away to camp at Xunung the suburb of Changan The inferior rebel leaders also were gratified with ranks And once more the capital was free of troops Dong Zhuos followers having so far succeeded did not forget their late leaderThey sought his corpse for burial but only a few fragments were discoverable Then they had sculptors engrave a statue of fragrant wood in his likeness laid that out in proper form and instituted a nobles sacrifices and prayers The remains were dressed in the robes of a prince laid in a princely coffin for burial They selected Meiwo for his tomb and having found an auspicious day conveyed the coffin thitherBut a terrific thunder storm came on at the time of inhumation and the ground was flooded The coffin was rived asunder and the poor remains knocked out by thundersA second time they buried the coffin but a similar thing happened in the nightAnd yet a third time in another place but the earth rejected the remains Meanwhile the thunderfire had entirely consumed themSo it may be said justly that Heaven was exceedingly angry with Dong ZhuoSo now Li Jue and Guo Si wielded the real power of the scepter and they were hard upon the peopleThey also removed the attendants from the Palace and replaced them by their own creatures who maintained a most perfect watch over every movement of the Emperor so that he was greatly hampered and embarrassedAll appointments and demotions were made by the two rebelsFor the sake of popularity they especially summoned Zhu Jun to court made him Minister of the Palace Bureau and associated him with the governmentOne day came a report that the Governor of Xiliang Ma Teng and the Imperial Protector of Bingzhou Han Sui with one hundred thousand troops are rapidly approaching the capital with the intention of attacking the rebels in the name of the EmperorNow these leaders from the west had laid careful plans Ma Teng and Han Sui had sent trusty friends to the capital to find out who would support them They had conspired with three officialsCourt Counselors Ma Yu and Chong Shao and Imperial Commander Liu Fanto be their inside allies and plot against the rebelsThese three obtained from the Throne two secret edicts conferring the ranks of Commander Who Conquers the West on Ma Teng and Commander Who Guards the West on Han Sui With these powers the two commanders joined forces and began their marchThe four leaders of the party in powerLi Jue Guo Si Fan Chou and Zhang Jiheld a consultation with their generals as to how to meet the attackAdviser Jia Xu said Since the attackers are coming from a distance our plan is to fortify and wait till shortage of food shall work for usIn a hundred days their supplies will be consumed and they must retireWe can pursue and we shall capture them Li Meng and Wang Fang rose and said This plan is badGive us ten thousand troops and we will put an end to both of them and offer their heads before your ensign To fight forthwith means defeat said Jia XuLi Meng and Wang Fang cried with one voice If we fail we are willing to lose our heads but if we win then your head is forfeit Jia Xu then suggested to Li Jue and Guo Si saying Seventy miles west of the capital stand the Zhouzhi Hills The passes are narrow and difficultSend Generals Zhang Ji and Fan Chou to occupy this point of vantage and fortify themselves so that they may support Li Meng and Wang Fang Li Jue and Guo Si accepted this adviceThey told off fifteen thousand horse and foot and Li Meng and Wang Fang left in high spiritThey made a camp ninety miles from ChanganThe force from the west arrived Ma Teng and Han Sui led out their troops to the attackThey found their opponents Li Meng and Wang Fang in battle array Ma Teng and Han Sui rode to the front side by sidePointing to the rebel leaders the commanders abused them crying Those are traitors who will capture them Hardly were the words spoken when there came out a youth general with a clear white complexion as jade eyes like shooting stars lithe of body and strong of limbHe was armed with a long spear and bestrode an excellent steedThis young leader was Ma Chao son of Ma Teng then seventeen years of age Though young he was a supreme valianceWang Fang despising him on account of his youth galloped forth to fight himBefore they had exchanged many passes Wang Fang was disabled and fell to a thrust of the young Ma Chaos spearThe victor turned to retire into the formation but Li Meng rode after Ma Chao to avenge his fallen colleagueMa Chao did not see Li Meng but his father called out You are followed Hardly had Ma Teng spoken when he saw that the pursuer was a prisoner seated on his sons steedNow Ma Chao had known he was followed but pretended not to see waiting till his enemy should have come close and lifted his spear to strikeThen Ma Chao suddenly wheeled about The spear thrust met only empty air and as the horses passed Ma Chaos powerful arm shot out and pulled Li Meng from the saddleThus Li Meng and Wang Fangs soldiers were left leaderless and fled in all directionsThe army of Ma Teng and Han Sui dashed in pursuit and a complete victory was scored They pressed into one of the passes and made a camp Then they decapitated Li Meng and exposed his headWhen Li Jue and Guo Si heard that both the boastful generals had fallen under the hand of one young man they knew that Jia Xu had given good advice and was gifted with clear prescience So they valued his plans the more highly and decided to act on the defensive They refused all challenges to combatSurely enough after a couple of months the supplies of the Xiliang force were all exhausted and the leaders began to consider retreat Just at this juncture a household servant of Ma Yus family betrayed his master and told of the conspiracy of the three court officials to assist the attackersThe two chiefs Li Jue and Guo Si in revenge seized the three conspiratorsMa Yu Chong Shao and Liu Fan with every member of their households and beheaded them in the market place The heads of the three were exposed at the front gate of the capitalBeing short of food and hearing of the destruction of their three adherents in the city the only course for Ma Teng and Han Sui was to retreatAt once Zhang Ji went in pursuit of Ma Teng and Fan Chou followed Han SuiThe retreating army under Ma Teng was beaten and only by Ma Chaos desperate efforts were the pursuers driven offFan Chou pursued the other army and when he had come close Han Sui rode boldly up and addressed him saying You and I Sir are fellow villagersWhy then behave so unfriendly Fan Chou replied I must obey the commands of my chief I am here for the service of the state why do you press me so hard said Han SuiAt this Fan Chou turned his horse called in his troops and left Han Sui in peaceUnwittingly a nephew of Li Jue had been a witness of this scene and when he saw the enemy allowed to go free he returned and told his uncleAngry that his enemy had escaped Li Jue would have sent an army to wreak vengeance on his general but his adviser Jia Xu again came in saying The people are yet unsettled it was dangerous to provoke another warInstead invite Fan Chou to a banquet and while the feast was in progress executing him for dereliction of duty This seemed good to Li Jue so the banquet was preparedZhang Ji and Fan Chou accepted their invitations and went cheerfullyToward the latter part of the entertainment a sudden change came over their host Li Jue and he suddenly asked Fan Chou Why have you been intriguing with Han SuiYou are turning traitor eh The unhappy guest was taken aback and before he could frame his words to reply he saw the assassins rush out with swords and axes In a moment all was over and Fan Chous head lay beneath the tableScared beyond measure his fellowguest Zhang Ji groveled on the floorFan Chou was a traitor said the host raising Zhang Ji by the arm and he has his deserts you are my friend and need not fear Li Jue gave Zhang Ji command of Fan Chous army with which Zhang Ji returned to his headquarters garrison in HongnongNo one of the leaders among the leaguers dared attempt an attack on the party newly risen from Dong Zhuos disaffection while on the other hand Jia Xu never ceased to urge his masters to exert themselves for the welfare of the people and thus to tempt wise people to join themAnd by these means the government began to prosper and the court to reassert its authorityHowever a new trouble arose in the shape of a resurgence of Yellow Scarves in Qingzhou They came under numerous chieftains in the number of hundreds of thousand and plundered any place they reachedMinister Zhu Jun said he knew of one who could destroy this sedition and when asked who was the man he proposed Zhu Jun said You want to destroy this horde of rebels you will fail unless you get the services of Cao Cao And where is he asked Li Jue He is Governor of DongjunHe has a large army and you have only to order him to act the rising will be broken A messenger went post haste with a command for Cao Cao and Bao Xin Lord of Jibei to act together in quelling the rebellionAs soon as Cao Cao received the court command he arranged with his colleague first to attack the rebels at ShouyangBao Xin made a dash right into their midst and inflicting damage wherever he could but he was killed in a battleCao Cao pursued the rebels as they fled Ten thousand surrenderedThen Cao Cao put his quondam enemies in the van and when his army reached any place many more surrendered and joined himAfter three months of these tactics he had won over many thousands both of soldiers and ordinary folksOf these new adherents the strongest and boldest were made the Qingzhou Army and the others were sent home to their fieldsIn consequence of these successes Cao Caos prestige and fame became very great and increased dailyHe reported his success to Capital Changan and was rewarded with the title of General Who Guards the EastAt his headquarters in Yanzhou Cao Cao welcomed wise counselors and bold warriors and many gathered around himTwo clever persons uncle and nephew came at the same time both from Yanzhou named Xun Yu and Xun YouThe uncle had once been in the service of Yuan Shao Cao Cao rejoiced when he had won the elder Xun to his side saying Xun Yu is my Zhang Liang He made Xun Yu a Marching General The nephew Xun You was famed for his ability and had been in the court service when it was in Luoyang but he had abandoned that career and retired to his villageCao Cao made him a Military InstructorXun Yu said to Cao Cao There is a certain wise person of Yanzhou somewhere but I do not know in whose service he is Who is he Cheng Yu he belongs to the eastern region of Yanzhou Yes I have heard of him said Cao CaoSo a messenger was sent to his native place to inquireCheng Yu was away in the hills engaged in study but he came at Cao Caos invitationI shall prove unworthy of your recommendation said Cheng Yu to his friend Xun Yu for I am rough and ignorantBut have you forgotten a fellow villager of yours Guo Jia He is really able Why not spread the net to catch him I had nearly forgotten said Xun Yu suddenly So he told Cao Cao of this man who was at once invitedGuo Jia discussing the world at large with Cao Cao recommended Liu Ye from Henan who was a descendant of Liu Xiu the Founder of Latter HanWhen Liu Ye had arrived he was the means of inviting two moreMan Chong from Shanyang and Lu Qian from Wucheng who were already known to Cao Cao by reputation These two brought to their new masters notice the name of Mao Jie from Chenliu who also came and was given officeThen a famous leader with his troop of some hundreds arrived to offer serviceThis was Yu Jin of Taishan an expert horseman and archer and skilled beyond his fellows in every form of military exercise He was made an army inspectorThen another day Xiahou Dun brought a fellow to present to Cao Cao Who is he asked Cao Cao He is from Chenliu and is named Dian Wei He is the boldest of the bold the strongest of the strongHe was one of Zhang Miaos people but quarreled with his tent companions and killed some dozens of them with his fists Then he fled to the mountains where I found himI was out shooting and saw him follow a tiger across a stream I persuaded him to join my troop and I recommend him I see he is no ordinary man said Cao CaoHe is fine and straight and looks very powerful and bold He isHe killed a man once to avenge a friend and carried his head through the whole market place Hundreds saw him but dared not come nearThe weapon he uses now is a couple of spears each weighs a hundred and twenty pounds and he vaults into the saddle with these under his arm Cao Cao bade the man give proof of his skillSo Dian Wei galloped to and fro carrying the spearsThen he saw away among the tents a huge banner swaying dangerously with the force of the wind and on the point of falling A crowd of soldiers were vainly struggling to keep it steadyDown he leaped shouted to the men to clear out and held the staff quite steady with one hand keeping it perfectly upright in spite of the strong windThis is old E Lai again said Cao CaoHe gave Dian Wei a post in the headquarters and besides made Dian Wei presents of an embroidered robe he was wearing and a swift steed with a handsome saddleCao Cao encouraged able people to assist him and he had advisers on the civil side and valiant generals in the army He became famous throughout the East of the Pass Now Cao Caos father Cao Song was living at Langye whither he had gone as a place free from the turmoil of the partisan strugglesNow Cao Cao wished to be united with him As a dutiful son Cao Cao sent the Governor of Taishan Ying Shao to escort his father to Yanzhou Old Cao Song read the letter with joy and the family prepared to moveThey were some forty in all with a train of a hundred servants and many cartsTheir road led through Xuzhou where the Imperial Protector Tao Qian was a sincere and upright man who had long wished to get on good terms with Cao Cao but hitherto had found no means of effecting a bond of unionHearing that the family of the great man was passing through his region Tao Qian went to welcome them treated them with great cordiality feasting and entertaining them for two days and when they left he escorted them to his boundaryFurther he sent with them one General Zhang Kai with a special escort of five hundredThe whole party reached the county of Huafei It was the end of summer just turning into autumn and at this place they were stopped by a tremendous storm of rain The only shelter was an old temple and thither they went The family occupied the main rooms and the escort the two side wingsThe men of the escort were drenched angry and discontentedThen Zhang Kai called some of his petty officers to a secret spot and said We are old Yellow Scarves and only submitted to Tao Qian because there was no other choice We have never got much out of itNow here is the Cao family with no end of gear and we can be rich very easily We will make a sudden onslaught tonight at the third watch and slay the whole lot Then we shall have plenty of treasure and we will get away to the mountains They all agreedThe storm continued into the night and as Cao Song sat waiting anxiously for signs of clearing he suddenly heard a hubbub at the west end of the templeHis brother Cao De drawing his sword went out to see what it was about and Cao De was at once cut downCao Song seized one of the concubines by the hand rushed with her through the passage toward the back of the temple so that they might escapeBut the lady was stout and could not get through the narrow doors so the two hid in one of the small outhouses at the side However they were seen and slainThe unhappy Governor Ying Shao fled for his life to Yuan ShaoThe murderers fled into the South of River Huai with their plunder after having set fire to the old templeCao Cao whom the ages praise Slew his hosts on his former flight Nemesis never turns aside Murdered too his family diedSome of the escort escaped and took the evil tidings to Cao CaoWhen he heard it he fell to the earth with a great cry They raised himWith set teeth he muttered Tao Qians people have slain my father no longer can the same sky cover usI will sweep Xuzhou off the face of the earthOnly thus can I satisfy my vengeance Cao Cao left one small army of thirty thousand under Xun Yu and Cheng Yu to guard the east headquarters and the three counties of Juancheng Fanxia and Dongjun Then he set forth with all the remainder to destroy Xuzhou and avenge his fatherXiahou Dun Yu Jin and Dian Wei were Van Leaders with Cao Caos orders to slaughter all the inhabitants of each captured city Now the Governor of Jiujiang Bian Rang was a close friend of Tao QianHearing Xuzhou was threatened Bian Rang set out with five thousand troops to his friends aidAngered by this move Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun to stop and kill Bian Rang while still on the marchAt this time Chen Gong was in office in Dongjun and he was also on friendly terms with Tao QianHearing of Cao Caos design to destroy the whole population Chen Gong came in haste to see his former companionCao Cao knowing Chen Gongs errand put him off at first and would not see him But then Cao Cao could not forget the kindness he had formerly received from Chen Gong and presently the visitor was called to his tentChen Gong said They say you go to avenge your fathers death on Xuzhou to destroy its people I have come to say a wordImperial Protector Tao Qian is humane and a good man He is not looking out for his own advantage careless of the means and of othersYour worthy father met his unhappy death at the hands of Zhang Kai Tao Qian is guiltlessStill more innocent are the people and to slay them would be an evilI pray you think over it Cao Cao retorted angrily You once abandoned me and now you have the impudence to come to see meTao Qian slew my whole family and I will tear his heart out in revenge I swear it You may speak for your friend and say what you willI shall be as if I heard not Intercession had failedChen Gong sighed and took his leave He said AlasI cannot go to Tao Qian and look upon his face So Chen Gong rode off to the county of Chenliu to give service to Governor Zhang MiaoCao Caos army of revenge laid waste whatever place it passed through slaying the people and desecrating their cemeteries When Tao Qian heard the terrible tidings he looked up to heaven saying I must be guilty of some fault before Heaven to have brought this evil upon my people He called together his officials to consultOne of them Cao Bao said Now the enemy is upon us we cannot sit and await death with folded handsI for one will help you to make a fight Tao Qian reluctantly sent the army outFrom a distance he saw Cao Caos army spread abroad like frost and rushed far and wide like snow In their midst was a large white flag and on both sides was written Vengeance When he had ranged his troops Cao Cao rode out dressed in mourning white and abused Tao QianBut Tao Qian advanced and from beneath his ensign he bowed low and said I wished to make friends with you Illustrious Sir and so I sent Zhang Kai to escort your familyI knew not that his rebel heart was still unchangedThe fault does not lie at my door as you must see You old wretch you killed my father and now you dare to mumble this nonsense said Cao CaoAnd he asked who would go out and seize Tao QianXiahou Dun undertook this service and rode outTao Qian fled to the inner portion of his array and as Xiahou Dun came on Cao Bao went to meet himBut just as the two horses met a hurricane burst over the spot and the flying dust and pebbles threw both sides into the utmost confusion Both drew off Tao Qian retired into the city and called his officers to council The force against us is too strong said he I will give myself up as a prisoner and let him wreak his vengeance on meI may save the people But a voice was heard saying You have long ruled here and the people love youStrong as the enemy are they are not necessarily able to break down our walls especially when defended by you and your peopleI have a scheme to suggest that I think will make Cao Cao die in a place where he will not find burial These bold words startled the assembly and they eagerly asked what the scheme wasMaking overtures for friendship Tao Qian encountered deadly hate But where danger seemed most threatening he discovered safetys gateThe next chapter will disclose who the speaker was CHAPTER Liu Bei Rescues Kong Rong At Beihai Lu Bu Defeats Cao Cao Near Puyang It was one Mi Zhu who said he knew how to defeat Cao Cao utterlyMi Zhu came of a wealthy family of merchants in Donghai and trading in Luoyang One day traveling homeward from that city in a carriage he met an exquisitely beautiful lady trudging along the road who asked him to let her ride He stopped and yielded his place to her She invited him to share the seat with herHe mounted but sat rigidly upright never even glancing in her direction They traveled thus for some miles when she thanked him and alightedJust as she left she said I am the Goddess of Fire from the Southern Land I am on my way to execute a decree of the Supreme God to burn your dwelling but your extreme courtesy has so deeply touched me that I now warn youHasten homeward remove your valuables for I must arrive tonight Thereupon she disappearedMi Zhu hastily finished his journey and as soon as he arrived moved everything out of his houseSure enough that night a fire started in the kitchen and involved the whole houseAfter this he devoted his wealth to relieving the poor and comforting the afflictedTao Qian gave him the magistracy office he then held The plan Mi Zhu proposed was this I will go to Beihai and beg Governor Kong Rong to helpAnother should go to Qingzhou on a similar mission to get the help from Imperial Protector Tien KaiIf the armies of these two places march on Cao Cao he will certainly retire Tao Qian accepted the plan and wrote two lettersHe asked for a volunteer to go to Qingzhou and a certain Chen Deng offered himself and after he had left Mi Zhu was formally entrusted with the mission to the north Meanwhile Tao Qian and his generals would hold the city as they couldKong Rong was a native of Qufu in the old state of Lu He was one of the twentieth generation in descent from the great Teacher ConfuciusKong Rong had been noted as a very intelligent lad somewhat precocious When ten years old he had gone to see Li Ying the Governor of Henan but the doorkeeper demurred to letting him in But when Kong Rong said I am Minister Li Yings intimate friend he was admitted Li Ying asked Kong Rong what relations had existed between their families that might justify the term intimateThe boy replied Of old my ancestor Confucius questioned your ancestor the Taoist sage Laozi concerning ceremonies So our families have known each other for many generations Li Ying was astonished at the boys ready witPresently High Minister Chen Wei visited to whom Li Ying told the story of his youthful guestHe is a wonder this boy said Li Ying pointing to Kong RongChen Wei replied It does not follow that a clever boy grows up into a clever man The lad took him up at once saying By what you say Sir you were certainly one of the clever boys The minister adviser and the governor all laughed saying The boy is going to be a noble vessel Thus from boyhood Kong Rong was famousAs a man he rose to be an Imperial Commander and was sent as Governor to Beihai where he was renowned for hospitality He used to quote the linesLet the rooms be full of friends And the cups be full of wineThat is what I like After six years at Beihai the people were devoted to himThe day that Mi Zhu arrived Kong Rong was as usual seated among his guests and the messenger was ushered in without delayIn reply to a question about the reason of the visit Mi Zhu presented Tao Qians letter which said that Cao Cao was pressing on Xuzhou City and the Imperial Protector prayed for helpThen said Kong Rong Your master and I are good friends and your presence here constrains me to go to his aidHowever I have no quarrel with Cao Cao either so I will first write to him to try to make peaceIf he refuses my offer then I must set the army in motion Cao Cao will not listen to proposals of peace he is too certain of his strength said Mi ZhuKong Rong wrote his letter and also gave orders to muster his troopsJust at this moment happened another rising of the Yellow Scarves ten thousand of them and the ruffians began to rob and murder at BeihaiIt was necessary to deal with them first and Kong Rong led his army outside the cityThe rebel leader Guan Hai rode out to the front saying I know this county is fruitful and can well spare ten thousand carts of grainGive me that and we retire refuse and we will batter down the city walls and destroy every soul Kong Rong shouted back I am a servant of the great Hans entrusted with the safety of their landThink you I will feed rebels  Guan Hai whipped his steed whirled his sword around his head and rode forwardZong Bao one of Kong Rongs generals set his spear and rode out to give battle but after a very few bouts Zong Bao was cut downSoon the soldiers fell into panic and rushed pellmell into the city for protectionThe rebels then laid siege to the city on all sidesKong Rong was very downhearted and Mi Zhu who now saw no hope for the success of his mission was grieved beyond wordsThe sight from the city wall was exceeding sad for the rebels were there in enormous numbers One day standing on the wall Kong Rong saw afar a man armed with a spear riding hard in among the Yellow Scarves and scattering them before him like chaff before the windBefore long the man had reached the foot of the wall and called out Open the gate But the defenders would not open to an unknown man and in the delay a crowd of rebels gathered round the rider along the edge of the moatSuddenly wheeling about the warrior dashed in among them and bowled over a dozen at which the others fell back At this Kong Rong ordered the wardens to open the gates and let the stranger enterAs soon as he was inside he dismounted laid aside his spear ascended the wall and made humble obeisance to the GovernorMy name is Taishi Ci and I am from the county of LaihuangI only returned home yesterday from the north to see my mother and then I heard that your city was in danger from a rebel attackMy mother said you had been very kind to her and told me I should try to helpSo I set out all alone and here I am This was cheeringKong Rong already knew Taishi Ci by reputation as a valiant fighting man although they two had never metThe son being far away from his home Kong Rong had taken his mother who dwelt a few miles from the city under his especial protection and saw that she did not suffer from wantThis had won the old ladys heart and she had sent her son to show her gratitudeKong Rong showed his appreciation by treating his guest with the greatest respect making him presents of clothing and armor saddles and horsesPresently said Taishi Ci Give me a thousand soldiers and I will go out and drive off these fellows You are a bold warrior but these are very numerousIt is a serious matter to go out among them said Kong Rong My mother sent me because of your goodness to herHow shall I be able to look her in the face if I do not raise the siegeI would prefer to conquer or perish I have heard Liu Bei is one of the heroes in the world and if we could get his help there would be no doubt of the resultBut there is no one to send I will go as soon as I have received your letter So Kong Rong wrote letters and gave them to his helperTaishi Ci put on his armor mounted his steed attached his bow and quiver to his girdle took his spear in his hand tied his packed haversack firmly to his saddle bow and rode out at the city gate He went quite aloneAlong the moat a large party of the besiegers were gathered and they came to intercept the solitary riderBut Taishi Ci dashed in among them and cut down several and so finally fought his way throughGuan Hai hearing that a rider had left the city guessed what his errand would be and followed Taishi Ci with a party of horsemen Guan Hai spread them out so that the messenger rider was entirely surroundedThen Taishi Ci laid aside his spear took his bow adjusted his arrows one by one and shot all round him And as a rider fell from his steed with every twang of Taishi Cis bowstring the pursuers dared not close inThus he got clear away and rode in hot haste to Liu BeiTaishi Ci reached Pingyuan and after greeting his host in proper form he told how Kong Rong was surrounded and had sent him for help Then he presented the letter which Liu Bei readAnd who are you asked Liu BeiI am Taishi Ci a fellow from LaihuangI am not related by ties of kin to Kong Rong nor even by ties of neighborhood but I am by the bonds of sentiment and I share his sorrows and misfortunesThe Yellow Scarves have invested his city and he is distressed with none to turn to and destruction is very nearYou are known as humane righteous and eager to help the distressed Therefore at his command I have braved all dangers and fought my way through his enemies to pray you save him Liu Bei smiled saying And does he know there is a Liu Bei in this world So Liu Bei together with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei told off three thousand troops and set out to help raise the siegeWhen the rebel leader Guan Hai saw these new forces arriving he led out his army to fight them thinking he could easily dispose of so small a force The brothers and Taishi Ci with them sat on their horses in the forefront of their array Guan Hai hastened forwardTaishi Ci was ready to fight but Guan Yu had opened the combatHe rode forth and the two steeds met The soldiers set up a great shout for how could there be any doubt of the resultAfter a few bouts Guan Yus greendragon saber rose and fell and with the stroke fell the rebel leader This was the signal for Zhang Fei and Taishi Ci to take a share and they advanced side by side With their spears ready they dashed in and Liu Bei urged forward his forceThe besieged Governor saw his doughty rescuers laying low the rebels as tigers among a flock of sheep None could withstand them and he then sent out his own troops to join in the battle so that the rebels were between two armiesThe rebels force was completely broken and many troops surrendered while the remainder scattered in all directionsThe victors were welcomed into the city and as soon as possible a banquet was prepared in their honor Mi Zhu was presented to Liu BeiMi Zhu related the story of the murder of Cao Song by Zhang Kai Cao Caos vengeful attack on Xuzhou and his coming to beg for assistanceLiu Bei said Imperial Protector Tao Qian is a kindly man of high character and it is a pity that he should suffer this wrong for no fault of his own You are a scion of the imperial family said Governor Kong Rong and this Cao Cao is injuring the people a strong man abusing his strengthWhy not go with me to rescue the sufferers I dare not refuse but my force is weak and I must act cautiously said Liu BeiThough my desire to help arises from an old friendship yet it is a righteous act as well I do not think your heart is not inclined toward the right said Kong RongLiu Bei said This being so you go first and give me time to see Gongsun Zan from whom I may borrow more troops and horsesI will come anon You surely will not break your promise said the GovernorWhat manner of man think you that I am said Liu BeiThe wise one said Death is common to all the person without truth cannot maintain the self Whether I get the troops or not certainly I shall myself come So the plan was agreed toMi Zhu set out to return forthwith while Kong Rong prepared for his expeditionTaishi Ci took his leave saying My mother bade me come to your aid and now happily you are safeLetters have come from my fellow townsman Liu Yao Imperial Protector of Yangzhou calling me thither and I must goI will see you again Kong Rong pressed rewards upon Taishi Ci but he would accept nothing and departedWhen his mother saw him she was pleased at his success saying she rejoiced that he had been able to prove his gratitude and after this he departed for YangzhouLiu Bei went away to his friend Gongsun Zan and laid before Gongsun Zan his design to help XuzhouCao Cao and you are not enemies why do you spend yourself for the sake of another said Gongsun ZanI have promised Liu Bei replied and dare not break faith I will lend you two thousand horse and foot said Gongsun ZanAlso I wish to have the services of Zhao Yun said Liu BeiGongsun Zan agreed to this also They marched away Liu Beis own troops being in the front and Zhao Yun with the borrowed troops being in rearIn due course Mi Zhu returned saying that Kong Rong had also obtained the services of Liu BeiThe other messenger Chen Deng came back and reported that Tien Kai would also bring help Then was Tao Qians heart set at easeBut both the leaders though they had promised aid greatly dreaded their antagonist and camped among the hills at a great distance fearful of coming to close quartersCao Cao knew of their coming and divided his army into parts to meet them so postponing the attack on the city itselfPresently Liu Bei came up and went to see Kong Rong who said The enemy is very powerful and Cao Cao handles his army skillfully We must be cautiousLet us make most careful observations before we strike a blow What I fear is famine in the city said Liu Bei They cannot hold out very longI will put my troops with yours under your command while I with Zhang Fei make a dash through to see Tao Qian and consult with him Kong Rong approved of this so he and Tien Kai took up positions on the oxhorn formation with Guan Yu and Zhao Yun on either side to support themWhen Liu Bei and Zhang Fei leading one thousand troops made their dash to get through Cao Caos army they got as far as the flank of his camp when there arose a great beating of drums and horse and foot rolled out like billows on the ocean The leader was Yu JinHe checked his steed and called out You mad men from somewhere where are you going Zhang Fei heard Yu Jin but deigned no replyHe only rode straight to attack the speakerAfter they had fought a few bouts Liu Bei waved his double swords as signal for his troops to come on and they drove Yu Jin before themZhang Fei led the pursuit and in this way they reached the city wallFrom the city wall the besieged saw a huge banner embroidered in white Liu Bei of Pingyuan and the Imperial Protector bade them open the gate for the rescuers to enterLiu Bei was made very welcome conducted to the residency and a banquet prepared in his honor The soldiers also were feastedTao Qian was delighted with Liu Bei admiring his highspirited appearance and clear speech Tao Qian bade Mi Zhu offer Liu Bei the seal and insignia of the protectorship office But Liu Bei shrank back startledWhat does this mean said Liu BeiTao Qian said There is trouble on every side and the kingly rule is no longer maintainedYou Sir are a member of the family and eminently fitted to support them and their prerogativesI am verging on senility and I wish to retire in your favorI pray you not to decline and I will report my action to the court Liu Bei started up from his seat and bowed before his host saying Scion of the family I may be but my merit is small and my virtue meagerI doubt my fitness even for my present post and only a feeling of doing right sent me to your assistance To hear such speech makes me doubtSurely you think I came with greed in my heartMay God help me no more if I cherished such a thought It is a poor old mans real sentiment said Tao Qian Time after time Tao Qian renewed his offer to entrust the region of Xuzhou to Liu Bei but Liu Bei kept refusingIn the midst of this came Mi Zhu saying The enemies had reached the wall and something must be done to drive them offThe present matter could await a more tranquil time Said Liu Bei I ought to write to Cao Cao to press him to raise the siegeIf he refuses we will attack forthwith Orders were sent to the three camps outside to remain quiescent till the letter could reach Cao CaoIt happened that Cao Cao was holding a council when a messenger with a war letter was announcedThe letter was brought in and handed to him and when he had opened and looked at it he found it was from Liu Bei This is the letter very nearlySince meeting you outside the pass fate has assigned us to different quarters of the world and I have not been able to pay my respects to youTouching the death of your noble father it was owing to the vicious nature of Zhang Kai and due to no fault of Tao QianNow while the remnant of the Yellow Scarves is disturbing the lands and Dong Zhuos partisans have the upper hand in the capital I wish that you Illustrious Sir would regard the critical position of the court rather than your personal grievances and so divert your forces from the attack on Xuzhou to the rescue of the stateSuch would be for the happiness of that city and the whole world Cao Cao gave vent to a torrent of abuseWho is this Liu Bei that he dares write and exhort meBeside he means to be satirical Cao Cao issued orders to put the bearer of the letter to death and to press on the siegeBut Guo Jia remonstrated saying Liu Bei has come from afar to help Tao Qian and he is trying the effect of politeness before resorting to arms I pray you my lord reply with fair words that his heart may be lulled with a feeling of safetyThen attack with vigor and the city will fall Cao Cao found this advice good so he spared the messenger telling him to wait to carry back his replyWhile this was going on a horseman came with news of misfortuneLu Bu has invaded Yanzhou now holding Puyang The three counties leftJuancheng Fanxia and Dongjunare under severe attacks When Li Jue and Guo Si the two partisans of Dong Zhuo succeeded in their attack on the capital Lu Bu had fled to Yuan ShuHowever Yuan Shu looked askance at him for his instability and refused to receive him Then Lu Bu went to try Yuan Shao who was a brother of Yuan ShuYuan Shao accepted the warrior and made use of him in an attack upon Zhang Yan in ChangshanBut his success filled him with pride and his arrogant demeanor so annoyed the other commanders that Yuan Shao was on the point of putting him to deathTo escape this Lu Bu had gone away to Zhang Yang Governor of Shangdang who accepted his servicesAbout this time Pang Shu who had been hiding and protecting Lu Bus family in Changan since his disappearance restored them to himThis deed angered Li Jue and Guo Si so that they put Pang Shu to death and wrote to Lu Bus protector to serve him the same To escape this Lu Bu once again had to flee and this time joined himself to Zhang MiaoLu Bu arrived just as Zhang Miaos brother Zhang Chao was introducing Chen GongChen Gong said to Zhang Miao The rupture of the empire has begun and warriors are seizing what they canIt is strange that you with all the advantages of population and provisions you enjoy do not strike for independenceCao Cao has gone on an expedition against the east leaving his own territory defenselessLu Bu is one of the fighting people of the day If you and he together attacked and got Yanzhou you could then proceed to the dominion Zhang Miao was pleased and resolved to tryHe ordered an attack and soon Lu Bu was in possession of Yanzhou and its neighborhood all but three small counties of Juancheng Fanxia and Dongjun which were vigorously and desperately defended by Xun Yu and Cheng Yu in concertCao Caos cousin Cao Ren had fought many battles but was repeatedly defeated and the messenger with the evil tidings had come from him asking prompt helpCao Cao was greatly disturbed by this and said If my own region be lost I have no home to return toI must do something at once The best thing would be to become friends with Liu Bei at any cost and return to Yanzhou said Guo JiaThen Cao Cao wrote to Liu Bei gave the letter to the waiting messenger and broke campThe news that the enemy had left was very gratifying to Tao Qian who then invited his various defenders into Xuzhou City and prepared banquets and feasts in token of his gratitude At one of these when the feasting was over he proceeded with his wish of retirement in favor of Liu BeiPlacing Liu Bei in the seat of highest honor Tao Qian bowed before him and then addressed the assembly I am old and feeble and my two sons lack the ability to hold so important an office as thisThe noble Liu Bei is a descendant of the imperial house He is of lofty virtue and great talentLet him then take over the rule of this region and only too willingly I shall retire to have leisure to nurse my health Liu Bei replied I came at the request of Governor Kong Rong because it was the right thing to doXuzhou is saved but if I take it surely the world will say I am a wicked man Mi Zhu said You may not refuseThe House of Han is falling their realm is crumbling and now is the time for doughty deeds and signal servicesThis is a fertile region well populated and rich and you are the man to rule over it But I cannot accept said Liu BeiImperial Protector Tao Qian is a great sufferer said Chen Deng and cannot see to mattersYou may not decline Sir Said Liu Bei Yuan Shu belongs to a family of rulers who have held the highest offices of state four times in three generations The multitude people respects himWhy not invite him to this task Because Yuan Shu is a drying skeleton in a dark tomb not worth talking aboutThis opportunity is a gift from Heaven and you will never cease to regret its loss said Kong Rong So spoke Kong Rong but still Liu Bei obstinately refusedTao Qian besought him with tears saying I shall die if you leave me and there will be none to close my eyes Brother you should accept the offer thus made said Guan Yu Why so much fuss said Zhang FeiWe have not taken the place it is he who wishes to give it you You all persuade me to do what is wrong said Liu BeiSeeing he could not persuade Liu Bei Tao Qian then said As you are set in determination perhaps you will consent to encamp at XiaopeiIt is only a little town but thence you can keep watch and ward over the region They all with one voice prayed Liu Bei to consent so he gave in The feast of victory being now ended the time came to say farewellWhen Zhao Yun took his leave Liu Bei held his hands alternately while dashing away the falling tears Kong Rong and Tien Kai went home to their own places When Liu Bei and his brothers took up their abode in Xiaopei they first repaired the defenses and then they put out proclamations in order to calm the inhabitants In the meantime Cao Cao had marched toward his own regionCao Ren met and told him Lu Bu is very powerful and he has Chen Gong as adviser Yanzhou is as good as lost with the exception of three counties which have been vigorously and desperately defended by Xun Yu and Cheng Yu Cao Cao said I own that Lu Bu is a bold fighter but nothing more he has no craftSo we need not fear him seriously Then he gave orders to make a strong camp till they could think out some victorious planLu Bu knowing of Cao Caos return called two of his subordinate generals Xue Lan and Li Feng to him and assigned to them the task of holding the city of Yanzhou saying I have long waited for opportunity to employ your skill now I give you ten thousand soldiers and you are to hold the city while I go forth to attack Cao Cao They acceptedBut Chen Gong the strategist came in hastily saying General you are going away whither I am going to camp my troops at Puyang that vantage point You are making a mistake said Chen Gong The two you have chosen to defend this city are unequal to the taskFor this expedition remember that about sixty miles due south on the treacherous road to the Taishan Mountains is a very advantageous position where you should place your best men in ambushCao Cao will hasten homeward by double marches when he hears what has happened and if you strike when half his troops have gone past this point you may seize him Said Lu Bu I am going to occupy Puyang and see what developsHow can you guess my big plan So Lu Bu left Xue Lan in command at Yanzhou and went awayNow when Cao Cao approached the dangerous part of the road near the Taishan Mountains Guo Jia warned him to take care as there was doubtless an ambush But Cao Cao laughed saying We know all Lu Bus dispositions Xue Lan is keeping the city Do you think Lu Bu has laid an ambushI shall tell Cao Ren to besiege Yanzhou and I shall go to Puyang In Puyang when Chen Gong heard of the enemys approach he spoke saying The enemy will be fatigued with long marches so attack quickly before they have time to recover Lu Bu replied I a single horseman am afraid of none I go and come as I will Think you I fear this Cao CaoLet him settle his camp I will take him after that Now Cao Cao neared Puyang and he made a campThe next day he led out his commanders and they arrayed their armies in open countryCao Cao took up his station on horseback between the two standards watching while his opponents arrived and formed up in a circular areaLu Bu was in front followed by eight of his generals all strong men Zhang Liao of Mayi backed by Hao Meng Cao Xing and Cheng Lian Zang Ba of Huaying backed by Wei Xu Song Xian and Hou ChengThey led an army of fifty thousand in totalThe drums began their thunderous roll and Cao Cao pointing to his opponent said You and I had no quarrel why then did you invade my land The empire of Han is the possession of all what is your special claim said Lu BuSo saying Lu Bu ordered Zang Ba to ride forth and challengeFrom Cao Caos side the challenge was accepted by Yue JinThe two steeds approached each other two spears were lifted both together and they exchanged near thirty blows with no advantage to eitherThen Xiahou Dun rode out to help his colleague and in reply out went Zhang Liao from Lu Bus side And they four foughtThen fierce anger seized upon Lu Bu Setting his trident halberd he urged his RedHare forward to where the fight was wagingSeeing him approach Xiahou Dun and Yue Jin both fled but Lu Bu pressed on after them and Cao Caos army lost the day Retiring ten miles they made a new campLu Bu called in and mustered his troopsThe day having gone against him Cao Cao called a council and Yu Jin said From the hill tops today I saw a camp of our enemies on the west of PuyangThey were but few men therein and tonight after todays victory it will not be defendedLet us attack and if we can take the camp we shall strike fear into the heart of Lu BuThis is our best plan Cao Cao thought so too He and six of his generalsCao Hong Li Dian Mao Jie Lu Qian Yu Jin and Dian Weiand twenty thousand horse and foot left that night by a secret road for the campIn his camp Lu Bu was rejoicing for that days victory when Chen Gong reminded him saying The western camp is importance point and it might be attacked But Lu Bu replied The enemy will not dare approach after todays defeat Cao Cao is a very able commander replied Chen GongYou must keep a good lookout for him lest he attack our weak spot So arrangements were made for defenseGenerals Gao Shun Wei Xu and Hou Cheng were ordered to march thereAt dusk Cao Cao reached the camp and began an immediate attack on all four sidesThe defenders could not hold him off They ran in all directions and the camp was capturedNear the fourth watch when the defending party came Cao Cao sallied forth to meet them and met Gao Shun Another battle then began and waged till dawn About that time a rolling of drums was heard in the west and they told Cao Cao that Lu Bu himself was at handThereupon Cao Cao abandoned the attack and fledGao Shun Wei Xu and Hou Cheng pursued him Lu Bu taking the leadCao Caos two generals Yu Jin and Yue Jin attacked the pursuers but could not check them Cao Cao went away northBut from behind some hills came out Zhang Liao and Zang Ba to attackLu Qian and Cao Hong were sent to stop the attackers but Lu Qian and Cao Hong were both defeatedCao Cao sought safety in the westHere again his retreat was met by Lu Bus four generals Hao Meng Cao Xing Cheng Lian and Song XianThe fight became desperate Cao Cao dashed at the enemys array The din was terribleArrows fell like pelting rain upon them and they could make no headwayCao Cao was desperate and cried out in fear Who can save me Then from the crush dashed out Dian Wei with his double spears crying Fear not my master Dian Wei leapt from his steed leaned his double spears against a wall and laid hold of a handful of battleaxesTurning to his followers he said When the ruffians are at ten paces call out to me Then he set off with mighty strides plunging forward careless of the flying arrowsLu Bus horsemen followed and when they got near Dian Weis followers shouted Ten paces Five then call shouted back Dian Wei and went onPresently Five paces Then Dian Wei spun round and flung the battleaxes With every fling a man fell from the saddle and never a battleax missedHaving thus slain ten or so the remainder fled and Dian Wei quickly remounted his steed set his twin spears and rushed again into the fight with a vigor that none could withstand One by one his opponents yielded and he was able to lead Cao Cao safely out of the press of battleCao Cao and his commanders went to their campBut as evening fell the noise of pursuit fell on their ears and soon appeared Lu Bu himself Cao Cao you rebel do not flee shouted Lu Bu as he approached with his halberd ready for a thrust All stopped and looked in each others faces the soldiers were weary their steeds spent Fear smote them and they looked around for some place of refugeYou may lead your lord safely out of the press But what if the enemy followWe cannot say here what Cao Caos fate was but the next chapter will relate CHAPTER Tao Qian Thrice Offers Xuzhou To Liu Bei Cao Cao Retakes Yanzhou From Lu Bu In Battles The last chapter closed with Cao Cao in great danger However help came Xiahou Dun with a body of soldiers found his chief checked the pursuit and fought with Lu Bu till duskRain fell in torrents swamping everything and as the daylight waned they drew off and Cao Cao reached campHe rewarded Dian Wei generously and advanced him in rankWhen Lu Bu reached his camp he called in his adviser Chen Gong Then Chen Gong proposed a new stratagemHe said In Puyang there is a rich leading family Tian by name who number thousands enough to populate a whole county in themselvesMake one of these people go to Cao Caos camp with a pretended secret letter about Lu Bus ferocity and the hatred of the people and their desire to be rid of himEnd by saying that only Gao Shun is left to guard the city and they would help any one who would come to save themThus our enemy Cao Cao will be inveigled into the city and we will destroy him either by fire or ambushHis skill may be equal to encompassing the universe but he will not escape Lu Bu thought this trick might be tried and they arranged for the Tian family letter to be sentComing soon after the defeat when Cao Cao felt uncertain what step to take next the secret letter was read with joyIt promised interior help and said the sign should be a white flag with the word Rectitude written thereonHeaven is going to give me Puyang said Cao Cao joyfullySo he rewarded the messenger very liberally and began to prepare for the expeditionThen came Liu Ye saying Lu Bu is no strategist but Chen Gong is full of guile I fear treachery in this letter and you must be carefulIf you will go then enter with only one third your army leaving the others outside the city as a reserve Cao Cao agreed to take this precautionHe went to Puyang which he found gay with fluttering flags Looking carefully he saw among them at the west gate the white flag with the lookedfor inscription His heart rejoicedThat day just about noon the city gates opened and two bodies of soldiers appeared as if to fight Gao Shun was the front commander and Hou Cheng the rear commanderCao Cao told off his general Dian Wei to oppose themNeither body however came on to full engagement but fell back into the cityBy this move Dian Wei and his troops had been drawn close up to the drawbridgeFrom within the city several soldiers were seen taking any chance of confusion to escape and come outside To Cao Cao they said We are clients of the Tian family and they gave him secret letters statingThe signal will be given about the first watch setting by beating a gong That will be the time to attackThe gates will be opened So Cao Cao ordered Xiahou Dun to march to the left and Cao Hong to the rightCao Cao led the main armytogether with Xiahou Yuan Li Dian and Yue Jininto the cityLi Dian pressed upon his master the precaution saying My lord should stay outside the city let us go in first But Cao Cao bade him be silent saying If I do not go who will advance And so at the first watch Cao Cao led the wayThe moon had not yet arisenAs he drew near the west gate they heard a crackling sound then a loud shouting and then torches moved hither and thitherNext the gates were thrown wide open and Cao Cao whipping up his steed galloped inBut when he reached the state residence he noticed the streets were quite deserted and then he knew he had been tricked Wheeling round his horse he shouted to his followers to retire This was the signal for another moveAn explosion of a signal bomb was heard close at hand and it was echoed from every side in a deafening roarGongs and drums beat all around with a roar like rivers rushing backward to their source and the ocean boiling up from its depths From two sides east and west came bodies of soldiers eager to attack led by Lu Bus generals Zhang Liao and Zang BaCao Cao dashed off toward the north only to find his way barred by Hao Meng and Cao XingCao Cao tried for the south gate but met enemies led by Gao Shun and Hou ChengCao Caos trusty commander Dian Wei with fierce eyes and gritting teeth at last burst through and got out with the enemy close after him But when Dian Wei reached the drawbridge he glanced behind him and missed his master Immediately Dian Wei turned back and cut an arterial alley inside Just within he met Li DianWhere is our lord cried Dian WeiI am looking for him said Li Dian Quick Get help from outside shouted Dian Wei I will seek him So Li Dian hastened for aid and Dian Wei slashed his way in looking on every side for Cao Cao He was not to be foundDashing out of the city Dian Wei ran up against Yue Jin who asked where their lord wasI have entered the city twice in search of him but cannot find him said Dian Wei Let us go in together said Yue Jin They rode up to the gateBut the noise of bombs from the gate tower frightened Yue Jins horse so that it refused to passWherefore Dian Wei alone went in butting through the smoke and dashing through the flames But he got in and searched on every sideWhen Cao Cao saw his sturdy protector Dian Wei cut his way out and disappear leaving him surrounded he again made an attempt to reach the north gateOn the way sharply outlined against the glow he saw the figure of Lu Bu coming toward him with his trident halberd ready to killCao Cao covered his face with his hand whipped up his steed and galloped pastBut Lu Bu came galloping up behind him and tapping him on the helmet with the halberd cried Where is Cao Cao Cao Cao turned and pointing to a dun horse well ahead cried There on that dunThats he Hearing this Lu Bu left pursuing Cao Cao to gallop after the rider of the dunThus relieved Cao Cao set off for the east gateThen he fell in with Dian Wei who took him under his protection and fought through the press leaving a trail of death behind till they reached the gate Here the fire was raging fiercely and burning beams were falling on all sides The earth element seemed to have interchanged with the fire element Dian Wei warded off the burning pieces of wood with his lance and rode into the smoke making a way for his lordJust as they were passing through the gate a flaming beam fell from the gate tower Cao Cao just warded it off with his arm but it struck his steed on the quarters and knocked the steed downCao Caos hand and arm were badly burned and his hair and beard singedDian Wei turned back to his rescue Luckily Xiahou Yuan came along just then and the two raised Cao Cao and set him on Xiahou Yuans horseAnd thus they got him out of the burning cityBut they had to go through heavy fighting till daybreak Cao Cao returned to his campHis officers crowded about his tent anxious for news of his health He soon recovered and laughed when he thought of his escape I blundered into that fools trap but I will have my revenge said heLet us have a new plan soon said Guo Jia I will turn his trick to my own useI will spread the false report that I was burned in the fire and that I died at the fifth watchHe will come to attack as soon as the news gets abroad and I will have an ambush ready for him in Maling HillsI will get him this time Really a fine stratagem said Guo JiaSo the soldiers were put into mourning and the report went everywhere that Cao Cao was deadAnd soon Lu Bu heard it and he assembled his army at once to make a surprise attack taking the road by the Maling Hills to his enemys campAs he was passing the hills he heard the drums beating for an advance and the ambushing soldiers leapt out all round himOnly by desperate fighting did he get out of the melee and with a sadly diminished force returned to his camp at Puyang There he strengthened the fortifications and could not be tempted forth to battleThis year locusts suddenly appeared and they consumed every green bladeThere was a famine and in the northeast grain rose to fifty strings of cash a cart People even took to cannibalismCao Caos army suffered from want and he marched them to JuanchengLu Bu took his troops to ShanyangPerforce therefore the fighting ceasedIn Xuzhou Imperial Protector Tao Qian over sixty years of age suddenly fell seriously ill and he summoned his confident Mi Zhu to his chamber to make arrangements for the futureAs to the situation the adviser said Cao Cao abandoned his attack on this place because of his enemys seizure of Yanzhou and now they are both keeping the peace solely because of the famineBut Cao Cao will surely renew the attack in the spring When Liu Bei refused to allow you to vacate office in his favor you were in full vigorNow you are ill and weak and you can make this a reason for retirementHe will not refuse again So a message was sent to the little garrison town Xiaopei calling Liu Bei to a counsel on military affairs This brought him with his brothers and a slender escort He was at once called in to the sick mans chamber Quickly disposing of the inquiries about his health Tao Qian soon came to the real object of his call for Liu BeiSir I asked you to come for the sole reason that I am dangerously ill and likely to die at any timeI look to you Illustrious Sir to consider the Hans and their empire as more important than anything else and so to take over the symbols of office of this region the commission and the seal that I may close my eyes in peace You have two sons why not depute them to relieve you said Liu Bei Both lack the requisite talentsI trust you will instruct them after I have gone but do not let them have the guidance of affairs But I am unequal to so great a charge I will recommend to you one who could assist youHe is Sun Qian from Beihai who could be appointed to some post Turning to Mi Zhu Tao Qian said The noble Liu Bei here is the most prominent man of the time and you should serve him well Still would Liu Bei have put from him such a post but just then the Imperial Protector pointing to his heart to indicate his sincerity passed awayWhen the ceremonial wailing of the officials was over the insignia of office were brought to Liu Bei But he would have none of themThe following days the inhabitants of the town and country around crowded into the state residence bowing and with tears calling upon Liu Bei to receive the charge If you do not we cannot live in pence said theyTo these requests his brothers added their persuasion till at length he consented to assume the administrative dutiesHe forthwith appointed Sun Qian and Mi Zhu as his official advisers and Chen Deng his secretaryHe moved his army from Xiaopei to Xuzhou City and he put forth proclamations to reassure the peopleHe also attended to the burial ceremonies he and all his army dressing in mourningAfter the fullest sacrifices and ceremonies a burial place for the late Imperial Protector was found close to the source of the Yellow RiverThe dead mans testament was forwarded to court The news of the events in Xuzhou duly reached the ears of Cao Cao then in Juancheng Said he angrily I have missed my revenge This Liu Bei has simply stepped into command of the region without expending half an arrow he sat still and attained his desireBut I will put him to death and then dig up Tao Qians corpse in revenge for the death of my noble father Orders were issued for the army to prepare for a new campaign against XuzhouBut Adviser Xun Yu remonstrated with Cao Cao saying The Supreme Ancestor secured the Land Within the Pass  and his illustrious successor on the throne Liu Xiu took Henei They both first consolidated their position whereby they could command the whole empire Their whole progress was from success to success Hence they accomplished their great designs in spite of difficultiesIllustrious Sir your Land Within the Pass and your Henei are Yanzhou and the Yellow River which you had first and which is of the utmost strategic point of the empireIf you undertake this expedition against Xuzhou leaving many troops here for defense you will not accomplish your design if you leave too few Lu Bu will fall upon usAnd finally if you lose this and fail to gain Xuzhou whither will you retire That region is not vacantAlthough Tao Qian has gone Liu Bei holds it and since the people support him they will fight to the death for himTo abandon this place for that is to exchange the great for the small to barter the trunk for the branches to leave safety and run into dangerI would implore you to reflect well Cao Cao replied It is not a good plan to keep soldiers idle here during such scarcity If that is so it would be more advantageous to attack the eastern counties of Chencheng Yingchuan and Runan and feed your army on their suppliesThe remnants of the Yellow Scarves He Yi and Huang Shao are there with stores and treasures of all kinds that they have amassed by plundering wherever they could Rebels of their stamp are easily broken Break them and you can feed your army with their grain Moreover both the court and the common people will join in blessing you This new design appealed strongly to Cao Cao and he quickly began his preparations to carry it outHe left Xiahou Dun and Cao Ren to guard Juancheng while his main body under his own command marched to seize Chencheng This done they went to Runan and YingchuanNow when the Yellow Scarves leaders He Yi and Huang Shao knew that Cao Cao was approaching they came out in a great body to oppose him They met at Goat HillThough the rebels were numerous they were a poor lot a mere pack of beasts without organization and lacking disciplineCao Cao ordered his strong archers and vigorous crossbowmen to keep them in check Dian Wei was sent out to challengeThe rebel leaders chose a secondrate champion for their side who rode out and was vanquished in the third boutThen Cao Caos army pushed forward and they made a camp at Goat HillThe following day the rebel Huang Shao himself led forth his army and made his battle array along a circleA leader advanced on foot to offer combat He wore a yellow turban on his head and a green robe His weapon was an iron mace He shouted I am He Man the devil who shoots across the sky who dare fight with me Cao Hong uttered a great shout and jumped from the saddle to accept the challengeSword in hand he advanced on foot and the two engaged in fierce combat in the face of both armies They exchanged some fifty blows neither gaining the advantageThen Cao Hong feigned defeat and ran away He Man went after himJust as he closed Cao Hong tried a feint and then suddenly wheeling about wounded his adversary Another slash and He Man lay deadAt once Li Dian dashed forward into the midst of the Yellow Scarves and laid hands on the rebel chief Huang Shao whom he carried off captiveCao Caos troops then set on and scattered the rebels The spoil of treasure and food was immenseThe other rebel leader He Yi fled with a few hundred horsemen toward Kobei HillsBut while on their road thither there suddenly appeared a force led by a certain swashbuckler who shall be nameless for the momentThis bravo was a wellbuilt man thickset and stout With a waist ten span in girth He used a long sword He barred the way of retreatHe Yi set his spear and rode toward him But at the first encounter the bravo caught He Yi under his arm and bore He Yi off a prisonerAll the rebels were terrorstricken dropped from their horses and allowed themselves to be bound Then the victor drove them like cattle into an enclosure with high banksPresently Dian Wei still pursuing the rebels reached Kobei Hills The swashbuckler went out to meet himAre you also a Yellow Scarf said Dian WeiI have some hundreds of them prisoners in an enclosure here Why not bring them out said Dian WeiI will if you win this sword from my hand This annoyed Dian Wei who attacked himThey engaged and the combat lasted for two long hours and then was still undecided Both rested a while The swashbuckler was the first to recover and renewed the challengeThey fought till dusk and then as their horses were quite spent the combat was once more suspendedIn the meantime some of Dian Weis men had run off to tell the story of this wondrous fight to Cao Cao who hastened in amazement followed by many officers to watch it and see the resultNext day the unknown warrior rode out again and Cao Cao saw himIn Cao Caos heart he rejoiced to see such a doughty hero and desired to gain his servicesSo Cao Cao bade Dian Wei feign defeatDian Wei rode out in answer to the challenge and some thirty bouts were fought Then Dian Wei turned and fled toward his own side The bravo followed and came quite close But a flight of arrows drove him awayCao Cao hastily drew off his men for one and a half miles and then secretly sent a certain number to dig a pitfall and sent troops armed with hooks to lie in ambushThe following day Dian Wei was sent out with one hundred horse His adversary nothing loath came to meet Dian WeiWhy does the defeated leader venture forth again cried he laughingThe swashbuckler spurred forward to join battle but Dian Wei after a faint show of fighting turned his horse and rode awayHis adversary intent upon capture took no care and he and his horse all blundered into the pitfall The hookmen took him captive bound him and carried him before Cao CaoAs soon as he saw the prisoner Cao Cao advanced from his tent sent away the soldiers and with his own hands loosened the leaders bonds Then he brought out clothing and dressed him bade him be seated and asked who he was and whence he came I am named Xu ChuI am from QiaoWhen the rebellion broke out I and my relations of some hundreds built a stronghold within a rampart for protectionOne day the robbers came but I had stones ready for them I told my relatives to keep on bringing them up to me and I threw them hitting somebody every time I threwThis drove off the robbers Another day they came and we were short of grain So I agreed with them to an exchange of plow oxen against grainThey delivered the grain and were driving away the oxen when the beasts took fright and tore off to their pens I seized two of oxen by the tail one with each hand and hauled them backwards a hundred or so pacesThe robbers were so amazed that they thought no more about oxen but went their waySo they never troubled us again I have heard of your mighty exploits said Cao Cao Will you join my army That is my strongest desire said Xu ChuSo Xu Chu called up his clan some hundreds in all and they formally submitted to Cao CaoXu Chu received the rank of general and received ample rewardsThe two rebel leaders He Yi and Huang Shao were executedRunan and Yingchuan were now perfectly pacified Cao Cao withdrew his army and went back to JuanchengXiahou Dun and Cao Ren came out to welcome him and they told him that spies had reported Yanzhou City to be left defenseless Lu Bus generals Xue Lan and Li Feng had given up all its garrison to plundering the surrounding country They wanted him to go against it without loss of time With our soldiers fresh from victory the city will fall at a tap of the drum said theySo Cao Cao marched the army straight to the cityAn attack was quite unexpected but the two leaders Xue Lan and Li Feng hurried out their few soldiers to fightXu Chu the latest recruit said he wished to capture these two and he would make of them an introductory gift The task was given him and he rode forthLi Feng with his halberd advanced to meet Xu ChuThe combat was brief as Li Feng fell in the second boutHis colleague Xue Lan retired with his troops But he found the drawbridge had been seized by Li Dian so that he could not get shelter within the cityXue Lan led his men toward JuyeBut Lu Qian pursued and killed him with an arrow His soldiers scattered to the four windsAnd thus Yanzhou was recaptured Next Cheng Yu proposed an expedition to take Puyang Cao Cao marched his army out in perfect orderThe van leaders were Dian Wei and Xu Chu Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan led the left wing Li Dian and Yue Jin led the right wing Yu Jin and Lu Qian guarded the rear Cao Cao himself commanded the centerWhen they approached Puyang Lu Bu wished to go out in person and alone to attack but his adviser Chen Gong protested saying General you should not go out until the arrival of the other officers Whom do I fear said Lu BuSo he threw caution to the winds and went out of the city He met his foes and he began to revile themThe redoubtable Xu Chu went to fight with him but after twenty bouts neither combatant was any the worseHe is not the sort that one man can overcome said Cao CaoAnd he sent Dian Wei to attack Lu Bu from another directionLu Bu stood the double onslaught Soon after the flank commanders joined in Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan attacking the left Li Dian and Yue Jin surrounding the right Lu Bu had six opponentsThese proved really too many for him so he turned his horse and rode back to the cityBut when the members of the Tian family saw him coming back beaten they raised the drawbridgeLu Bu shouted Open the gatesLet me in But the Tians said We have gone over to Cao Cao This was hard to hear and the beaten man abused them roundly before he leftChen Gong got away through the east gate taking with him the generals familyThus Puyang came into Cao Caos hands and for their present services the Tian family were pardoned their previous faultHowever Liu Ye said Lu Bu is a savage beast If let alive he will be a great dangerHunt him down Liu Ye was ordered to keep Puyang Wherefore Cao Cao determined to follow Lu Bu to Dingtao whither he had gone for refugeLu Bu Zhang Miao and Zhang Chao were assembled in the city Gao Shun and other generals were out foragingCao Cao army arrived but did not attack for many days and presently he withdrew fifteen miles and made a stockadeIt was the time of harvest and he set his soldiers to cut the wheat for foodThe spies reported this to Lu Bu who came over to seeBut when he saw that Cao Caos stockade lay near a thick wood he feared an ambush and retired Cao Cao heard that Lu Bu had come and gone and guessed the reason He fears an ambush in the wood said Cao Cao We will set up flags there and deceive himThere is a long embankment near the camp but behind it there is no waterThere we will lay an ambush to fall upon Lu Bu when he comes to burn the wood So Cao Cao hid all his soldiers behind the embankment except half a hundred drummers and he got together many peasants to loiter within the stockade as though it was not emptyLu Bu rode back and told Chen Gong what he had seenThis Cao Cao is very crafty and full of wiles said the adviserDo not act I will use fire this time and burn out his ambush said Lu BuNext morning Lu Bu rode out and there he saw flags flying everywhere in the wood He ordered his troops forward to set fire on all sides But to his surprise no one rushed out to make for the stockadeStill he heard the beating of drums and doubt filled his mind Suddenly he saw a party of soldiers move out from the shelter of the stockade He galloped over to see what it meantThen the signalbombs exploded out rushed the troops and all their leaders dashed forward Xiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Xu Chu Dian Wei Li Dian and Yue Jin all attacked at onceLu Bu was at a loss and fled into the open countryOne of his generals Cheng Lian was killed by an arrow of Yue JinTwo thirds of his troops were lost and the beaten remainder went to tell Chen Gong what had come to pass We would better leave said Chen GongAn empty city cannot be held So Chen Gong and Gao Shun taking their chiefs family with them abandoned DingtaoWhen Cao Caos soldiers got into the city they met with no resistance Zhang Chao committed suicide by burning himselfZhang Miao fled to Yuan ShuThus the whole northeast fell under the power of Cao CaoHe immediately tranquilized the people and rebuilt the cities and their defenses Lu Bu in his retreat fell in with his generals and Chen Gong also rejoined him so that he was by no means brokenI have but small army said Lu Bu but still enough to break Cao Cao And so he retook the backward road IndeedThus does fortune alternate victory defeat The happy conqueror today tomorrow must retreatWhat was the fate of Lu Bu will appear laterCHAPTER  Li Jue and Guo Si Duel In Changan The Emperor Establishes Anyi The New Capital The last chapter told of the defeat of Lu Bu and his gathering the remnant of his army at Dingtao When all his generals had joined him he began to feel strong enough to try conclusions with Cao Cao once again Said Chen Gong who was opposed to this course Cao Cao is too strong right now seek some place where we can rest a time before trying Suppose I went to Yuan Shao said Lu Bu Send first to make inquiries Lu Bu agreedThe news of the fighting between Cao Cao and Lu Bu had reached Jizhou and one of Yuan Shaos advisers Shen Pei warned him saying Lu Bu is a savage beastIf he gets possession of Yanzhou he will certainly attempt to add this region to itFor your own safety you should help to crush him Wherefore Yuan Shao sent Yan Liang with fifty thousand troops to destroy Lu BuThe spies heard this and at once told Lu Bu who was greatly disturbed and called in Chen GongGo over to Liu Bei who has lately succeeded to Xuzhou Hence Lu Bu went thitherHearing this Liu Bei said Lu Bu is a hero and we will receive him with honor But Mi Zhu was strongly against receiving him saying He was a cruel bloodthirsty beast But Liu Bei replied How would misfortune have been averted from Xuzhou if he had not attacked YanzhouHe cannot be our enemy now that he comes seeking an asylum Brother your heart is really too goodAlthough it may be as you say yet it would be well to prepare said Zhang FeiThe new Imperial Protector with a great following met Lu Bu ten miles outside the city gates and the two chiefs rode in side by sideThey proceeded to the residence and there after the elaborate ceremonies of reception were over they sat down to converseSaid Lu Bu After Wang Yun and I plotted to slay Dong Zhuo and my misfortune in the Li Jue and Guo Sis sedition I drifted about from one place to another and none of the nobles east of the Huashang Mountains seemed willing to receive meWhen Cao Cao with wicked ambition invaded this region and you Sir came to its rescue I aided you by attacking Yanzhou and thus diverting a portion of his forceI did not think then that I should be the victim of a vile plot and lose my leaders and my soldiersBut now if you will I offer myself to you that we may together accomplish great designs Liu Bei replied When the late Tao Qian died there was no one to administer Xuzhou and so I assumed that task for a timeNow since you are here General it is most suitable that I step down in your favor Whereupon Liu Bei handed the insignia and the seal of authority to Lu BuLu Bu was on the point of accepting them when he saw Guan Yu and Zhang Fei who stood behind the Imperial Protector glaring at him with angry eyesSo Lu Bu put on a smile and said I may be something of a fighting man but I could not rule a great region like this Liu Bei repeated his offerBut Chen Gong said The strong guest does not oppress his host You need not fear Lord Liu Bei Then Liu Bei desistedBanquets were held and dwelling places prepared for the guest and his retinueAs soon as convenient Lu Bu returned the feast Liu Bei went with his two brothersHalf through the banquet Lu Bu requested Liu Bei to retire to one of the inner private rooms whither Guan Yu and Zhang Fei followed himThere Lu Bu bade his wife and daughter bow as to their benefactorHere also Liu Bei showed excessive modestyLu Bu said Good Younger Brother you need not be so very modest Zhang Fei heard what Lu Bu said and his eyes glared crying What sort of a man are you that dares call our brother younger brother He is one of the ruling familya jade leaf on a golden branchCome out and I will fight you three hundred bouts for the insult Liu Bei hastily checked the impulsive one and Guan Yu persuaded him to go awayThen Liu Bei apologized saying My poor brother talks wildly after he has been drinking I hope you will not blame him Lu Bu nodded but said nothingSoon after the guests departedBut as the host escorted Liu Bei to his carriage he saw Zhang Fei galloping up armed as for a frayLu Bu you and I will fight that duel of three hundred bouts shouted Zhang Fei Liu Bei bade Guan Yu check himNext day Lu Bu came to take leave of his host You O Lord kindly received me but I fear your brothers and I cannot agreeSo I will seek some other asylum General if you go the blame is mineMy rude brother has offended and must eventually apologizeIn the meantime what think you of a temporary sojourn at the town where I was encamped for some time XiaopeiThe place is small and mean but it is near and I will see to it that you are supplied with all you need Lu Bu thanked him and accepted this offer He led his troops there and took up residenceAfter he had gone Liu Bei buried his annoyance and Zhang Fei did not again refer to the matterThat Cao Cao had subdued the east of the Huashang Mountains has been stated before He memorialized the Throne and was rewarded with the title of General Who Exhibits Firm Virtue and Lord of FeitingAt this time the rebellious Li Jue was commanding the court and he had made himself Regent Marshal and his colleague Guo Si styled himself Grand Commander Their conduct was abominable but no one dared to criticize themImperial Guardian Yang Biao and Minister Zhu Jun privately talked with Emperor Xian and said Cao Cao has two hundred thousand troops and many capable advisers and leaders it would be well for the empire if he would lend his support to the imperial family and help to rid the government of this evil party His Majesty wept I am weary of the insults and contempt of these wretches and should be very glad to have them removed I have thought of a plan to estrange Li Jue and Guo Si and so make them destroy each other Then Cao Cao could come and cleanse the court said Yang BiaoHow will you manage it asked the EmperorGuo Sis wife Lady Qiong is very jealous and we can take advantage of her weakness to bring about a quarrel So Yang Biao received instruction to act with a secret edict to support himYang Biaos wife Lady Kai made an excuse to visit Lady Qiong at her palace and in the course of conversation said There is talk of secret liaison between the General your husband and the wife of Minister Li JueIt is a great secret but if Minister Li Jue knew it he might try to harm your husbandI think you ought to have very little to do with that family Lady Qiong was surprised but said I have wondered why he has been sleeping away from home lately but I did not think there was anything shameful connected with itI should never have known if you had not spokenI must put a stop to it By and by when Lady Kai took her leave Lady Qiong thanked her warmly for the information she had givenSome days passed and Guo Si was going over to the dwelling of Li Jue to a dinner Lady Qiong did not wish him to go and she said This Li Jue is very deep and one cannot fathom his designsYou two are not of equal rank and if he made away with you what would become of your poor handmaid Guo Si paid no attention and his wife could not prevail on him to stay at homeLate in the afternoon some presents arrived from Li Jues palace and Lady Qiong secretly put poison into the delicacies before she set them before her lordGuo Si was going to taste at once but she said It is unwise to consume things that come from outsideLet us try on a dog first They did and the dog diedThis incident made Guo Si doubt the kindly intentions of his colleagueOne day at the close of business at court Li Jue invited Guo Si to his palaceAfter Guo Si arrived home in the evening rather the worse for too much wine he was seized with a colicHis wife said she suspected poison and hastily administered an emetic which relieved the painGuo Si began to feel angry saying We did everything together and helped each other always Now he wants to injure me If I do not get in the first blow I shall suffer some injury So Guo Si began to prepare his guards for any sudden emergencyThis was told to Li Jue and he in turn grew angry saying So Guo Si is doing so and so Then Li Jue got his guards under way and came to attack Guo SiBoth houses had ten thousand and the quarrel became so serious that they fought a pitched battle under the city walls When that was over both sides turned to plunder the peopleThen a nephew of Li Jue Li Xian suddenly surrounded the Palace put the Emperor and Empress in two carriages and assigned Jia Xu and Zuo Ling to carry them offThe palace attendants were made to follow on footAs they went out of the rear gate they met Guo Sis army who began to shoot at the cavalcade with arrows They killed many attendants before Li Jues army came up and forced them to retireThe carriages were got out of the Palace and eventually reached Li Jues camp while Guo Sis soldiers plundered the Palace and carried off all the women left there to their camp Then the Palace was set on fireAs soon as Guo Si heard of the whereabouts of the Emperor he came over to attack the camp of Li JueThe Emperor between these two opposing factions was greatly alarmed IndeedSlowly the Hans had declined but renewed their vigor with Liu Xiu Twelve were the rulers before him followed him also twelve othersFoolish were two of the latest dangers surrounded the altars These were degenerate days with authority given to eunuchsThen did He Jin the simple the inept who commanded the army Warriors call to the capital wishing to drive out the vermin Though they drove out the leopards tigers and wolves quickly entered All kinds of evil were wrought by a low class creature from XizhouWang Yun honest of heart beguiled this wretch with a woman Much desired of his henchman thus sowing seeds of dissension Strife resulted and peace no longer dwelt in the empireNo one suspected that Li Jue and Guo Si would continue the evil Much to the sorrow of the Middle Empire yet they stove for a trifleFamine stalked in the Palace grief for the clashing of weapons Why did the warriors strive Why was the land thus partitionedThey had turned aside from the way appointed of HeavenKings must ponder these things heavy the burden lies on them Chiefest in all the realm theirs is no common appointment Should the King falter or fail calamities fall on the multitude people The empire is drenched with their blood grisly ruin surrounds themSteeped in sorrow and sad read you the ancient records Long is the tale of years the tale of sorrow is longerWherefore one who would rule chiefly must exercise forethought This and a keenedged blade these must suffice to maintain oneGuo Sis army arrived and Li Jue went out to give battleGuo Sis troops had no success and retiredThen Li Jue removed the imperial captives to Meiwo with his nephew Li Xian as gaolerSupplies were reduced and famine showed itself on the faces of the eunuchs The Emperor sent to Li Jue to request five carts of rice and five sets of bullock bones for his attendantsLi Jue angrily replied The court gets food morning and evening why do they ask for more He sent putrid meat and rotten grain and the Emperor was very vexed at the new insultImperial Counselor Yang Qi counseled patience saying Li Jue is a base creature but under the present circumstances Your Majesty must put up with itYou may not provoke him The Emperor bowed and was silent but the tears fell on his garmentsSuddenly some one came in with the tidings that a force of cavalry their sabers glittering in the sun was approaching to rescue them Then they heard the gongs beat and the roll of the drumsThe Emperor sent to find out who it wasBut it was Guo Si and the sadness fell again Presently arose a great din For Li Jue had gone out to do battle with Guo Si whom he abused by name I treated you well and why did you try to kill me said Li JueYou are a rebel why should I not slay you cried Guo SiYou call me rebel when I am guarding the Emperor You have abducted him do you call that guarding Why so many wordsLet us forgo a battle and settle the matter in single combat the winner to take the Emperor and go The two generals fought in front of their armies but neither could prevail over the otherThen they saw Yang Biao come riding up to them crying Rest a while O CommandersFor I have invited a party of officers to arrange a peace Wherefore the two leaders retired to their campsSoon Yang Biao Zhu Jun and sixty other officials came up and went to Guo Sis camp They were all thrown into confinementWe came with good intentions they moaned and we are treated like this Li Jue has run off with the Emperor I have to have the officers said Guo SiWhat does it mean One has the Emperor the other his officers What do you want said Yang BiaoGuo Si lost patience and drew his sword but Commander Yang Mi persuaded him not to slay the speakerThen Guo Si released Yang Biao and Zhu Jun but kept the others in the campHere are we two officers of the Throne and we cannot help our lord We have been born in vain said Yang Biao to Zhu JunThrowing their arms about each other they wept and fell swooning to the earthZhu Jun went home fell seriously ill and died Thereafter the two adversaries fought every day for nearly three months each losing many soldiersNow Li Jue was irreligious and practiced magic He often called witches to beat drums and summon spirits even when in campJia Xu used to remonstrate with him but quite uselesslyYang Qi said to the Emperor That Jia Xu although a friend of Li Jue never seems to have lost the sense of loyalty to Your Majesty Soon after Jia Xu himself arrivedThe Emperor sent away his attendants and said to Jia Xu weeping the while Can you not pity the Hans and help me Jia Xu prostrated himself saying That is my dearest wishBut Sire say no more let thy servant work out a plan The Emperor dried his tears and soon Li Jue came inHe wore a sword by his side and strode straight up to the Emperor whose face became the color of clayThen Li Jue spoke Guo Si has failed in his duty and imprisoned the court officersHe wished to slay Your Majesty and you would have been captured but for me The Emperor joined his hands together in salute and thanked Li JueLi Jue went away Before long Huangfu Li entered and the Emperor knowing him as a man of persuasive tongue and that he came from the same county as Li Jue bade him go to both factions to try to arrange peaceHuangfu Li accepted the mission and first went to Guo Si who said I would release the officers if Li Jue would restore the Emperor to full liberty Huangfu Li then went to the other sideTo Li Jue he said Since I am a Xiliang man the Emperor and the officers have selected me to make peace between you and your adversaryGuo Si has consented to cease the quarrel will you agree to peace I overthrew Lu Bu I have upheld the government for four years and have many great services to my credit as all the world knowsThat other fellow that horsethief has dared to seize the officers of state and to set himself up against me I have sworn to slay him Look around youDo you not think my army large enough to break him It does not follow said Huangfu LiIn ancient days in Youqiong Hou Yi proud of and confident in his archers skill gave no thought to others and governed alone and he so perishedLately you yourself have seen the powerful Dong Zhuo betrayed by Lu Bu who had received many benefits at his hands In no time Dong Zhuos head was hanging over the gateSo you see mere force is not enough to ensure safetyNow you are a general with the axes and whips and all the symbols of rank and high office your descendants and all your clan occupy distinguished positions You must confess that the state has rewarded you liberallyTrue Guo Si has seized the officers of state but you have done the same to the Most Revered Who is worse than the other Li Jue angrily drew his sword and shouted Did the Son of Heaven send you to mock and shame me But his commander Yang Feng checked himGuo Si is still alive said Yang Feng and to slay the imperial messenger would be giving him a popular excuse to raise an army against youAnd all the nobles would join him Jia Xu also persuaded Li Jue and gradually his wrath cooled downHuangfu Li was urged to go away But Huangfu Li would not be satisfied with failureAs he went out of the camp he cried loudly Li Jue will not obey the Emperors commandHe will kill his prince to set up himself Counselor Hu Miao tried to shut Huangfu Lis mouth saying Do not utter such wordsYou will only bring hurt upon yourself But Huangfu Li shrieked at him also saying You also are an officer of state and yet you even back up the rebel When the prince is put to shame the minister dies That is our codeIf it be my lot to suffer death at the hands of Li Jue so be it And Huangfu Li maintained a torrent of abuseThe Emperor heard of the incident called in Huangfu Li and sent him away to his own country XiliangNow more than half Li Jues troops were from Xiliang and he had also the assistance of the Qiangs the tribespeople beyond the borderWhen Huangfu Li spread that Li Jue was a rebel and so were those who helped him and that there would be a day of heavy reckoning those stories disturbed the soldiersLi Jue sent one of his officers General Wang Chang of the Tiger Army to arrest Huangfu Li but Wang Chang had a sense of right and esteemed Huangfu Li as an honorable manInstead of carrying out the orders Wang Chang returned to say he could not be foundJia Xu tried to work on the feelings of the barbarian tribes He said to them The Son of Heaven knows you are loyal to him and have bravely fought and sufferedHe has issued a secret command for you to go home and then he will reward you The tribesmen had a grievance against Li Jue for not paying them so they listened readily to the insidious persuasions of Jia Xu and desertedThen Jia Xu advised the Emperor Li Jue is covetous in natureHe is deserted and enfeebled a high office should be granted to him to lead him astray So the Emperor officially appointed Li Jue Regent MarshalThis delighted him greatly and he ascribed his promotion to the potency of his wise witches prayers and incantations He rewarded those people most liberally But his army was forgottenWherefore his commander Yang Feng was angry and he said to General Song Guo We have taken all the risks and exposed ourselves to stones and arrows in his service yet instead of giving us any reward he ascribes all the credit to those witches of his Let us put him out of the way and rescue the Emperor said Song GuoYou explode a bomb within as signal and I will attack from outside So the two agreed to act together that very night in the second watchBut they had been overheard and the eavesdropper told Li JueSong Guo was seized and put to deathThat night Yang Feng waited outside for the signal and while waiting out came Li Jue himself Then a melee began which lasted till the fourth watchBut Yang Feng got away and fled to XianBut from this time Li Jues army began to fall away and he felt more than ever the losses caused by Guo Sis frequent attacksThen came news that Zhang Ji at the head of a large army was coming down from Shanxi to make peace between the two factionsZhang Ji vowed he would attack the one who was recalcitrantLi Jue tried to gain favor by hastening to send to tell Zhang Ji he was ready to make peaceSo did Guo Si So the strife of the rival factions ended at last and Zhang Ji memorialized asking the Emperor to go to Hongnong near LuoyangThe Emperor was delighted saying I have longed to go back to the east Zhang Ji was rewarded with the title of Commander of the Flying Cavalry and was highly honoredZhang Ji saw to it that the Emperor and the court had good supplies of necessariesGuo Si set free all his captive officers and Li Jue prepared transport for the court to move to the eastLi Jue told off companies of his Royal Guard to escort the cavalcade The progress had been without incident as far as XinfengNear Baling Bridge the west wind of autumn came on to blow with great violence but soon above the howling of the gale was heard the trampling of a large body of forceThey stopped at a bridge and barred the way Who comes cried a voice The Imperial Chariot is passing and who dares stop it said Yang Qi riding forwardTwo leaders of the barring party advanced to Yang Qi saying General Guo Si has ordered us to guard the bridge and stop all spiesYou say the Emperor is here we must see him and then we will let you pass So the pearl curtain was raised and the Emperor said I the Emperor am hereWhy do you not retire to let me pass Gentlemen They all shouted Long LifeLong Life and fell away to allow the cortege through But when they reported what they had done Guo Si was very angry saying I meant to outwit Zhang Ji seize the Emperor and hold him in MeiwoWhy have you let him get away He put the two officers to death set out to pursue the cavalcade and overtook it just at the county of HuayingThe noise of a great shouting arose behind the travelers and a loud voice commanded Stop the train The Emperor burst into tearsOut of the wolfs den into the tigers mouth said he No one knew what to do they were all too frightenedBut when the rebel army was just upon them they heard the beating of drums and from behind some hills came into the open a cohort of one thousand soldiers preceded by a great flag bearing the name Han General Yang FengHaving defeated by Li Jue Yang Feng fled to the foothills of the Xian and he came up to offer his services as soon as he heard the Emperors journeySeeing it was necessary to fight now he drew up his line of battleGuo Sis general Cui Yong rode out and began a volley of abuseYang Feng turned and said Where is Xu Huang In response out came a valiant warrior gripping a heavy battleaxHe galloped up on his fleet bay making directly for Cui Yong whom he felled at the first blow At this the whole force dashed forward and routed Guo SiThe defeated army went back some seven miles while Yang Feng rode forward to see the Emperor who graciously said It is a great service you have rendered you have saved my life Yang Feng bowed and thanked him and the Emperor asked to see the actual slayer of the rebel leaderSo Xu Huang was led to the chariot where he bowed and was presented as Xu Huang of Hedong The Emperor recognized the achievement of the warriorThen the cavalcade went forward Yang Feng acting as escort as far as the city of Huaying the halting place for the nightThe Commander of the place Duan Wei supplied them with clothing and foodAnd the Emperor passed the night in Yang Fengs campNext day Guo Si having mustered his troops appeared in front of the camp and Xu Huang rode out to engageBut Guo Si threw his army out so that they entirely surrounded the camp and the Emperor was in the middleThe position was very critical when help appeared in the person of a galloping general from the southeast and the rebels fell away at his assaultThen Xu Huang smote them and so scored a victoryWhen they had time to see their helper they found him to be Dong Cheng the uncle of the Emperor or the State Uncle The Emperor wept as he related his sorrows and dangersSaid Dong Cheng Be of good courage SireGeneral Yang Feng and I have pledged ourselves to kill both the rebels Li Jue and Guo Si and so purify the world The Emperor bade them travel east as soon as possible and so they went on night and day till they reached their destination Hongnong Guo Si led his defeated army back Meeting Li Jue he told Li Jue of the rescue of the Emperor and whither they was goingIf they reach the Huashang Mountains and get settled in the east they will send out proclamations to the whole country calling up the nobles to attack us and we and our families will be in danger said Guo SiZhang Ji is holding Changan and we must be carefulThere is nothing to prevent a joint attack on Hongnong when we can kill the Emperor and divide the empire between us said Li JueGuo Si found this a suitable scheme so their armies came together again in one place and united in plundering the countryside As they proceeded to Hongnong they left destruction behind themYang Feng and Dong Cheng heard of the rebels approach when they were yet a long way off so Yang Feng and Dong Cheng turned back and decided to meet them at DongjianLi Jue and Guo Si had previously made their plan Since the loyal troops were few as compared with their own horde they would overwhelm the loyal troops like a flood So when the day of battle came they poured out covering the hills and filling the plainsYang Feng and Dong Cheng devoted themselves solely to the protection of the Emperor and EmpressThe officials the attendants the archives and records and all the paraphernalia of the court were left to care for themselvesThe rebels ravaged Hongnong but the two protectors got the Emperor safely away into ShanbeiWhen the rebel generals showed signs of pursuit Yang Feng and Dong Cheng had to play a doubleedged swordThey sent to offer to discuss terms of peace with Li Jue and Guo Si at the same time they sent a secret edict to enlist the help from the leaders of the old White Wave rebels Han Xian Li Yue and Hu CaiLi Yue was actually a brigand and had inspired rebels throughout the country but the need for help was so desperateThese three being promised pardon for their faults and crimes and a grant of official rank naturally responded to the call and thus the loyal side was strengthened so that Hongnong was recapturedBut meanwhile Li Jue and Guo Si laid waste whatever place they reached slaying the aged and weakly forcing the strong to join their ranksWhen going into a fight they forced these peoplesoldiers to the front and they called them the DaretoDie soldiers Li Jue and Guo Sis force was overwhelmingWhen Li Yue the White Wave leader approached with his army Guo Si bade his soldiers scatter clothing and valuables along the road The late robbers could not resist the temptation so a scramble beganThen Guo Sis soldiers fell upon the disordered ranks and did much damageYang Feng and Dong Cheng had to take the Emperor away to the north Li Jue and Guo Si pursuedLi Yue said The danger is graveI pray Your Majesty mount a horse and go in advance The Emperor replied I cannot bear to abandon my officers They wept and struggled on as best they couldThe White Wave leader Hu Cai was killed in one attackThe enemy came very near and the Emperor left his carriage and went on foot Yang Feng and Dong Cheng escorted him to the bank of the Yellow RiverLi Yue sought a boat to ferry him to the other sideThe weather was very cold and the Emperor and Empress cuddled up close to each other shivering They reached the river but the banks were too high and they could not get down into the boatSo Yang Feng proposed to fasten together the horses bridles and lower down the Emperor slung by the waistHowever the Empress brother Fu De found some rolls of white silk from dead soldiers and they rolled up the two imperial personages in the silk and thus they lowered them down near the boatThen Li Yue took up his position in the prow leaning on his swordFu De carried the Empress on his back into the boatThe boat was too small to carry everybody and those unable to get on board clung to the cable but Li Yue cut them down and they fell into the waterThey ferried over the Emperor and then sent back the boat for the othersThere was a great scramble to get on board and they had to chop off the fingers and hands of those who persisted in clinging to the boat The lamentation rose to the heavensWhen they mustered on the farther bank many were missing only a dozen of the Emperors suite were leftYang Feng found a bullock cart and transported the Emperor and Empress to DayangThey had no food and at night sought shelter in a poor tileroofed house The cottagers gave them some boiled millet but it was too coarse to be swallowedNext day the Emperor conferred titles on those who had protected him Li Yue was made General Who Conquers the North and Han Xian was appointed General Who Conquers the East The flight continuedSoon two officers of rank came up with the cortege and they bowed before His Majesty with many tears They were Regent Marshal Yang Biao and Minister Han RongThe Emperor and Empress lifted up their voices and wept with themSaid Han Rong to his colleague The rebels have confidence in my wordsYou stay as guard of the Emperor and I will take my life in my hands and try to bring about peace After Han Rong had gone the Emperor rested for a time in Yang Fengs campBut Yang Biao requested the Emperor to head for Anyi and make the capital thereWhen the train reached the town they found it containing not a single lofty building and the court lived in grass huts devoid even of doorsThey surrounded these with a fence of thorns as a protection and within this the Emperor held counsel with his ministers The soldiers camped round the fenceNow Li Yue and his fellow ruffians showed their true colors They wielded the powers of the Emperor as they wished and officials who offended them were beaten or abused even in the presence of the EmperorThey purposely provided thick wine and coarse food for the Emperors consumption He struggled to swallow what they sentLi Yue and Han Xian joined in recommending to the Throne the names of convicts common soldiers sorcerers leeches and such people who thus obtained official ranks There were more than two hundred of such peopleAs seals could not be engraved pieces of metal were hammered into some sort of a shapeNow Han Rong went to see Li Jue and Guo SiAfter listening to his vigorous persuasions the two rebel generals agreed to set free the officials and palace peopleA famine occurred that same year and people were reduced to eating grass from the roadside Starving they wandered hither and thitherBut food and clothing were sent to the Emperor from the governor of Henei Zhang Yang and the governor of Hedong Wang Yi and the court began to enjoy a little reposeDong Cheng and Yang Feng sent laborers to restore the palaces in Luoyang with the intention of moving the court thitherLi Yue was opposed to thisDong Cheng argued Luoyang is the original capital as opposed to the paltry town of AnyiRemoval would be but reasonable Li Yue wound up by saying You may get the court to remove but I shall remain here But when the consent of the Emperor had been given and a start made Li Yue secretly sent to arrange with Li Jue and Guo Si to capture the Emperor However this plot leaked out and the escort so arranged as to prevent such a thing and they pressed on to the pass at Zhiguan Hills as rapidly as possibleLi Yue heard this and without waiting for his rebel colleagues to join him set out to act aloneAbout the fourth watch just as the cavalcade was passing Zhiguan Hills a voice was heard shouting Stop those carriagesLi Jue and Guo Si are here This frightened the Emperor greatly and his terror increased when he saw the whole mountain side suddenly light up IndeedThe rebel party erstwhile split in twain To work their wicked will now join three againHow the Son of Heaven escaped this peril will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER Cao Cao Moves The Court To Xuchang Lu Bu NightRaids Xuzhou The last chapter closed with the arrival of Li Yue who shouted out falsely that the army was that of the two arch rebels Li Jue and Guo Si come to capture the imperial cavalcade But Yang Feng recognized the voice of Li Yue and bade Xu Huang go out to fight himXu Huang went and in the first bout the traitor fellThe White Wave rebels scattered and the travelers got safely through Zhiguan Hills Here the Governor of Henei Zhang Yang supplied them plentifully with food and other necessaries and escorted the Emperor to ZhidaoFor his timely help the Emperor conferred upon Zhang Yang the rank of a Grand CommanderYang Feng moved his army to the northeast of Luoyang and camped at YewangCapital Luoyang was presently entered Within the walls all was destruction The palaces and halls had been burned the streets were overgrown with grass and brambles and obstructed by heaps of ruins The palaces and courts were represented by broken roofs and toppling wallsA small palace however was soon built and therein the officers of court presented their congratulations standing in the open air among thorn hushes and bramblesThe reign style was changed from Prosperous Stability to Rebuilt Tranquillity the first year The year was a year of grievous famineThe Luoyang people even reduced in numbers as they were to a few hundreds had not enough to eat and they prowled about stripping the bark off trees and grubbing up the roots of plants to satisfy their starving hunger Officers of the government of all but the highest ranks went out into the country to gather fuelMany people were crushed by the falling walls of burned housesAt no time during the decadence of Han did misery press harder than at this period A poem written in pity for the sufferings of that time saysMortally wounded the white serpent poured forth its life blood at Mangdang Hills Bloodred pennons of war waved then in every quarter Chieftain with chieftain strove and raided each others borders Midst the turmoil and strife the Kingship even was threatenedWickedness stalks in a country when the King is a weakling Brigandage always is rife when a dynastys failing Had one a heart of iron wholly devoid of feeling Yet would one surely grieve at the sight of such desolationRegent Marshal Yang Biao memorialized the Throne saying The decree issued to me some time ago has never been acted uponNow Cao Cao is very strong in the east of Huashang Mountains and it would be well to associate him in the government that he might support the ruling house The Emperor replied There was no need to refer to the matter againSend a messenger when you will So the decree went forth and a messenger bore it into the East of HuashangNow when Cao Cao had heard that the court had returned to Capital Luoyang he called together his advisers to consult Xun Yu laid the matter before Cao Cao and the council thus Eight hundred years ago Lord Wen of Yin supported Prince Xiang of the declining Shang Dynasty and all the feudal lords backed Lord WenThe Founder of the Hans Liu Bang won the popular favor by wearing mourning for Emperor Yi of QinNow Emperor Xian has been a fugitive on the dusty roads To take the lead in offering an army to restore him to honor is to have an unrivaled opportunity to win universal regardBut you must act quickly or some one will get in before you Cao Cao understood and at once prepared his army to moveJust at this moment an imperial messenger was announced with the very command Cao Cao wanted and Cao Cao immediately set out At Luoyang everything was desolateThe walls had fallen and there were no means of rebuilding them while rumors and reports of the coming of Li Jue and Guo Si kept up a state of constant anxietyThe frightened Emperor spoke with Yang Feng saying What can be doneThere is no answer from the East of Huashang and our enemies are near Then Yang Feng and Han Xian said We your ministers will fight to the death for you But Dong Cheng said The fortifications are weak and our military resources small so that we cannot hope for victory and what does defeat meanI see nothing better to propose than a move into the east of Huashang Mountains The Emperor agreed to this and the journey began without further preparationThere being few horses the officers of the court had to march afootHardly a bowshot outside the gate they saw a thick cloud of dust out of which came all the clash and clamor of an advancing armyThe Emperor and his Consort were dumb with fearThen appeared a horseman he was the messenger returning from the East of Huashang He rode up to the chariot made an obeisance and said General Cao Cao as commanded is coming with all the military force of the East of Huashang but hearing that Li Jue and Guo Si had again approached the capital he has sent Xiahou Dun in advanceWith Xiahou Dun are many capable leaders and fifty thousand of proved soldiers They will guard Your Majesty All fear was swept awaySoon after Xiahou Dun and his staff arrivedXiahou Dun Xu Chu and Dian Wei were presented to the Emperor who graciously addressed themThen one came to say a large army was approaching from the east and at the Emperors command Xiahou Dun went to ascertain who these wereHe soon returned saying they were Cao Caos infantryIn a short time Cao Hong Li Dian and Yue Jin came to the imperial chariot and their names having been duly communicatedCao Hong said When my brother Cao Cao heard of the approach of the rebels he feared that the advance guard he had sent might be too weak so he sent me to march quickly for reinforcement General Cao Cao is indeed a trusty servant said the EmperorOrders were given to advance Cao Hong leading the escortBy and by scouts came to say that the rebels were coming up very quicklyThe Emperor bade Xiahou Dun divide his force into two parts to oppose themXiahou Dun and Cao Hongs armies threw out two wings with cavalry in front and foot behindThey attacked with vigor and beat off the Li Jue and Guo Sis rebels with severe loss of ten thousandThen Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong begged the Emperor to return to Luoyang and Xiahou Dun guarded the cityNext day Cao Cao came with his great army and having got them duly camped he went into the city to audienceHe knelt at the foot of the steps but was called up hither to stand beside the Emperor and be thankedCao Cao replied Having been the recipient of great bounty thy servant owes the state much gratitudeThe measure of evil of the two rebels is full I have two hundred thousand of good soldiers to oppose them and those soldiers are fully equal to securing the safety of Your Majesty and the ThroneThe preservation of the state sacrifice is the matter of real moment High honors were conferred on Cao CaoHe was appointed Commander of Capital District Minister of War and granted Military InsigniaThe two rebels Li Jue and Guo Si wished to attack Cao Caos army while fatigued from its long marchBut their adviser Jia Xu opposed this saying There was no hope of victory He has both strong soldiers and brave leadersSubmission may bring us amnesty Li Jue was angry at the suggestion crying Do you wish to dishearten the army And he drew his sword on Jia Xu But the other officers interceded and saved the adviserThat same night Jia Xu stole out of the camp and quite alone took his way home to his native villageSoon the rebels decided to offer battle In reply Cao Cao sent out Xu Chu Cao Ren and Dian Wei with three hundred horse These three leaders dashed into the rebels army but quickly retiredThis maneuver was repeated and again repeated before the real battle array was formed Then Li Xian and Li Bie nephews of Li Jue rode out At once from Cao Caos side dashed out Xu Chu and cut down Li XianLi Bie was so startled that he fell out of the saddle He too was slain The victor Xu Chu rode back to his own side with the two headsWhen he offered them to the chief Cao Cao patted him on the back crying You are really my Fan Kuai  Next a general move forward was made Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong leading the two wings and Cao Cao in the center They advanced to the roll of the drumThe rebels fell back before them and presently fledThey pursued Cao Cao himself leading sword in hand The slaughter went on till night Ten thousands were killed and many more surrenderedLi Jue and Guo Si went west flying in panic like dogs from a falling houseHaving no place of refuge they took to the hills and hid among the brushwoodCao Caos army returned and camped again near the capitalThen Yang Feng and Han Xian said one to another This Cao Cao has done a great service and he will be the man in powerThere will be no place for us So they represented to the Emperor that they wished to pursue the rebels and under this excuse withdrew their army and camped at DaliangOne day the Emperor sent to summon Cao Cao to audience The messenger was called inCao Cao noticed that the messenger looked remarkably well and could not understand it seeing that everyone else looked hungry and famine strickenSo Cao Cao said You look plump and well Sir how do you manage it Only this I have lived meager for thirty years Cao Cao nodded What office do you hold I am a graduate recommended for filial piety and honestyI had offices under Yuan Shao and Zhang Yang but came here when the Emperor returned Now I am one of the secretariesI am a native of Dingtao and my name is Dong Zhao Cao Cao got up from his place and crossed over saying I have heard of youHow happy I am to meet you Then wine was brought into the tent and Xun Yu was called in and introducedWhile they were talking a man came in to report that a party was moving eastwardCao Cao ordered to find out whose people these were but Dong Zhao knew at onceThey are old leaders under the rebels Yang Feng and the White Wave General Han XianThey are running off because you have come Illustrious Sir Do they mistrust me said Cao Cao They are not worthy of your attentionThey are a poor lot What of this departure of Li Jue and Guo Si Tigers without claws birds without wingsthey will not escape you very longThey are not worth thinking about Cao Cao saw that he and his guest had much in common so he began to talk of affairs of stateSaid Dong Zhao You Illustrious Sir with your noble army have swept away rebellion and have become the mainstay of the Throne an achievement worthy of the ancient Five ProtectorsBut the officials will look at it in very different ways and not all favorably to youI think you would not be wise to remain here and I advise a change of capital to XuchangHowever it must be remembered that the restoration of the capital has been published far and wide and the attention of all the people is concentrated on Luoyang hoping for a period of rest and tranquillityAnother move will displease manyHowever the performance of extraordinary deed may mean the acquisition of extraordinary merit It is for you to decide Exactly my own inclination said Cao Cao seizing his guests hand But are there not dangers Yang Feng at Daliang and the court officials That is easily managedWrite to Yang Feng and set his mind at restThen say to the high officials plainly that there is no food in the capital here and so you are going to another place where there is and where there is no danger of scarcityWhen they hear it they will approve Cao Cao had now decided and as his guest took leave Cao Cao seized his hands once more saying I shall need your advice in future affairs Dong Zhao thanked and leftThereafter Cao Cao and his advisers secretly discussed the change of capital Now as to that Court Counselor Wang Li who was an astrologer said to Liu Ai Chair of the Imperial Office I have been studying the stars Since last spring Venus has been nearing the Guard star in the neighborhood of the Measure and the Cowherd  crossing the River of Heaven Mars has been retrograding and came into conjunction with Venus in the Gate of Heaven so that Metal  are mingled Thence must emerge a new rulerThe aura of the Hans is exhausted and the ancient states of Jin and Wei must increase A secret memorial was presented to the Emperor sayingThe Mandate of Heaven has its course and the five elementsmetal wood water fire and earthare out of proportionEarth attacking Fire is Wei attacking Han and the successor to the empire of Han is in Wei Cao Cao heard of these sayings and memorials and sent a man to the astrologer to say Your loyalty is well known but the ways of Heaven are past finding outThe less said the better Then Cao Cao discussed with Xun YuThe adviser expounded the meaning thus The virtue of Han was fire your element is earthXuchang is under the influence of earth and so your fortune depends on getting thereFire can overcome earth as earth can multiply wood Dong Zhao and Wang Li agree and you have only to hide your time So Cao Cao made up his mindNext day at court he said The capital is deserted and cannot be restored nor can it be supplied easily with foodXuchang is a noble city resourceful and close to Luyang a grain basinIt is everything that a capital should beI venture to request that the court move thither The Emperor dared not oppose and the officials were too overawed to have any independent opinion so they chose a day to set outCao Cao commanded the escort and the officials all followedWhen they had traveled a few stages they saw before them a high mound and from behind this there arose the beating of drumsThen Yang Feng and Han Xian came out and barred the wayIn front of all stood Xu Huang who shouted Cao Cao is stealing away the Emperor Cao Cao rode out and took a good look at this manHe seemed a fine fellow and in his secret soul Cao Cao greatly admired him although he was an enemyThen Cao Cao ordered Xu Chu to go and fight Xu HuangThe combat was battleax against broadsword and the two men fought more than half a hundred bouts without advantage to either side Cao Cao then beat the gongs and drew off his troops In the camp a council was calledCao Cao said The two rebels themselves need not be discussed but Xu Huang is a fine general and I was unwilling to use any great force against himI want to win him over to our side Then stepped out Man Chong replying Do not let that trouble you I will have a word with himI shall disguise myself as a soldier this evening and steal over to the enemys camp to talk to himI shall incline his heart toward you That night Man Chong duly disguised got over to the other side and made his way to the tent of Xu Huang who sat there by the light of a candle Xu Huang was still wearing his coat of mailSuddenly Man Chong ran out in front and saluted saying You have been well since we parted old friend Xu Huang jumped up in surprise gazed into the face of the speaker a long time and presently said What You are Man Chong of ShanyangWhat are you doing here I am an officer in General Cao Caos armySeeing my old friend out in front of the army today I wanted to say a word to himSo I took the risk of stealing in this evening and here I am Xu Huang invited Man Chong in and they sat downThen said Man Chong There are very few as bold as you on the earth why then do you serve such as your present chiefs Yang Feng and Han XianMy master is the most prominent man in the worlda man who delights in wise people and appreciates soldiers as every one knowsYour valor today won his entire admiration and so he took care that the attack was not vigorous enough to sacrifice you Now he has sent me to invite you to join himWill you not leave darkness for light and help him in his magnificent task Xu Huang sat a long time pondering over the offerThen he said with a sigh I know my masters are doomed to failure but I have followed their fortunes a long time and do not like to leave them But you know the prudent bird selects its tree and the wise servant chooses his masterWhen one meets a worthy master and lets him go one is very reckless I am willing to do what you say said Xu Huang risingWhy not put these two to death as an introductory gift said Man ChongIt is very wrong for a servant to slay his masterI will not do that True you are really a good man Then Xu Huang taking only a few horsemen of his own men with him left that night and deserted to Cao CaoSoon some one took the news to Yang Feng who at the head of a thousand strong horsemen set out to capture the deserter As they drew close Yang Feng called out Betrayer Stop there But Yang Feng fell into an ambushSuddenly the whole mountain side was lit up with torches and out sprang Cao Caos troops he himself being in command I have been waiting here a long time do not run away cried Cao CaoYang Feng was completely surprised and tried to draw off but was quickly surroundedThen Han Xian came to his rescue and a confused battle began Yang Feng succeeded in escaping while Cao Cao kept up the attack on the two disordered armiesA great number of the rebels gave in and the leaders found they had too few men left to maintain their independence so they betook themselves to Yuan ShuWhen Cao Cao returned to camp the newly surrendered general was presented and well received Then again the cavalcade set out for the new capitalIn due time they reached Xuchang and they built palaces and halls an ancestral temple and an altar terraces and public offices The walls were repaired storehouses built and all put in order Then came the rewards for Cao Caos adherents and othersDong Cheng and thirteen others were raised to rank of lordshipAll good service was rewarded certain others again who deserved it were punished all according to Cao Caos sole decision He himself was made Prime Minister Regent Marshal and Lord of WupingXun Yu was made Imperial Counselor and Chair of the Secretariat Xun You Minister of War Guo Jia Minister of Rites and Religion Liu Ye Minister of Works Mao Jie Minister of Agriculture and together with Ren Jun they were put over the military stores Cheng Yu was appointed Lord of Dongping Dong Zhao Magistrate of Luoyang Man Chong Magistrate of Xuchang Xiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Cao Ren Cao Hong Lu Qian Li Dian Yue Jin Yu Jin and Xu Huang were made Commanders Xu Chu and Dian Wei Commanders of Capital District All good service received full recognition Cao Cao was then the one man of the courtAll memorials went first to him and were then submitted to the Throne When state matters were in order Cao Cao gave a great banquet in his private quarters to all his advisers and affairs outside the capital were the subject of discussionThen Cao Cao said Liu Bei has his army at Xuzhou and he carries on the administration of the regionLu Bu fled to Liu Bei when defeated and Liu Bei gave Lu Bu Xiaopei to live in If these two agreed to join forces and attack my position would be most seriousWhat precautions can be taken Then rose Xu Chu saying Give me fifty thousand of picked soldiers and I will give the Prime Minister both their heads Xun Yu said O Leader you are brave but we must consider the present circumstanceWe cannot start sudden war just as the capital has been changedHowever there is a certain ruse known as Rival Tigers and One Prey Liu Bei has no decree authorizing him to govern the regionYou Sir Prime Minister can procure one for him and when sending it and so conferring upon him right in addition to his might you can enclose a private note telling him to get rid of Lu BuIf he does then he will have lost a vigorous warrior from his side and he could be dealt with as occasions serveShould he fail then Lu Bu will slay him This is Rival Tigers and One Prey ruse they wrangle and bite each other Cao Cao agreed that this was a good plan so he memorialized for the formal appointment which he sent to Liu BeiLiu Bei was created General Who Conquers the East Lord of Yicheng and Imperial Protector of Xuzhou as wellAt the same time a private note was enclosedIn Xuzhou when Liu Bei heard of the change of capital he began to prepare a congratulatory addressIn the midst of this an imperial messenger was announced and was met which all ceremony outside the gate When the epistle had been reverently received a banquet was prepared for the messengerThe messenger said This decree was obtained for you by Prime Minister Cao Cao Liu Bei thanked himThen the messenger drew forth his secret letter After reading it Liu Bei said This matter can be easily arranged The banquet over and the messenger conducted to his lodging to seek repose Liu Bei before going to rest called in his councilors to consider the letterThere need be no compunction about putting him to death said Zhang Fei Lu Bu is a bad man But he came to me for protection in his weakness how can I put him to death That would be immoral said Liu BeiIf he was a good man it would be difficult replied Zhang Fei Liu Bei would not consentNext day when Lu Bu came to offer congratulations he was received as usualHe said I have come to felicitate you on the receipt of the imperial bounty Liu Bei thanked him in due formBut then he saw Zhang Fei draw his sword and come up the hall as if to slay Lu Bu Liu Bei hastily interfered and stopped Zhang FeiLu Bu was surprised and said Why do you wish to slay me Zhang Fei Cao Cao says you are immoral and tells my brother to kill you shouted Zhang FeiLiu Bei shouted again and again to Zhang Fei to go away and he led Lu Bu into the private apartments out of the wayThen he told Lu Bu the whole story and showed him the secret letterLu Bu wept as he finished reading This is that miscreants scheme for sowing discord between us Be not anxious Elder Brother said Liu BeiI pledge myself not to be guilty of such an infamous crime Lu Bu again and again expressed his gratitude and Liu Bei kept him for a timeThey remained talking and drinking wine till lateSaid Guan Yu and Zhang Fei later Why not kill him Liu Bei said Because Cao Cao fears that Lu Bu and I may attack him he is trying to separate us and get us to swallow each other while he steps in and takes the advantage Is there any other reason Guan Yu nodded assent but Zhang Fei said I want to get him out of the way lest he trouble us later That is not what a noble man should do said his elder brother Soon the messenger was dismissed and returned to the capital with a the reply from Liu BeiThe letter only said the instruction would take time to plan and implementBut the messenger when he saw Cao Cao told him the story of Liu Beis pledge to Lu BuThen said Cao Cao The plan has failed what next Xun Yu replied I have another trick called Tiger against Wolf in which the tiger is made to gobble up the wolf Let us hear it said Cao CaoSend to Yuan Shu to say that Liu Bei has sent up a secret memorial to the Throne that he wishes to subdue the southern regions around the Huai RiverYuan Shu will be angry and attack himThen you will order Liu Bei to dispose of Yuan Shu and so set them destroying each otherLu Bu will certainly think that is his chance and turn traitor This is the Tiger against Wolf trick Cao Cao thought this good and sent the messenger and also sent a false edict to Liu BeiWhen this came the messenger was received with all the ceremonies and the edict ordered the capture of Yuan Shu After the departure of the bearer Liu Bei called Mi Zhu who pronounced it a ruseIt may be said Liu Bei but the royal command is not to be disobeyed So the army was prepared and the day fixedSun Qian said A trusty man must be left on guard of the city And Liu Bei asked which of his brothers would undertake this taskI will guard the city said Guan YuI am constantly in need of your advice so how can we part said Liu BeiI will guard the city said Zhang Fei You will fail said Liu Bei After one of your drinking bouts you will get savage and flog the soldiersBeside you are rash and will not listen to any ones adviceI shall be uneasy all the time Henceforth I drink no more wine I will not beat the soldiers and I will always listen to advice said Zhang FeiI fear the mouth does not correspond to the heart said Mi ZhuI have followed my elder brother these many years and never broken faith why should you be contemptuous said Zhang FeiLiu Bei said Though you say this I do not feel quite satisfiedI will order Adviser Chen Deng to help you and keep you soberThen you will not make any mistake Chen Deng was willing to undertake this duty and the final orders were given The army of thirty thousand horse and foot left Xuzhou and marched toward Nanyang When Yuan Shu heard that a memorial had been presented proposing to take possession of his territories he broke out into abuse of Liu Bei You weaver of mats You plaiter of straw shoes You have been smart enough to get possession of a large region and elbow your way into the ranks of the noblesI was just going to attack you and now you dare to scheme against meHow I detest you So Yuan Shu at once gave orders to prepare an army of one hundred thousand under Ji Ling to attack XuzhouThe two armies met at Xuyi where Liu Bei was encamped in a plain with hills behind and a stream on his flank for his army was smallJi Ling was a native of the East of Huashang He used a very heavy threeedged swordAfter he had made his camp he rode out and began abusing his opponents shouting Liu Bei you rustic bumpkin how dare you invade this land I have a decree ordering me to destroy the Governor who behaves improperlyIf you oppose you will be assuredly punished replied Liu BeiJi Ling angrily rode out brandishing his weaponBut Guan Yu cried Fool do not attempt to fight And Guan Yu rode out to meet himThen they two fought and after thirty bouts neither had an advantageThen Ji Ling cried out for a rest So Guan Yu turned his horse away rode back to his own array and waited for Ji LingWhen the moment came to renew the combat Ji Ling sent out one of his officers Xun Zheng to take his placeBut Guan Yu said Tell Ji Ling to come I must settle with him who shall be tiger and who shall be deer You a reputationless leader and unworthy to fight with our general replied Xun ZhengThis reply angered Guan Yu who made just one attack on Xun Zheng and brought him to the ground At this success Liu Bei urged on the army and Ji Lings troops were defeatedThey retired to the mouth of the River Huaiyin and declined all challengesHowever many of their troops were sent into Liu Beis camp for harassment and many of them were slainThe two armies thus stood facing each other In Xuzhou after Liu Bei had started on his expedition Zhang Fei placed his colleague and helper Chen Deng in charge of the administration of the region keeping military affairs under his own supervisionAfter thinking over the matter or some time he gave a banquet to all the military officers and when they were all seated he made a speech Before my brother left he bade me keep clear of the wine cup for fear of accidentsNow gentlemen you may drink deep today but from tomorrow wine is forbidden for we must keep the city safeSo take your fill And with this he and all his guests rose to drink togetherThe wine bearer came to Cao Bao who declined it saying I never drink as I am forbidden of heaven WhatA fighting man does not drink wine said the hostI want you to take just one cup Cao Bao was afraid to offend so he drankNow Zhang Fei drank huge goblets with all his guests on every hand and so swallowed a huge quantity of liquor He became quite intoxicated Yet he would drink more and insisted on a cup with every guestIt came to the turn of Cao Bao who declined Really I cannot drink said Cao BaoYou drank just now why refuse this time Zhang Fei pressed him but still Cao Bao resistedThen Zhang Fei in his drunken madness lost control of his temper and said If you disobey the orders of your general you shall be beaten one hundred strokes And he called in his guards Here Chen Deng interfered reminding him of the strict injunctions of his brotherYou civilians attend to your civil business and leave us alone said Zhang FeiThe only way of escape for the guest was to beg remission and Cao Bao did so Sir if you saw my soninlaws face you would pardon me Who is your soninlaw Lu Bu I did not mean to have you really beaten but if you think to frighten me with Lu Bu I willI will beat you as if I was beating him said Zhang FeiThe guests interposed to beg him off but their drunken host was obdurate and the unhappy guest received fifty blows Then at the earnest prayers of the others the remainder of the punishment was remittedThe banquet came to an end and the beaten Cao Bao went away burning with resentment That night he sent a letter to Xiaopei relating the insults he had received from Zhang Fei The letter told Lu Bu of Liu Beis absence and proposed that a sudden raid should be made that very night before Zhang Fei had recovered from his drunken fitLu Bu at once summoned Chen Gong and told himXiaopei is only a place to occupy temporarily said Chen GongIf you can seize Xuzhou do soIt is a good chance Lu Bu got ready at once and soon on the way with five hundred cavalrymen ordering Chen Gong and Gao Shun to follow him with the main bodyXiaopei being only about fifteen miles away Lu Bu was under the walls at the fourth watch It was clear moonlight No one on the ramparts saw himLu Bu came up close to the wall and called out Liu Beis secret messenger has arrived The guards on the wall were Cao Baos people and they called himCao Bao came and when he saw who was there he ordered the gates to be openedLu Bu gave the secret signal and the soldiers entered shouting Zhang Fei was in his apartment sleeping off the fumes of wine His servants hastened to arouse him and told him an enemy had got the gates openThey said Lu Bu got in and there is fighting in the city Zhang Fei savagely got into his armor and laid hold of his mighty octaneserpent halberdBut as he was mounting his horse at the gate the attacking soldiers came upHe rushed at them but being still half intoxicated made but a poor fightLu Bu knowing Zhang Feis prowess did not press him hard and Zhang Fei made his way with eighteen leading Guards of Yan to the east gate and there went out leaving Liu Beis family to their fate Cao Bao seeing Zhang Fei had but a very small force and was still half drunk as well came in pursuit Zhang Fei saw who it was and was mad with rage He galloped toward Cao Bao and drove him off after a few passes He followed Cao Bao to the moat and wounded him in the backCao Baos frightened steed carried its master into the moat and he was drownedOnce well outside the city Zhang Fei collected his troops and they rode off toward the south directionLu Bu having surprised the city set himself to restore order He put a guard over the residence of Liu Bei so that no one should disturb the family Zhang Fei with his few followers went to his brothers camp and told his story of treachery and surpriseAll were greatly distressedSuccess is not worth rejoicing over failure is not worth grieving over said Liu Bei with a sighWhere are our sisters asked Guan Yu They shared the fate of the city Liu Bei nodded his head and was silentGuan Yu with an effort controlled his reproaches and said What did you say when you promised to guard the city and what orders did our brother give youNow the city is lost and therewith our sistersinlaw Have you done well Zhang Fei was overwhelmed by remorse He drew his sword to kill himselfHe raised the cup in pledge None might say nay Remorseful drew the sword Himself to slay Zhang Feis fate will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER Taishi Ci Fights With The Little Prince Sun Ce Cuts Short The White Tiger King In the last chapter it was recorded that Zhang Fei was about to end his life with his own weapon in Xuyi But Liu Bei rushed forward and caught Zhang Fei in his arms snatched away the sword and threw it on the earth saying Brothers are as hands and feet wives and children are as clothingYou may mend your torn dress but who can reattach a lost limbWe three by the Oath of the Peach Garden swore to seek the same death dayThe city is lost it is true and my wives and little ones but I could not bear that we should die ere our course be runBeside Xuzhou was not really ours and Lu Bu will not harm my family but will rather seek to preserve themYou made a mistake Worthy Brother but is it one deserving of death And Liu Bei weptHis brothers were much affected and their tears fell in sympathyAs soon as the news of Lu Bus successful seizure of his protectors region reached Yuan Shu Yuan Shu sent promises of valuable presents to Lu Bu to induce him to join in a further attack on Liu Bei The presents are said to have been fifty thousand carts of grain five hundred horses ten thousand ounces of gold and silver and a thousand rolls of colored silkLu Bu swallowed the bait and ordered Gao Shun to lead forth fifty thousand troopsBut Liu Bei heard of the threatened attack so he made inclement weather an excuse to moved his few soldiers out of Xuyi for Guangling before the attacking force came upHowever Gao Shun demanded the promised reward through Ji Ling who put Gao Shun off saying My lord has gone away I will settle this as soon as I can see him and get his decision With this answer Gao Shun returned to Lu Bu who could not decide what to doThen came a letter from Yuan Shu saying Although Gao Shun had gone to attack Liu Bei yet Liu Bei had not been destroyed and no reward could be given till he was actually taken Lu Bu railed at what he called the breach of faith and was inclined to attack Yuan Shu himself However his adviser Chen Gong opposed this course saying You should not Yuan Shu is in possession of Shouchun and has a large army well supplied You are no match for himRather ask Liu Bei to take up his quarters at Xiaopei as one of your wings and when the time comes let him lead the attack both south and northThen Yuan Shu and Yuan Shao will fall before you and you will be very powerful Finding this advice good Lu Bu sent letters to Liu Bei asking him to returnAfter the flight of Liu Bei Yuan Shu attacked Guangling and reduced Liu Beis force by halfWhen the messenger from Lu Bu came Liu Bei read the letter He was quite content with the offer but his brothers were not inclined to trust Lu BuSuch a dishonorable man must have a motive said Guan Yu and Zhang FeiSince he treats me kindly I cannot but trust him replied Liu BeiSo Liu Bei went back to XuzhouLu Bu fearing that Liu Bei might doubt his sincerity restored Liu Beis family and when Lady Gan and Lady Mi saw their lord they told him that they had been kindly treated and guarded by soldiers against any intrusion and provisions had never been wantingI knew he would not harm my family said Liu Bei to Guan Yu and Zhang Fei However Zhang Fei was not pleased and would not accompany his brothers into the city when they went to express their thanksHe went to escort the two ladies to Xiaopei At the interview Lu Bu said I did not wish to take the city but your brother behaved very badly drinking and flogging the soldiers and I came to guard it lest some evil should befall But I had long wished to yield it to you said Liu Bei Thereupon Lu Bu wished to retire in favor of Liu Bei who however would not hear of itLiu Bei returned and took up his quarters in Xiaopei but his two brothers would not take the situation kindly and were very discontentedSaid Liu Bei One must bow to ones lotIt is the will of Heaven and one cannot struggle against fate Lu Bu sent presents of food and stuffs and peace reigned between the two housesIn Shouchun Yuan Shu prepared a great banquet for his soldiers when it was announced that Sun Ce had subdued Lu Kang the Governor of LujiangYuan Shu summoned the victor who made obeisance at the foot of the hall of audienceYuan Shu sitting in state asked for details of the campaign and then invited Sun Ce to the banquetAfter the unhappy death of his father Sun Jian Sun Ce had returned to the lower region of the Great River where he had devoted himself to peaceful ends inviting to his side good people and able scholarsAfterwards when a quarrel broke out between his mothers brother Governor Wu Jing of Dangyang and the late Imperial Protector of Xuzhou Tao Qian Sun Ce removed his mother with all the family to Que he himself taking service under Yuan Shu who admired and loved him greatlyIf I had a son like Sun Ce said Yuan Shu I should die without regret Yuan Shu appointed Sun Ce Commander and sent him on various expeditions all of which were successfulAfter this banquet to celebrate the victory over Lu Kang Sun Ce returned to his camp very bitter over the arrogant and patronizing airs of his patronInstead of retiring to his tent Sun Ce walked up and down by the light of the moonHere am I a mere nobody and yet my father was such a hero And he cried out and wept in spite of himselfThen suddenly appeared one who said laughing loudly What is this Sun CeWhile your noble father enjoyed the light of the sun he made free use of me and if his son has any difficulty to resolve why does he not refer it to me also instead of weeping here alone Looking at the speaker Sun Ce saw it was Zhu Zhi a native of Dangyang who had been in Sun Jians serviceSun Ce then ceased weeping and they two sat down I was weeping from regret at being unable to continue my fathers work said Sun Ce Why stay here bound to the service of a master The Governor of Dangyang is in distressWhy not get command of an army under the pretense of an expedition to relieve Wu JingEscape the shadow of Yuan Shu and take control of Dangyang then you can accomplish great things While these two were talking another man suddenly entered saying I know what you two are planning Noble SirsUnder my hand is a band of one hundred bold fellows ready to help Sun Ce in whatever he wishes to do The speaker was one of Yuan Shus advisers named Lu Fan from RunanThey three then sat and discussed schemesThe one fear is that Yuan Shu will refuse to give you the troops said Lu FanI still have the Imperial Hereditary Seal that my father left me that should be good security Yuan Shu earnestly desires that jewel said Zhu ZhiHe will certainly lend you troops on that pledge The three talked over their plans gradually settling the details and not many days after Sun Ce obtained an interview with his patron Assuming the appearance of deep grief Sun Ce said I have been unable to avenge my fatherNow the Imperial Protector of Yangzhou Liu Yao is opposing my mothers brother and my mother and her family are in danger in QueWherefore I would borrow a few thousands of fighting men to rescue themAs perhaps Illustrious Sir you may lack confidence in me I am willing to deposit the Imperial Hereditary Seal left me by my late father as a pledge Let me see it if you have it said Yuan ShuI do not want the jewel really but you may as well leave it with meI will lend you three thousand troops and five hundred horsesReturn as soon as peace can be madeAs your rank is hardly sufficient for such powers I will memorialize to obtain for you higher rank with the title of General Who Exterminates Brigands and you can soon start Sun Ce thanked his patron most humbly and soon put the army in motion taking with him his two new advisers and his fathers generalsZhu Zhi Lu Fan Cheng Pu Huang Gai Han Dang and othersWhen Sun Ce reached Linyang he saw a body of troops in front of him at their head a dashing leader of handsome and refined mienAs soon as this commander saw Sun Ce he dismounted and made obeisanceIt was Zhou Yu from ShuchengWhen Sun Jian was opposing the tyrant Dong Zhuo he moved his family to Shucheng where the Zhou family had livedAnd as Zhou Yu and Sun Ce were of the same age all but two months they became exceedingly good friends and sworn brothers Sun Ce being the elder in virtue of his two months seniorityZhou Yu was on his way to visit Sun Ces uncle Governor Wu Jing of Dangyang when the happy meeting took placeNaturally Sun Ce confided his projects and inmost ideas to his friend who at once said I shall put my whole life and energy to serve you to reach that grand goal Now that you have come the design is as good as accomplished said Sun CeZhou Yu was introduced to Zhu Zhi and Lu FanZhou Yu said Do you know of the two Zhangs of GuanglingThey would be most useful people in working out your schemes Who are they the two Zhangs said Sun CeThey are men of transcendent genius who are living near here for the sake of tranquillity in these turbulent times Their names are Zhang Zhao and Zhang HongWhy not invite them to help you Brother Sun Ce lost no time in sending letters and gifts but they both declinedThen he visited them in person was greatly pleased with their speech and by dint of large gifts and much persuasion got them to promise to join himSun Ce appointed them both Counselors and Generals The plan of the attack upon Yangzhou was the next matter for discussionThe Imperial Protector Liu Yao was of Donglai a scion of the imperial family and brother of the Imperial Protector of Yanzhou Liu DaiLiu Yao had long ruled in Yangzhou and headquartered in Shouchun But Yuan Shu had forced him to flee to the southeast of the Great River He retired to Que and now was battling with Wu Jing in LinyangHearing of the meditated attack on him Liu Yao summoned his generals to take counselSaid General Zhang Ying I will take an army and entrench at NiuzhuNo army can get past that whatever its strength Zhang Ying was interrupted by another who shouted And let me lead the van All eyes turned to this man it was Taishi Ci who after helping Kong Rong raise the siege of Beihai had come to serve Liu YaoHearing him offer to undertake the hazardous post of van leader Liu Yao said But you are still young and not yet equal to such a chargeRather stay by my side and await my orders Taishi Ci withdrew in disappointmentSoon Zhang Ying led his army to Niuzhu where the stores of grain locatedWhen Sun Ce approached Zhang Ying went to meet him and the two armies faced each other above the Bullock RapidZhang Ying roundly abused his opponent and Huang Gai rode out to attack himBut before the combat had proceeded far there arose an alarm of fire in Zhang Yings campZhang Ying turned back and then Sun Ce advanced in full force compelling the enemy to abandon their possessionThe defeated general fled to the hillsNow the incendiaries who had brought about this result were two named Jiang Qin from Shouchun and Zhou Tai from Jiujiang who in these turbulent times had got together a band of kindred spirits and lived by plundering the country along the Great RiverThey knew Sun Ce by reputation as a man who treated able people very liberally and wished to join him So they came with their band three hundred strong and helped him in this way as an introductionSun Ce welcomed them and gave the leaders rankAfter taking possession of the stores of all kinds abandoned by the runaways and enlisting four thousand of those who surrendered into his own ranks Sun Ce moved forward to attack ShentingAfter his defeat Zhang Ying returned to his master and told his misfortuneLiu Yao was going to punish his failure by death but listened to his advisers who asked for mercy for the unfortunate man and sent him to command the garrison in Lingling Liu Yao himself set out to meet the invadersHe camped south of the Sacred Hills Sun Ce camped on the opposite side of the hillsSun Ce inquired the natives Is there a temple of Liu Xiu the Founder of Latter Hans in the vicinity They said There is a temple to the south on the summit of the hills I dreamed last night that Liu Xiu called me so I will go and pray there said Sun CeBut Counselor Zhang Zhao advised My lord you should not go as the enemy is on the other side and you may fall into an ambush The spirit will help me what need I fear So Sun Ce put on his armor took his spear and mounted taking with him twelve of his commanders as an escortThey rode up the hills dismounted burned incense and they all bowed in the shrineThen Sun Ce knelt and made a vow saying If I Sun Ce succeed in my task and restore the authority of my late father then will I restore this temple and order sacrifices at the four seasons When they had remounted Sun Ce said I am going to ride along the ridge and reconnoiter the enemys position His commanders begged him to refrain but he was obstinate and they rode there together noting the villages belowA soldier of the other side going along a bye road quickly reported the presence of horsemen on the ridge and Liu Yao said It is certainly Sun Ce trying to inveigle us to battleBut do not go out Taishi Ci jumped up saying What better chance to capture him So without orders he armed himself and rode through the camp crying If there be any valiant people among you follow me No one moved save a subaltern who said He is a valiant man and I will go with him So he also wentThe others only laughed at the pairNow having seen all he wished Sun Ce thought it time to return and wheeled round his horseBut when he was going over the summit some one shouted Stay Sun Ce Sun Ce turned two horsemen were coming at full speed down the next hillSun Ce halted and drew up his little escort right and left he himself with his spear readyWhich is Sun Ce shouted Taishi CiWho are you was the replyI Taishi Ci of Laihuang come to take him prisoner Then I am he said Sun Ce laughingCome both of you together I am not afraid of youIf I were I should not be Sun Ce You and all your crowd come on and I will not blench cried Taishi Ci putting his horse at a gallop and setting his spearSun Ce braced himself for the shock and the battle beganFifty bouts were fought and still neither combatant had the advantageSun Ces commanders whispered to each other their admiration and amazementTaishi Ci saw that the spearmanship of his opponent showed no weak point whereby he could gain the advantage so he decided to resort to guile Feigning defeat he would lead Sun Ce to pursueTaishi Ci however did not retire along the road by which he had come but took a path leading around the hill instead of over itHis antagonist followed shouting He who retreats is no worthy soldier But Taishi Ci thought within himself He has twelve others at his back and I only one If I capture him the others will retake himI will inveigle him into some secret spot and then try So flying and fighting by turns he led Sun Ce an eager pursuer down to the plainHere Taishi Ci suddenly wheeled about and attackedAgain they exchanged half a hundred bouts without resultThen Sun Ce made a fierce thrust which his opponent evaded by gripping the spear under his arm while he himself did the same with his opponents spearNeither was wounded but each exerting his utmost strength to pull the other out of the saddle they both came to the groundTheir steeds galloped off they knew not whither while the two men each dropping his spear began a hand to hand struggleSoon their fighting robes were in tatters Sun Ce gripped the short lance that Taishi Ci carried at his back while Taishi Ci tore off the Sun Ces helmetSun Ce tried to stab with the short lance but Taishi Ci fended off the blow with the helmet as a shieldThen arose a great shouting Liu Yao had come up with a thousand soldiers Sun Ce seemed now in sore straitsHis twelve followers came up and each combatant let go his holdTaishi Ci quickly found another steed seized a spear and mountedSun Ce whose horse had been caught by Cheng Pu also mounted and a confused battle began between the handful of men on one side and a whole thousand troops on the other It swayed and drifted down the hill sideHowever soon Zhou Yu leading his troops came to the rescue and as evening drew on a tempest put an end to the fight Both sides drew off and returned to campNext day Sun Ce led his army to the front of Liu Yaos camp and the challenge was accepted The armies were drawn upSun Ce hung the short lance he had seized from Taishi Ci at the end of his spear and waved it in front of the line of battle and ordered his soldiers to shout If the owner of this had not fled he would have been stabbed to death On the other side they hung out Sun Ces helmet and the soldiers shouted back Sun Ces head is here already Both sides thus yelled defiance at each other one side boasting the other braggingThen Taishi Ci rode out challenging Sun Ce to a duel to the death and Sun Ce would have accepted but Cheng Pu said My lord should not trouble himself I will take him And Cheng Pu rode forthYou are no antagonist for me said Taishi CiTell your master to come out This incensed Cheng Pu who rode at his opponent and they two fought thirty bouts The duel was stopped by the gongs of Liu Yao Why did you sound the retreat said Taishi CiI was just going to capture the wretch Because I have just heard that Que has been capturedZhou Yu led a surprise force thither and Chen Wu was in league with him to betray the cityWe have no home nowI will hasten to Moling to get the help of Xue Li and Ze Rong to retake the city The army retired Taishi Ci with it without being pursuedOn the other side Zhang Zhao said to Sun Ce Zhou Yus attack is the cause of this move they are in no mood to fightA night raid on their camp would finish them The army was divided into five divisions for the night surprise and hastened toward the camp where they scored a victory Their opponents scattered in all directionsTaishi Ci alone made a determined stand and as he could not withstand a whole army he fled with ten horsemen to Jingxian Now Sun Ce acquired a new adherent in the person of Chen Wu He was a soldier of middle height sallow of complexion and dark eye an odd looking manBut Sun Ce held him in high esteem appointed him Commander and put him in the van of the attack on Xue LiAs Van Leader Chen Wu and a dozen horsemen made a dash into the enemys formation where they slew half a hundred men So Xue Li would not fight but remained within his defensesAs Sun Ce was attacking the city a spy came in with the news that Liu Yao and Ze Rong had gone to attack Niuzhu which made Sun Ce move thither in haste His two opponents were ready for battleI am here said Sun Ce you would better give in A general came out from behind Liu Yao to accept the challenge It was Yu Mi But in the third bout Sun Ce made him prisoner and carried him off to the other sideSeeing his colleague thus captured Fan Neng rode out to the rescue and got quite closeBut just as he was going to thrust all Sun Ces soldiers shouted There is a man behind you going to strike secretly At this Sun Ce turned and shouted so thunderously loud that Fan Neng fell out of his saddle from mere fright He split his skull and diedWhen Sun Ce reached his standard he threw his prisoner to the ground And Yu Mi was also dead crushed to death between the arm and the body of his captorSo in a few moments Sun Ce had disposed of two enemies one crushed to death and one frightened to death Thereafter Sun Ce was called the Little PrinceLiu Yao had a defeat the greater portion of his force surrendered and the number of those slain exceeded ten thousandLiu Yao himself fled to Yuzhang and sought safety with Liu Biao Imperial Protector of Jingzhou An attack on Moling was the next moveAs soon as Sun Ce arrived at the moat he summoned Commander Xue Li to surrenderSome one let fly a furtive arrow from the wall which wounded Sun Ce in the left thigh so severely that he fell from his steed Hastily his officers picked up their wounded chief and returned to the camp where the arrow was pulled out and the wound dressed with the medicines suitable for injuries by metalsBy Sun Ces command the story was spread abroad that the hurt had been fatal and all the soldiers set up cries of lamentationThe camp was broken upXue Li Zhang Ying and Chen Heng made a night sortie but fell into a carefully prepared ambush and presently Sun Ce himself appeared on horseback shoutingSun Ce is here still His sudden appearance created such a panic that the soldiers dropped their weapons and fell on their facesSun Ce gave orders not to kill them But their leaders fellZhang Ying from Chen Wus spear thrust as he turned to run away Chen Heng was killed by Jiang Qins arrow and the Commander Xue Li was slain in the turbulence Thus Sun Ce got possession of MolingHaving calmed the people he sent his soldiers away to Jingxian where Taishi Ci was in commandTaishi Ci had assembled two thousand veterans in addition to his own troops for the purpose of avenging his masterSun Ce and Zhou Yu on the other hand consulted how to capture him aliveZhou Yu planned Attack the city on three sides leaving the east gate free for flightSome distance off an ambush shall be prepared when Taishi Ci his men fatigued and horses spent shall fall an easy victim The latest recruits under Taishi Cis banner were mostly hillmen and unaccustomed to disciplineBeside the walls of the city were pitiably lowOne night Sun Ce ordered Chen Wu to strip off his long dress leave his arms save a dagger clamber up the ramparts and set fire to the citySeeing the flames spreading Taishi Ci made for the east gate and as soon as he got outside Sun Ce followed in pursuitThe pursuit was maintained for some fifteen miles when the pursuers stopped Taishi Ci went on as long as possible finally halting to rest in a spot surrounded by reeds Suddenly a tremendous shouting aroseTaishi Ci was just starting when tripping ropes arose all round his horse was thrown and he found himself a prisoner Taishi Ci was taken back to campAs soon as Sun Ce heard the news he himself rode out to order the guards to leave the prisoner whose bonds he loosened with his own hands Then he took off his own embroidered robe and put it on the captive They entered the camp together I knew you were a real hero said Sun CeThat worm of a Liu Yao had no use for such as you and so he got beaten Taishi Ci overcome by this kindness and good treatment then formally surrenderedSun Ce seized his hand and said laughing If you had taken me at that fight we had near the shrine would you have killed me Who can say said Taishi Ci smilingSun Ce laughed also and they entered his tent where Taishi Ci was placed in the seat of honor at a banquetTaishi Ci said Can you trust me so far as to let me go to muster as many as I can of the soldiers of my late masterUnder the smart of this defeat they will turn against him and they would be a great help to you Exactly what I most desireI will make an agreement with you that at midday tomorrow you will return Taishi Ci agreed and went offAll the generals said he would never returnHe is trustworthy and will not break his word said the chief None of the officers believed he would come backBut the next day they set up a bamboo rod in the gate of the camp and just as the shadow marked noon Taishi Ci returned bringing with him about a thousand troopsSun Ce was pleased and his officers had to confess that he had rightly judged his manSun Ce thus marched his army to the South Land and his enemies fled or surrendered before his force He had now several legions and the southeast of the Great River was his He improved the conditions of the people and maintained order so that his adherents and supporters daily increasedHe was called Sun Ce the BrightWhen his army approached the people used to flee in terror but when it had arrived and they saw that no one was permitted to loot and not the least attempt was made on their houses they rejoiced and presented the soldiers with oxen and wine for which they were in turn duly rewarded Gladness filled the country sideThe soldiers who had followed Liu Yao were kindly treated Those who wished to join Sun Ces army did so those who preferred not to be soldiers were sent home with presentsAnd thus Sun Ce won the respect and praise of every one and became very powerfulSun Ce then settled his mother and the remainder of the family in Que setting his brother Sun Quan and Zhou Tai over the city of XuanchengThen he headed an expedition to the south to reduce WujunAt that time there was a certain Yan Baihu or the White Tiger who styled himself King of Eastern Wu  and ruled over Wujun His armies stationed at Wucheng and JiaxingHearing of Sun Ces approach Yan Baihu sent his brother Yan Yu with an army against Sun Ce and they met at Juniper BridgeYan Yu sword in hand took his stand on the bridge and this was reported to Sun Ce who prepared to accept the challengeZhang Hong tried to dissuade him saying For as much as my lords fate is bound up with that of the army he should not risk a conflict with a mere robberI wish that you should remember your own value Your words O Wise One are as gold and precious stones but I fear that my soldiers will not carry out my commands unless I myself share their dangers However Sun Ce sent forth Han Dang to take up the challengeJust as Han Dang reached the bridge Jiang Qin and Chen Wu who had dropped down the river in a small boat passed under the bridgeThough the arrows fell in clouds on the bank the two men rushed up and fiercely attacked Yan Yu as he stood on the bridgeYan Yu fled and Han Dang went in pursuitBut Yan Yu smote up to the west gate of the city into which he enteredSun Ce laid siege to Wujun both by land and waterFor three days no one came out to offer battleThen at the head of his army Sun Ce came to the west gate and summoned the wardenAn officer of inconsiderable rank came out and stood with one hand resting on a beam while with the other he gave point to his abuse of those belowQuickly Taishi Cis hands sought his bow and an arrow was on the string See me hit that fellows hand said he turning to his companionsEven as the sound of his voice died away the bowstring twanged the arrow sped and lodged in the beam firmly pinning thereto the officers handBoth sides those on the wall and those below it marveled and acclaimed at such marksmanship The wounded man was taken awayWhen Yan Baihu the White Tiger heard of the exploit he said How can we hope to withstand an army with such people as this in it And his thoughts turned toward a peaceHe sent his brother Yan Yu out to see Sun Ce who received him civilly invited him into the tent and set wine before himAnd what does your brother propose said Sun CeHe is willing to share this region with you was the replyThe rat How dare he put himself on a level with me cried Sun CeSun Ce commanded to put the messenger to deathYan Yu started up and drew his sword but out flew Sun Ces blade and the unhappy messenger fell to the ground His head was hacked off and sent into the city to his brother This had its effectYan Baihu saw resistance was hopeless so he abandoned Wujun and fled Sun Ce pressed the attackHuang Gai captured Jiaxing and Taishi Ci took Wucheng Several other southern cities were fallen The territory was quickly subduedYan Baihu rushed off toward Yuhang in the east plundering on all sides till a band of villagers under the leadership of one Ling Cao checked his career of robbery there Yan Baihu then fled toward KuaijiLing Cao and his son then went to meet Sun Ce who took them into his service and appointed them Commanders as a reward for their service and the joint forces crossed the Great RiverThe White Tiger Yan Baihu gathered his scattered forces and took up a position at Western Ford but Cheng Pu attacked him there and scattered the defenders chasing them as far as KuaijiThe Governor of the place Wang Lang was on Yan Baihus side and inclined to support him actively But when Wang Lang proposed this one of his officers stood forth saying NoSun Ce as a leader is humane and upright while the White Tiger is a savage ruffian Rather capture him and offer his person as a peace offering to Sun Ce The Governor turned angrily toward the speaker who was an official named Yu Fan from Kuaiji and bade him be silent Yu Fan withdrew sighing deeplyAnd the Governor went to the help of the White Tiger with whom he joined forces at Shanyin Sun Ce came upWhen both sides were arrayed Sun Ce rode out and addressed Wang Lang saying Mine is an army of good soldiers and my aim is to restore peace to this region but you give your support to a rebel Wang Lang replied Your greed is insatiableHaving got possession of Wujun you want also my territoryI shall revenge for the Yans This response greatly angered Sun CeJust as battle was to be joined Taishi Ci advanced and Wang Lang came toward him waving a swordBefore they had exchanged many passes Zhou Xin dashed out to help Wang Lang Thereupon Huang Gai rode out to make the sides more equalThese latter two were just engaging when the drums rolled on both sides and a general battle beganSuddenly confusion was caused in the rear of Wang Langs army by the sudden onslaught of a small armyWang Lang galloped off to see the attackers were Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu Then an attack was made on his flank so that he was in a hopeless position and he and Yan Baihu and Zhou Xin fighting desperately to cut an arterial alley only just managed to reach the shelter of the city The drawbridges were raised the gates closed and preparations made to sustain a siegeSun Ce followed right up to the walls and then divided his troops so as to attack all four gatesSeeing that the city was being fiercely attacked Wang Lang was for making a sortie but Yan Baihu opposed this as hopeless against so strong a force outsideWe can only strengthen our position and remain behind the shelter of the ramparts until hunger forces the besiegers to retire said Yan Baihu Wang Lang agreed and the siege went onFor several days a vigorous attack was maintained but with little successIn a council Sun Jing who was the uncle of Sun Ce said Since they are holding the city with such resolution it will be difficult to dislodge themBut the bulk of their supplies is stored at Chadu distant only some ten milesOur best plan is to seize this place thus attacking where the enemy is unprepared and doing what they do not expect Sun Ce approved saying My uncles plan is admirable and will crush the rebels So he issued orders to kindle watch fires at all the gates and leave the flags standing to maintain the appearance of soldiers in position while the expedition went southZhou Yu came to utter a warning When you my lord go away the besieged will surely come out and follow youWe might prepare a surprise for them Sun Ce replied My preparations are complete and the city will be captured tonight So the army set outWang Lang heard that the besiegers had gone and he went up to the tower to reconnoiterHe saw the fires blazing the smoke rising and the pennons fluttering in the breeze as usual and hesitatedZhou Xin said He has gone and this is only a strategyLet us go out and smite them Yan Baihu said If he has gone it is to attack ChaduLet us pursue The place is our base of supply said Wang Lang and must be defendedYou two lead the way and I will follow with reserves So Yan Baihu and Zhou Xin went forth with five thousand soldiers and drew near their enemy about the first watch at seven miles from the city The road led through dense forestThen suddenly the drums beat and lighted torches sprang up on all sidesYan Baihu was frightened turned his horse and started to retreat At once a leader appeared in front in whom by the glare of the torches he recognized Sun CeZhou Xin made a rush at him but fell under Sun Ces spearThe men surrenderedHowever Yan Baihu managed to cut his way out and fled to YuhangWang Lang soon heard of the loss and not daring to return to the city fled in all haste to the coastal regionsAnd so Sun Ce got possession of the city of KuaijiHaving restored order a few days later a man came bringing the head of the White Tiger as an offering to Sun Ce This man was a native of the countyHe was of medium height with a square face and wide mouthHe was named Dong XiSun Ce appointed him CommanderAfter this peace reigned in all the southeast Sun Ce placed his uncle Sun Jing in command of the city and made Zhu Zhi Governor of Wujun Then Sun Ce returned to his own place south of the Great RiverWhile Sun Ce was absent a band of brigands suddenly attacked Xuancheng left in the care of his brother Sun Quan and the leader Zhou TaiAs the onslaught was made on all sides at once and in the night the brigands got the upper handZhou Tai took the youth in his arms and mounted a horse but as the robbers came on with swords to attack him he dismounted and though without mail met the robbers on foot and slew them as they came up Then came a horseman armed with a spear but Zhou Tai laid hold of his spear and pulled him to the earth Then Zhou Tai mounted the robbers horse and thrusting this way and that with the spear fought his way out So Sun Quan was preserved but his savior had received more than a dozen woundsHowever the bandits went awayThese wounds being due to metal would not heal but swelled enormously and the brave soldiers life hung in the balance Sun Ce returned and was deeply grievedThen Dong Xi said Once in an engagement with some coastal pirates I received many spear wounds but a certain wise man named Yu Fan recommended a surgeon who cured me in half a month Surely this must be Yu Fan of Kuaiji replied Sun CeThat is he he is so called Yes truly a wise man I would employ him So Sun Ce sent two officers to invite Yu Fan and he came at onceHe was treated in most friendly fashion and appointed an official forthwith Then the question of treating the wounded man was brought upThe surgeon is one Hua Tuo from Qiao who has perfectly marvelous medicine skillI will get him to come said Yu FanShortly the famous Hua Tuo arrived a man with the complexion of a youth and a snowy beard He looked more like a saint who had passed the gates of this lifeHe was treated very warmly and taken to see the sick generals woundsThe case is not difficult said the surgeonAnd he prepared certain drugs that healed the wounds within a month Sun Ce suitably acknowledged his care and skill and he was allowed to leave with rich rewardsNext Sun Ce attacked the brigands and destroyed them so restoring complete tranquillity to the South LandAfter this he set garrisons at all the strategic points in the old state of Wu and this done memorialized what he had achieved to the ThroneHe came to an understanding with Cao Cao and sent letters to Yuan Shu demanding the return of the Imperial Hereditary Seal he had left in pledgeBut Yuan Shu secretly cherishing the most ambitious designs wrote excuses and did not return the state jewelIn his own place Yuan Shu hastily summoned about thirty of his officers to a council Among them were Adviser Yang Dajiang and Generals Zhang Xun Ji Ling Qiao Rui Lei Bo and Chen Lan Yuan Shu said Sun Ce borrowed an army from me and set out on an expedition which has made him master of the South LandNow he says nothing of repayment but demands the token of his pledge Truly he is a boor and what steps can I take to destroy him Yang Dajiang replied You cannot do any thing against him for he is too strongly placed the Great River as the shieldYou must first remove Liu Bei in revenge for having attacked you without cause and then you may think about Sun Ce I have a scheme to put the former into your hands in a very short time Yuan Shu went not to destroy the tiger but instead Against a dragon forth his army ledThe means Yang Dajiang employed will be made plain in the next chapterCHAPTER In The Camp Gate Lu Bu Shoots The Halberd At River Yu Cao Cao Suffers Defeat Adviser Yang Dajiang knew how to remove Liu BeiWhat is your plan of attack on Liu Bei said Yuan ShuYang Dajiang replied Though Liu Bei now camped at Xiaopei could easily be taken yet Lu Bu is strongly posted at the chief city nearAnd I think Lu Bu would help Liu Bei if it was only for the grudge he bears against you for not having given him the gold and studs grain and horses you promisedFirst of all you should send Lu Bu a present whereby to engage his affections and keep him quiet while you deal with Liu BeiYou can see to Lu Bu after this is done and Xuzhou is yours Thereupon two hundred thousand carts of millet was sent with letters by the hand of Han YinThe gift pleased Lu Bu greatly and he treated the messenger with great cordialityFeeling sure of no trouble from that quarter Yuan Shu told off one hundred thousand troops against Xiaopei The army was led by Ji Ling as commanding general and Lei Bo and Chen Lan as generals When Liu Bei heard these things he called his officers to take counselZhang Fei was for open war forthwithBut Sun Qian said Our resources were too small therefore we must lay the position before Lu Bu and ask help Do you think that fellow will do anything said Zhang Fei cynicallyLiu Bei decided in favor of Sun Qians proposal and wrote as followsHumbly I venture to remind you that I am here by your orders and enjoy repose as the result of your kindness extensive as the heavensNow Yuan Shu moved by a desire for revenge is sending a force against this place and its destruction is imminent unless you intervene to save itI trust you will send an army quickly to protect the town and our happiness will be inexpressible Receiving this Lu Bu called in Chen Gong to whom he said I have just received gifts from Yuan Shu and a letter with the intent of restraining me from helping Liu BeiNow comes a letter from Liu Bei asking helpIt seems to me that Liu Bei where he is can do me no harm but if Yuan Shu overcomes Liu Bei and comes to an understanding with the leaders around the Huashang Mountains then the power of the north is so much nearer and I should be unable to resist the attacks of so many leaders and should never sleep secureI will aid Liu Bei that is the better course for me Now Yuan Shus force sent against Xiaopei went thither as quickly as possible and soon the country to the southeast fluttered with pennons by day and blazed with watch fires by night while the rolling of the drums reverberated from heaven to earthThe five thousand troops at Liu Beis disposal were led out of the city and arranged to make a brave show but it was good news to him to hear that Lu Bu had arrived and was quite nearLu Bu camped only half a mile away to the southwestWhen Yuan Shus general Ji Ling heard of his arrival he wrote letters reproaching Lu Bu for his treachery Lu Bu smiled as he read them I know how to make both of them love me said Lu BuSo he sent invitations to both Liu Bei and Ji Ling to come to a banquet Liu Bei was for accepting the invitation and going but his brothers dissuaded him saying There is some treachery in his heart I have treated him too well for him to do me any harm said Liu BeiSo he mounted and rode away the two brothers followingThey came to the campThe host said Now by a special effort I have got you out of danger I hope you will not forget that when you come into your own Liu Bei thanked him heartily and was invited to take a seat Guan Yu and Zhang Fei took up their usual place as guardsBut when Ji Ling was announced Liu Bei felt a spasm of fear and got up to go awayYou two are invited for the particular purpose of a discussion said the host Do not take it amiss Liu Bei being quite ignorant of his intentions was very uneasy Presently his fellow guest enteredSeeing Liu Bei in the tent and in the seat of honor Ji Ling was puzzled hesitated and tried to withdrawBut the attendants prevented this and Lu Bu advancing laid hold of him and drew him into the tent as he had been a childDo you wish to slay me asked Ji LingNot at all replied Lu BuThen you are going to slay LongEars No not that Then what does it mean Liu Bei and I are brothersNow General you are besieging him and so I have come to the rescue Then slay me said Ji Ling There would be no sense in thatAll my life I have disliked fighting and quarrels but have loved making peaceAnd now I want to settle the quarrel between you two May I ask how you think of doing so I have a means and one approved of Heaven itself Then Lu Bu drew Ji Ling within the tent and led him up to Liu BeiThe two men faced each other full of mutual suspicion but their host placed himself between them and they took their seats Liu Bei on the right hand of the hostThe banquet beganAfter a number of courses almost in silence Lu Bu spoke saying I wish you two gentlemen to listen to me and put an end to your strife Liu Bei made no reply but Ji Ling said I have come with an army of one hundred thousand at the express bidding of my master to take Liu Bei How can I cease the strifeI must fight What exclaimed Zhang Fei drawing his swordFew as we are we regard you no more than a lot of childrenWhat are you compared with a million Yellow ScarvesYou dare hurt our brother Guan Yu urged him to be silent saying Let us see what General Lu Bu has to say first after that there will be time to go to our tents and fight I beg you both to come to an understandingI cannot let you fight said Lu BuNow on one side Ji Ling was discontented and angry on the other Zhang Fei was dying for a fight and neither of the two chiefly concerned would signify assentThen suddenly the host turned to his attendants saying Bring my trident halberd They did so and he sat there gripping that graceful but effective weapon in his right hand Both guests felt very ill at ease and turned paleLu Bu went on saying I have tried to persuade you to make peace for that is the command of the Most HighIt shall be put to the test He then bade his servants take the halberd outside beyond the gate and set it upThen speaking to his two guests he said That gate is one hundred and fifty paces distant If I can hit that left branch of the halberdhead with an arrow you will both withdraw your armies If I miss you can go away and prepare for immediate battleI shall stand against either of you who does not abide by what I say Ji Ling thought to himself That small mark at that distance How could any one hit it So he assented thinking he would have plenty of fighting after his host had missed the markOf course Liu Bei was willingThey all sat down again and wine was servedWhen this had been drunk the host called for his bow and arrows Liu Bei silently prayed that he would hit the markLu Bu turned back his sleeves carefully fitted an arrow to the string and pulled the bow to its utmost stretchA slight exclamation escaped him as the bow curved like the harvest moon sailing through the sky Twang went the bowstring and the arrow sped like a falling star And it struck the slender tongue of the halberd head full and squareA roar of acclamation from all sides greeted the exploit The multitude people often hail their praise O Lu Bu was a wonderful archer And the arrow he shot sped straight By hitting the mark he saved his friend That day at his camp gateHou Yi the archer of ancient days Brought down each mocking sun And the apes that gibbered to fright Yang Youji Were slain by him one by oneBut we sing of Lu Bu that drew the bow And his feathered shaft that flew For one hundred thousand soldiers could doff their mails When he hit the mark so true Lu Bu laughed loud at the success of his shot Dropping his bow he seized his guests by the hands saying The command of Heaven indeedAnd now you cease from fighting He ordered the soldier attendants to pour out great goblets of wine and each drank Liu Bei in his inmost heart felt rather lucky his fellow guest sat silent nodding his headPresently he said I cannot disobey your command General but let me departWhat will my master say and will he believe me I will write a letter and confirm it said Lu BuAfter a few more rounds of the wine Ji Ling asked that he might have the letter and after that departed When the brothers took their leave Lu Bu again reminded Liu Bei saying Do not forget I have delivered you today Liu Bei thanked him and departedNext day the leaders broke camps and the soldiers were goneWhen Ji Ling had got back to the South of River Huai and told the story of the feat of archery and the peace making that followed and had presented the letter his lord was very wrothLu Bu repays me for all my grain with this bit of play acting cried Yuan ShuHe has saved Liu Bei but I will lead a large army myself and settle both Liu Bei and him Be careful my lord said Ji LingLu Bu is braver and stronger than most leaders and has wide territoryHe and Liu Bei together make a powerful combination not easy to break But there is another courseI have found out that his wife Lady Yan has a daughter just of marriageable age and as you have a son you could arrange a marriage alliance with Lu BuIf his daughter wedded your son Lu Bu would certainly slay your enemy for you This is called RelativeaboveStranger plan This scheme appealed to Yuan Shu who soon set about its accomplishmentHe sent presents by the hand of Han Yin who was to discuss the questionWhen Han Yin saw Lu Bu he said My master has an immense respect for you Illustrious Sir and he desires to ensure perpetual alliance between the two families by a marriage an alliance such as existed between the ancient states of Qin and Jin Lu Bu was well disposed toward the scheme but went in to consult his wifeNow Lu Bu had two wives and one concubine He first married a lady of the Yan family and she was the legal wifeThen he took Diao Chan as a concubine And while he was living at Xiaopei he had married a secondary wife a daughter of Cao BaoLady Cao had died quite young leaving no issue Neither had Diao Chan borne any children So that Lu Bu had but one child this daughter of whom he was dotingly fondWhen he broached the subject his wife said The Yuans have dominated the regions around the River Huai these many years They have a large army and are very prosperousOne day a Yuan will become emperor and our daughter may hope to be an empressBut how many sons has Yuan Shu Only this one Then we should accept the offerEven if our daughter does not become an Empress Xuzhou has a new ally Lu Bu decided to accept and so treated the messenger with extreme generosityHan Yin went back with a favorable answerThe wedding gifts were then prepared ready for Han Yin to take to the brides familyThey were received and banquets and merrymaking filled all the timeNext day Chen Gong went to see the messenger in his lodging and when the usual ceremonies and greetings had been exchanged the two men sat down to talkWhen the servants had been sent out of earshot Chen Gong said Who originated this scheme by which Yuan Shu and Lu Bu are to become connections by this marriage so that Liu Beis head may fall Han Yin was terrifiedI pray you not to let it get abroad said he I certainly shall keep it secret But if there be any delay some other person will find it out and that spells failure said Chen GongWhat would best be done I will see Lu Bu and get him to send the girl immediately so that the marriage may be concluded quickly If it happened thus my master would indeed hold you in high respect With this Chen Gong took his leave and sought an interview with Lu BuI hear your daughter is to be married to Yuan Shus sonThat is capital but no one knows when That has yet to be considered There were certain fixed rules as to the period between sending presents and consummation of the marriage emperors a year nobles half a year high officers three months and common people one month Lu Bu replied As to Yuan Shu Heaven has already put into his hands the Imperial Hereditary Seal and he will surely arrive at the dignity one daySo I should think the imperial rule would apply No it will not The nobles rule then No nor that The high officers Not even that Lu Bu laughed saying Then you mean me to go by the rule for common people Nor that either Then what do you mean In the midst of the present troubles when there is great rivalry among the nobles do you not see that the others will be exceedingly jealous of your marriage alliance with such a high family as the YuansSuppose you postpone the choice of the day most likely when your fine morning arrives the wedding party will fall into an ambush on the road and the bride be carried off Then what could be doneMy opinion is that you would have done better to refuseBut since you have consented then carry out the plan at once before the lords hear of it and so send the girl over without delay to ShouchunYou can hire a lodging there till you have selected the wedding day and the odds are greatly against any failure What you say is quite to the point replied Lu Bu He went into the private apartments to see his wife and told her the bride elect would set out immediately and the trousseau was to be prepared as far as it could beOn his side he chose some good horses and had a wedding carriage got ready The escort consisted of Han Yin and two of Lu Bus generals Song Xian and Wei XuThe procession went out of the city to the sound of musicNow at this time Chen Gui father of Chen Deng was placidly waiting till the evening of his life passed into night Hearing this burst of music he inquired the occasion and the servants told himThey are working on the RelativeaboveStranger device then said Chen GuiLiu Bei is in danger Thereupon in spite of his many infirmities he went to see Lu BuNoble Sir what brings you here asked Lu BuI heard you were dead and I came to mourn quavered the old manWho said that exclaimed his hostOnce upon a time you received grand presents from Yuan Shu that you might slay Liu Bei but you got out by that clever shot at your halberdNow they suddenly seek a marriage alliance thinking to get hold of your daughter as a pledge The next move will be an attack on Xiaopei and that gone where are youWhatever they ask in future grain or troops or anything else and you yield will bring your own end nearer and make you hated all roundIf you refuse then you are false to the duties of a relative and that will be an excuse to attack you openlyBeside this Yuan Shu intends to call himself emperor which would be rebellion and you would be of the rebels family something abominable which the multitude people would not suffer Lu Bu was much disturbed to hear this I have been misled cried heSo he hurriedly sent Zhang Liao to bring the wedding party which had been ten miles away back to the cityWhen they had come Lu Bu threw Han Yin into prison and sent a reply to Yuan Shu saying curtly that the girls trousseau was not ready and she could not be married till it wasChen Gui wanted Han Yin to be sent to the capital XuchangBut Lu Bu was hesitating what course to adopt when he heard that Liu Bei was enlisting soldiers and buying horses for no apparent reasonHe is simply doing his duty there is nothing to be surprised at said Lu Bu at firstThen came two officers Song Xian and Wei Xu saying As you ordered us we went into the Huashang Mountains to purchase horsesWe had got three hundred when on our way back on the borders of Xiaopei some robbers stole half of themWe hear that the real robbers were Zhang Fei and his soldiers who took on the guise of brigands Lu Bu was very angry at this and began to prepare an expedition against XiaopeiWhen Liu Bei heard that an attack threatened he led out his army to oppose it and the two armies were arrayedLiu Bei rode to the front and said Elder Brother why have you brought an army against me Lu Bu began abusing him saying That shot of mine at the Archery Feast saved you from grave danger why then did you steal my horses I wanted horses and I sent out to buy them Should I dare to take yours said Liu BeiYou stole a hundred and fifty in the person of your brother Zhang FeiYou only used another mans hand Thereupon Zhang Fei with his spear set rode out saying Yes I stole your good horses and what more do you expect Lu Bu replied You goggledeyed thief You are always treating me with contempt Yes I took your horses and you get angryYou did not say any thing when you stole my brothers Xuzhou Lu Bu rode forward to give battle and Zhang Fei advancedA reckless fight began and the two warriors kept it up for a hundred bouts without a decisive strokeThen Liu Bei fearing some accident to his brother hastily beat the gongs as a signal to retire and led his army into the cityLu Bu then invested it Liu Bei called his brother and chided him as the cause of all this misfortuneWhere are the horses said Liu BeiIn some of the temples and courts replied Zhang FeiLiu Bei sent a messenger out to speak softly and offer to restore the stolen horses if hostilities were to ceaseLu Bu was disposed to agree but Chen Gong opposedYou will suffer by and by if you do not remove this Liu Bei Under Chen Gongs influence the request for peace was rejected and the attackers on the city pressed harder Liu Bei called Mi Zhu and Sun Qian to him to ask adviceSaid Sun Qian The one person that Cao Cao detests is Lu BuLet us then abandon the city and take refuge with Cao Cao from whom we may borrow troops to destroy him If we try to get away who will lead the van I will do my best said Zhang Fei So Zhang Fei led the way Guan Yu was rearguard and in the center was Liu Bei with the nonfighting portionThe cavalcade started and went out at the north gate under the bright moonThey met opposition from Song Xian and Wei Xus men but the soldiers were driven off by Zhang Fei and the besieging force was passed without difficultyZhang Liao pursued but was held off by Guan Yus rearguard It seemed Lu Bu was not dissatisfied at the flight for he took no personal trouble to prevent it He made formal entry into the city settled local affairs and appointed Gao Shun as GovernorLiu Bei approached Xuchang and encamped outside the city whence he sent Sun Qian to see Cao Cao and relate the events that brought him thereCao Cao was very friendly and said Liu Bei is as my brother Then Cao Cao invited Liu Bei to enter the city Leaving his brothers at the camp Liu Bei with Sun Qian and Mi Zhu went to Cao Cao who received him with the greatest respectThe story of Lu Bus perfidy was again related He has no sense of right said Cao CaoYou and I my brother will attack him together Liu Bei was very gratefulA banquet was then prepared and it was late evening before the visitor left for his own campXun Yu then had an interview with his master and said If you are not on your guard Liu Bei will be your undoingYou ought to destroy him He is too much of a hero Cao Cao made no reply and his adviser retiredPresently Guo Jia came and Cao Cao said I have been advised to kill Liu Bei what of such a scheme A bad scheme said Guo JiaYou are the popular champion pledged to relieve the people from oppression and only by truth and rectitude can you secure the support of the nobleminded Your only fear is lest they stay away Now Liu Bei is clearly a heroHe has come to you for help and protection and to put him to death would be to alienate all good people and put fear into the hearts of all the able advisersHampered by these difficulties where will you find those whose help you needTo remove the dangers represented by one man and thereby injure yourself in the eyes of all humankind is a sure means of destructionThese conditions need careful consideration What you say exactly fits in with what I think said Cao Cao greatly pleased with these remarksHis next step was to memorialize the Emperor to give Liu Bei the imperial protectorship of YuzhouAgain Cheng Yu said Liu Bei is certain to rise to the top he will never remain in a subordinate position You would better remove him Cao Cao answered Now is just the time to make use of good peopleI will not forfeit the regard of the world for the sake of removing one individualGuo Jia and I both see this in the same light Wherefore Cao Cao rejected all persuasion to work against Liu Bei but sent him three thousand soldiers and ten thousand carts of grain and set him on his way to YuzhouLiu Bei was to march to Xiaopei occupy it call together his former soldiers and attack Lu BuWhen Liu Bei reached Yuzhou he sent to inform Cao Cao who prepared to march an army to subjugate Lu Bu But just then hasty news came that Zhang Ji who had gone to the attack of Nanyang had been wounded by a stray arrow and had diedHis nephew Zhang Xiu had succeeded to the command of his army and with Jia Xu as strategist Zhang Xiu had joined Liu Biao and camped at Wancheng They intended to attack the capital and get possession of the Emperors personCao Cao was placed in a quandary He would go to attack this combination but he feared lest Lu Bu would attack the capital if he left it So he sought the advice of Xun YuSaid the Adviser Lu Bu has no notion of a policyHe is led astray by any little advantage that presents itself to his eyes All you need do is to obtain promotion for him giving him some additional title and tell him to make peace with Liu Bei and he will do it The south is no threat then Good said Cao CaoAnd he acted upon the hint and sent an Imperial Legate Wang Ze to Xuzhou with the official announcement and a letter urging peace while he went on with preparations to meet the other danger from Zhang XiuWhen ready Cao Cao marched out with one hundred fifty thousand troops in three divisionsXiahou Dun was the Van Leader and they went to River Yu and camped there Jia Xu succeeded in persuading Zhang Xiu of the hopelessness of resistanceYou would do well to surrender since Cao Caos army is too large for you to oppose said Jia XuSeeing the truth of this Zhang Xiu sent his adviser to propose sub missionCao Cao was greatly pleased with the messenger admiring his ready and fluent repartee and tried to win him to his serviceI was formerly with Li Jue and was guilty with himNow I am with Zhang Xiu who esteems my advice and I should not like to abandon him said Jia XuJia Xu left and next day conducted his master into Cao Caos presence Cao Cao was very generousThen he entered Wancheng with a small force the greater part of the army being put in camp outside where the lines extended some three milesGreat banquets were given every day by Zhang Xiu and Cao Cao was always being entertainedOne day when Cao Cao returned to his quarters in a more than usual merry mood he asked the attendants if there were any singing girls in the cityHis nephew Cao Amin heard the question and said Peeping through one of the partitions last evening I saw a perfectly beautiful woman in one of the courts They told me she was the wife of Zhang Ji Zhang Xius uncle She is very lovely Cao Cao inflamed by the description given him of the beauty told his nephew to go and bring her to visit him Cao Amin did so supported by an armed escort and very soon the woman stood before Cao CaoShe was a beauty indeed and Cao Cao asked her nameShe replied Thy handmaid was wife to Zhang Ji I was born of the Zhou family Do you know who I am I have known the Prime Minister by reputation a long timeI am happy to see him and be permitted to bow before him said she It was for your sake that I allowed Zhang Xiu to submit otherwise I would have slain him and cut him off root and branch said Cao CaoIndeed then I owe my very life to you I am very grateful said sheTo see you is a glimpse of paradise but there is one thing I should like betterStay here and go with me to the capital where I will see that you are properly cared forWhat do you say to that my lady She could but thank him But Zhang Xiu will greatly wonder at my prolonged absence and gossips will begin to talk said sheIf you like you can leave the city tomorrow She did so but instead of going at once to the capital she stayed with him among the tents where Dian Wei was appointed as a special guard over her apartmentsCao Cao was the only person whom she saw and he passed the days in idle dalliance with the lady quite content to let time flow by But people told Zhang Xiu what had gone amiss and he was angry at the shame brought upon the familyHe confided his trouble to Jia Xu who said Keep this secret wait till he appears again to carry on business and then do so and so A plan was arranged quite secretlyNext day Zhang Xiu went into Cao Caos tent saying Since the surrendered troops are deserting in great number it would be well to camp them in the center of your camp to prevent this Cao Cao gave the permission and Zhang Xiu moved and placed his army in four campsBut Dian Wei the especial guard of Cao Caos tent was a man to be feared being both brave and powerful It was hard to know how to attack him So counsel was taken with Hu Juer the commander of one camp and a man of enormous strength and activityHe could carry a burden of six hundred pounds and two hundred miles in a day Hu Juer proposed a planHe said The fearsome thing about Dian Wei is his double halberdsBut get him to come to a party and make him quite drunk before you send him backI will mingle among his escort and so get into his tent and steal away his weaponsOne need not fear him then So the necessary arms were prepared and orders given in the various campsThis done Zhang Xiu gave a banquet and the intended victim was invited and plied vigorously with wine so that he was quite intoxicated when he left And as arranged Hu Juer mingled with his escort and made away with his weaponsThat night when Cao Cao was at supper with Lady Zhou he heard the voices of men and neighing of horses and sent out to ask what it meantThey told him it was the night patrol going the rounds and he was satisfiedNear the second watch of the night again was heard some noise in the rear of his tent and one of the fodder carts was reported to be burningOne of the soldiers has dropped a spark there is nothing to be alarmed at said Cao CaoBut very soon the fire spread on all sides and became alarming Cao Cao called Dian WeiBut he usually so alert was lying down quite intoxicatedHowever the beating of gongs and rolling of drums mingling with his dreams awoke Dian Wei and he jumped up His trusty halberds had disappearedThe enemy was near He hastily snatched up an infantrymans sword and rushed outAt the gate he saw a crowd of spearmen just bursting inDian Wei rushed at them slashing all around him and twenty or more fell beneath his blows The others drew backBut the spears stood around him like reeds on the river bank Being totally without mail he was soon wounded in several placesHe fought desperately till his sword snapped and was no longer of any use Throwing it aside he seized a couple of soldiers and with their bodies as weapons felled ten of his opponents The others dared not approach but they shot arrows at himThese fell thick as rain but he still maintained the gate against the assailantsHowever the mutineers got in by the rear of the camp and they wounded Dian Wei in the back with spear thrusts Uttering a loud cry he fell The blood gushed from the wound in torrents and he diedEven after he was dead not a man dared to come in by the main gateCao Cao relying on Dian Wei to hold the main gate had fled in haste by the rear gate Cao Amin accompanied him on footThen Cao Cao was wounded by an arrow in the arm and three arrows struck his horseHowever fortunately the horse was a fine Dawan beast full of spirit and in spite of its wounds it bore its master swiftly and well as far as the bank of River YuHere some of the pursuers came up and Cao Amin was hacked to piecesCao Cao dashed into the river and reached the further side but there an arrow struck his steed in the eye and it fellCao Caos eldest son Cao Ang dismounted and yielded his horse to his father who galloped onCao Ang was killed by arrows but Cao Cao himself got awaySoon after he met several of his officers who had rallied a few troopsThe soldiers of Qingzhou under Xiahou Dun seized the occasion to plunder the peopleYu Jin took his army fell upon them and slew many Thus he protected and appeased the people The plunderers meeting Cao Cao on the road knelt down howling and said Yu Jin had mutinied and attacked them Cao Cao was surprised and he gave order to Xiahou Dun Xu Chu Li Dian and Yue Jin to attack Yu JinNow when Yu Jin saw his master and a great company approaching he at once stopped the attack and set his troops to make a campAn officer asked him The Qingzhou soldiers say you have turned traitor why do you not explain now that the Prime Minister has arrived Why first make a camp Yu Jin replied Our enemies are coming up in our rear and are very close It is necessary to prepare for defense or we shall not withstand themExplanation is a small matter but defense is very important Soon after the camp was finished Zhang Xiu fell upon them Yu Jin himself rode out to face them Zhang Xiu drew backThe other generals of Yu Jin seeing he advance thus boldly also attacked and Zhang Xiu was overcomeThey pursued him a great distance until his force was almost annihilatedWith the miserable remnant he finally fled to Liu Biao Cao Caos army reformed and the commanders musteredThen Yu Jin went to see his master and told him of the conduct of the Qingzhou soldiers and their looting and why he had attacked themWhy did you not tell me before you made the camp Yu Jin related what had occurredSaid Cao Cao When the first thought of a leader in the time of greatest stress is to maintain order and to strengthen his defenses giving no thought to slander but shouldering his burdens bravely and when he thereby turns a defeat into a victory who even of the ancient leaders can excel Yu Jin Cao Cao rewarded Yu Jin with a golden armor and the lordship of YishouBut Cao Cao reprimanded Xiahou Dun for the lack of discipline among his soldiers Sacrifices in honor of the dead warrior Dian Wei were instituted Cao Cao himself led the wailing and paid due honorsTurning to his officers he said I have lost my first born son but I grieve not so heavily for him as for Dian Wei I weep for him All were sad at the loss of this generalThen orders were issued to return to the capital When Imperial Legate Wang Ze bearing the imperial decree reached Xuzhou he was met by Lu Bu who conducted him into the residence where the decree was read It conferred Lu Bu the title General Who Pacifies the East and a special seal accompanied the mandateThe private mediating letter was also handed over and the messenger detailed the high appreciation in which Lu Bu was held by the Chief Minister of StateLu Bu was greatly pleasedNext came news that a messenger from Yuan Shu had arrivedWhen he had been introduced he said My masters project of declaring himself emperor is advancing He has already built a palace and will speedily choose Empress and concubines and would come to the South of River HuaiHe is looking forward to receiving the fiancee of the Heir Apparent Has the rebel gone so far cried Lu Bu in a rageHe put the messenger to death and Han Yin into the cage He drafted a memorial of thanks and sent it to the capital at the same time sending too Han Yin the unfortunate agent who had arranged the marriage allianceHe also replied to Cao Caos private meditating letter asking to be confirmed in his protectorship of Xuzhou The letter was sent by the hand of Chen DengCao Cao was pleased to hear of the rupture of the marriage arrangement between the houses of Yuans and Lus and forthwith put Han Yin to death in the market placeHowever Chen Deng secretly told Cao Cao saying Lu Bu is cruel stupid and facileThe longer he remains the worse I know Lu Bu quite well replied Cao Cao He is a wolf with a savage heart and it will be hard to feed him for longIf it had not been for you and your father I should not have known all the circumstances and you must help me to get rid of him Anything the Prime Minister wishes to do shall have my assistance was the replyAs a reward Cao Cao obtained an annually grant of two thousand carts of grain for Chen Gui and the governorship of Guangling for Chen Deng who then took his leaveAs he was saying farewell Cao Cao took him by the hand saying I shall depend upon you in the eastern affairs Chen Deng nodded acquiescenceThen he returned to Lu Bu who asked him how the visit wasChen Deng told him My father received a generous annuity and I was made Governor of Guangling Lu Bu enraged saying You did not ask Xuzhou for me but you got something for yourselfYour father advised me to help Cao Cao by breaking off the marriage and now I get nothing at all of what I asked while you and your father get everythingI have been victimized by your father He threatened Chen Deng with his swordChen Deng only laughed saying O General how unwary you are I unwary When I saw Cao Cao I said that to keep you going was like feeding a tiger The tiger must be kept fully fed or he would eat humansBut Cao Cao laughed and replied No not that One must treat the Commander like a falconNot feed it till the foxes and hares are done Hungry the bird is of use full fed it flies away I asked who were the quarryHe replied Yuan Shu of the South of River Huai Sun Ce of the South Land Yuan Shao of Jizhou Liu Biao of Jingzhou Liu Zhang of Yiazhou and Zhang Lu of Hanzhong these are the foxes and hares Lu Bu threw aside his sword and laughed saying Yes he understands me But just about that time came news of the advance of Yuan Shu on Xuzhou and that frightened Lu BuWhen discord rose between Qin and Jin They were attacked by Yue and Wu And when a promised bride never came An army marched against army to enforce the claimHow all this fell out will be shown in the next chapter CHAPTER Yuan Shu Marches Out An Army Of Seven Divisions Cao Cao And Three Generals Join Forces The south of River Huai was very fruitful and Yuan Shu as governor of such a large territory was very influential He was not a little puffed up The possession of the Imperial Hereditary Seal pledged by Sun Ce added to his pride And he seriously thought of assuming the full style As a preliminary he assembled all his officers and addressed them thusThe Supreme Ancestor the Founder of Han Dynasty was only a very minor official and yet he became ruler of the empireThe dynasty has endured four centuries and its measure of fortune has run out It no longer possesses authority the cauldron is on the point of boiling overMy family has held the highest offices of state for four generations and is universally respectedWherefore I wish in response to the will of Heaven and the desire of the people to assume the Imperial DignityWhat think ye of the proposal my officers Secretary Yan Xiang rose in opposition at once saying You may not do thisPrince Wen the Ancestor of the Zhou was of distinguished virtue and held many offices till the last years of Shang Dynasty he had two thirds of the empire Still he served and was loyal to the ruling houseYour house is honorable but it is not so glorious as that of ZhouThe Hans may be reduced but they are not so abominably cruel as those of the Shang Dynasty that they are to be overthrownIndeed this should not be done Yuan Shu did not hear this with pleasureSaid he We Yuans came from the Chen family the same ancestry with King ShunBy the rule of interpreting the signs of fate the day has come when earth Beside there is an oracle saying One who replaces the Hans must wade through deep mire My name means the high road It fits exactlyFurther than this I possess the Imperial Hereditary Seal and must become lord of all or I turn from Heavens own wayFinally I have made up my mind so if any one says too much that person will simply suffer death Yuan Shu arrogated himself the insignia of royalty and assigned Second Glory the reign titleHe set up officials with titles only given by an emperor and rode in a chariot decorated with the dragon and phoenix and offered sacrifices after the manner of an emperor in the north and south suburbs Also he appointed the daughter of Feng Fang his Empress and his son Heir Apparent and he pressed for the early wedding of Lu Bus daughter with his son so that the palace entourage might be completeBut when Yuan Shu heard of the fate of his marriage ambassador Han Yin who was sent to the capital and was executed Yuan Shu was very angry and began at once to plan for revengeHe made Zhang Xun his Grand Commander and gave Zhang Xun the command of more than two hundred thousand soldiers with the instruction to invade Xuzhou The army consisted of seven divisions under seven commanders Zhang Xun led the Center Army Qiao Rui the First Left Army Lei Bo the Second Left Army Han Xian the Third Left Army Chen Ji First Right Army Chen Lan Second Right Army and Yang Feng the Third Right ArmyEach commander was instructed to make a certain town his objectiveThe Imperial Protector of Yangzhou Jin Shang was ordered to superintend the commissariat but he declined the office And so Yuan Shu put Jin Shang to deathJi Ling was in command of the reserves to help wherever he was requiredYuan Shu led thirty thousand troops and he appointed three generals Li Feng Liang Gang and Yue Jiu to go up and down and coordinate the grand marchLu Bu found out from his scouts that his own Xuzhou City was the objective of Zhang Xun the other towns to be first attacked being Xiaopei Yidu Langye Jieshi Xiapi and Junshan The invading armies were marching twenty miles a day and plundering the countryside as they advancedLu Bu summoned his advisers to a council to which came Chen Gong Chen Deng and Chen GuiWhen all had assembled Chen Gong said This misfortune that has come to us is due to the two Chens who fawned upon the central government in order to obtain rank and appointments Now remove the evil by putting these two to death and sending their heads to Yuan Shu Then he will retire and leave us in peace Lu Bu acquiesced and had the two arrestedBut the son Chen Deng only laughed saying What is this anxiety aboutThese seven armies are no more to me than so many heaps of rotting strawThey are not worth thinking about If you can show us how to overcome them I will spare your life said Lu BuGeneral if you will listen to poor me the region will be perfectly safe Let us hear what you have to say Yuan Shus troops are numerous but they are only a flock of crows they are not an army under a leader There is no mutual confidenceI can keep them at bay with the ordinary guards of the place and could overcome them by some unsuspected stratagemIf I should fail I have another plan by which I can not only protect the region but capture our enemy Let us have it Chen Deng said Han Xian and Yang Feng two of the leaders of our enemies are old servants of the Han Dynasty who fled from fear of Cao Cao and being homeless sought refuge with Yuan ShuHe despises them and they are dissatisfied with his serviceA little letter from the court will secure their help as our allies and with Liu Bei to help us on the outside we can certainly overcome Yuan Shu You shall take the letters yourself said Lu BuChen Deng agreed and a memorial detailing his intentions was sent to the capital letters to Yuzhou to Liu Bei and finally Chen Deng was sent with a small escort to wait for Han Xian on the road to Xiapi When Han Xians army had halted and pitched camp Chen Deng went to see Han Xian who said What are you here forYou belong to Lu Bu I am a noble of the court of the great Hans Why do you call me a Lu Bus manIf you General hitherto a minister of state now serve a traitor you will nullify the grand services you rendered in protecting the Emperor in the flight from ChanganBeside the suspicious Yuan Shu will assuredly do you some harm and you will regret not having taken this opportunity to work against him Han Xian sighed saying I would return to my allegiance if there should be any opportunity Thereupon Chen Deng gave him Lu Bus letter asking for cooperationHan Xian read it and said Yes I knowYou may return to your master and say General Yang Feng and I will turn our weapons and smite Yuan ShuLook out for a signal flare and let your master come to our aid As soon as Chen Deng had got back and reported his success Lu Bu divided his troops into five divisions each of ten thousand and sent them to five threatened towns to meet his enemiesGao Shun led one army to Xiaopei against Qiao Rui Chen Gong to Yidu against Chen Ji Zhang Liao and Zang Ba to Langye against Lei Bo Song Xian and Wei Xu to Jieshi against Chen LanLu Bu himself led against the main body under Zhang Xun leaving a small guard in Xuzhou CityLu Bu camped ten miles from the wallsWhen the enemy came up Zhang Xun thought Lu Bu too strong to attack with the force he had so he retired seven miles to await reinforcementsThat night in the second watch Han Xian and Yang Feng arrived and soon the flare was lighted as arranged Lu Bus troops were admitted to the camp and caused great confusionThen Lu Bu gave a full attack and Zhang Xun was routed and fledLu Bu pursued till daylight when he fell in with one of the other bodies led by Ji LingBoth sides faced each other but at the very beginning of the engagement Yang Feng and Han Xian also attacked and Ji Ling was forced to flyLu Bu went in pursuit but soon another force came out from the rear of some hills These looked very imposing As the ranks opened Lu Bu saw a leaders guard with flags bearing dragons and phoenixes and representations of the sun and moon the stars in the four groups of the Great Bear Constellation the five directions of the Earth golden gourds silver axes yellow halberds white yaks tails all imperial emblems And beneath a yellow silken parasol sat Yuan Shu on horseback clad in silver mail with a sword handle showing at each wristStanding out in front of the array Yuan Shu railed at his opponent calling him traitor and bastardLu Bu said nothing but rode forward ready for battle and Li Feng one of Yuan Shus leaders advanced to take the challengeThey met but at the third bout Li Feng was wounded in the hand whereupon his spear fell to the ground and he fledLu Bu waved on the advance and his men prevailedThe other side fled leaving much spoil clothing mail and horsesYuan Shus defeated troops had not gone far when a strong army led by Guan Yu appeared barring his way TraitorWhy have they not slain you cried Guan YuWhereat Yuan Shu fled in great trepidation and his army melted into fugitives in all directions The new army fell upon them with great slaughterYuan Shu and the remnant of his army retreated into the below regions of River HuaiVictory being now secure Lu Bu in company with Guan Yu Yang Feng and Han Xian returned to Xuzhou where there were banquets and feasting and rewards for the soldiers and generals of five divisionsThese over Guan Yu took his leave and returned to Yuzhou while Han Xian was appointed Governor of Yidu and Yang Feng Governor of LangyeThere had been a question of keeping these two in Xuzhou City but Chen Gui opposed it saying Let them hold those places in Huashang Mountains which will be all yours within a year So Han Xian and Yang Feng were sent to these two cities in the meantime to await ordersWhy not retain them here asked Chen Deng secretly of his fatherThey would be a basis for our conspiracy against Lu Bu But if they helped him on the other hand we should lengthen the tigers claws and teeth said Chen GuiSo Chen Deng could only approve of his fathers precautionsYuan Shu returned home burning to avenge his defeat so he sent to the South Land to ask a loan of troops from Sun CeBut Sun Ce said On the strength of holding the State Seal he secretly calls himself emperor and rebels against the HansI would rather punish such a renegade than help him So Sun Ce refusedThe letter refusing help added to Yuan Shus angerWhat next from this callow youth cried Yuan ShuI will smite him before I deal with the others But his adviser Yang Dajiang dissuaded him from this courseHaving refused help to his powerful rival Sun Ce thought it wise to take measures for his own safety So he stationed an army at JiangkouSoon after came a messenger from Cao Cao bearing Sun Ces appointment as Governor of Kuaiji with orders to raise an army and reduce Yuan Shu Sun Ce was inclined to carry out these orders but he called a council at which Zhang Zhao opposed this courseSaid he Although recently defeated Yuan Shu has large army and ample suppliesHe is not to be attacked lightly You would better write to Cao Cao persuading him to attack the South of River Huai and we will be auxiliaries Between the two armies Yuan Shu must certainly be defeatedIf by the remotest chance we lose we have Cao Cao to come to our rescue This plan was adopted and a messenger was sent to lay it before Cao CaoIn the meantime after the defeat at River Yu Cao Cao had reached Xuchang where his first thought was to institute sacrifices to his beloved lost leader Dian WeiHe conferred rank upon his son Dian Man and took him into his own palace to be cared forPresently arrived Sun Ces messenger with letters and next came a report that Yuan Shu being short of food had made a raid on ChenliuCao Cao thought the moment opportune so he issued orders for the south expedition leaving Cao Ren to hold the capitalThe army marched horse and foot one hundred seventy thousand with commissariat wagons of food to the number of over a thousandMessages were sent to summon Sun Ce Liu Bei and Lu BuLiu Bei was the first to welcome the grand army at his Yuzhou borders and he was called in to the Prime Ministers tentAfter the usual salutations two human heads were produced by Liu BeiWhose are these asked Cao Cao in surpriseThe heads of Han Xian and Yang Feng Why did this happen They were sent to control Yidu and Langye but they allowed their soldiers to plunder the peopleBitter complaints arose so I invited them to a banquet and my brothers dispatched them when I gave the signal by dropping a cup Their armies gave in at onceNow I have to apologize for my fault You have removed an evil which is a grand service why talk of a fault And Cao Cao praised Liu Beis actionWhen the joint army reached Lu Bus Xuzhou borders he came to meet itCao Cao spoke graciously to him and conferred upon him the title of General of the Left Army promising him an official seal as soon as he returned to the capitalLu Bu was very pleasedThen the three armies were made into one force Cao Cao being in the center Lu Bu to the left wing and Liu Bei to the right wingXiahou Dun and Yu Jin were Leaders of the Van On Yuan Shus side General Qiao Rui with fifty thousand troops was appointed Van LeaderThe armies met on the confines of the city of ShouchunQiao Rui and Xiahou Dun rode out and opened battleBut Qiao Rui fell in the third bout and his troops fled into the cityThen came news that Sun Ces fleet was near and would attack on the west The other three land corps took each one faceCao Cao on the north Lu Bu on the east and Liu Bei on the south The city of Shouchun was in a parlous state At this juncture Yuan Shu summoned his officersYang Dajiang explained the case Shouchun has suffered from drought for several years and the people are on the verge of famineSending an army would add to the distress and anger the people and victory would be uncertainI advise not to send any more soldiers there but to hold on till the besiegers are conquered by lack of suppliesMeanwhile Your Highness with regiment of guards will move over to the other side of River Huai which is quite ready and we shall also escape the enemys ferocity So due arrangements was madeOne hundred thousand troops under Li Feng Yue Jiu Liang Gang and Chen Ji were appointed to guard Shouchun Then a general move was made to the other side of the River HuaiNot only the remained army went over but all the accumulated wealth of the Yuan family gold and silver jewels and precious stones were moved alsoCao Caos army of one hundred seventy thousand needed daily no inconsiderable quantity of food and as the country around had been faminestricken for several years nothing could be got there So he tried to hasten the military operations and capture the cityOn the other hand the defenders knew the value of delay and simply held onAfter a months vigorous siege the fall of Shouchun seemed as far off as it was at first and supplies were very short Letters were sent to Sun Ce who sent a hundred thousand carts of grainWhen the usual distribution became impossible the Chief of the Commissariat Ren Jun and the Controller of the Granaries Wang Hou presented a statement asking what was to be doneServe out with a smaller measure said Cao CaoThat will save us for a time But if the soldiers murmur what then I shall have another device As ordered the controller issued grain in a short measureCao Cao sent secretly to find out how the army took this and when he found that complaints were general and the soldiers were saying that the Prime Minister was fooling them he sent a secret summons to the controllerWhen Wang Hou came Cao Cao said I want to ask you to lend me something to pacify the soldiers withYou must not refuse What does the Prime Minister wish I want the loan of your head to expose to the soldiery But I have done nothing wrong exclaimed the unhappy manI know that but if I do not put you to death there will be a mutinyAfter you are gone your wife and children shall be my care So you need not grieve on their account Wang Hou was about to remonstrate further but Cao Cao gave a signalThe executioners hustled Wang Hou out and he was beheaded His head was exposed on a tall pole and a notice said In accordance with military law Wang Hou had been put to death for peculation and the use of a short measure in issuing grain This appeased the discontentNext followed a general order threatening death to all commanders if the city was not taken within three daysCao Cao in person went up to the very walls to superintend the work of filling up the moat The defenders kept up constant showers of stones and arrowsTwo inferior officers who left their stations in fear were slain by Cao Cao himselfThereafter he went on foot to work with his soldiers and to see that work went on continuously and no one dared be a laggardThus encouraged the army became invincible and no defense could withstand their onslaught In a very short time the walls were scaled the gates battered in and the besiegers were in possessionThe officers of the garrisonLi Feng Yue Jiu Liang Gang and Chen Jiwere captured alive and were executed in the market placeAll the paraphernalia of imperial state were burned and the whole city wreckedWhen the question of crossing the river in pursuit of Yuan Shu came up Xun Yu opposed it saying The country has suffered from short crops for years and we should be unable to get grain An advance would weary the army harm the people and possibly end in disasterI advise a return to the capital to wait there till the spring wheat shall have been harvested and we have plenty of food Cao Cao hesitated and before he had made up his mind there came an urgent message Zhang Xiu with the support of Liu Biao was ravaging the country all roundThere were rebellions in Nanyang and Jiangling and Cao Hong could not cope with itCao Hong had been worsted already in several engagements and was in sore straits Cao Cao at once wrote to Sun Ce to command the Great River so as to prevent any move on the part of Liu Biao while he prepared his army to go to deal with Zhang XiuBefore marching Cao Cao directed Liu Bei to station at Xiaopei as he and Lu Bu being as brothers might help each otherWhen Lu Bu had left for Xuzhou Cao Cao said secretly to Liu Bei I am leaving you at Xiaopei to dig a pitfall for the tiger You will only take advice from Chen Deng and Chen Gui and there can be no mishapYou will find so andso your ally when needed So Cao Cao marched to Xuchang where he heard that Duan Wei had slain Li Jue and Wu Xi killed Guo Si and they presented the heads of these twoBeside the whole clan of Li Jue more than two hundred had been arrested and brought to the capitalThey were all put to death at various gates and their heads exposed as warning The people cheered the end of those two rebelsIn the Emperors palace a large number of officials were assembled at a peace banquetThe Emperor rewarded the two successful leaders Duan Wei with the title of General Who Destroys Rebellion and Wu Xi General Who Wrecks Villainy and sent to guard ChanganThey came to audience to express their gratitude and marched awayThen Cao Cao sent in a memorial that Zhang Xiu was in rebellion and an army must be sent against himThe Emperor in person arranged the chariot and escorted Cao Cao out of the city when he went to take command of the expeditionIt was the summer the fourth month of the third year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  Xun Yu was in chief military command in Xuchang The army marched awayIn the course of the march they passed through a wheat region and the grain was ready for harvesting but the peasants had fled for fear and the corn was uncut Cao Cao sent proclamations to all villages and townsI am sent on the expedition by command of the Emperor to capture a rebel and save the peopleI cannot avoid moving in the harvest season but if any one trample down the corn he shall be put to deathMilitary law is strict without exception and the people need fear no damage The people were very pleased and lined the road wishing success to the expeditionWhen the soldiers passed wheat fields they dismounted and pushed aside the stalks so that none were trampled downOne day when Cao Cao was riding through the fields a dove suddenly got up startling the horse so that it swerved into the standing grain and a large patch was trampled downCao Cao at once called the Provost Marshal and bade him decree the sentence for the crime of trampling down cornHow can I deal with your crime asked the Provost Marshal I made the rule and I have broken itCan I otherwise satisfy public opinion Cao Cao laid hold of the sword by his side and made to take his own lifeAll hastened to prevent him and Guo Jia said In ancient days the days of the Spring and Autumn history the laws were not applied to the persons of the most importantYou are the supreme leader of a mighty army and must not wound yourself Cao Cao pondered for a long timeAt last he said Since there exists the reason just quoted I may perhaps escape the death penalty Then with his sword he cut off his hair and threw it on the ground saying I cut off the hair as touching the head Then he sent messengers to exhibit the hair throughout the whole army saying The Prime Minister having trodden down some corn ought to have lost his head by the terms of the order now here is his hair cut off as an attack on the head This deed was a stimulus to discipline all through the army so that not a person dared be disobedient A poet wrote A myriad soldiers march along and all are brave and bold And their myriad inclinations by one leader are controlledThat crafty leader shore his locks when forfeit was his head O full of guile were thou Cao Cao as every one has saidOn the first news of the approach of Cao Cao with an army Zhang Xiu wrote to Liu Biao for helpThen Zhang Xiu led out his troops with his two generals Lei Xu and Zhang Xian When the array was complete Zhang Xiu took his station in front and pointing at Cao Cao railed at him saying O false and pretended supporter of benevolence and justice O shameless oneYou are just a beast of the forest and absolutely devoid of humanity This annoyed Cao Cao who sent out Xu Chu against the insulterZhang Xian came to meet him and fell in the third boutThence Zhang Xius troops fled and were pursued to the very walls of Nanyang only managing to get within just before the pursuit came upThe city was then closely besieged Seeing the moat was so wide and deep that approach to the wall would be difficult Cao Caos commanders began to fill up the ditch with earthThen with sand bags brushwood and bundles of grass they built a great mound near the wall and on this erected steps so that they could look over into the cityCao Cao rode round the city closely inspecting the defensesThree days later he issued an order to make a mound of earth and brushwood at the northwest corner as he would mount the walls at that pointHe was observed from within the city by Jia Xu who went to Zhang Xiu and said I know what Cao Cao intends and I can defeat him by a countermove Even amongst the very foremost There is one who leads the way Some one sees through your devices Be as crafty as ye mayWhat the countermove was will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER  Giving Counsels Jia Xu Directs A Great Victory Braving Battlefield Xiahou Dun Loses An Eye Jia Xu as he had guessed the enemys intention had also devised a countermove So he went to his chief and said I saw Cao Cao very carefully reconnoitering round about the cityHe certainly noticed that the southeast corner of the wall had been lately restored with mud bricks of a different kind and that the fencing barrier is badly out of repair He will try to effect an entrance there Wherefore he is making a feint attack at the opposite point He is piling up straw and making ostentatious preparations whereby to cajole us into withdrawing from the real point of attack to defend the northwest His troops will scale the walls in the darkness and try to enter at the southeast Supposing your surmise correct what do you advise asked Zhang XiuThe countermove is plainYou issue an order for our best and bravest soldiers to fill their bellies to take only the lightest outfit and conceal themselves in the houses near the southeast cornerThen disguise the townspeople as soldiers and send them to pretend to defend the northwestTonight we will let the enemy climb up the walls and enter the city and once they are fairly within give the signal and the concealed soldiers will rush out upon themWe may even capture Cao Cao himself The stratagem was decided uponSoon the scouts told Cao Cao The defenders of the city have moved to the northwest where noisy preparations for defense are going on The opposite corner is left undefended They have fallen into my trap said Cao Cao gleefullyHe ordered his troops to prepare shovels and hooks and all the gear needed for scaling walls and all day they kept up the attack on the northwest angleBut at the second watch they dispatched the veterans to the opposite corner where they climbed the wall broke up the fencing barrier and got into the city apparently without disturbing any of the guards There was no sign of life anywhere as they enteredBut just as they were leaving the wall suddenly a bomb exploded and they found themselves in an ambushThey turned to retire but Zhang Xiu immediately fell on the rear and began a slaughterCao Caos troops were totally defeated and fled out of the gate into the countryZhang Xiu kept up the pursuit till daybreak when he retired into the city againCao Cao then rallied his army and mustered his soldiers He had lost fifty thousand and much baggage while two of his generals Lu Qian and Yu Jin were woundedCao Cao being thus worsted Jia Xu advised Zhang Xiu to write off to Liu Biao to cut off Cao Caos retreat so that he might be utterly destroyedLiu Biao was preparing an army for this purpose when a scout came to say that Sun Ce had encamped in the river at HukouKuai Liang said This move of Sun Ce in the river is part of Cao Caos strategy and there will be neverending regret if Cao Cao is allowed to escapeAn immediate expedition is necessary Wherefore Liu Biao moved out with his army to Anzhong to block Cao Cao leaving Huang Zu to hold Jingzhous points of vantageZhang Xiu having been informed of the movement of Liu Biao went with Jia Xu to smite Cao Cao on the rearIn the meantime Cao Caos army marching very leisurely had arrived at XiangyangWalking one day beside River Yu he suddenly uttered a great cry and when his officers asked the reason thereof he replied I remembered that here only a year ago I lost my great general Dian WeiIs that not a reason to grieve Thereupon Cao Cao gave orders to halt while he should make a great sacrifice and mourn for his lost leaderAt the ceremony he himself burned incense and wailed and prostrated himself The army was much affected by his devotionAfter the sacrifices to the lost hero he sacrificed to the names of his nephew Cao Amin and his eldest son Cao Ang both of whom had died at the same timeHe also sacrificed to his lost soldiers and even to his Dawan steed which had been killed by an arrowNext day Xun Yu wrote to tell Cao Cao that Liu Biao had gone to help Zhang Xiu and was camped at Anzhong thereby cutting his road of retreatCao Cao replied to the letter saying I have been marching only a short distance each day and of course knew of the pursuitBut my plans are laid and as I am near Anzhong my enemy will be brokenYou need not have any fears Then Cao Cao hastened his march till he came near where Liu Biao had taken position Zhang Xiu still shortened the distanceCao Cao ordered his men during the night to open a secret way through a pass where he laid an ambush With the first light of dawn Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu met As Cao Caos force looked small they thought he had retired so they boldly advanced into the pass to smite him Then the ambush was opened and both the attackers forces were cut upThe fighting ended Cao Caos soldiers went outside the pass and encamped The two leaders on the other side restored order among their beaten troops and then held a conferenceHow could we have foreseen such a wicked ruse said Liu BiaoLet us try again said Zhang XiuWherefore they joined forces at AnzhongBut Xun Yu discovered through his spies that Yuan Shao was preparing an attack on Capital Xuchang so he at once wrote to Cao Cao who much disturbed by this news set out homeward right awayWhen Zhang Xiu heard this through his scouts he wished to follow the retreating armyJia Xu opposed it and said It will lead to a defeat However Liu Biao said It is wrong to lose such a chance And so finally pursuit was decided uponThey had not marched more than four miles before they came upon Cao Caos rearguard who fought with great vigor and bravery so that the pursuers were beaten off and went home discomfitedZhang Xiu said to Jia Xu This defeat comes from my not following your advice Now set your army in order and pursue said Jia XuBut we have just suffered defeat cried both leaders Do you now counsel pursuit Yes and the result will be a great victory if you go nowI will venture my head on that said Jia XuZhang Xiu had confidence but Liu Biao was afraid and would not accompany himSo one army only started in pursuit However this was enoughCao Caos rearguard was thoroughly routed and abandoned their wagons and their baggage in their hasty flightZhang Xiu pursued but suddenly a troop came out from the shelter of some hills and checked himFearful to try further he hastened back to AnzhongThe other general Liu Biao asked the adviser to explain his apparent inconsistency saying When our veteran and brave soldiers were going to pursue those who retreated you said our men would lose the day and when defeated men pursued the victors you foretold victoryYou were right in both cases but we wish you would enlighten us It is easy to explainYou Generals although skilled leaders are not a match for our enemyThough Cao Cao had lost a battle he had able generals to keep the rear and guard against pursuitOur soldiers are good but not a match for them That is how I knewFor as much as Cao Caos hurried retreat was due to trouble in the capital and he had beaten off our attack I knew he would retire at his utmost speed and not take his usual precautionsI ventured to take advantage of his laxity Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu could not but affirm his complete understanding of the conditionsOn the advice of Jia Xu then Liu Biao returned to Jingzhou while Zhang Xiu took up his position at Xiangyang so that each strengthened the other as the lips protect the teeth from coldWhen Cao Cao during his retreat heard that his army was being pursued he hastily turned back to support the rearguard Then he saw the pursuing army draw offThe soldiers of the beaten rearguard said Had it not been for the troops that came out of the hills we should all have been lost What troops asked Cao Cao in surprise The leader of the troops then advanced slung his spear and dismounting made a low obeisanceHe was Li Tong Imperial Commander from JiangxiaCao Cao asked him why he had comeLi Tong replied I was in command at Runan when I heard of the struggle going on so I came to lend you any help I could To show his gratitude Cao Cao conferred upon Li Tong the title Lord Who Renders High Services and confirmed him in his command as the defense of Runan against Liu Biao and Zhang XiuThen Li Tong expressed his thanks and took his leaveOn his return to the capital Cao Cao presented a memorial on the good services rendered by Sun Ce and the Emperor made him Lord of Wu  with the title General Who Destroys Rebels The messenger bearing the decree bore also the order to repress Liu BiaoCao Cao went to his palace and there received the ceremonial calls of congratulation These finished Xun Yu asked saying You Sir marched very leisurely to Anzhong how came it that you felt certain of victory Cao Cao replied My soldiers who retire and find their retreat cut off fight vigorously and desperatelyI retired slowly to entice the enemy into following whereby I could do as I wished with them Basing my movements on these considerations I felt secure Xun Yu bowed his head in admirationWhen Guo Jia entered Cao Cao said Why so late Sir The visitor drew a letter from his sleeve saying to his master Yuan Shao sends this expressing he desires to send an army to attack Gongsun Zan and wishes you to lend provisions and troops I heard Yuan Shao was going to attack Xuchang I suppose my return has made him change his intention said Cao CaoThen he opened the letter and read it It was couched in very arrogant terms Yuan Shao is so exceedingly rude that I will attack him said Cao Cao Only I think I am not quite strong enoughWhat should be done Guo Jia said My lord you know well who lost and why in the conflict between Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor and Xiang Yu his rival the former won only by superior wisdomXiang Yu was the stronger but in the end he was overcomeYour rival has ten weak points whereas you have ten strong ones and though his army is large it is not terrible Then Guo Jia continued Yuan Shao is overmuch devoted to ceremony and deportment while you are sympathetic and natural this is an excellence in conductHe is antagonistic and drives you are conciliatory and lead so you have the advantage of popular approvalFor many years the government has been lax and he makes it more so you strive vigorously after efficiency this is the excellence of able administrationHe is outwardly liberal but grudging at heart and too given to nepotism you appear exacting but you understand and use people after their ability this is the advantage of correct appreciationHe is a visionary but lacking in decision you are a man of prompt decision and direct action this is an advantage in policyHe loves to gather about him people of renown you treat people as you find them regardless of their reputation this is where you excel in moral virtueHe is compassionate to those at hand but careless about those out of sight your care is allembracing this is where you excel in humanityHe lends a ready ear to calumny and is misled you may be flooded with evil counsel but you preserve independence this is where you excel in perspicacityHis sense of right and wrong is confused your appreciation is accurate and clear this is where you excel in administrative capacityHe loves the makebelieve force but is ignorant of military essentials you would overcome with far inferior numbers as you possess military genius this is where you excel in warWith your ten superiorities you will have no difficulty in overcoming Yuan Shao How can I be worth as much as you say said Cao Cao smilingWhat Guo Jia has said about the ten points in your favor agrees exactly with what I think said Xun YuYuan Shaos army is not formidable in spite of its size The real and dangerous enemy is Lu Bu said Guo JiaWhen Yuan Shao has gone north to destroy Gongsun Zan we ought to sweep away Lu Bu and so clear away our danger from that side for if this is not done our attack on Yuan Shao will be the signal for an attempt on the capitalThat would be most serious Cao Cao saw things in the same light as his advisers and began to discuss plans for an attack on Lu BuXun Yu was of opinion that they should first secure the fidelity and aid of Liu BeiSo letters were written and they waited his assurance before moving a soldier Then in order to reassure Yuan Shao his emissary was treated with great kindness and a memorial presented to the Emperor asking extra honors for him Yuan Shao was made Imperial Protector of the four northern regionsJizhou Qingzhou Youzhou and BingzhouWith all this a private letter was written by Cao Cao urging upon him to attack Gongsun Zan and promising assistance So Yuan Shaos army started In the meantime the two Chen Deng and Chen Gui were playing their gameAt every feast and gathering in Xuzhou they uttered the most fulsome praises of Lu BuChen Gong was greatly displeased and took an opportunity to talk about them to his master They flatter you to your face but what is in their hearts You ought to be most carefully on your guard Hold your tongue was the angry reply You are simply slandering them without the slightest excuseYou want to harm good people No ears for loyal words said Chen Gong as he went away sad at heart and we shall suffer He thought seriously of abandoning Lu Bu but that would be too painful a wrenchBeside he feared people would laugh at himSo the days passed sorrowfully for himOne day with a few horsemen he rode out to the country near Xiaopei to hunt On the high road he saw a messenger galloping along in hot haste and began to wonder what it might mean He left the hunt rode across country and intercepted the rider Where are you from Who sent you asked Chen GongThe messenger made no reply for he knew to what party his captors belongedBut they searched him and found a letter the secret reply to Cao Caos letter from Liu BeiThe messenger and the letter were both taken straight to Lu Bu He questioned the man who said The Prime Minister sent me to bear a letter to Imperial Protector Liu BeiI was now taking back the replyI know nothing more and I am ignorant of the contents of the letters So Lu Bu tore it open and readI have received your commands concerning the destruction of Lu Bu and dare I for a moment venture to disregard themBut my force is weak and I must act with extreme circumspection If you move your main body then I will hasten forward and in the meantime my army shall be got ready and weapons preparedI await your command Lu Bu was really alarmedThe wretches cried he To dare to act thus The unhappy messenger was put to death and countermoves plannedChen Gong and Zang Ba went to enlist the help of the Taishan Mountains banditsSun Guan Wu Dun Yin Li and Chang Xiso that they would take Yanzhou in the east of Huashang MountainsGao Shun and Zhang Liao went to attack Liu Bei in XiaopeiSong Xian and Wei Xu went west to attack Runan and YingchuanAnd Lu Bu took command of a large body of troops ready to afford help wherever neededThe departure of the army under Gao Shun against Xiaopei was reported to Liu Bei who assembled his officers at a councilSun Qian advised sending a message to the capital to inform Cao Cao of their dangerIn response to the chiefs call Jian Yong a fellow townsman of Liu Bei offered to take the message Up to that moment Jian Yong had served as a secretarySo a letter was written and Jian Yong set out at once on his journeyThen preparations were made for defense Liu Bei commanding at the south gate Sun Qian at the north gate Guan Yu at the west gate and Zhang Fei at the east gate Mi Zhu and his brother Mi Fang commanded the family guard in the centerThe two Mis were put in command of the house guard because they were Liu Beis brothersinlaw he had taken a sister of Mi Zhu as a second wife Hence they were suitable men to guard the family In due course Gao Shun came to the south gateLiu Bei ascended the tower and said I have no quarrel with your master why do you come here with an army You have plotted with Cao Cao to injure my master as we know now why should I not bind you So saying Gao Shun gave the signal to attackBut Liu Bei did not go out to repulse Gao Shun he only kept the gate fast closedSoon after Zhang Liao led an attack on the west gate then kept by Guan Yu who addressed Zhang Liao from the wall You are too good a man to waste yourself on rebels said Guan YuZhang Liao hung his head and made no replyGuan Yu knew that Zhang Liao had a sound heart and high principles and said no more as he was unwilling to wound Zhang Liao Nor did he go out to attackZhang Liao then drew off and proceeded to the east gate and Zhang Fei went out to give battle Soon it was told Guan Yu who came over quicklyHe saw Zhang Fei going out but Zhang Liao was already withdrawing Zhang Fei wished to pursue but his brother held him backHe is afraid and so has gone away it would be best to pursue said Zhang Fei No said Guan YuAs a warrior he is not inferior to either of us but I have spoken a few straight words and he has sunk deepHe is repentant and that is why he will not meet us So Zhang Fei understood and the gates were shut and orders given for careful defenseWhen Jian Yong Liu Beis messenger reached the capital he saw Cao Cao and told him what had happened The advisers were called to discuss a planCao Cao said I wish to attack Lu Bu I fear not Yuan Shao but Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu may attack me in the rear Xun You the nephew of Xun Yu replied Both these latter have been too recently defeated to do anything so rashBut Lu Bu is a bold fighting man and if he joined forces with Yuan Shu and they set themselves to conquer River Huai and River Si the problem would he difficult Then spoke Guo Jia Let us take advantage of the moment before they have fully made up their mindSmite before they are fully prepared And Cao Cao did so An army of fifty thousand were sent in advance with four commandersXiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Lu Qian and Li Dian Cao Cao commanded the center army which marched by divisions and Jian Yong brought up the rearSoon the scouts informed Gao ShunHe sent flying messengers to Lu Bu who detached two hundred horse with Hou Cheng Cao Xing and He Meng to assist him Gao Shun posted this reinforcement and his army about ten miles from Xiaopei to meet Cao Caos army Lu Bu and the main army also followed close When Liu Bei saw the enemy retiring from the city he knew Cao Caos army was close at hand So making arrangements for guarding the city within he and his two brothers marched their troops out of the city and made a camp that they might be ready to assistNow the division of Cao Caos army under Xiahou Dun having marched out in advance first came into touch with Gao Shun Xiahou Dun at once rode out with spear set and offered a challenge It was accepted and the two leaders fought half a hundred bouts Then Gao Shun began to weaken and had to turn backHe rode round to the rear of his arrayXiahou Dun was not the man to quail so he followed right into the enemys countryThen Cao Xing one of Lu Bus generals secretly strung his bow fitted an arrow and when Xiahou Dun had come quite near shot at him The arrow hit Xiahou Dun full in the left eyeHe shrieked and putting up his head pulled out the arrow and with it the eye Essence of my father blood of my mother I cannot throw this away cried Xiahou Dun and he put the eye into his mouth and swallowed itThen resuming his firm grip of his spear Xiahou Dun went after this new enemy There was no escape for Cao XingHe was overtaken and fell with a fatal spear wound full in the faceBoth sides were stricken dumb with amazementHaving thus slain the man who had wounded him Xiahou Dun rode back toward his own sideGao Shun went in pursuit and waving on his army attacked so vigorously that he won the dayXiahou Yuan defended for his elder brother as they fledLu Qian and Li Dian led various divisions back to Jibei and made a campGao Shun having scored this victory returned to attack Liu Bei and as Lu Bu opportunely arrived with Zhang Liao these three arranged their forces so that each attacked one of the brothers Dauntless was Xiahou Dun that warrior bold His courage had been proved of old But smitten sore one hapless day He might not in the battle stay The fate of Liu Bei will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER Cao Cao Fights At Xiapi Lu Bu Perishes At The White Gate Tower As was stated before Gao Shun and Zhang Liao together went to smite Guan Yu while Lu Bu attacked Zhang Fei Both brothers went out to give battle while Liu Bei force was held in reserveBut then Lu Bu attacked both Guan Yu and Zhang Fei from the rear and the brothers were forced to fleeLiu Bei with a few score of horsemen rushed back to XiaopeiAs he approached the gate with Lu Bu pressing him close he shouted to the soldiers on the wall to lower the drawbridgeLu Bu was so close behind that the archers on the wall feared to shoot lest they should wound their lord and so Lu Bu got into the gate The gate guards could not force him back so they scattered in all directionsLu Bu led his force into the cityLiu Bei saw the position was too desperate for him to reach his residence and he must abandon all his family So he hastened through the city and left by the west gate out at which he and his scanty following fled for very life When Lu Bu reached the residence he was met by Mi Zhu who said The hero does not destroy a persons familyYour rival for the empire is Cao Cao and my master always mindful of the good turn you did him at the Archery Feast would not be ungratefulBut he could not help going to Cao Cao and I think you will pity him Lu Bu replied We two are old friends how could I bear to harm his wives and children Whereupon he sent the family to Xuzhou with Mi Zhu to take care of themNext Lu Bu led his army into Huashang Mountains to Yanzhou leaving Gao Shun and Zhang Liao to guard XiaopeiDuring these troubles Sun Qian had also fled out of the city Guan Yu and Zhang Fei each with a handful of soldiers had got away to the hillsAs Liu Bei with his few horsemen was making the best of their way from the scene of his defeat he heard some one coming up behind him When he got closer the person proved to be Sun QianI know not the fate of my brothers whether they be alive or dead and my wife and children are lost to me What can I do said Liu BeiSun Qian replied I see nothing better than getting away to Cao Cao whence we may be able to plan our future moves Liu Bei had no better plan to propose and the two men directed their way to Xuchang choosing byroads rather than highwaysWhen their small supplies ran out they entered a village to begBut when the people of any place heard that Liu Bei of Yuzhou was the man who needed help they vied with each other in offering all that was requiredOne day they sought shelter at a house whence a youth came out and made a low obeisance They asked his name and he gave it as Liu An of a well known family of huntersHearing who the visitor was the hunter wished to lay before him a dish of game but though he sought for a long time nothing could be found for the table So Liu An came home killed his wife and prepared a portion for his guestWhile eating Liu Bei asked What flesh is it Liu An told himWolf Liu Bei knew no better and ate his fillNext day at daylight just as Liu Bei was leaving he went to the stables in the rear to get his horse and passing through the kitchen he saw the dead body of a woman lying on the table The flesh of one arm had been cut awayQuite startled he asked what this meant and then he knew what he had eaten the night beforeHe was deeply sorry at this proof of his hosts regard and the tears rained down as he mounted his steed at the gateI wish I could go with you said Liu An but as my mother still lives I cannot go so far from home Liu Bei thanked him and went his wayThe party took the road by Liangcheng and as they were going out they saw not far off a thick cloud of dustWhen the troop came nearer they found the troops were of Cao Caos army and with them they traveled to the main camp where they found Cao Cao himself Cao Cao shed tears at the sad story of Liu Beis distress the loss of the city his brothers and wives and childrenWhen Liu Bei him of the hunter who had sacrificed his wife to feed them Cao Cao sent the hunter a present of a hundred ounces of silver as a reward The march then was continued to Jibei where Xiahou Yuan welcomed them They heard that his brother Xiahou Dun was still ill from the wound he had received in the eyeCao Cao went to the sick mans bedside to see him and had him removed to Xuchang for skilled treatmentPresently scouts sent out particularly for tidings of Lu Bu returned saying Lu Bu has allied himself with the bandits in the east and they are attacking Yanzhou At this Cao Cao dispatched Cao Ren with three thousand soldiers to take Xiaopei while he in conjunction with Liu Bei moved against Lu BuThey went east As they reached the Mangdang Hills near Xiao Pass they met the a band of thirty thousand Taishan Mountains brigands barring their road The chieftains of the bandits were Sun Guan Wu Dun Yin Li and Chang Xi who rode out with their spears setHowever Xu Chu plunged into the battle and easily beat them back and chased them right up to the passThe scouts told Lu Bu who was then in Xuzhou whither he had gone to start an expedition to save Xiaopei He left the protection of Xuzhou to Chen Gui and set out with Chen DengAs this latter was starting Chen Gui said to him Remember the words of Cao Cao that the business of the east is in our handsNow is our moment for Lu Bu is about to suffer defeat Father I can look after the outside But when Lu Bu returns beaten you must arrange with Mi Zhu to keep him out of the cityI shall find a means of escape said Chen Deng His family is here and he has many friends How about them I also have a scheme to settle them Then Chen Deng went to see Lu Bu to whom he said Xuzhou is surrounded and this city will be fiercely attacked We ought to provide for possible retreat and I advise storing grain and money in XiapiWe could retreat there if the day went adversely Why not see about this in good time Your words are indeed wise I will also send my wives and little ones thither said Lu BuThe family left under escort of Wei Xu and Song Xian and with them was sent much grain and treasures and coins And then the soldiers marched to the relief of the passAbout half way there Chen Deng said Let me go first to reconnoiter so that you my lord may advance with confidence Thus Chen Deng parted company with his chief and preceded him to the pass where he was received by Chen Gong Chen Deng said The General greatly wonders why you do not advanceHe is going to inquire into it The enemy is in great force and we cannot be too careful said Chen GongWe are holding the pass and you should persuade our master to take steps to guard Xiaopei Chen Deng said Your words are true That evening he went up to the heights from which he could see Cao Caos army which was quite close to the passThen he wrote three notes tied them to arrows and shot them into Cao Caos campNext day he left and hastened back to Lu Bu and said Those bandits are about to give up the pass to the enemy but I have left Chen Gong to hold itYou would better make an attack tonight and hold him Had it not been for you the pass would have been lost said Lu BuThen he sent Chen Deng back to arrange a fire signal with Chen Gong for simultaneous actionSo Chen Deng returned to Chen Gong to whom he said Cao Caos troops have found a secret way through the pass and I fear Xuzhou is already lostYou ought to go back at once At this the pass was abandoned and Chen Gong began to retreat Then Chen Deng gave the prearranged signalLu Bu saw the fire and advanced in the darkness to the relief of the passPresently he met Chen Gongs army and as neither recognized the other in the darkness a fierce battle ensued Nor was the trick discovered till daylight came While these things were going on Cao Cao had noted the signal and advanced as fast as possibleThe bandits who alone remained to hold the pass were easily driven out and scattered in all directionsWhen daylight came and the trick was discovered Lu Bu and Chen Gong set off together for XuzhouBut when they arrived and summoned the gate instead of opening the doors the guards on the wall saluted them with a thick flight of arrowsAt the same time Mi Zhu appeared on the defense tower and shouted You stole our masters city and now we are going to give it back to himYou will not enter here again Where is Chen Gui cried Lu Bu angrilyWe have slain him was the replyWhere is Chen Deng said Lu Bu turning to Chen GongDo you still hold to your delusion General that you ask where this specious rogue is Lu Bu bade them search through all the ranks but Chen Deng was not to be foundThen they decided to go to XiaopeiBut ere they had got half way there suddenly appeared the troops under the command of Gao Shun and Zhang LiaoThey said Chen Deng came to us saying you General was surrounded and wanted help so we came at once Another trick of that false rogue said Lu BuSurely he shall die for this They went with all speed to Xiaopei only to see as they drew near the ensigns of the enemy displayed all along the walls for the city had been taken by Cao RenWhile Lu Bu stood at the foot of the rampart reviling the traitor Chen Deng himself appeared on the wall and pointing to Lu Bu cried Did you think that I a minister of the dynasty would serve a rebel like you Lu Bu in his wrath was about to make a desperate attack but suddenly a great noise was heard and an army came up behind him It was led by no other than Zhang FeiGao Shun went to engage him but he had no chance of successLu Bu then joined in the frayThen another army appeared and the leader this time was Cao Cao himself and his army rushed to the attackSeeing that he had no hope of victory Lu Bu went away toward the east with Cao Cao in pursuitLu Bus army marched till they were worn outThen appeared a new force under Guan Yu Holding his sword ready to strike Guan Yu called out Do not flee O Lu BuGuan Yu is waiting for you Lu Bu joined battle he was flurried and scarcely knew what was happeningAnd soon Zhang Fei came up once moreBy desperate efforts Lu Bu and his troops cut an arterial alley through the press and got freeAfter this they started for Xiapi as fast as they could travel and Hou Cheng helped to keep the pursuers at bay and welcomed them into the city So the two brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were together again after their separationBoth shed tears of joy as they told each other what they had seen and sufferedI was on the Haizhou Road when I heard of you said Guan YuI lost no time in starting And I had been camped in the Mangdang Hills for a long time It is happiness to be together again So they talked Then they marched off together to find their elder brother and made their salutations with tears In Liu Beis heart sadness and joy intermingledNext they were presented to Cao Cao and with him they went into the captured Xuzhou CityMi Zhu soon came with the welcome news of the safety of the familyAnd Chen Gui and Chen Deng came to present their salutationsA grand banquet was prepared for the officers at which Cao Cao presided as host and Chen Gui and Liu Bei occupied the seats of honor to his right and leftAt the close of the banquet Cao Cao paid the two Chens the highest compliments on their success and rewarded them with the revenues of ten counties beside giving the son the title of General Who Quells the WavesCao Cao was very pleased with his success and at once began to scheme for the taking of Xiapi the sole place now left to Lu Bu where he had taken refuge Cheng Yu said the course was inadvisable If Lu Bu be pressed too hard he may get clear by a desperate effort and throw himself into the arms of our especial enemy Yuan ShuThese two as allies would be difficult to overcomeRather send a capable man to guard the South of River Huai one able to secure you against Lu Bu on one hand and to hold Yuan Shu on the otherMoreover the bandits are in Huashang Mountains and still our enemiesThey must be watched Cao Cao replied I can keep the whole of Huashang Mountains and I will request Liu Bei to take the south Could I dare withstand your command said Liu BeiSo forthwith Liu Bei leaving Mi Zhu and Jian Yong at Xuzhou went south taking in his train Guan Yu Zhang Fei and Sun QianAnd Cao Cao led his army to XiapiLu Bu felt very secure in his refuge He had good store of grain and he had the protection of River Si so he sat quiet satisfied that he could maintain his defense So he allowed Cao Caos army to approach without molestationYou ought to attack Cao Caos army as they come up before they have time to make camps and defensesThey will only have a fatigued army to oppose to your fresh troops and you will certainly defeat them So said Chen Gong but Lu Bu replied I have suffered too many defeats lately to take any riskWait till they actually attack and you will see them floating away on the waters So Lu Bu neglected the confidants advice and waited till the enemy had settled into their campThis done the attackers advanced against the city From the foot of the wall Cao Cao called to Lu Bu to listen while he spoke Lu Bu ascended to the wall where he stood Cao Cao addressed him saying When I heard that your family and that of Yuan Shu were likely to be united by marriage I sent an army against youYuan Shu was guilty of treason while you had to your credit on the destruction of Dong Zhuo For what reason have you sacrificed all your merits to throw in your lot with a rebelIt will be over late to regret when this city shall have fallenBut if you surrender and help me to support the ruling house you shall not lose your rank Lu Bu replied If the Prime Minister will retire we may be able to discuss the matter But Chen Gong standing near his master began to rail at Cao Cao for a rebel and shot an arrow that struck his plumed helmetMy oath but I will slay you at least cried Cao Cao pointing his finger at Chen GongThen the attack on the walls beganThey have come from far and cannot maintain this for long said Chen GongGeneral go out with your horse and foot and take up a position outside leaving me to maintain the defense with the remainder of our troopsIf he engages you I will come out and strike at his rear ranks if he attacks the city you can come to our aidIn ten days their stores will fail and we can beat them offThis will place them between the oxhorns The advice seems good said Lu BuLu Bu went back to his palace and prepared his weaponsAs it was the depth of winter he made his army take plenty of wadded clothing to keep them warm Lady Yan his wife heard of it and came to ask whither he was goingHe told her of Chen Gongs planShe said My lord you are leaving an undamaged city abandoning your wife and little ones and going with a paltry forceShould any untoward event happen will your handmaid and her lord ever meet again Lu Bu hesitated and for three days made no moveThen Chen Gong came to see him again and said The enemy are all round the city and unless you go out soon you will be quite hemmed in I am thinking it would be better to maintain a stubborn defense said Lu Bu Our enemies are short of food and have sent for supplies to XuchangThese will soon arrive and you should go out with some veterans and intercept the convoyThat loss would be a heavy blow Lu Bu agreed and went in to tell his wife the new planShe wept saying If you go do you think Chen Gong and others equal to the defense of the cityShould anything go wrong you would be very sorryYou abandoned me at Changan and it was only through the fortunate kindness of Pang Shu that I was hidden from our enemies and rejoined youWho would have thought you would leave me againBut go go your way as far as you wish and do not mind your wife And she wept bitterlyLu Bu very sadly went to take leave of Diao Chan who said You are my lord and my life you must not be careless and ride out alone You need not fear with my mighty trident halberd and RedHare who dare come near me He went outBut when he met Chen Gong he said That story about supplies for Cao Cao is all false one of his many rusesI am not going to stir Chen Gong sighed he felt all was lostWe shall die and no person shall know our burial place said heThereupon Lu Bu remained in his own quarters with his ladies drinking freely to dissipate his sorrowsTwo of his advisers Xu Si and Wang Kai went in and proposed Yuan Shu in the South of River Huai is very powerfulWhy not write to him to renew the marriage allianceYuan Shu can hardly refuse to rescue the affianced bride of his son So Lu Bu wrote and bade these two take the letterXu Si said You ought to send a strong escort with us to force a way through So Lu Bu told off one thousand troops and two of his generals Zhang Liao and He Meng to conduct his messenger beyond the passThey started that same night at the second watch Zhang Liao leading and He Meng bringing up the rearThey got out of the city crept past Liu Beis camp and got beyond the danger zoneThen half the escort went on and Zhang Liao led the remainder back toward the city At the pass he found Guan Yu waitingHowever at that moment Gao Shun came to his help and they all returned and reentered the gates The two messengers presently reached Shouchun saw Yuan Shu and presented the letter How is this said Yuan ShuFormerly he slew my messenger and repudiated the marriage now he sends to ask for it It is all due to the vile plans of that monster Cao Cao If pray you Illustrious Sir consider it carefully replied Xu SiBut if your master was not hemmed in by his enemy and in imminent danger he would never have thought of renewing this proposal of marriage The messengers said You may decide not to help him but the teeth are cold when the lips are goneIt will not make for your happiness and comfort Said Yuan Shu Lu Bu is unreliable tell him that I will send soldiers after the girl has arrived here This was final and the two messengers took leave and headed back to XiapiWhen the party reached Liu Beis camp Xu Si decided We must wait the night falls and Wang Kai and I will try to get through in the darkness the escort of He Meng remaining behind to protect our rear They tried that very night and the two messengers crept across without discoveryBut the escort found them selves faced by Zhang FeiHe Meng tried to fight but was captured in the very first bout and the five hundred troops of his half company were either killed or they fled The prisoner was taken to Liu Bei who forwarded him to the main campThere he told the story of the marriage and the scheme to save the city Cao Cao was angry and ordered the execution of He Meng at the main gateThen Cao Cao sent orders to each camp to exercise the greatest diligence with threats of rigorous punishment of the officers of any corps that permitted any communication between the besieged and the outer worldEvery soldier felt mightily afraidLiu Bei returned to camp and cautioned his brothers saying We are in the most important place with regard to the South of River Huai and you must be very careful not to allow any breach of this command Zhang Fei was inclined to grumble saying We have just captured one of the enemys leaders and there is no word of praise or reward for us nothing but new orders and threats What do you make of that You are wrong to complain said Liu BeiThese are orders of the CommanderinChief and what would happen were there no ordersDo not disobey them Brother They promised obedience and withdrewIn the meantime Xu Si and Wang Kai had got back to Lu Bu and told him what Yuan Shu had said that if the girl came the soldiers should goBut how can she be sent said Lu Bu Xu Si said That is the difficulty He Mengs capture means that Cao Cao knows the whole plan of getting help from the South of River HuaiI do not see how any one but you yourself could hope to get through the close siege Suppose we tried today said Lu BuThis is an illomened day you must not try todayTomorrow is a very lucky day especially in the evening for any military action Then Lu Bu ordered Zhang Liao and Gao Shun Get ready three thousand troops for the venture and prepare a light carriageI will lead the first seventy miles thence you can escort the brideelect the remainder of the way to her new home Next evening toward the second watch Lu Bu wrapped up his daughter in soft wadded garments bound her about with a mailed coat and took her on his back Then with his mighty trident halberd in hand he mounted RedHare and rode at the head of the cavalcade out of the city gate Zhang Liao and Gao Shun followed In this order they approached Liu Beis campThe drums at once beat the alarm and Guan Yu and Zhang Fei barred the way Stop they shoutedLu Bu had no desire to fight all he wished was to get through so he made for a side road Liu Bei came in pursuit and the two parties engagedBrave as he might be Lu Bu was almost helpless now that he was hampered by a girl on his shoulders whom he was desperately anxious to preserve from hurtBeside other parties came up all shouting and attacking and he had no alternative but to give up his project and return into the city of Xiapi He reached his palace very sad at heartThe besiegers returned to camp well pleased that no one had got beyond their linesLu Bu found consolation in the wine cupThe siege had gone on for two months and still the city stoodThen they heard that Zhang Yang Governor of Henei had been inclined to come to the help of Lu BuBut one of his subordinates Yang Chou had assassinated him and was bringing his head as an offering to Cao Cao when he also had been slain by Kui Gu one of the Governors adherents Kui Gu had then led the force to QuanIn the camp of the besiegers there now arose much murmuring Cao Cao sent Shi Huan to intercept and kill Kui GuThen he called a counsel saying Though Zhang Yang who meant to hurt us is happily no more yet we are threatened on the north by Yuan Shao and on the east Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu are a menace Here we meet with no success against the city of Xiapi We are for leaving Lu Bu to his fate and returning home What do you think Among them Xun You fought against the idea saying You must not act like thisLu Bu has lost much and his spirit is broken The spirit of the leader expresses that of his army and when the leader fails his soldiers do not fightChen Gong is clever but nothing is doneLu Bu broken Chen Gong without decision it only needs a sharp attack and we shall succeed I have a plan to propose said Guo Jia a plan to overcome the city at once it is better than two hundred thousand troops I suppose you mean drowning the city by River Si and River Yi said Xun YuThat is it said Guo Jia smilingCao Cao accepted the suggestion with joy and set his troops to cut the banks of River Yi and River Si and moved his army to the high ground whence they watched the drowning out of XiapiOnly the east gate remained clear of water The besieged soldiers hastened to their leaderLu Bu said Why should I fear My good horse can go as well through the water as over the land And he again returned to the wine cup for consolation drinking deeply with his wife and concubineThe continual drinking bouts told at last and Lu Bu began to look dissipatedSeeing himself in a mirror one day he was startled at the change and said to himself I am injuring myself with wine no more from this day forward He then issued an order that no one should drink wine under penalty of deathNow one of his generals Hou Cheng lost fifteen horses stolen by one of his subordinates Hou Cao who intended to resell them to Liu BeiHou Cheng found out where the horses were went out after them and recovered them after killing Hou CaoAnd Hou Chengs colleagues congratulated him on his successTo celebrate the occasion Hou Cheng brewed a few barrels of wine to be drunk at the feast But thinking his chief might find him in fault Hou Cheng sent the bottles of wine to Lu Bus palace with a petition explaining By your virtue of warlike renown I have recovered my horses and as my comrades come with their congratulations I brew some bottles of wine first to offer Your Lordship and second to ask your permission to have a little wine at the feast Lu Bu took it very angrily saying When I have forbidden all wine you brew some and begin to give feasts you are simply defying me Whereupon he ordered the officer to instant executionHowever Song Xian Wei Xu and other officers came in and interceded and after a time Lu Bu softenedYou ought to lose your head for this disobedience but for the sake of your colleagues the punishment shall be reduced to a hundred strokes They tried to beg him off this but only succeeded in reducing the number of blows to one halfWhen the sentence had been carried out and Hou Cheng was permitted to return home his colleagues came sadly to console him Had it not been for you I should have been put to death said Hou ChengSong Xian replied All Lu Bu cares for is his family there is no pity for any one elseWe are no more than the weeds by the roadside Wei Xu said The city is besieged the water is drowning us out There will not be much more of this for we may die any day He is a beast with neither a sense of humanity nor of right Let us leave him said Song Xian He is not worth fighting forThe best we could do would be to seize him and hand him over to Cao Cao said Wei XuI was punished because I got my horses back again yet all he trusts in is his own RedHareIf you two will betray the gate and seize Lu Bu I will steal the horse and go out to Cao Caos camp They settled how to carry out the plot and that very night Hou Cheng sneaked into the stables and got RedHare awayHe hastened to the east gate which was opened to let him through The guard made a pretense of pursuing him but only a pretenseHou Cheng reached the besiegers camp presented the horse and told Cao Cao what had been arranged They would show a white flag and open the gates to his armyHearing this Cao Cao had a few notifications written out which were attached to arrows and shot over the wallsThis is one of them Regent Marshal Cao Cao has received a command from the Emperor to destroy Lu BuThose who interfere with the operations of his grand army whatever their rank shall be put to death in the gate on the day that the city shall be capturedShould any one capture Lu Bu or bring his head he shall be well rewardedLet all take note of this Next day at daylight a tremendous hubbub was heard without the city and Lu Bu halberd in hand hasted to the wall to see what it meant As he went from gate to gate inspecting the defenses and guards he censured Wei Xu for letting Hou Cheng escape and get away with his horseLu Bu threatened to punish Wei XuBut just then the besiegers began a fierce attack as the white flag had just appeared and Lu Bu had to turn all his energies to defenseThe assault lasted till noon when the attacking force drew off for a timeLu Bu was taking a rest in the tower and fell asleep in his chairSong Xian sent away Lu Bus attendants and when they had gone he stole Lu Bus weapon the trident halberd in which he trusted Then Song Xian and Wei Xu fell upon Lu Bu together and before he was well awake had bound him with cords trussing him so that he could not moveLu Bu shouted for his guards but they were driven off by the two traitor generals and could not come near Then a white flag was shown and the besiegers again approached the cityThe traitors shouted out Lu Bu has been captured alive But Xiahou Yuan could hardly believe it till they threw down the famous halberd The gates were flung open and the enemy entered the cityGao Shun and Zhang Liao who were at the opposite gate were surrounded and cut off by the water and helplessThey were captured Chen Gong made a dash to the south gate but was also taken by Xu HuangPresently Cao Cao entered and at once gave orders to turn the streams back into their usual courses He put out proclamations soothing the peopleCao Cao and Liu Bei with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei behind seated themselves side by side in the White Gate TowerThe captives to the number of a thousand were brought before them Lu Bu looked a pitiable objectAlthough a very tall man he was tied up in a veritable ballThe bonds are very tight cried he I beseech you to loosen them Bindings a tiger must binding tight of course replied Cao CaoSeeing Hou Cheng Song Xian and Wei Xu standing there looking pleased at their success Lu Bu said I treated you all well enough how could you turn against me Said Song Xian You listened to the words of your women but rejected the advice of your generalsWas not that mean Lu Bu was silentThen Gao Shun was brought forwardWhat have you to say asked Cao CaoGao Shun sulkily held his tongue and was ordered out to executionNext Chen Gong was led in I hope you have been well since we last saw each other Chen Gong said Cao CaoYour ways were crooked and so I left you said Chen GongYou say I was crooked and what of your serving Lu Bu Though he was a fool he did not resemble you in deceit and wickedness You say you are able enough and clever but what about your position today Turning toward Lu Bu Chen Gong said This man would not follow my adviceHad he done so he would not now be a captive What think you ought to be done about this days work said Cao CaoThere is death for me today and that is the end said Chen Gong undauntedlyVery well for you but what of your mother and wife and children It is said that one who rules with due regard to filial piety does not harm a persons family one who would show benevolence does not cut off the sacrifices at a persons tomb My mother and wife and children are in your handsBut since I am your prisoner I pray you slay me quickly and not to try to harrow my feelings Cao Caos heart still leaned toward mercy but Chen Gong turned and walked away repulsing the attendants who would stop himCao Cao rose from his place and walked with Chen Gong the tears falling from his eyesChen Gong never looked at himTurning to his guards Cao Cao said Let his mother and family be taken to Xuchang and looked after immediatelyAny postponement will be punished The condemned man heard him but uttered no word He stretched out his neck for the blowTears sprang to the eyes of all presentHis remains were honorably coffined and buried in Xuchang A poem pitying Chen Gongs fate says Neither hope of life nor fear of death moved him How brave was he a hero indeed But his lord heeded not his words Wherefore in vain possessed he great talentsNevertheless in that he stood by his masterTo parting with wife and mother He merits our pity and profound respectWho would resemble Chen Gong That day he died at the White Gate TowerWhile Cao Cao sadly escorted Chen Gong on the way to death Lu Bu appealed to Liu Bei Noble Sir you sit there an honored guest while poor I lie bound at your feet Will you not utter one word to alleviate my lot Liu Bei noddedAs Cao Cao returned to his place Lu Bu called out Your only trouble Illustrious Sir is myself and I am on your side nowYou take the lead I will help you and together the world is at our feet What do you think said Cao Cao turning to Liu Bei You are willing to forget the episodes of Ding Yuan and Dong Zhuo Truly the lout is not to be trusted said Lu Bu looking at Liu BeiStrangle and expose said Cao CaoAs he was led away Lu Bu turned once more to Liu Bei You longeared lout you forget now the service I rendered you that day at my camp gate when my arrow hit the mark Just then some one shouted Lu Bu O foolDeath is but death and why are you scared at it Every one turned to look the guards were hustling Zhang Liao to the place of judgmentCao Cao ordered Lu Bus execution A poet has written upon the death of Lu Bu The flood spreads wide the city drowns Its lord is captive Nought avails His coursers speed or halberds thrustThe tiger erstwhile fierce now whines For mercy Cao Cao had meted him Full well a falcon flown at will And hungry kept Poor foolHe let Chen Gongs advice be overborne By harem tattle vainly now He rails against the LongEars faith And another poem saysRound is the hungry tiger eater of men for whom is no pity Since the blood of his victims is fresh and not yet dry Liu Bei spoke no word in favor of Lu Bu To whom even a fathers life was not sacredIt was recorded earlier that the executioners were hustling Zhang Liao forwardPointing to him from above Cao Cao said He has a familiar face You were not likely to forget me you saw me before in Puyang said Zhang LiaoO so you remember me eh Yes more is the pity Pity for what That the fire that day was not fierce enough to burn you up rebel that you are Cao Cao began to get angryHow dare you insult me cried he and lifted his sword to kill the bold speakerThe undaunted Zhang Liao never changed color but stretched out his neck for the blowThen a man behind Cao Cao caught his arm and in front of him another dropped on his knees saying O Prime Minister I pray thee stay thy hand Lu Bu whining was not spared Railing Zhang Liao far better faredWho was it that saved Zhang Liao The next chapter will show CHAPTER Cao Cao Organizes A Hunting Expedition In Xutian Dong Cheng Receives A Secret Command In The Palace The last chapter said that Cao Cao was checked in his angry attack upon Zhang Liao They were Liu Bei who held his arm and Guan Yu who knelt before himA man as generoushearted as he is should be saved said Liu BeiGuan Yu said I know him well as loyal and righteous I will vouch for him with my own life Cao Cao threw aside his sword and smiledI also know Zhang Liao to be loyal and good I was just testing him said heCao Cao loosed the prisoners bonds with his own hands had a change of dress brought in and clothed him therewithThen he was led to a seat of honor This kindly treatment sank deep into Zhang Liaos heart and he hastened to declare formally that he yielded And then he was given the rank of Imperial Commander and the title of LordshipZhang Liao was sent on a mission to win over the bandit leader Zang Ba who hearing what had happened came forthwith and gave in his submissionHe was graciously received and his former colleaguesSun Guan Wu Dun and Yin Lialso yielded with the exception of Chang Xi who remained obdurate All these former enemies who came over were kindly treated and given posts of responsibility wherein they might prove the reality of their conversionLu Bus family were sent to the capitalAfter the soldiers had been rewarded with feasting the camp was broken up and the army moved away to XuchangPassing through Xuzhou the people lined the roads and burned incense in honor of the victors They also petitioned that Liu Bei should be their protectorCao Cao replied Liu Bei has rendered great services You must wait till he has been received in audience and obtained his rewardAfter that he shall be sent here The people bowed low to the ground to express their thanksChe Zhou General of the Flying Cavalry was given command of Xuzhou for the moment After the army had arrived at the capital rewards were granted to all the officers who had been in the expedition Liu Bei was retained in the capital lodging in an annex to the Prime Ministers palaceNext day a court was held and Cao Cao memorialized the services of Liu Bei who was presented to Emperor XianDressed in court robes Liu Bei bowed at the lower end of the audience arenaThe Emperor called him to the Hall and asked his ancestryLiu Bei replied Thy servant is the son of Liu Hong grandson of Liu Xiong who was a direct descendant of Prince Faubus of Zhongshan who was the son of His Majesty the Emperor Myers  The Emperor bade them bring forth the Books of the Genealogies and therefrom a secretary readLiu Jing the Filial Emperor begot fourteen sons of whom the seventh was Liu Sheng Prince of Zhongshan Sheng begot Liu Zhen Lord of Luchang Zhen begot Liu Ang Lord of Pei  Lu begot Liu Lian Lord of Yishui Lian begot Liu Ying Lord of Qinyang Ying begot Liu Jian Lord of Anguo Jian begot Liu Ai Lord of Guangling Ai begot Liu Xian Lord of Jiaoshui Xian begot Liu Shu Lord of Zuyi Shu begot Liu Ziyang Lord of Qiyang Ziyang begot Liu Bi Lord of Yuanze Bi begot Liu Da Lord of Yingchuan Da begot Liu Buyi Lord of Fengling Buyi begot Liu Hui Lord of Jichuan Hui begot Liu Xiong Governor of Zhuo Xiong begot Liu Hong who held no office or rank and Liu Bei is his son The Emperor compared this with the registers of the Imperial House and found by them that Liu Bei was his uncle by descentThe Emperor seemed greatly pleased and requested Liu Bei to go into one of the side chambers where he might perform the ceremonial obeisance prescribed for a nephew to his uncleIn his heart he rejoiced to have this heroic warrior uncle as a powerful supporter against Cao Cao who really held all the power in his own handsThe Emperor knew himself to be a mere puppet He conferred upon his uncle the rank of General of the Left Army and the title of Lord of YichengWhen the banquet was concluded Liu Bei thanked the Emperor and went out of the palaceAnd from this time he was very generally styled the Imperial Uncle When Cao Cao returned to his palace Xun Yu and his fellow advisers went in to see himXun Yu said It is no advantage to you Illustrious Sir that the Emperor recognizes Liu Bei as an uncle Liu Bei may be recognized as uncle but he is under my orders since I control the decrees of the Throne He will be all the more ready to obeyBeside I will keep him here under the pretense of having him near his sovereign and he will be entirely in my handsI have nothing to fear The man I fear is Yang Biao who is a relative of the two Yuan brothers Should Yang Biao conspire with them he is an enemy within and might do much harmHe will have to be removed Hence Cao Cao sent a secret emissary to say that Yang Biao was intriguing with Yuan Shu and on this charge Yang Biao was arrested and imprisoned And his death would have been compassed had his enemy daredBut just then the Governor of Beihai Kong Rong was at the capital and he remonstrated with Cao Cao saying Yang Biao comes from a family famed for virtue for at least four generations you cannot trump up so foolish a charge as that against him It is the wish of His Majesty retorted Cao CaoIf the child Emperor Cheng of Zhou Dynasty had put Duke Chao to death could the people have believed Duke Zhou the Regent Marshal had nothing to do with it So Cao Cao had to relinquish the attempt but he took away Yang Biaos offices and banished him to his family estate in the countryCourt Counselor Zhao Yan an opponent of the Prime Minister sent up a memorial impeaching Cao Cao for having removed a minister of state from office without a decreeCao Caos reply to this was the arrest of Zhao Yan and his execution a bold stroke which terrified the bulk of officers and reduced them to silenceCheng Yu advised Cao Cao to assume a more definite position He said Illustrious Sir your prestige grows daily why not seize the opportunity to take the position of Chief of the Feudatory Princes There are still too many supporters of the court was the replyI must be carefulI am going to propose a royal hunt to try to find out the best line to follow This expedition being decided upon they got together fleet horses famous falcons and pedigree hounds and prepared bows and arrows in readiness They mustered a strong force of guards outside the cityWhen the Prime Minister proposed the hunting expedition the Emperor said he feared it was an improper thing to doCao Cao replied In ancient times rulers made four expeditions yearly at each of the four seasons in order to show their strength They were called Sou Miao Xien and Shou in the order of spring summer autumn and winterNow that the whole country is in confusion it would be wise to inaugurate a hunt in order to train the armyI am sure Your Majesty will approve So the Emperor with the full paraphernalia for an imperial hunt joined the expedition He rode a saddled horse carried an inlaid bow and his quiver was filled with goldtipped arrows His chariot followed behind Liu Bei and his brothers were in the imperial train each with his bow and quiver Each party member wore a breastplate under the outer robe and held his especial weapon while their escort followed themCao Cao rode a dun horse called FlyingLightning and the army was one hundred thousand strongThe hunt took place in Xutian and the legions spread out as guards round the hunting arena which extended over some one hundred square milesCao Cao rode even with the Emperor the horses heads alternating in the leadThe imperial attendants immediately following were all in Cao Caos confidenceThe other officers civil and military lagged behind for they dared not press forward into the midst of Cao Caos partisansOne day the Emperor was riding toward the hunting grounds and noticed his newly found uncle respectfully standing by the roadsideI should like to see my uncle display his hunting skill said the Emperor Liu Bei mounted his steed at onceJust then a hare started from its form Liu Bei shot and hit it with the first arrow The Emperor much struck by this display rode away over a slopeSuddenly a deer broke out of the thicketHe shot three arrows at it but all missed You try said the Emperor turning to Cao CaoLend me Your Majestys bow Cao Cao replied and taking the inlaid bow and the goldentipped arrows he pulled the bow and hit the deer in the shoulder at the first shot It fell in the grass and could not runNow the crowd of officers seeing the goldenbarbed arrow sticking in the wound concluded at once that the shot was the Emperors so they rushed up and shouted O King live forever Cao Cao rode out pushing past the Emperor and acknowledged the congratulationsThey all turned pale Guan Yu who was behind Liu Bei was especially angryThe silkworm eyebrows stood up fiercely and the red phoenix eyes glared as sword in hand he rode hastily forth to cut down the audacious Prime Minister for his impertinenceHowever Liu Bei hastily waved him back and shot at him a meaning glance so that Guan Yu stopped and made no further move Liu Bei bowing toward Cao Cao said Most sincere felicitationsA truly supernatural shot such as few have achieved It is only the enormous good fortune of the Son of Heaven said Cao Cao with a smileThen he turned his steed and felicitated the Emperor But he did not return the bow he hung it over his own shoulder insteadThe hunt finished with banqueting and when the entertainments were over they returned to the capital all glad of some repose after the expedition Guan Yu was still angry of the Prime Ministers breach of decorumOne day Guan Yu said to Liu Bei Brother why did you prevent me from killing that rebel and so ridding the world of a scoundrelHe insults the Emperor and ignores everybody else When you throw stones at a rat beware of the vase quoted Liu BeiCao Cao was only a horses head away from Our Lord and in the midst of a crowd of his partisansIn that momentary burst of anger if you had struck and failed and harm had come to the Emperor what an awful crime would have been laid to us If we do not rid the world of him today a worse evil will come of it said Guan Yu But be discreet my brotherSuch matters cannot be lightly discussed The Emperor sadly returned to his palace With tears in his eyes he related what had occurred in the hunt to his consort Empress Fu Alas for me said he From the first days of my accession one vicious minister has succeeded another I was the victim of Dong Zhuos evil machinations then followed the rebellion of Li Jue and Guo SiYou and I had to bear sorrows such as no others have borneThen came this Cao Cao as one who would maintain the imperial dignity but he has seized upon all real authority and does as he wishesHe works continually for his own glorification and I never see him but my back pricksThese last few days in the hunting field he went in front of me and acknowledged the cheers of the crowd He is so extremely rude that I feel sure he has sinister designs against meAlas my wife we know not when our end may come In a whole court full of nobles who have eaten the bread of Han is there not one who will save his country said sheThus spoke the Empress and at the same moment there stepped in a man who said Grieve not O Imperial PairI can find a savior for the country It was none other than the father of the Empress Fu WanHave you heard of Cao Caos wanton and perverse behavior said the Emperor drying his eyesYou mean the deer shooting Who did not see that indeedBut the whole court is full of his clan or his creaturesWith the exception of the relatives of your Consort there is not one loyal enough to deal with a rebelI have no authority and can do nothing but there is General Dong Cheng the State Uncle who could do it Could Uncle Dong Cheng come in to consult about thisI know he has had much experience of state troubles Fu Wan replied Every one of your attendants is a partisan of Cao Cao and this sort of thing must be kept most profoundly secret or the consequence will be most serious Then what can be done said the EmperorThe only plan I can think of is to send gifts of a robe and a jade girdle to Dong Cheng and in the lining of the girdle hide a secret edict authorizing him to take certain stepsWhen he gets home and has read the edict he can elaborate plans as quickly as possible and neither the spirits above nor the demons below will know anything about them The Emperor approved and Fu Wan went outThe Emperor then with his own hand drew up a decree writing it with blood drawn by biting his finger He gave the document to Empress Fu to sew into the purple lining of the girdle When all was done he put on the robe and girded it with the girdle Next he bade one of the attendants summon State Uncle Dong Cheng to the PalaceDong Cheng came and after the ceremonies were finished the Emperor said A few nights ago I was talking with the Empress of the terrible days of the rebellion and we thought of your good services then therefore we have called you in to reward you The minister bowed his head in thanksThen the Emperor led Dong Cheng out of the Reception Hall to the Temple of Ancestors and they went to the gallery of Worthy Ministers where the Emperor burned incense and performed the usual ceremoniesAfter this they went to see the portraits and among them was one of the founder of the dynasty Liu Bang the Supreme AncestorWhence sprang our great ancestor and how did he begin his great achievement said the EmperorYour Majesty is pleased to joke with thy servant said Dong Cheng rather startled at the questionWho does not know the deeds of the Sacred Ancestor He began life as a minor official in Sishang There gripping his sword he slew a white serpent the beginning of his struggle for the rightSpeedily he mastered the empire in three years had destroyed Qin and in five also ChuThus he set up a dynasty that shall endure forever Such heroic forefathers Such weakling descendants How sad it is said the EmperorPointing to the portraits right and left he continued Are not these two Zhang Liang Lord of Liu and Xiao He Lord of Cuo CertainlyThe Supreme Ancestor was greatly assisted by these two The Emperor glanced right and leftHis attendants were rather far away Then he whispered to Dong Cheng You like these two must stand by me My poor services are of no worth I do not compare with those men said the UncleI remember that you saved me at the western capital ChanganI have never forgotten and I could never reward you properly Then pointing to his own robe the Emperor continued You must wear this robe of mine girded with my own girdle and it will be as though you are always near your Emperor Dong Cheng bowed his gratitude while the Emperor taking off the robe presented it to his faithful ministerAt the same time he whispered Examine it closely when you get home and help your Emperor carry out his intention Dong Cheng understood He put on the robe and the girdle took leave and left the chamberThe news of the audience for Dong Cheng had been taken to the Prime Minister who at once went to the Palace and arrived as Dong Cheng was passing out at the Donghua Gate They met face to face and Dong Cheng could in nowise avoid himDong Cheng went to the side of the road and made his obeisanceWhere are you from State Uncle asked Cao CaoHis Majesty summoned me into the Palace and has given me this robe and beautiful girdle Why did he give you these He had not forgotten that I saved his life in the old days Take it off and let me see it Dong Cheng who knew that a secret decree was hidden away somewhere in the garments was afraid Cao Cao would notice a breach somewhere in the material so he hesitated and did not obeyBut Cao Cao called his guards and they took off the girdle Then Cao Cao looked it over carefully It certainly is a very handsome girdle said heNow take off the robe and let me look at that Dong Chengs heart was melting with fear but he dared not disobey So he handed over the robeCao Cao took it and held it up against the sun with his own hand and minutely examined every part of itWhen he had done this he put it on girded it with the girdle and turning to his attendants said How is it for length Beautiful they chorusedTurning to Dong Cheng he said Will you give these to me My Princes presents to me I dare not give to anotherLet me give you another robe in its stead said Dong ChengIs there not some intrigue connected with these presents I am sure there is said Cao Cao How could I dare said Dong Cheng tremblingIf you are so set upon it then I must give it up How could I take away what your Prince has given youIt was all a joke said the Prime MinisterCao Cao returned both robe and girdle and their owner made the best of his way homeWhen night came and he was alone in his library he took out the robe and looked over every inch of it most carefully He found nothingHe gave me a robe and a girdle and bade me look at them carefullyThat means there is something to be looked for but I can find no trace of it What does it mean he soliloquizedThen he lifted the girdle and examined that The jade plates were carved into the semblance of small dragons interlaced among flowers The lining was of purple silk All was sewn together most carefully and neatly and he could find nothing out of the common He was puzzled He laid the belt on the table Presently he picked it up and looked at it againHe spent long hours over it but in vainHe leaned over on the small table his head resting on his hands and was almost asleep when a candle snuff fell down upon the girdle and burned a hole in the liningHe hastily shook it off but the mischief was done a small hole had been burned in the silken lining and through this there appeared something white with blood red marksHe hastily ripped it open and drew out the decree written by the hand of the Emperor himself in characters of blood It readOf human relationships that between parents and children stands first of the various social ties that between prince and minister stands highestToday Cao Cao the wicked is a real tyrant treating even his Prince with indignityWith the support of his faction and his army he has destroyed the principles of governmentBy conferring rewards and inflicting punishments he has reduced the Emperor to a nonentityI have grieved over this day and night I have feared the empire would be ruinedYou are a high minister of state and my own relative You must recall the difficulties of the great Founders early days and draw together the loyal and rightminded to destroy this evil faction and restore the prerogatives of the Throne Such a deed would be indeed an extreme joy to the spirits of my ancestorsThis decree written in blood drawn from my own veins is confided to a noble who is to be most careful not to fail in executing his Emperors designGiven in the era of Rebuilt Tranquillity fourth year and the third month of spring  So ran the decree and Dong Cheng read it with streaming eyes There was no sleep for him that nightEarly in the morning he returned to his library and reread it No plan suggested itselfHe laid the decree down on the table and sought in the depths of his mind for some scheme to destroy Cao Cao but could not decide upon anyAnd he fell asleep leaning over his tableIt happened that Minister Wang Zifu with whom Dong Cheng was on terms of great intimacy came to visit him and as usual walked into the house unannounced and went straight to the libraryHis host did not wake and Wang Zifu noticed hardly hidden by his sleeve the Emperors writingWondering what this might be Wang Zifu drew it out read it and put it in his own sleeve Then he called out loud Uncle Dong Cheng are you not wellWhy are you asleep at this time of day Dong Cheng started up and at once missed the decree He was aghast he almost fell to the groundSo you want to make away with Cao Cao I shall have to tell him said Wang ZifuThen Brother that is the end of the Hans said his host with tearsI was joking said Wang ZifuMy forefathers also served the Hans and ate of their bounty Am I devoid of loyaltyI would help you Brother as far as lies in my power It is well for the country that you think like this said Dong ChengBut we ought to have a more private place than this to talk over such plans and pledge ourselves to sacrifice all in the cause of Han Dong Cheng began to feel very satisfiedHe produced a roll of white silk and wrote his own name at the top and signed it and Wang Zifu followed suitThen the visitor said General Wu Zilan is one of my best friends he ought to be allowed to come in Dong Cheng replied Of all the officials of the court Commander Chong Ji and Court Counselor Wu Shi are my best friends Certainly they would back me up So the discussion proceededPresently a servant announced no other than these very two men Dong Cheng just mentionedThis is providential said Dong Cheng and he told Wang Zifu to hide behind a screenThe two guests were led into the library and after the exchange of the ordinary civilities and a cup of tea Chong Ji referred to the incident at the hunt and the shooting of the stagWere you not angry at that said Chong JiDong Cheng answered Though we be angry what can we do Wu Shi struck in saying I would slay this fellow I swear but I cannot get any one to back me up One should perish for ones country one should not mind said Chong JiAt this moment Wang Zifu appeared from behind the screen saying You two want to kill Cao Cao I shall have to let him know thisAnd Uncle Dong Cheng is my witness A loyal minister does not mind deathIf we are killed we will be Han ghosts which is better than being sycophants of a traitor said Chong Ji angrilyDong Cheng said We were just saying we wanted to see you two on this matterWang Zifu is only joking Then he drew forth the decree and showed it to the two newcomers who also wept as they read itThey were asked to add their names to the silk rollWang Zifu said Wait here a few moments till I get Wu Zilan to come He left the room and very soon returned with his friend who also wrote his name in the presence of all the othersAfter this they went into one of the inner chambers to drink success to the new plotWhile there a new visitor Ma Teng Governor of Xiliang was announcedSay I am indisposed said the host and cannot receive visitors The doorkeeper took the message whereat Ma Teng angrily said Last night at the Donghua Gate I saw him come out in robe and girdle How can he pretend illness todayI am not come from mere idleness why does he refuse to see me The doorkeeper went in again and told his master what the visitor had said and that he was very angryThen Dong Cheng rose excused himself saying he would soon return and went to receive Ma TengAfter the visitor had saluted and they were both seated Ma Teng said I have just come from a farewell audience and wished to bid you adieuWhy did you want to put me off My poor body was taken suddenly ill that is why I was not waiting to welcome you said Dong ChengYou do not look as if you were ill your face wears the very bloom of health said Ma Teng bluntly His host could say no more and was silent The visitor shook out his sleeves and rose to departHe sighed deeply as he walked down the steps saying to himself Not one of them is any good there is no one to save the country This speech sank deeply into Dong Chengs heartHe stopped his guest saying Who is no good to save the country Whom do you mean That incident at the hunt the other day the shooting of the stag filled my breast with angerBut if you a near relative of the Emperor can pass your time in wine and idle dalliance without a thought of doing away with rebellion where can any one be found who will save the dynasty However Dong Cheng doubts were not set at restPretending great surprise he replied The Prime Minister is of high rank and has the confidence of the court why then do you utter such things So you find that wretch Cao Cao a good man eh Pray speak lower there are eyes and ears very near us The sort of people who covet life and fear death are not those to discuss any great undertaking So saying Ma Teng rose to go sway By this time his hosts doubts were set at rest he felt that Ma Teng was loyal and patrioticSo Dong Cheng said Do not be angry any moreI will show you something Whereupon he invited Ma Teng to go into the room where the others were seated and then showed him the decreeAs Ma Teng read it his hair stood on end he ground his teeth and bit his lips till the blood came When you move remember the whole force of my army is ready to help said Ma TengDong Cheng introduced him to the other conspirators and then the pledge was produced and Ma Teng was told to sign his nameHe did so at the same time smearing the blood as a sign of the oath and saying I swear to die rather than betray this pledge Pointing to the five he said We require ten for this business and we can accomplish our design We cannot get many true and loyal peopleOne of the wrong sort will spoil all said Dong ChengMa Teng told them to bring in the list of officialsHe read on till he came to the name Liu of the imperial clan when clapping his hands he cried Why not consult him Whom cried they altogetherMa Teng very slowly and deliberately spoke his nameTo a very trusty servant comes an Emperors decree And a scion of the ruling house can prove his loyaltyIf the readers turns to the next chapter they will see whom Ma Teng talked about CHAPTER In A Plum Garden Cao Cao Discusses Heroes Using The Hosts Forces Guan Yu Takes Xuzhou Who is it was the question on the lips of the conspiratorsMa Tengs reply was The Imperial Protector of Yuzhou Liu BeiHe is here and we will ask him to help Though he is an uncle of the Emperor he is at present a partisan of our enemy and he will not join said Dong Cheng But I saw something at the hunt said Ma Teng When Cao Cao advanced to acknowledge the congratulations due to the Emperor Liu Beis sworn brother Guan Yu was behind him and grasped his sword as if to cut down Cao Cao However Liu Bei signed to him to hold his hand and he didLiu Bei would willingly destroy Cao Cao only he thinks Cao Caos teeth and claws are too manyYou must ask Liu Bei and he will surely consent Here Wu Shi urged caution saying Do not go too fast Let us consider the thing most carefully They dispersedNext day after dark Dong Cheng went to Liu Beis lodging taking with him the decreeAs soon as Dong Cheng was announced Liu Bei came to greet him and led him into a private room where they could talk freely The two younger brothers were there as wellIt must be something unusually important that has brought Uncle Dong Cheng here tonight said Liu BeiIf I had ridden forth by daylight Cao Cao might have suspected something so I came by night Wine was brought in and while they were drinking Dong Cheng said Why did you check your brother the other day at the hunt when he was going to attack Cao Cao Liu Bei was startled and said How did you know Nobody noticed but I saw Liu Bei could not prevaricate and said It was the presumption of the man that made my brother so angry Guan Yu could not help it The visitor covered his face and weptAh said he if all the court ministers were like Guan Yu there would be no sighs for lack of tranquillity Now Liu Bei felt that possibly Cao Cao had sent his visitor to try him so he cautiously replied Where are the sighs for lack of tranquillity while Cao Cao is at the head of affairs Dong Cheng changed color and rose from his seatYou Sir are a relative of His Majesty and so I showed you my inmost feelingsWhy did you mislead me But Liu Bei said Because I feared you might be misleading me and I wanted to find out At this Dong Cheng drew out the decree he had received and showed it His host was deeply movedThen Dong Cheng produced the pledgeThere were only six names to it and these were Dong Cheng Wang Zifu Chong Ji Wu Shi Wu Zilan and Ma TengSince you have a decree like this I cannot but do my share said Liu Bei and at Dong Chengs request he added his name and signature to the others and handed it backNow let us but get three more which will make ten and we shall be ready to act But you must move with great caution and not let this get abroad said Liu BeiThe two remained talking till an early hour in the morning when the visitor leftNow in order to put Cao Cao quite off the scent that any plot against him was in progress Liu Bei began to devote himself to gardening planting vegetables and watering them with his own hands Guan Yu and Zhang Fei ventured to remonstrate with him for taking to such an occupation when great matters needed attentionThe reason for this you may not know replied heAnd they said no more One day when the two brothers were absent and Liu Bei was busy in his garden two generals of Cao Cao Xu Chu and Zhang Liao with an escort came from Cao Cao saying The command of the Prime Minister is that you come at once What important affair is afoot asked Liu Bei nervously We know nothing we were ordered to come and request your presence All he could do was to followWhen he arrived Cao Cao met him and laughingly said That is a big business you have in hand at home This remark made Liu Bei turn the color of clayCao Cao took him by the hand and led him straight to the private garden saying The growth of vegetables that you are trying to learn is very difficult Liu Bei breathed againHe said That is hardly a business it is only a solace Cao Cao said I happened to notice the green plums on the trees today and suddenly my thoughts went back to a year ago when we were thrashing Zhang Xiu We were marching through a parched county and every one was suffering from thirstSuddenly I lifted my whip and pointing at something in the distance I said Look at those fruitful plum trees in the forest ahead The soldiers heard it and it made their mouths waterSeeing the plums kindles my appreciation I owe something to the plums and we will repay it todayI ordered the servants to heat some wine very hot and sent to invite you to share it Liu Bei was quite composed by this time and no longer suspected any sinister designHe went with his host to a small spring pavilion in a plum garden where the wine cups were already laid out and green plums filled the dishesThey sat down to a confidential talk and free enjoyment of their wineAs they drank the weather gradually changed clouds gathering and threatening rainThe servants pointed out a mass of cloud that looked like a dragon hung in the sky Both host and guest leaned over the balcony looking at itDo you understand the evolution of dragons asked Cao Cao of the guestNot in detail A dragon can assume any size can rise in glory or hide from sightBulky it generates clouds and evolves mist attenuated it can scarcely hide a mustard stalk or conceal a shadowMounting it can soar to the empyrean subsiding it lurks in the uttermost depths of the oceanThis is the midspring season and the dragon chooses this moment for its transformations like a person realizing own desires and overrunning the worldThe dragon among animals compares with the hero among humans You General have traveled all lakes and rivers you must know who are the heroes of the present day and I wish you would say who they are I am just a common dullard how can I know such things Do not be so modest Thanks to your kindly protection I have a post at courtBut as to heroes I really do not know who they are You may not have looked upon their faces but you have heard their names Yuan Shu of the South of River Huai with his strong army and abundant resources is he one His host laughed A rotting skeleton in a graveyard I shall put him out of the way shortly Well Yuan Shao thenThe highest offices of state have been held in his family for four generations and his clients are many in the empireHe is firmly posted in Jizhou and he commands the services of many able people Surely he is one A bully but a coward he is fond of grandiose schemes but is devoid of decision he makes for great things but grudges the necessary sacrificeHe loses sight of everything else in view of a little present advantageHe is not one There is Liu Biao of Jingzhou He is renowned as a man of perfection whose fame has spread on all sidesSurely he is a hero He is a mere semblance a man of vain reputation No not he Sun Ce is a sturdy sort the chief of all in the South LandIs he a hero He has profited by the reputation of his father Sun Jian he is not a real hero What of Liu Zhang of Yiazhou Though he is of the reigning family he is nothing more than a watch dogHow could you make a hero of him What about Zhang Xiu Zhang Lu Han Sui and all those leaders Cao Cao clapped his hands and laughed very loudly saying Paltry people like them are not worth mentioning With these exceptions I really know none Now heroes are the ones who cherish lofty designs in their bosoms and have plans to achieve them they have allembracing schemes and the whole world is at their mercy Who is such a person said Liu BeiCao Cao pointed his finger first at his guest and then at himself saying The only heroes in the world are you and I Liu Bei gasped and the spoon and chopsticks rattled to the floorNow just at that moment the storm burst with a tremendous peal of thunder and rush of rain Liu Bei stooped down to recover the fallen articles saying What a shock And it was quite close WhatAre you afraid of thunder said Cao CaoLiu Bei replied The Sage One paled at a sudden peal of thunder or fierce gust of windWhy should one not fear Thus he glossed over the real fact that it was the words he had heard that had so startled himConstrained to lodge in a tigers lair He played a waiting part But when Cao Cao talked of breaking humans Then terror gripped his heartBut he cleverly used the thunder peal As excuse for turning pale O quick to seize occasions thus He surely must prevailThe shower had passed and there appeared two men rushing through the garden both armedIn spite of the attendants they forced their way to the pavilion where sat the two friends They were Guan Yu and Zhang FeiThe two brothers had been outside the city at archery practice when Cao Caos invitation had come so peremptorily On their return they heard that two officers had arrived and led away Liu Bei to the Prime MinisterThey hastened to his palace and were told their brother was with his host in the grounds and they feared something had happened So they rushed inNow when they saw their brother quietly talking with Cao Cao and enjoying a cup of wine they took up their usual places and meekly stood waitingWhy did you come said Cao CaoWe heard that you Sir had invited our brother to a wine party and we came to amuse you with a little sword play said theyThis is not a Hongmen Banquet replied Cao Cao What use have we for Xiang Chang and Xiang Ba of old Liu Bei smiledThe host ordered wine to be served to the two Fan Kuais to allay their anxiety and soon after the three took their leave and returned homeward We were nearly frightened to death said Guan YuThe story of the dropped chopsticks was toldThe two asked what their brother intended by his actions My learning gardening was to convince Cao Cao of my perfect simplicity and the absence of any ambitionBut when he suddenly pointed to me as one of the heroes I was startled for I thought he had some suspicionsHappily the thunder at that moment supplied the excuse I wanted Really you are very clever said theyNext day Cao Cao again invited Liu Bei and while the two were drinking Man Chong who had been dispatched to find out what Yuan Shao was doing came to present his reportHe said Gongsun Zan has been completely defeated by Yuan Shao Do you know the detailsI should like to know how interrupted Liu BeiThey were at war and Gongsun Zan got the worst of it so he acted on the defensive building a high wall about his army and on that erecting a high tower which he called the Yijing Tower Therein he placed all his grain one hundred thousand carts total and took up his own quartersHis fighting troops passed in and out without ceasing some going out to give battle others returning to rest One of them was surrounded and sent to ask Gongsun Zan to rescue himGongsun Zan said If I rescue him hereafter every one will want to be helped and will not exert himself So Gongsun Zan did not goThis disgusted his soldiers and many deserted to the enemy so that his army diminishedHe sent letters to the capital to crave help but the messenger was capturedHe sent to Zhang Yan to arrange with him for a twopronged joint attack and those letters with the plans also fell into Yuan Shaos hands and the plans were adopted by Yuan Shao who gave the signals agreed uponThus Gongsun Zan fell into an ambush lost heavily and retreated into the cityThere he was besieged and a subterranean passage was pierced into the tower where he lodged The tower was set on fire and Gongsun Zan could not escape So he slew his wife and little ones and hanged himselfThe flames destroyed the bodies of the whole familyYuan Shao has added the remnants of the vanquished army to his own and so become yet strongerHis brother Yuan Shu in the South of River Huai however has become so arrogant and cruel that the people have turned against himThen Yuan Shu had sent to say he would yield the title of Emperor which he had assumed in favor of Yuan ShaoYuan Shao demanded the Imperial Hereditary Seal also and Yuan Shu promised to bring it in person Now Yuan Shu has abandoned River Huai and is about to move to the North of Yellow RiverIf he succeeded the two brothers will control adjoining regions and be dangerous It was a sad story and Liu Bei remembered with sorrow that in the days of success and prosperity the dead chieftain Gongsun Zan had pushed his interest and shown him much kindnessMoreover he was anxious to know the fate of Zhao YunIn his heart he thought What better chance am I likely to get of setting myself free So Liu Bei rose and said to Cao Cao If Yuan Shu goes over to join his brother he will surely pass through Xuzhou I beg you to give me an army with which to smite him on the wayThat will finish Yuan Shu Memorialize the Emperor tomorrow and I will give you an army said Cao CaoSo next day Liu Bei went to an audience and Cao Cao gave him command of fifty thousand horse and foot and sent Generals Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao with himAt parting with Liu Bei the Emperor shed tearsAs soon as Liu Bei reached his lodging he set about preparations for immediate departure taking his seal as General and preparing his weaponsDong Cheng went three miles away from the city to bid him farewellYou must not mind my going this journey will assuredly help on the scheme said Liu BeiKeep your mind fixed on that said Dong Cheng and never forget what His Majesty requires of us They partedPresently his brothers asked him why he was in such a hurry to get away Liu Bei replied I have been a bird in a cage a fish in a netThis is like the fish regaining the open sea and the bird soaring into the blue skyI suffered much from the confinement Then he ordered Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao to march the troops faster Now Guo Jia and Cheng Yu had been absent inspecting stores and supplies when Liu Bei left As soon as they heard of his expedition they went in to see their master asking him why he had let Liu Bei go in command of an armyHe is going to cut off Yuan Shu replied Cao CaoFormerly when he was Imperial Protector of Yuzhou we recommended that he should be put to death but you would not hear of itNow you have given him an army You have allowed the dragon to reach the sea the tiger to return to the mountainsWhat control will you have in future So spoke Cheng Yu and Guo Jia followed in the same strain saying Even if you would not put him to death you need not have let him goAs the proverb says Relax opposition for one day and agelong harm ensues You must admit the truth of this Cao Cao recognized that these were prudent counsels so he sent Xu Chu with five hundred horsemen and imperative orders to bring Liu Bei back againLiu Bei was marching as rapidly as possible when he noticed a cloud of dust in the rear and remarked to his brothers Surely they are pursuing us He halted and made a stockade and ordered his brothers to be in readiness one on each flankPresently the messenger arrived and found himself in the midst of an army ready for battle Xu Chu dismounted and entered the camp to speak with Liu BeiSir on what business have you come asked Liu BeiThe Prime Minister has sent me to request you to return as he has further matters to discuss with you When a general has once taken the field even the royal command is of no effectI bade farewell to the Emperor I received the Prime Ministers commands and there can be nothing further to talk aboutYou may return forthwith and take that as my reply Xu Chu was undecided what action to takeHe thought The Prime Minister cherishes a friendship with Liu Bei and I have no orders to killI can only return with this reply and ask further instructions So Xu Chu leftWhen he related what had occurred Cao Cao still hesitated to take any actionThis refusal to return means enmity said Cheng Yu and Guo JiaStill two of my people are with him said Cao CaoHe will not dare do anything unfriendly I think Beside I sent him and I cannot go back on my own orders So Liu Bei was not pursuedHe took his arms he fed his steed And fared forth willingly Intent to accomplish his Kings behest Deep graven on his memoryAt least he had broken out of his cage He heard not the tigers roar He had shaken the shackles from his feet As a dragon on high could soarAs soon as Ma Teng heard that Liu Bei had set forth he reported that pressing business called him and marched back to his own region XiliangWhen Liu Bei reached Xuzhou the Imperial Protector Deputy Che Zhou came to meet himWhen the official banquet was over Sun Qian and Mi Zhu paid their visit to Che Zhou Then Liu Bei proceeded to his residence to greet his familyScouts were sent out to see what Yuan Shu was doing They came back with the intelligenceYuan Shus arrogance had driven away his generals Lei Bo and Chen Lan who had returned to their mountain fastness in Mount SongHis forces thus reduced he wrote resigning the imperial style he had assumed in favor of his brother Yuan Shao who at once commanded his presenceThereupon he packed up the palace fittings he had made got the remnants of his army in order and marched west When Yuan Shu neared Xuzhou Liu Bei led out his force of fifty thousand soldiers and four generalsGuan Yu Zhang Fei Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao Yuan Shu sent out Ji Ling to force a way throughBut Zhang Fei opposed him and attacked without a parley In the tenth bout Zhang Fei cut down Ji LingThe defeated troops fled in all directionsThen Yuan Shu came up with his own armyLiu Bei placed Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao in command of the left wing Guan Yu and Zhang Fei the right wing and himself in the center and so met Yuan Shu As soon as the enemy came near Liu Bei began to abuse him crying O rebellious one and wicked I have a command to destroy youYield then with good grace and so escape your punishment Base weaver of mats and mean maker of straw sandalsHow dare you make light of me replied Yuan Shu and he gave the signal for an attack Liu Bei retired and his generals from the flanks closed inThey smote the army of Yuan Shu till corpses littered the plain and blood flowed in streams At the same time Yuan Shus former generals Lei Bo and Chen Lan from Mount Song attacked the baggage train and completed the destructionYuan Shu tried to retreat to Shouchun but Lei Bo and Chen Lan barred the roadYuan Shu sought refuge in Jiangling with one thousand troops left of all his army And these were the weakly ones able neither to fight nor fleeIt was then the height of summer and their food was nearly exhausted The whole provision consisted of thirty carts of wheatThis was made over to the soldiers and the members of his household went hungry Many died of actual starvationYuan Shu could not swallow the coarse food that the soldiers lived on One day he bade his cook bring him some honeyed water to quench his thirstThere is no water save that tainted with blood replied the cook Where can I get honeyed water This was the last strawYuan Shu sat up on his couch and rolled out on the floor with a loud cry Blood gushed from his mouth and thus he diedIt was the sixth month of the fourth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity The last days of Han approached and weapons clashed in every quarter The misguided Yuan Shu lost to all sense of honor Forgetful of his forefathers who had filled the states highest offices Madly aspired to become himself Emperor Resting his outrageous claim on the possession of the Seal And arrogantly boasting that thus he fulfilled the design of HeavenSick unto death he vainly begged for a little honeyed water He died aloneYuan Shu being dead his nephew Yuan Yin taking his coffin and his wife and children sought shelter in Lujiang There the Magistrate Xu Liu slew all the survivorsAmong the possessions Xu Liu found the Imperial Hereditary Seal which he at once took to the capital and presented to Cao Cao for which service he was made Governor of GaolingSince then the Imperial Hereditary Seal belonged to Cao CaoWhen Liu Bei heard that Yuan Shu was dead he prepared a report to the Throne and sent it to Cao Cao He sent the two generals deputed by Cao Cao Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao back to the capital keeping the army to defend XuzhouHe also personally went through the countryside commanding the people to resume their ordinary avocationsCao Cao was angry when his two officers returned without their man and was going to put them to death Xun Yu reasoned with himThe power was in Liu Beis hands and so these two had no alternative said Xun YuSo they were pardonedYou should instruct Che Zhou the Imperial Protector Deputy to try to destroy him said Xun YuAccordingly he sent secret orders to Che Zhou who took Chen Deng into his confidence and asked his adviceChen Deng said That is easyLiu Bei is outside the city and an ambush in the city gate to attack him on his return from the country will be final I will attack the escort with arrows from the city walls Che Zhou agreed to try thisThen Chen Deng went to his father to tell him Chen Gui bade him go and warn the intended victimChen Deng at once rode away to do soBefore long he met Guan Yu and Zhang Fei to whom he told his story Now Liu Bei was following some distance behindAs soon as Zhang Fei heard of the plot he wanted to attack the ambush but Guan Yu proposed another planSaid he Attacking the ambush will be a failure since we are without the walls And I think we can compass the death of Che ZhouIn the night we will pretend to be some of Cao Caos soldiers and entice him out to meet us We will slay him Zhang Fei approved of the planNow the soldiers still had some of Cao Caos army banners and wore similar armorAbout the third watch they came to the city wall and hailed the gateThose on guard asked who they were The men replied that they were Zhang Liaos troops sent from the capitalThis was told Che Zhou who sent hastily for Chen Deng to ask his advice If I do not receive them they will suspect my loyalty said Che ZhouYet if I go out I may be victim of a ruse So he went up on the wall and said It is too dark to distinguish friends from foesYou must wait till daylight If Liu Bei know our presence he will attack shouted back the soldiers And they begged him to let them in Still Che Zhou hesitatedThey shouted louder than ever to open the gatePresently Che Zhou girded on his armor placed himself at the head of one thousand cavalry and went outHe galloped over the bridge shouting Where is Zhang Liao Then lights blazed around and he recognized Guan Yu with his sword drawn Wretch cried Guan Yu You would plot to slay my brother would you Che Zhou was too frightened to make good defense and he turned to reenter the gateBut as he reached the drawbridge Chen Deng shot out flights of arrows wherefore Che Zhou turned aside and galloped along under the wall But Guan Yu came quickly in pursuitHis sword was raised aloft and as it came down Che Zhou fell to the earthGuan Yu cut off his head and returned shouting I have slain the traitor You others need not fear if you only surrender They threw aside their spears and gave in As soon as the excitement had calmed Guan Yu took the head to show Liu Bei and told him the story of the plot But what will Cao Cao think of this said Liu BeiAnd he may come If he does we can meet him said Guan Yu But Liu Bei was grieved beyond measureWhen he entered the city the elders of the people knelt in the road to welcome himWhen he reached his residence he found that Zhang Fei had already exterminated the family of Che ZhouLiu Bei said We have slain one of Cao Caos best officers and how will he stand that Never mind cried Chen DengI have a plan Just from grave danger extricated A looming war must be placatedThe plan proposed by Chen Deng will be disclosed next CHAPTER Yuan Shao And Cao Cao Both Take The Field Guan Yu And Zhang Fei Captures Two Generals This was the plan proposed to Liu Bei Yuan Shao is Cao Caos terrorHe is strongly posted in an extensive territory of four regionsJizhou Qingzhou Youzhou and Bingzhouwith one million fighting soldiers and numerous able officersWrite letters and pray him rescue you Liu Bei replied But we have never had any dealings with each other and he is unlikely to do such a thing for one who has just destroyed his brother There is some one here whose family have been on intimate terms with the Yuans for a hundred yearsYuan Shao would surely come if he wrote And who is this A man you know well and respect greatly can you not guess You surely mean Zheng Xuan said Liu Bei suddenlyThat is he said Chen Deng smilingNow Zheng Xuan was a student and a man of great talent who had long studied under the famed teacher Ma Rong whose knowledge of the Book of Odes was universally recognizedWhenever Ma Rong lectured he let fall a curtain behind which were a circle of singing girls The students were assembled in front of this curtainZheng Xuan attended these lectures for three years and never once let his eyes wander to the curtain Naturally the master admired his pupilAfter Zheng Xuan had finished his studies and gone home Ma Rong praised him to the others saying Only one man has penetrated the inner meaning of my instructions and that one is Zheng Xuan In Zheng Xuans household the waiting maids were familiar with the Book of OdesOnce one of the maids opposed Zheng Xuans wishes so as punishment she was made to kneel in front of the steps Another girl made fun of her quoting from an odeWhat are you doing there in the mire The kneeling girl capped the verse from another ode quoted sheThat was but a simple word I said Yet brought it wrath upon my head Such was the family in which Zheng Xuan had been bornIn the reign of the Emperor Huan he rose to the rank of Chair of the SecretariatBut when the Ten Eunuchs began to control the government he gave up office and retired into the country to XuzhouLiu Bei had known him before had consulted him on many occasions and greatly respected himLiu Bei was glad that he had remembered this man and without loss of time in company with Chen Deng he went to Zheng Xuans house to ask him to draft this letter which Zheng Xuan generously consented to doSun Qian was entrusted with the task of delivery and set out at once Yuan Shao read it and considered the matter long before speakingLiu Bei destroyed my brother and I ought not to help him but out of consideration for the writer of this letter I must Thereupon Yuan Shao assembled his officers to consider an attack upon Cao CaoAdviser Tian Feng said Do not raise an army The people are worn out and the granaries are empty with these constant wars Let us rather report the recent victory of Gongsun Zan to the ThroneIf that does not reach the Emperor then memorialize that Cao Cao is hindering the government Then raise an armyoccupy Liyang assemble a Yellow River fleet in Henan prepare weapons send out your various divisions and within three years you will win all round Adviser Shen Pei replied I do not agreeThe military genius of our illustrious lord having overcome the hordes of the north to dispose of Cao Cao is as simple as turning ones hand it is not a matter of months Adviser Ju Shou said Victory is not always to the manyCao Caos discipline is excellent his soldiers are brave and well drilled He will not sit down quietly waiting to be surrounded as Gongsun Zan didNow you abandon the intention to inform the Throne of our success which I find a good plan but you intend to send out an army without any valid excuseOur lord should not do that Then followed adviser Guo Tu saying You are wrongNo expedition against Cao Cao can lack excuseBut if our master would take the chance now offering itself of coming into his own he will accede to the request in the letter of Zheng Xuan and ally himself with Liu Bei for the destruction of Cao CaoThis would win the approval of Heaven and the affections of the people a double blessing Thus the four advisers differed and wrangled and Yuan Shao could not decide which to followThen there came two others Xu You and Xun Shen and seeing them Yuan Shao said You two have wide experience how would you decide The two made their obeisance and Yuan Shao said A letter from Zheng Xuan the Chair has arrived counseling me to support Liu Bei in an attack on Cao CaoNow am I to send an army or not send an army They both cried with one voice SendYour armies are numerous enough and strong enough you will destroy a traitor and help the dynasty Your words just express my desire said Yuan Shao and thenceforward the discussion turned on the expeditionFirst Liu Beis legate Sun Qian was sent back with Yuan Shaos consent and instructions for Liu Bei to make ready to cooperateSecond Yuan Shao assigned Shen Pei and Peng Ji as Commanding Generals Tian Feng Xun Shen and Xu You as Military Advisers Yan Liang and Wen Chou as Generals The army was to be composed of three hundred thousand horse and foot in equal numbers They were to march on LiyangWhen the arrangements were complete Guo Tu went to his chief saying In order to manifest the righteousness of your attack on Cao Cao it would be well to issue a manifesto with a summary of his various crimes Yuan Shao approved of this and Chen Lin well known as a scholar was entrusted to compose such a documentChen Lin had been the Court Secretary in the reign of the late Emperor LingWhen Dong Zhuo unseated Regent Marshal He Jin Chen Lin sought safety in Jizhou This is the manifestoA perspicacious ruler wisely provides against political vicissitudes a loyal minister carefully foresees the difficulties in the assertion of authorityWherefore a person of unusual parts precedes an extraordinary situation and of such a person the achievements will be extraordinaryFor indeed the ordinary person is quite unequal to an extraordinary situationIn former days after having gained ascendancy over a weakling emperor of the powerful Qin Dynasty Prime Minister Zhao Gao wielded the whole authority of the Throne overruling the governmentAll dignity and fortune came through him and his contemporaries were restrained so that none dared to speak openlySlowly but surely evolved the tragedy of the Wangyi Palace when the Emperor was slain and the Imperial Tablets perished in the flames Zhao Gao the author of these crimes has ever since been held up to obloquy as the arch example of an evil doer In the later days of Empress Lu of the Hans after the death of the Supreme Ancestor the world saw Lu Chan and Lu Lu brothers of the Empress and fellows in wickedness monopolizing the powers of governmentWithin the capital they commanded two armies and without they ruled the feudal states of Liang and ZhaoThey arbitrarily controlled all state affairs and decided all questions in the council chamber and the courtThis dominance of the base and declension of the noble continued till the hearts of the people grew cold within themThereupon Zhou Bo Lord of Jiang and Liu Zhang Lord of Zhuxu asserted their dignity and let loose their wrath They destroyed the contumacious ministers and restored their ruler to his royal state Thus they enabled the kingly way to be reestablished and the glory to be manifested Here are two instances where ministers asserted their authorityThis Cao Cao now Minister of Works forsooth had for ancestor a certain eunuch named Cao Teng fitting companion of Xu Huang and Zuo Guan All three were prodigies of wickedness and insatiably avaricious and let loose on the world they hindered ethical progress and preyed upon the populaceThis Cao Teng begged for and adopted Cao Caos father who by wholesale bribery wagons of gold and cartloads of jewels presented at the gates of the influential contrived to sneak his way into considerable office where he could subvert authorityThus Cao Cao is the depraved bantling of a monstrous excrescence devoid of all virtue in himself ferocious and cunning delighting in disorder and reveling in public calamityNow I Yuan Shao a man of war have mustered my armies and displayed my might that I may sweep away and destroy the evil opponents of governmentI have already had to deal with Dong Zhuo the ruffian who invaded the official circle and wrested the governmentAt that time I grasped my sword and beat the drums to restore order in the east I assembled warriors selected the best and took them into my serviceIn this matter I came into relations with this Cao Cao and conferred with him to further my scheme I gave him command of a subordinate force and looked to him to render such petty service as he was equal toI suffered his stupidities and condoned his shortcomings his rash attacks and facile retreats his losses and shameful defeats his repeated destruction of whole armies Again and again I sent him more troops and filled the gaps in his depleted ranks I even addressed a memorial to the Throne for him to be appointed Imperial Protector of Yanzhou I made him feel as he were a tiger I added to his honors and increased his authority hoping that eventually he would justify himself by a victory against Dong Zhuo such as Qin used Meng Ming against JinBut Cao Cao availed himself of the opportunity to overstep all bounds to give free rein to violence and evil He stripped the common people outraged the good and injured the virtuousBian Rang Governor of Jiujiang was a man of conspicuous talent and of worldwide reputationHe was honest in speech and correct in demeanor He spoke without flatteryCao Cao put him to death and his head was exposed and his family utterly destroyedFrom that day to this scholars have deeply mourned and popular resentment has steadily grownOne person raised his arm in anger and the whole countryside followed himWhereupon Cao Cao was smitten at Xuzhou and his territory was snatched by Lu BuHe fled eastward without shelter or refugeMy policy is a strong trunk and weak branches a commanding central government and obedient feudal lords Also I am no partisan Therefore I again raised my banners donned my armor and moved forward to attack My drums rolled for an assault on Lu Bu and his multitudes incontinently fledI saved Cao Cao from destruction and restored him to a position of authorityWherein I must confess to showing no kindness to the people of Yanzhou although it was a great matter for Cao Cao Later it happened that the imperial cortege moved west and a horde of rebels of Dong Zhuos faction rose and attacked The course of government was hindered At that moment my territory was threatened from the north and I could not leave itWherefore I sent one of my officers Xu Xun to Cao Cao to see to the repair of the dynastic temples and the protection of the youthful sovereign Thereupon Cao Cao gave the rein to his inclinationsHe arbitrarily ordered the removal of the courtHe brought shame upon the Ruling House and subverted the lawsHe engrossed the chairmanship of the three highest offices and monopolized the control of the administrationOffices and rewards were conferred according to his will punishment was at his wordHe glorified whole families of those he loved he exterminated whole clans of those he hatedOpen critics were executed secret opponents were assassinatedOfficials locked their lips wayfarers only exchanged glancesChairs of boards recorded levies and every government official held a sinecureThe late Yang Biao a man who had filled two of the highest offices of state as Chairs of two boards because of some petty grudge was though guiltless charged with a crime He was beaten and suffered every form of crueltyThis arbitrary and impulsive act was a flagrant disregard of constitutional rulesAnother victim was the Counselor Zhao Yan He was faithful in remonstrance honest in speech endowed with the highest principles of rectitude He was listened to at court His words carried enough weight with the Emperor to cause him to modify his intention and confer reward for outspokennessDesirous of diverting all power into his own hands and stifle all criticism Cao Cao presumed to arrest and put to death this censor in defiance of all legal proceduresAnother evil deed was the destruction of the tomb of Prince Xiao of Liang the brother of the late EmperorHis tomb should certainly have been respected even its mulberries and sweetgum trees its cypresses and its pinesCao Cao led soldiers to the cemetery and stood by while it was desecrated the coffin destroyed and the poor corpse exposed They stole the gold and jewels of the deadThis deed brought tears to the eyes of the Emperor and rent the hearts of all peopleCao Cao also appointed new officesCommander Who Opens Grave Mounds and General Who Seeks for Goldwhose tracks were marked by desecrated graves and exhumed bodiesIndeed while assuming the position of the highest officer of state he indulged the inclination of a bandit polluting the empire oppressing the people a bane to gods and humansHe added to this by setting up minute and vexatious prohibitions so that there were nets and snares spread in every pathway traps and pitfalls laid in every roadA hand raised was caught in a net a foot advanced was taken in an entanglement Wherefore the people of his regions Yanzhou and Yuzhou waxed desperate and the inhabitants of the metropolis groaned and murmured in angerRead down the names through all the years Of ministers that all humans curse For greed and cruelty and lust Than Cao Cao you will not find a worseI have investigated the cases of evil deeds in the regions but I have been unable to reform himI have given him repeated opportunities hoping that he would repentBut he has the heart of a wolf the nature of a wild beast He nourishes evil in his bosom and desires to pull down the pillars of the state to weaken the House of Han to destroy the loyal and true and to stand himself conspicuous as the chiefest of criminalsFormerly when I attacked the north Gongsun Zan that obstinate bandit and perverse brave resisted my might for a yearBefore Gongsun Zan could be destroyed this Cao Cao wrote to him that under the pretense of assisting my loyal armies he would covertly lead them to destruction The plot was discovered through his messengers and Gongsun Zan also perishedThis blunted Cao Caos ardor and his plans failedNow he is camped at the Ao Granaries with the Yellow River to strengthen his position Like the mantis in the story who threatened the chariot with its forelegs he thinks himself terribleBut with the dignity and prestige of Han to support me I confront the whole worldI have spearmen by millions horsemen by hundreds of thousands fierce and vigorous warriors strong as Chong Huang and Wu Huo those heroes of antiquityI have enlisted expert archers and strong bowmenIn Bingzhou my armies have crossed the Taihang Range and in Qingzhou they have forded River Ji and River TaThey have coasted down the Yellow River to attack his van and from Jingzhou the armies of Liu Biao have descended to Wancheng and Wangye to smite his rearguard Thunderlike in the weight of their march tigerlike in the alertness of their advance they are as flames let loose among light grass as the blue ocean poured on glowing embers Is there any hope that he escape destructionOf the hordes of Cao Cao those who can fight are from the north or from other camps and they all desire to return home They weep whenever they look to the northThe others belong to Yanzhou or Yuzhou being remnants of the armies of Lu Bu and Zhang Yang Beaten stern necessity forced them to accept service but they take it only as a temporary expedientThey who have been wounded hate each otherIf I give the signal to return and send my drums to the mountain tops and wave the white flag to show them they may surrender they will melt away like dew before the sun and no blood will be shed The victory will be mineNow the Hans are failing and the bonds of empire are relaxedThe sacred dynasty has no supporter the ministers are not strong enough to cope with the difficultiesWithin the capital the responsible ministers are crestfallen and helpless There is no one to rely uponSuch loyal and high principled people as are left are browbeaten by a tyrannical minister How can they manifest their virtueCao Cao has surrounded the Palace with seven hundred veterans the ostensible object being to guard the Emperor but the covert design being to hold him prisonerI fear this is but the first step in usurpation and so I take my partNow is the time for loyal ministers to sacrifice their lives the opportunity for officers to perform meritorious deedsCan I fail to urge you Cao Cao has forged commands to himself to undertake the control of government affairs and in the name of the state sends out calls for military assistanceI fear lest distant regions may obey his behest and send troops to help him to the detriment of the multitude and their everlasting shame No wise person will do soThe forces of four regionsBingzhou Jizhou Qingzhou and Youzhou are moving out simultaneouslyWhen this call reaches Jingzhou you will see their forces cooperate with those of Liu BiaoAll regions and counties ought to organize volunteers and set them along their borders to demonstrate their force and prove their loyal support of the dynastyWill not this be rendering extraordinary service The rank of lordship with feudal rights over five thousand households and a money reward of five millions will be the reward of the one who brings the head of Cao CaoNo questions will be asked of those who surrenderI publish abroad this notice of my bounty and the rewards offered that you may realize that the dynasty is in real danger Yuan Shao read this effusion with great joyHe at once ordered copies to be posted everywhere in towns and cities at gates tax stations ferries and passesCopies found their way to the capital and one got into Cao Caos palace That day he happened to be in bed with a bad headacheThe servants took the paper to the sick mans room He read it and was frightened from the tips of his hair to the marrow of his very bones He broke out into a cold perspiration and his headache vanished He bounded out of bed and said to Cao Hong Who wrote this They say it is Chen Lins brush replied heCao Cao laughed They have the literary gift they would rather have the military too to back it upThis fellow may be a very elegant writer but what if Yuan Shaos fighting capacity falls short Cao Cao called his advisers together to consider the next moveKong Rong heard of the summons and went to Cao Cao saying You should not fight with Yuan Shao he is too strongMake peace Xun Yu said He is despicable do not make peace Kong Rong replied His land is wide and his people strongHe has many skillful strategists like Guo Tu Xu You Peng Ji and Shen Pei loyal leaders like Tian Feng and Ju Shou and formidable generals like Yan Liang and Wen Chou able commanders like Gao Lan Zhang He Han Meng and Chunyu QiongYou cannot say he is despicable Xun Yu laughed saying His army is a rabbleOne general Tian Feng is bold but treacherous another Xu You is greedy and ignorant Shen Pei is devoted but stupid Peng Ji is steady but useless And these four of such different temperaments mutually incompatible will make for confusion rather than efficiency The brave Yan Liang and Wen Chou are worthless and can be disposed of in the first battle and the others such as Gao Lan Zhang He Han Meng and Chunyu Qiong are poor rough stuffWhat is the use even of their hundred thousands Kong Rong was silent and Cao Cao smiled They are even as Xun Yu describes said Cao CaoThen Cao Cao issued orders Generals Liu Dai and Wang Zhong were to lead an army of fifty thousand troops displaying the Prime Ministers banners and march against Xuzhou to attack Liu BeiThis Liu Dai had been Imperial Protector of Yanzhou but had surrendered to Cao Cao and entered Cao Caos service after the fall of the region Cao Cao had given him a rank as Supernumerary Leader and now was disposed to make use of himCao Cao himself took command of a large army of two hundred thousand troops for a simultaneous attack on Yuan Shao at LiyangAdviser Cheng Yu said The two Liu Dai and Wang Zhong sent against Liu Bei are unequal to their task I know said Cao CaoThey are not meant to fight Liu Bei it is merely a feintThey have orders not to make any real attack till I have overcome Yuan ShaoThen Liu Bei will be next Liu Dai and Wang Zhong went their way and Cao Cao marched out his grand army which came into touch with the enemy then thirty miles distant at Liyang Both sides made fortified camps and waited watching each otherThis went on for two months of the autumnThere was dissension in Yuan Shaos camp Xu You was at enmity with his colleague Shen Pei who was in commanding position and the strategist Ju Shou resented the rejection of his plan So they would not attack Yuan Shao also could not make up his mind Tired of this state of inaction Cao Cao then gave orders to his commandersZang Ba was to continue the pressure on Qingzhou and Xuzhou Yu Jin and Li Dian to deploy troops along the Yellow River Cao Ren to quarter the main force at GuanduThen Cao Cao with an army marched back to Capital XuchangThe five legions sent against Liu Bei went into camp thirtyfive miles from Xuzhou The camp made an imposing display of the banners of the Prime Minister but no attacks followed Their spies were very busy north of the river to get news of Cao Caos movement On the defensive side Liu Bei as he was uncertain of the strength of the force against him dared not moveSuddenly orders came for the Cao Caos army to attack and then discord showed itselfLiu Dai said The Prime Minister orders an attack you advance Wang Zhong replied You were named first I am the CommanderinChief it is not my place to go first I will go with you in joint command said Wang ZhongLet us cast lots and he upon whom the lot falls must go said Liu DaiThey drew lots and it fell to Wang Zhong who advanced toward Xuzhou with half the forceWhen Liu Bei heard of the threatened attack he called Chen Deng to consult Liu Bei said There is dissension in Yuan Shaos camp at Liyang so they do not advanceWe do not know where Cao Cao is but his own banner is not displayed in his Liyangs camp Why then is it shown here Chen Deng replied His tricks take a hundred forms It must be that he regards the north as more important and has gone there to look after its defenseHe dares not show his flag there and I feel sure it is only meant to mislead usHe is not here Liu Bei then asked whether one of his brothers would find out the truth and Zhang Fei volunteered to go I fear you are unsuited for this said Liu BeiYou are too impetuous If Cao Cao is there I will haul him over here said Zhang FeiLet me go first and find out said Guan YuIf you go I shall feel more at ease said Liu BeiSo Guan Yu set out with three thousand soldiers to reconnoiterIt was then early winter and snow was falling from a gloomy sky They marched regardless of the snow and came near Wang Zhongs camp with arms all ready to attackGuan Yu summoned Wang Zhong to a parleyThe Prime Minister is here why do you not surrender said Wang ZhongBeg him to come to the front for I would speak with him replied Guan YuIs he likely to come out to see such as you said Wang ZhongGuan Yu angrily dashed forward and Wang Zhong set his spear to meet himGuan Yu rode till he came close to his antagonist then suddenly wheeled awayWang Zhong went after him and followed up a slopeJust as they passed the crest Guan Yu suddenly wheeled again shouted and came on flourishing the mighty swordWang Zhong could not withstand that and fled But Guan Yu changing the huge sword to his left hand with his right laid hold of his victim by the straps of his breastplate lifted him out of the saddle and rode away to his own lines with the captive laid across the pommel of his saddleWang Zhongs army scatteredThe captive was sent to Xuzhou where he was summoned into the presence of Liu BeiWho are youWhat office do you holdHow dare you falsely display the ensigns of the Prime Minister said Liu BeiWhat do you mean by falsely when I simply obeyed my orders said Wang ZhongMy master wanted to produce the impression that he was presentReally he was not there Liu Bei treated him kindly giving him food and clothing but put him in prison till his colleague could be capturedGuan Yu said to Liu Bei I knew you had peaceful intentions in your mind therefore I captured Wang Zhong instead of slaying him I was afraid of Zhang Feis hasty and impulsive temper said Liu Bei He would have slain this man So I could not send himThere is no advantage in killing persons of this sort and while alive they are often useful in amicable settlements Here Zhang Fei said You have got this Wang Zhong now I will go and get the other man Be careful said Liu BeiLiu Dai was once Imperial Protector of Yanzhou and he was one of the nobles who met at Tiger Trap Pass to destroy Dong Zhuo He is not to be despised I do not think him worth talking about so muchI will bring him in alive just as Second Brother did this other I fear that if his life be lost it may upset our designs said Liu BeiIf I kill him I will forfeit my own life said Zhang FeiSo he was given three thousand soldiers and went off quicklyThe capture of his colleague made Liu Dai careful He strengthened his defenses and kept behind themHe took no notice of the daily challenges and continual insults which began with Zhang Feis arrivalAfter some days Zhang Fei evolved a ruseHe issued orders to prepare to rush the enemys camp at night but he himself spent the day drinking Pretending to be very intoxicated he held a courtmartial and one soldier was severely flogged for a breach of discipline The man was left bound in the midst of the camp Zhang Fei saying Wait till I am ready to start tonight you shall be sacrificed to the flag At the same time he gave secret orders to the custodians to let the man escapeThe man found his opportunity crept out of camp and went over to the enemy to whom he betrayed the plan of a night attackAs the man bore signs of savage punishment Liu Dai was the more disposed to credit his desertion and tale and Liu Dai made his arrangements putting the greater part of his troops in ambush outside his camp so that it was emptyThat night having divided his army into three parties Zhang Fei went to attack the camp A few men were ordered to advance directly dash in and set fire goingTwo larger bodies of troops were to go round to the rear of the camp and attack when they saw the fire well startedAt the third watch Zhang Fei with his veterans went to cut off Liu Dais road to the rearThe thirty men told off to start a conflagration made their way into the camp and were successfulWhen the flames arose the ambushing troops rushed out but only to find themselves attacked on both sidesThis confused them and as they knew nothing of the number of their assailants they were panic stricken and scatteredLiu Dai with a company of footmen got clear of the fight and fled but he went straight toward Zhang Fei Escape was impossible and the two men rode up each to attack the other Zhang Fei captured his opponent and the men surrendered Zhang Fei sent news of this success to his brothersLiu Bei said Hitherto Zhang Fei has been rather violent but this time he has acted wisely and I am very pleased They rode out to welcome Zhang FeiYou said I was too rough how now said Zhang Fei to his brothers If I had not put you on your mettle you would not have evolved this stratagem said Liu BeiZhang Fei laughedThen appeared the captive Liu Dai in bonds Liu Bei at once dismounted and loosed the cords saying My young brother was rather hasty but you must pardon him So Liu Dai was freedHe was taken into the city his colleague was released and both were cared for Liu Bei said to them I could not help putting Imperial Protector Deputy Che Zhou to death when he tried to kill me but Cao Cao took it as disaffection and sent you two generals to punish meI have received much kindness from him and certainly would not show ingratitude by killing youI wish you to speak for me and explain when you get back We are deeply grateful that you spare our lives and we will certainly do so in gratitude for what our wives and children owe you Next day the two leaders and their army were allowed to depart unscathed But before they had got three miles from the boundary they heard a mighty shouting and there appeared Zhang Fei barring the road My brother made a mistake in letting you go he did not understandHow could he give freedom to two rebels This made the two men quake with fear but as the fierce eyed warrior with uplifted sword was bearing down upon them they heard another man galloping up and shouting Do not behave so disgracefully The newcomer was Guan Yu and his appearance relieved the unhappy men of all fearWhy do you stop them since our brother set them free cried Guan YuIf they are let go today they will surely come back cried Zhang FeiWait till they do then you may kill them replied Guan YuThe two leaders with one voice cried Even if the Prime Minister slay our whole clans we will never come againWe pray you pardon us Said Zhang Fei If Cao Cao himself had come I would have slain him Not a breastplate should have gone backBut for this time I leave you your heads Clapping their hands to their heads the two men scuttled off while the two brothers returned to the cityCao Cao will certainly come said Guan Yu and Zhang FeiSun Qian said This is not a city that can hold out for longWe should send part of our forces to Xiaopei and guard Xiapi as a corner stone of our position Liu Bei agreed and told off Guan Yu to guard Xiapi whither he also sent his two wives Lady Gan and Lady MiThe former was a native of Xiapi the latter was Mi Zhus younger sisterSun Qian Jian Yong Mi Zhu and Mi Fang were left to defend Xuzhou and Liu Bei with Zhang Fei went to XiaopeiThe two released leaders Liu Dai and Wang Zhong hastened home to Cao Cao and explained to him that Liu Bei was not disaffectedBut their master was exceeding angry with them crying You shameful traitors what use are you He roared to the guards to take them away to instant executionHow can a hare or a deer expect To conquer in tiger strife Minnows and shrimps that with dragons contend Already have done with lifeThe fate of the two leaders will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER  Mi Heng Slips His Garment And Rails At Traitors Ji Ping Pledges To Kill The Prime MinisterAt the close of the last chapter the two unsuccessful leaders Liu Dai and Wang Zhong were in danger of deathHowever Kong Rong remonstrated with Cao Cao saying You knew these two were no match for Liu Bei and if you put them to death because they failed you will lose the hearts of your people Wherefore the death sentence was not executed but they were deprived of rank and status Cao Cao next proposed to lead an army himself to attack Liu Bei but Kong Rong advised The weather is too inclement We must wait the return of springIn the interval we better use the time to arrange peace with Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao before launching an expedition against Xuzhou Wherefore Liu Ye was sent to Zhang Xiu and in due time reached XiangyangHe first had an interview with Jia Xu Zhang Xius adviser whereat he dwelt upon Cao Caos virtues so that Jia Xu was impressed kept him as a guest and undertook to smooth his waySoon after Liu Ye saw Zhang Xiu and spoke of the advantages of coming to terms with Cao CaoWhile the discussion was in progress a messenger from Yuan Shao was announced and he was called inHe presented letters and when they also proposed terms of peace Jia Xu asked what their success had been lately against Cao CaoThe war had ceased for the moment on account of the winter replied the messengerAs you General and Liu Biao are both well reputed officers of the state I have been sent to request your help Jia Xu laughed You can return to your master and say that as he could not brook rivalry of his brother he certainly would be sorely put to it with that of all the officers of the state The letter was torn into fragments before the messengers face and he was angrily bidden be gone But his master Yuan Shao is stronger than Cao Cao protested Zhang XiuYou have torn up his letter and are dismissing his manWhat shall we say about such an insult should Yuan Shao come Better join hands with Cao Cao said Jia XuBut there is still between us an unavenged enmity we could not suffer each other Jia Xu said There are three advantages in joining hands with Cao Cao First he has a command from the Emperor to restore peaceSecond as Yuan Shao is so strong our little help to him will be despised while we shall loom large and be well treated by Cao CaoThird Cao Cao is going to be Chief of the Feudal Lords and he will ignore all private feuds in order to show his magnanimity to all the worldI hope General you will see these things clearly and hesitate no longer Zhang Xiu now convinced became more reasonable and recalled Liu Ye who at the interview extolled the many virtues of his masterIf the Prime Minister had any thought of the old quarrel he would hardly have sent me to make friendly engagements would he said Liu Ye at the lastSo Zhang Xiu and his adviser proceeded to the capital where formal submission was madeAt the interview Zhang Xiu bowed low at the steps but Cao Cao hastening forward took him by the hand and raised him saying Forget that little fault of mine I pray you General Zhang Xiu received the title of General Who Possesses Prowess and Jia Xu was appointed CounselorCao Cao then directed his secretaries to draft letters inviting the support of Liu BiaoJia Xu said Liu Biao loves to have to do with famous peopleIf some famous scholar should be sent to him he would submit forthwith So Cao Cao inquired of Xun You who was the best person to go as a messenger and he recommended Kong Rong Cao Cao agreed and sent Xun You to speak with this officerSo he went to Kong Rong saying A scholar of reputation is required to aid as a messenger of state can you undertake this task Kong Rong replied I have a certain friend Mi Heng whose talents are ten times mineHe ought to be constantly at the court of the Emperor and not merely be sent as a state messengerI will recommend him to the Emperor So Kong Rong wrote the following memorialIn ancient days when the great waters were abroad the emperor pondered over their regulation and he sought out people of talent from all directionsIn old time when Emperor Wu of the Hans desired to enlarge his borders crowds of scholars responded to his callIntelligent and holy Your Majesty ascended the throneYou have fallen upon evil days but have been diligent modest and untiring in your effortsNow the great mountains have sent forth spirits and people of genius appearI your humble servant know of a certain simple scholar Mi Heng by name of Pingyuan a young man of twentyfour His moral character is excellent his talents eminent As a youth he took a high place in study and penetrated the most secret arcane of learningWhat he glanced at he could repeat what he heard once he never forgotHe is naturally high principled and his thoughts are divineSang Hongyangs mental calculations and Zhang Anshis memorial feats compared with Mi Hengs powers are no longer wonderfulLoyal sincere correct and straightforward his ambition is unsulliedHe regards the good with trembling respect he detests the evil with uncompromising hatredRen Zuo in unflinching candor Shi Yu in severe rectitude never surpassed himHundreds of hawks are not worth one ospreyIf Mi Heng be given a court appointment notable results must followReady in debate rapid in utterance his overwhelming intelligence wells up in profusion in the solution of doubts and the unraveling of difficulties he has no peerIn former days of Han Jia Yi begged to be sent on trial to a vassal state for the control of the Xiongnu tribespeople Zhong Jun offered to bring back the Prince of Nanyue to do homage to the emperorThe generous conduct of these youths has been much admiredIn our day Lu Cui and Yan Xiang remarkable for their talents have been appointed among the secretariesAnd Mi Heng is no less capableShould he be got then all possibilities may be realized the dragon may curvet through the celestial streets and soar along the Milky Way fame will extend to the poles of the universe and hang in the firmament with rainbow gloryHe would be the glory of all the present Ministers and enhance the majesty of the Palace itselfThe Music will acquire new beauties and the Palace will contain an excellent treasurePeople like Mi Heng are but fewAs in the recitation of Ji Chu Songs and the singing of Yang E Poems the most skillful performers are sought and such fleet horses as Fei Tu Broncos and Yao Miao Mustangs were looked for by the famous judges of horses Wang Liang and Bo Le so I the humble one dare not conceal this manYour Majesty is careful in the selection of servants and should try himLet him be summoned as he is simply clad in his serge dress and should he not appear worthy then may I be punished for the fault of deception The Emperor read the memorial and passed it to his Prime Minister who duly summoned Mi HengHe came but after his formal salutations were over he was left standing and not invited to sit downLooking up to heaven he sighed deeply saying Wide as is the universe it cannot produce the person Under my orders are scores of people whom the world call heroes What do you mean by saying there is not the person said Cao CaoI should be glad to hear who they are said Mi HengXun Yu Xun You Guo Jia and Cheng Yu are all people of profound skill and long views superior to Xiao He and Chen PingZhang Liao Xu Chu Li Dian and Yue Jin are bravest of the brave better than Cen Peng and Ma WuLu Qian and Man Chong are my secretaries Yu Jin and Xu Huang are my van leaders Xiahou Dun is one of the worlds marvels Cao Ren is the most successful leader of the ageNow say you there are not the people Sir you are quite mistaken said Mi Heng with a smile I know all these things you call peopleXun Yu is qualified to pose at a funeral or ask after a sick man Xun You is fit to be a tomb guardian Cheng Yu might be sent to shut doors and bolt windows and Guo Jia is a reciter of poems Zhang Liao might beat drums and clang gongs Xu Chu might lead cattle to pasture Yue Jin would make a fair reader of elegy Li Dian could carry dispatches and notices Lu Qian would be a fair armorer Man Chong could be sent to drink wine and eat brewers grains Yu Jin might be of use to carry planks and build walls Xu Huang might be employed to kill pigs and slay dogs Xiahou Dun should be styled Whole Body General and Cao Ren should be called Moneygrubbing Governor As for the remainder they are mere clothes shelves rice sacks wine vases flesh bags And what special gifts have you said Cao Cao angrily I know everything in heaven above and the earth beneathI am conversant with the Three Religions and the Nine Systems of Philosophy I could make my prince the rival of Kings Yao and Shun Can I discuss on even terms with common people Now Zhang Liao was present and he raised his sword to strike down the impudent visitor who spoke thus to his master but Cao Cao said I want another drummer boy to play on occasions of congratulation in the courtI will confer this office upon him Instead of indignantly declining this Mi Heng accepted the position and went outHe spoke very impertinently said Zhang Liao why did you not put him to death He has something of a reputation empty but people have heard of him and so if I put him to death they would say I was intolerantAs he thinks he has ability I have made him a drummer to mortify him Soon after Cao Cao instituted a banquet in the capital at which the guests were manyThe drums were to be played and the old drummers were ordered to wear new clothesBut the new drummer Mi Heng took his place with the other musicians clad in old and worn garmentsThe piece chosen was the Tolling of Yuyang and from the earliest taps on the drum the effect was exquisite profound as the notes from metal and stoneThe performance stirred deeply the emotions of every guest some even shed tearsSeeing all eyes turned on the shabby performer the attendants said Why did you not put on your new uniform Mi Heng turned to them slipped off his frayed and torn robe and stood there in full view naked as he was bornThe assembled guests covered their faces Then the drummer composedly drew on his nether garmentsWhy do you behave so rudely at court said Cao CaoTo flout ones prince and insult ones superiors is the real rudeness cried Mi HengI bare my natural body as an emblem of my purity So you are pureAnd who is foul You do not distinguish between the wise and the foolish which is to have foul visionYou have never read the Odes or the Histories which is to have foul speechYou are deaf to honest words which is to have foul earsYou are unable to reconcile antiquity with today which is to be foul withoutYou cannot tolerate the nobles which is to be foul withinYou harbor thoughts of rebellion which is to have a foul heartI am one of the most famous scholars in the empire and you make me a drummer boy that is as Yang Huo belittling Confucius or Zang Cang vilifying MenciusYou desire to be chief and arbitrator of the great nobles yet you treat me thus Now Kong Rong who had recommended Mi Heng for employment was among the guests and he feared for the life of his friend Wherefore he tried to calm the stormMi Heng is only guilty of a misdemeanor like Fu Yue cried Kong RongHe is not a man likely to disturb your dreams Illustrious Sir Pointing to Mi Heng the Prime Minister said I will send you to Jingzhou as my messenger and if Liu Biao surrender to me I will give you a post at court But Mi Heng was unwilling to goSo Cao Cao bade two of his men prepare three horses and they set Mi Heng on the middle one and dragged him along the road between themIt is also related that a great number of officers of all ranks assembled at the East Fritillary Gate to see the messenger startXun Yu said When Mi Heng comes we will not rise to salute him So when Mi Heng came dismounted and entered the waiting room they all sat stiff and silentMi Heng uttered a loud cryWhat is that for said Xun YuShould not one cry out when one enters a coffin said Mi HengWe may be corpses shouted they altogether but you are a wandering headless ghost I am a minister of Han and not a partisan of Cao Caos cried Mi HengYou cannot say I have no head They were angry enough to kill him but Xun Yu checked them saying He is a paltry fellow it is not worth soiling your blades with his blood I am paltry and yet I have the soul of a man and you are mere worms said Mi HengThey went their ways all very angryMi Heng went on his journey and presently reached Jingzhou where he saw Liu BiaoAfter that under pretense of extolling Liu Biaos virtue he lampooned Liu Biao who was annoyed and sent him to Jiangxia to see Huang ZuWhy did you not put the fellow to death for lampooning you said one to Liu BiaoYou see he shamed Cao Cao but Cao Cao did not kill him as Cao Cao feared to lose popular favorSo Cao Cao sent him to me thinking to borrow my hand to slay him and so suffer the loss of my good nameI have sent him on to Huang Zu to let Cao Cao see that I understood Liu Biaos clever caution met with general praise At that time a messenger from Yuan Shao was also there with certain proposals for an alliance and it was necessary to decide which aide to espouseAll the advisers came together to consider the question Then Commander Han Song said As you have now two offers you can please yourself and choose your own way to destroy your enemies for if one refuses you can follow the other Now Cao Cao is an able general and has many capable officers in his trainIt looks as though he may destroy Yuan Shao and then move his armies across the river I fear my lord you would be unable then to withstand himThat being so it would be wise to support Cao Cao who will treat you with respect Liu Biao replied You go to the capital and see how things tendThat will help me to decide Han Song said The positions of master and servant are clearly definedNow I am your man prepared to go all lengths for you and obey you to the last whether in serving the Emperor or in following Cao CaoBut lest there should be any doubt you must remember that if the Emperor gives me any office then I shall become his servant and shall not be ready to face death for you You go and find out what you canI have ideas in my mind So Han Song took his leave and went to the capital where he saw Cao CaoCao Cao gave him rank and made him Governor of LinglingAdviser Xun Yu remonstrated saying This man came to spy out how things were moving He has done nothing to deserve reward and yet you give him an office like this There were no such suspicious rumors connected with poor Mi Heng and yet you sent him off and would never test his power Mi Heng shamed me too deeply before all the world I am going to borrow Liu Biaos hand to remove him And you need say no more said Cao CaoThen Cao Cao sent Han Song back to his former master to tell him what had happenedHan Song came and was full of praise for the virtues of the court and was keen on persuading Liu Biao to espouse that side Then Liu Biao suddenly turned angry charged him with treachery put him in prison and threatened him with death You turn your back on me cried Han SongI did not betray you Kuai Liang remarked Han Song had foretold this possibility before he left it is only what he expected Liu Biao who was just and reasonable went no furtherPresently came the news that Mi Heng had been put to death by Huang Zu on account of a quarrel begun over the wine cups Both being worse for liquor they had begun to discuss the worth of peopleYou were in Xuchang said Huang ZuWho was there of worth The big boy was Kong Rong and the little one Yang XiuThere was no one else to count What am I like said Huang ZuYou are like a god in a temple you sit still and receive sacrifice but the lack of intelligence is pitiful Do you regard me as a mere image cried Huang Zu angrily So Huang Zu put the impudent speaker to deathEven at the very point of death Mi Heng never ceased his railing and abuse Alas sighed Liu Biao when he heard Mi Hengs fate Then Liu Biao had the victim honorably interred near Yingwu on Parrot Island And a later poet wrote of Mi Heng Huang Zu could brook no rival at his word Mi Heng met death beneath the cruel swordHis grave on Parrot Isle may yet be seen The river flowing past it coldly greenCao Cao heard of the young mans death with pleasure The putrid bookworm has just cut himself up with his own sharp tongue said heAs there was no sign of Liu Biao coming to join him Cao Cao began to think of coercion Xun Yu dissuaded him from this courseSaid he Yuan Shao is not subjugated Liu Bei is not destroyed To attack Liu Biao would be to neglect the vital to care for the immaterialDestroy the two chief enemies first and the Han River is yours at one blow And Cao Cao took the adviceAfter the departure of Liu Bei Dong Cheng and his fellow conspirators did nothing else day or night but try to evolve plans for the destruction of Cao Cao But they could see no chance to attackAt the new year audience Cao Cao was odiously arrogant and overweening and the chief conspirators disgust was so intense that he fell illHearing of the State Uncles indisposition the Emperor sent the Court Physician to see himThe Court Physician at this time was a native of Luoyang named Ji Ping A very famous physician Ji Ping devoted himself wholly to the treatment of his court patientLiving in Dong Chengs palace and seeing Dong Cheng at all times Ji Ping soon found that some secret grief was sorely troubling him But Ji Ping dared not ask questionsOne evening of the full moon festival when the physician was just taking his leave Dong Cheng kept him and the two men had supper togetherThey eat talking for some time and Dong Cheng by and by dropped off to sleep dressed as he was Presently Wang Zifu and the others were announcedAs they were coming in Wang Zifu cried Our business is settled I should be glad to hear how said Dong ChengLiu Biao has joined Yuan Shao and five hundred thousand troops in fifty legions are on their way here by different routesMore than this Ma Teng and Han Sui are coming from the northwest with seven hundred thousand Xiliang troopsCao Cao has moved every soldier outside Xuchang to meet the combined armiesThere is a great banquet in the Palace tonight and if we get together our young men and servants we can muster more than a thousand and we can surround the Palace while Cao Cao is at the banquet and finish him off We must not miss this Dong Cheng was more than delightedHe called his servants and armed them put on his own armor and mounted his horse The conspirators met as they had arranged just at the inner gate of the Prime Ministers palace It was the first watch The small army marched straight in Dong Cheng leading with his treasured sword drawn His intended victim was at table in one of the private roomsDong Cheng rushed in crying Cao Cao you rebel stay and dashed at Cao Cao who fell at the first blowAnd just then he woke up and found it was all a dream but his mouth was still full of cursesDo you really wish to destroy Cao Cao said Ji Ping going forward to his half awakened patient This brought Dong Cheng to his sensesHe stopped terror stricken and made no replyDo not be frightened O Uncle said the doctorAlthough I am a physician I am also a man and I never forget my emperorYou have seemed sad for many days but I have never ventured to ask the reasonNow you have shown it in your dream and I know your real feelingsIf I can be of any use I will helpNothing can daunt me Dong Cheng covered his face and wept I fear you may not be true to me cried heJi Ping at once bit off a finger as a pledge of his faithAnd then his host and patient brought forth the decree he had received in the girdle I am afraid our schemes will come to nought said Dong ChengLiu Bei and Ma Teng are gone and there is nothing we can doThat was the real reason I fell ill It is not worth troubling you gentlemen with for Cao Caos life lies in these hands of mine said Ji PingHow can that be Because he is often ill with deepseated pain in his head When this comes on he sends for meWhen next he calls me I only have to give him one dose and he will certainly die We do not want any weapons If only you could do itYou would be the savior of the dynasty it depends upon you Then Ji Ping went away leaving his late patient a happy manDong Cheng strolled into the garden and there he saw one of his servants Quin Quington whispering with one of the concubines Yun Ying in a dark cornerThis annoyed him and he called his attendants to seize themHe would have put them to death but for the intervention of his wife At her request he spared their lives but both were beaten forty canes and the lad was thrown into a dungeonSulky at this treatment Quin Quington broke out of the cell in the night climbed over the wall and went straight to Cao Caos palace where he betrayed the conspiracyCao Cao at once had him taken into a secret chamber and questioned himQuin Quington gave the names of the conspirators saying Wang Zifu Wu Zilan Chong Ji Wu Shi Ma Teng and my master have been meeting secretlyMy master has a roll of white silk with writing on it but I do not know what it meansYesterday Ji Ping bit off one of his fingers as a pledge of fidelityI saw that Quin Quington was kept in a secret part of the palace while his late master Dong Cheng only knowing that he had run away took no special means to find himSoon after this Cao Cao feigned a headache and sent for Ji Ping as usualThe rebel is done for thought Ji Ping and he made a secret package of poison which he took with him to the palace of the Prime MinisterHe found Cao Cao in bed The patient bade the doctor prepare a potion for himOne draught will cure this disease said Ji PingHe bade them bring him a pot and he prepared the potion in the roomWhen it had simmered for some time and was half finished the poison was added and soon after the physician presented the draughtCao Cao knowing it was poisoned made excuses and would not swallow itYou should take it hot said the doctor Then there will be a gentle perspiration and you will be better You are a scholar said Cao Cao sitting up and know what is the correct thing to doWhen the master is ill and takes drugs the attendant first tastes them when a man is ill his son first tastes the medicineYou are my confidant and should drink firstThen I will swallow the remainder Medicine is to treat disease what is the use of any ones tasting it said Ji PingBut he guessed now the conspiracy had been discovered so he dashed forward seized Cao Cao by the ear and tried to pour the potion down his throat Cao Cao pushed it away and it spiltThe bricks upon which it fell were split asunderBefore Cao Cao could speak his servants had already seized the assailantSaid Cao Cao I am not ill I only wanted to test youSo you really thought to poison me He sent for a score of sturdy gaolers who carried off the prisoner to the inner apartments to be interrogatedCao Cao took his seat in a pavilion and the hapless physician tightly bound was thrown to the ground before him The prisoner maintained a bold frontCao Cao said I thought you were a physician how dared you try to poison me Some one incited you to this crime and if you tell me I will pardon you You are a rebel you flout your Prince and injure your bettersThe whole empire wishes to kill you Do you think I am the only one Cao Cao again and again pressed the prisoner to tell what he knew but he only replied that no one had sent him it was his own desireI have failed and I can but die added Ji PingCao Cao angrily bade the gaolers give him a severe beating and they dogged him for two watchesHis skin hung in tatters the flesh was battered and the blood from his wounds ran down the stepsThen fearing he might die and his evidence be lost Cao Cao bade them cease and remove him They took him off to a quiet place where he might recover somewhatHaving issued orders to prepare a banquet for next day Cao Cao invited all the courtiers theretoDong Cheng was the only one who excused himself saying he was unwellThe other conspirators dared not stay away as they felt they would be suspected Tables were laid in the private apartments and after several courses the host said There is not much to amuse us today but I have a man to show you that will sober you Bring him in Cao Cao said turning to the gaolers and the hapless Ji Ping appeared securely fastened in a wooden collarHe was placed where all could see himYou officials do not know that this man is connected with a gang of evil doers who desire to overturn the government and even injure meHowever Heaven has defeated their plans but I desire that you should hear his evidence Then Cao Cao ordered the gaolers to beat their prisonerThey did so till Ji Ping lay unconscious when they revived him by spraying water over his faceAs soon as he came to he glared at his oppressor and ground his teeth Cao Cao you rebel What are you waiting forWhy not kill me cried Ji PingCao Cao replied The conspirators were only six at first you made the seventhIs that true Here the prisoner broke in with more abuse while Wang Zifu and the other three conspirators exchanged glances looking as though they were sitting on a rug full of needlesCao Cao continued his torture of the prisoner beating him into unconsciousness and reviving him with cold water the victim disdaining to ask mercyFinally Cao Cao realized he would incriminate none of his accomplices and so he told the gaolers to remove Ji PingAt the close of the banquet when the guests were dispersing four of them the four conspirators were invited to remain behind to supperThey were terrified so that their souls seemed no longer to inhabit their bodies but there was no saying nay to the invitationPresently Cao Cao said Still there is something I want to speak about so I have asked you to stay for a time longerI do not know what you four have been arranging with Dong Cheng Nothing at all said Wang ZifuAnd what is written on the white silk asked Cao Cao They all said they knew nothing about itThen Cao Cao ordered the runaway servant to be brought inAs soon as Quin Quington came Wang Zifu said Well what have you seen and where Quin Quington replied You five very carefully chose retired places to talk in and you secretly signed a white rollYou cannot deny that Wang Zifu replied This miserable creature was punished for misbehavior with one of Uncle Dong Chengs maids and now because of that he slanders his master You must not listen to him Ji Ping tried to pour poison down my throatWho told him to do that if it was not Dong Cheng said Cao CaoThey all said they knew nothing about who it wasSo far said Cao Cao matters are only beginning and there is a chance of forgiveness But if the thing grows it will be difficult not to take notice of it The whole four vigorously denied that any plot existedHowever Cao Cao called up his henchmen and the four men were put into confinementNext day Cao Cao with a large following went to the State Uncles palace to ask after his healthDong Cheng came out to receive his visitor who at once said Why did you not come last night I am not quite well yet and have to be very careful about going out replied Dong ChengOne might say you were suffering from national sorrow eh said Cao CaoDong Cheng startedCao Cao continued Have you heard of the Ji Ping affair No what is it Cao Cao smiled coldly saying How can it be you do not know He turned to his attendants and told them to bring in the prisoner while he went on talking to his host about national illness Dong Cheng was much put about and knew not what to doSoon the gaolers led in the physician to the steps of the hallAt once the bound man began to rail at Cao Cao as rebel and traitorThis man said Cao Cao pointing to Ji Ping has implicated Wang Zifu and three others all of whom are now under arrestThere is one more whom I have not caught yet Who sent you to poison me continued Cao Cao turning toward the physicianQuick tell me Heaven sent me to slay a traitor Cao Cao angrily ordered them to beat Ji Ping again but there was no part of his body that could be beatenDong Cheng sat looking at him his heart feeling as if transfixed with a daggerYou were born with ten fingers how is it you have now only nine Ji Ping replied I bit off one as a pledge when I swore to slay a traitor Cao Cao told them to bring a knife and they lopped off his other nine fingersNow they are all off that will teach you to make pledges Still I have a mouth that can swallow a traitor and a tongue that can curse him said Ji PingCao Cao told them to cut out his tongueJi Ping said Do notI cannot endure any more punishment I shall have to speak outLoosen my bonds Loose them There is no reason why not said Cao CaoThey loosed himAs soon as he was free Ji Ping stood up turned his face toward the Emperors palace and bowed saying It is Heavens will that thy servant has been unable to remove the evil Then he turned and smashed his head into the steps and diedHis body was quartered and exposedThis happened in the first month of the fifth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  and a certain historian wrote a poem There lived in Han a simple physician No warrior yet brave Enough to risk his very life His Emperor to saveHe failed but lasting fame Is his he feared not death He cursed the traitorous Prime Minister Unto his latest breathSeeing his victim had passed beyond the realm of punishment Cao Cao had Quin Quington led inDo you know this man Uncle Yes cried Dong ChengSo the runaway servant is here he ought to be put to death He just told me of your treachery he is my witness said Cao CaoWho would dare kill him How can you the First Minister of State heed the unsupported tale of an absconding servant But I have Wang Zifu and the others in prison said Cao CaoAnd how can you rebut their evidence He then called in the remainder of his followers and ordered them to search Dong Chengs bedroom They did so and found the decree that had been given him in the girdle and the pledge signed by the conspirators You mean rat cried Cao Cao You dared do this He gave orders to arrest the whole household without exceptionThen he returned to his palace with the incriminating documents and called all his advisers together to discuss the dethronement of the Emperor and the setting up of a successorMany decrees blood written have issued accomplishing nothing One inscribed pledge was fraught with mountains of sorrowThe reader who wishes to how the fate of the Emperor must read the next chapter CHAPTER Cao Cao Murdered The Consort Dong Liu Bei Flees To Yuan Shao The last chapter closed with the discovery of the girdle decree and the assembly of Cao Caos advisers to consider the deposition of Emperor Xian Cheng Yu spoke strongly against this saying Illustrious Sir the means by which you impress the world and direct the government is the command of the House of Han In these times of turmoil and rivalry among the nobles such a step as the deposition of the ruler will certainly bring about civil war and is much to be deprecated After reflection Cao Cao abandoned the project But Dong Chengs plot was not to go unpunishedAll five of the conspirators with every member of their households seven hundred at least were taken and put to death at one or another of the gates of the cityThe people wept at such merciless and wholesale slaughterA secret decree in a girdle sewn In red blood written the Emperors own To the staunch and faithful Dong Cheng addressed Who had saved him once when enemies pressedAnd who sore grieved at his Sovereigns fate Expressed in dreams his ceaseless hate Carried misfortune and death in its train But glory to him who died in vain Another poet wrote of the sad fate of Wang Zifu and his friendsGreatheartedly these signed the silken roll And pledged themselves to save their king from shameBlack death of them took heavy toll To write their names upon the roll of fameBut the slaughter of the conspirators and their whole households did not appease the wrath of the Prime Minister The Emperors consort was a sister of Dong Cheng and sword in hand Cao Cao went into the Palace determined to slay her alsoThe Emperor cherished her tenderly the more so as she was then in the fifth month of pregnancyThat day as they often did the Emperor Consort Dong and Empress Fu were sitting in their private apartment secretly talking of the decree entrusted to Dong Cheng and asking each other why nothing seemed to have been doneThe sudden appearance of the angry Prime Minister armed as he was frightened them greatlyDoes Your Majesty know that Dong Cheng conspired against me said heDong Zhuo died long ago replied the EmperorNot Dong ZhuoDong Cheng roared Cao CaoThe Emperors heart trembled but he gasped out Really I did not know So the cut finger and the blood written decree are all forgotten eh The Emperor was silentCao Cao bade his lictors seize Consort DongThe Emperor interposed asking pity for her conditionIf Heaven had not interposed and defeated the plot I should be a dead manHow could I leave this woman to work evil to me by and by Said the Emperor Immure her in one of the palaces till her confinementDo not harm her now Do you wish me to spare her offspring to avenge the mother said Cao Cao I pray that my body may be spared mutilation and not put to shame said Consort DongCao Cao bade his men show her the white silk cordThe Emperor wept bitterly Do not hate me in the below realms of the Nine Golden Springs said the Emperor to herHis tears fell like rainEmpress Fu also joined in the lament but Cao Cao said You are behaving like a lot of children And he told the lictors to take Consort Dong away and strangle her in the courtyard In vain had the fair girl found favor in the sight of her lord She died and the fruit of her womb perishedStern and calm her lord sat powerless to save Hiding his face while tears gushed forthWhen leaving the Palace Cao Cao gave strict orders to the keepers saying Any one of the imperial relatives by marriage who enter the Palace will be put to death and the guards will share the same punishment for lack of zeal To make more sure he appointed three thousand Imperial Guards from his own troops and appointed Cao Hong to the commandThen said Cao Cao to his counselor Cheng Yu The conspirators in the capital have been removed it is true but there are yet two others Ma Teng and Liu BeiThese must not be left Cheng Yu replied Ma Teng is strong in the west and would not be easily capturedHe might be enticed to the capital by suave words and kindly praises when he would be at your mercyLiu Bei is at Xuzhou strongly posted in an oxhorn formation and not to be lightly attackedMore than this Yuan Shao is at Guandu and his one desire is to attack youAny attempt on the east will send Liu Bei to Yuan Shao for help and Yuan Shao will come here at onceThen what will you do You are at fault replied Cao CaoLiu Bei is a bold warrior and if we wait till he is fully fledged and winged he will be more difficult to deal withYuan Shao may be strong but he is not to be fearedHe is too undeciding to act As they were discussing these things Guo Jia came in and Cao Cao suddenly referred the matter to himIf I attack Liu Bei then Yuan Shao is to be feared what do you think of it Guo Jia said Yuan Shao by nature is dilatory and hesitating and his various advisers are jealous of each other He is not to be fearedLiu Bei is getting together a new army and has not yet won their hearts You could settle the east in one battle This advice is in harmony with my thinking said Cao CaoAnd he prepared an army of two hundred thousand troops to move in five divisions against XuzhouScouts took the news of these preparations to Xuzhou Sun Qian first went to Xiapi to tell Guan Yu and then went to Xiaopei to tell Liu Bei The two discussed the position and decided that help must be soughtSo letters were written to Yuan Shao and given to Sun Qian who went north sought Tian Feng and asked him to arrange an interview with Yuan ShaoSun Qian was introduced and presented his lettersBut Yuan Shao was of melancholy countenance and his dress was all awryTian Feng said Why this disarray my lord I am about to die replied Yuan ShaoBut why do you utter such words I have three sons but only the youngest is clever enough to understand my ideasNow he is suffering from scabies which places his life in jeopardy Think you that I have any heart to talk over any other affairs But said Tian Feng the present combination of circumstances is unparalleled Cao Cao is going to attack the east and Xuchang will be emptyYou can enter it with a few volunteers and so perform good service to the Emperor and save the people from sorrowYou have only to make up your mind to act I know the chance is excellent but I am worried and distressed and fear failure What are you distressed about said Tian FengAmong my sons only this special one is remarkable and if anything happens I am done Thus it became evident that no army would be dispatchedIn confirmation of this Yuan Shao said to Sun Qian Go home and tell Liu Bei the real reason and say that if anything untoward happen he can come over to me and I will find some means of helping him Tian Feng struck the ground with his staffIt is such a pity cried heJust as a unique opportunity presents itself everything is spoiled by the illness of a child He went outSun Qian saw that no help could be hoped for and set out to return When he had arrived and related what he had seen Liu Bei was quite alarmed and asked what could be doneDo not be troubled Brother said Zhang FeiWe can destroy Cao Cao merely by a sudden attack before his army shall have time to camp That would be according to the rules of war said Liu BeiYou have always been a bold warrior and that move against Liu Dai shows that you are becoming a strategist too So Liu Bei gave Zhang Fei command of enough soldiers to carry out this planNow while Cao Cao was in the midst of his march toward Xiaopei a tornado sprang up and the howling gale tore down one of the banners and broke the staffCao Cao called together his advisers and leaders to ask them what this portendedXun Yu said From what direction was the wind at the time and what was the color of the flag The wind was from the southeast and the flag was blue and red There is only one interpretationA raid on the camp will occur tonight Cao Cao noddedAt that moment Mao Jie entered and reported a similar incident Cao Cao asked him the portentMy thinking tells me it means a night raid replied he Alas for the weakness of this descendant of kings He placed his faith on a night raidBut the broken staff of a banner warned his enemy Why should the ancient of days favor the wickedThis is evidently providence said Cao CaoAnd he began to make preparations He told off nine bodies of troops to take stations leaving only one of them as if camped while he placed the others in ambush at eight points There was but little moonlight as Liu Bei and Zhang Fei marched their respective armies toward Cao Caos campThey had left Sun Qian to guard XiaopeiZhang Fei since he was the originator of the stratagem led the way with some light horse As they drew near everything seemed very quiet and no one seemed moving Then suddenly lights flashed out all about them and Zhang Fei saw he had fallen into a trapAt once from all the eight directions came out the ambushing troops From east west north south were Zhang Liao Xu Chu Li Dian and Yu Jin From northeast northwest southeast southwest were Xiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Xu Huang and Yue Jin Zhang Fei dashing this way and rushing that guarding his van and protecting his rear vainly tried to clear himselfThe soldiers he had being originally Cao Caos troops soon gave in and returned to their old leader The position became very desperateZhang Fei met Xu Huang and engaged him but his rear was also attacked by Yue Jin At length he cut an arterial alley out and with a half score of his troops started to return to Xiaopei The retreat was cut offHe thought to make for Xuzhou but felt certain that way was also barredNo other way seemed open and so he made for the Mangdang Hills As Liu Bei drew near the camp he intended to attack when he heard the din of battle Then he was attacked in the rear and very soon had lost half his forceNext Xiahou Dun came to attack Thereupon Liu Bei boltedHe was pursued by Xiahou YuanPresently Liu Bei looked about him and found he had less than half a hundred soldiers following him He set his face in the direction of Xiaopei But before long Liu Bei saw that place was in flames So he changed his plan and went toward Xiapi However he found the whole countryside full of the enemy and he could not get throughSo he bethought himself of the promise of Yuan Shao that he would find refuge if things went unfavorable and determined to go to Yuan Shao till he could form some other planWherefore he took the Qingzhou roadBut it also was blocked and he went into the open country and made his way north not without being pursued and losing the remainder of his few followersHe hastened toward Qingzhou City traveling one hundred miles a dayWhen he reached the city and summoned the gate the guards asked who he was and they told the Governor who was Yuan Shaos eldest son Yuan TanYuan Tan was greatly surprised but he opened the gates and went to meet Liu Bei whom he treated with due considerationLiu Bei told the story of his defeat and said he wished for harborHe was given suitable quarters and hospitably entertained while the young man wrote to inform his fatherThen Yuan Tan provided an escort and sent Liu Bei on his journey as far as the boundary of Pingyuan At the city of Yejun Liu Bei was met by Yuan Shao in person ten miles outside the city with a great escortLiu Bei made a humble obeisance which Yuan Shao hastened to return and said I have been very distressed that on account of my sons illness I did not come to your aidIt is a great joy to see you the one desire of my life is satisfied Liu Bei replied The poor Liu Bei you see here has long desired to take refuge with you but fate has hitherto denied him that privilegeNow attacked by Cao Cao my family lost I remembered that you General would receive good people from all sidesWherefore I put my pride in my pocket I trust that I may be found worthy and one day I will prove my gratitude Yuan Shao received him with much pleasure and treated him exceedingly wellAnd they both lived in Yuan Shaos home region JizhouAfter the capture of Xiaopei Cao Cao pressed on toward Xuzhou City which after a short defense and the flight of Mi Zhu and Jian Yong was surrendered by Chen DengCao Cao led his army into the city restored order and pacified the people Next he wanted to press on to Xiapi where Guan Yu was holding out and keeping guard of Liu Beis familyXun Yu said Guan Yu is there in charge of his brothers family and he will defend the city to the lastIf you do not take it quickly Yuan Shao will get it Cao Cao said I have always loved Guan Yu both for his warlike abilities and his principles I would engage him to enter my serviceI would rather send some one to talk him into surrender He will not do that said Guo Jia his sense of right is too solidI fear any one who went to speak with him would suffer Then suddenly a man stepped out saying I know him slightly and I will go The speaker was Zhang LiaoCheng Yu looked at him and said Though you are an old acquaintance I do not think you are equal to talking over Guan YuBut I have a scheme that will so entangle him that he will have no alternative he will have to enter the service of the Prime Minister They set the fatal spring beside the lordly tigers trail They hide the hook with fragrant bait to catch the mighty whaleHow Guan Yu was to be entrapped will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER  Besieged In Tushan Mountains Guan Yu Makes Three Conditions The Rescue At Baima Cao Cao Is Released The plan to seduce Guan Yu from allegiance to his brothers was now announced by Cheng Yu Since Guan Yu is far braver than ordinary warriors he can only be overreached by superior cunningNow send some of the captured soldiers who have lately been of Liu Beis army into Xiapi where they shall say they have come back They shall thus be our allies on the inside Then an attack and a feigned defeat will entice Guan Yu to a distance from the cityAnd his return road shall be cut Cao Cao accepted the scheme and a few score of the troops who had lately been in Xuzhou were sent to the city Guan Yu believed the story they told and trusted them So they were suffered to remainAfter this part of the game had been played Xiahou Dun led forward five thousand troops against the cityAt first Guan Yu would not accept the challenge but provoked by men sent to hurl insults at him from the foot of the wall his wrath got the better of him and he moved out with three thousand troopsAfter the leaders had exchanged some ten bouts Xiahou Dun made to run away Guan Yu pursuedXiahou Dun stopped and made a stand then he fled again Thus alternately fighting and retiring he enticed Guan Yu seven miles from XiapiThen Guan Yu suddenly remembering the risk to the city drew off his army to return homewardSoon at the sound of a signal bomb from the left and right out moved two bodies of troops led by Xu Huang and Xu Chu who barred his way Guan Yu hastened along a road that seemed to offer retreat but from both sides his ambushing enemies shot their crossbows and the arrows flew like locusts on the wing No way past was found and he turned back Then both bodies joined in attacking himHe drove them off and got into the road to his own city but soon Xiahou Dun came up again and attacked fiercely as beforeEvening came and still Guan Yu was hemmed in so he went up on a low hill of Tushan Mountains upon which he encamped for a restGuan Yu was surrounded on all sides by enemies By and by looking toward his city he saw the glow of fire It meant that the traitors who had come in to surrender had opened the gate and the enemy had gone in forceThey had made the fires in order to perplex and distress Guan Yu and indeed the sight saddened him In the night he made efforts to escape from the hill but every attempt was checked by flights of arrowsAt daybreak he prepared for one more effort but before moving he saw a horseman riding up at full speed and presently discerned Zhang LiaoWhen within speaking distance Guan Yu said Are you come to fight me Zhang Liao No replied Zhang LiaoI am come to see you because of our old friendship Wherefore Zhang Liao threw aside his sword dismounted and came forward saluting And the two sat downThen naturally you have come to talk me over said Guan YuNot so said Zhang LiaoSometime ago you saved me can I help saving you Then you desire to help me Not exactly that replied Zhang LiaoThen what are you doing here if you have not come to help me Nothing is known of the fate of your elder brother nor whether your younger brother is alive or deadLast night your city fell into the hands of Cao Cao but neither soldiers nor people were harmed and a special guard was set over the family of Liu Bei lest they should be alarmedI came to tell you how well they had been treated This is certainly talking me over said Guan Yu Though escape is impossible yet I am not perturbedI look upon death as going homeYou would better depart quickly and let me go down and begin the struggle again Surely you must know everybody will ridicule you when they hear of this said Zhang LiaoI shall die for loyalty and righteousness Who will laugh said Guan YuYou would be guilty of three faults if you died Tell me them said Guan Yu First of all you and your elder brother pledged yourselves in the Peach Garden to die or to live togetherNow your brother has been defeated and you want to fight to the death Therefore if your brother appear again by and by and wants your help he will seek it in vain Is this anything else than betraying the Peach Garden OathSecondly you are in charge of your brothers family and if you fought and died the two women would be left forlorn and without a protector That would be a betrayal of trust Thirdly your military skill stands out conspicuous and will go down in historyIf you do not aid your brother in his noble attempt to maintain the dynasty then all your labors and sufferings will have been spent to win a worthless reputation as a valiant fool Where is the sense in thatI feel it my duty to point out these three faults to you Guan Yu remained silent and thought for some timeThen he said You have spoken of my three faults What do you desire You are surrounded with the certainty of death if you do not yieldThere is no advantage in a useless deathWherefore your best course is to yield to Cao Cao till you hear news of Liu Bei and can rejoin himThus you will ensure the safety of the two ladies and also keep inviolate the Peach Garden compact You will preserve a useful lifeBrother you must reflect on these things Brother you have spoken of three advantages now I have three conditionsIf the Prime Minister concede these then will I doff my armorIf he refuses then I prefer to be guilty of the three faults and die Why should the Prime Minister not concede them He is most liberal and large mindedI pray you let me hear your conditions The first is that as I and the Imperial Uncle have sworn to support the Hans I now submit to the Emperor and not to His Prime Minister Cao CaoThe second condition is that suitable provision be made for the two ladies under my care and that no one shall be allowed to approach themThe third is that I shall be allowed to set off to rejoin Uncle Liu Bei so soon as I shall hear where he is whether it be far or near I require all these to be satisfied failing a single one I will not submitWherefore Zhang Liao I pray you hasten back and announce them Zhang Liao lost no time but rode back to Cao CaoWhen he spoke of Guan Yus intention to submit to the Hans but not to Cao Cao the latter laughed saying As I am the Minister of Han so am I HanI grant that Zhang Liao then spoke of provision due to their rank and security from molestation for the ladies to which Cao Cao replied I will give them twice the regular amount for an Uncle of the Emperor as for securing them from molestation that is simpleThe ordinary domestic law is enoughWhy should there be any doubt Then said Zhang Liao Whenever he shall get news of the whereabouts of Liu Bei he must go to him At this Cao Cao shook his head saying Then I am merely to feed Guan Yu what is the use of thisI cannot consent Zhang Liao replied You must know of Yu Rangs saying the difference in behavior brought about by difference of treatmentLiu Bei treats Guan Yu just kindly and liberally you can surely engage Guan Yus heart and support by being kinder and more liberal What you say is much to the pointI will grant the three conditions said Cao CaoWhereupon Zhang Liao left to carry the news to Guan Yu still on the summit of the Tushan MountainsNow I expect the army to withdraw so that I may enter the city to tell the two ladies what has been arrangedAfter that I submit at once Zhang Liao rode back once more with this request and the order was given for the army to retire three milesDo not do this said Xun Yu I fear treachery He will certainly not break faith said Cao CaoHe is too high principled The army retired and Guan Yu with his force reentered the city of Xiapi where he saw that the people were following their ordinary avocations in tranquillityHe came to the palace and went in to see the two ladies who hastened to meet himHe bowed to them below the steps and said I apologize for having caused you to feel alarmed Where is the Uncle asked theyI know not whither he has gone What do you intend to do BrotherinLaw I went out of the city to try a last battleI was surrounded on a hill top and Zhang Liao has urged me to yield I proposed three conditions all of which were conceded and the enemy drew off to allow me to return to the cityUnless I have your decision SistersinLaw I scarcely dare to take any final step They asked what were the conditions and were toldLady Gan said When Cao Caos army came in we took it to mean certain deathBut it is scarcely credible that not a hair of our heads has been disturbed not a soldier has dared enter our doorsYou have accepted the conditions BrotherinLaw and there is no need to ask our consentOur only fear is that he will not let you go by and by to search for the Uncle SistersinLaw you need not be anxiousI will see to that You must decide everything and need not ask us Guan Yu withdrew and then with a small escort went to his interview with Cao CaoCao Cao came to the outermost gate to welcome him and Guan Yu dismounted and made obeisanceCao Cao returned his salute with the greatest cordialityThe leader of a defeated army is grateful for the graciousness that has preserved his life said Guan YuI have so long admired your loyalty and high principles that this happy meeting gratifies the desire of my whole life replied Cao CaoAs the Prime Minister has granted the three requests which my friend petitioned for on my behalf there is now but little to discuss said Guan YuAs I have spoken so be it I could not break faith replied Cao CaoWhenever I hear where Uncle Liu Bei is I must certainly go to him even if through fire and water It may be that there will be no time nor opportunity of saying farewellI trust you will understand the reason If Liu Bei should prove to be alive you must certainly be allowed to go to himBut I fear that in the confusion he may have lost his lifeYou may set your mind at rest and let me make inquiries Guan Yu thanked him Then a banquet was prepared in Guan Yus honorNext day the army started on its homeward marchFor the journey to the capital a carriage was prepared for the two ladies and Guan Yu was its guardOn the road they rested at a certain post station and Cao Cao anxious to compromise Guan Yu by beguiling him into forgetfulness of his duty assigned Guan Yu to the same apartment as his sistersinlawGuan Yu stood the whole night before the door with a lighted candle in his hand Not once did he yield to fatigueCao Caos respect for him could not but increaseAt the capital the Prime Minister assigned a dignified residence to Guan Yu which he immediately divided into two enclosures the inner one for the two ladies and the other for himself He placed a guard of eighteen of his veterans over the womens quartersGuan Yu was presented to Emperor Xian who conferred upon him the rank of General Who Serves the HansGuan Yu expressed his thanks to the EmperorNext day Cao Cao made a great banquet inviting all his advisers and officers solely in honor of Guan Yu who sat in the seat of honorBeside this Guan Yu received presents of silks and gold and silver vessels all of which Guan Yu sent into the ladies quarters for their use and keepingIn fact from the day of arrival in the capital Guan Yu was treated with marked respect and distinction small banquets following each other in each three days and large banquets held in each five daysCao Cao also presented him with ten most lovely serving girls Guan Yu sent these also within to wait upon his two sistersinlawEvery third day Guan Yu went to the door of the womens quarters to inquire after their welfare and then they asked if any news of the wanderer had come This ceremony closed with the wordsBrotherinLaw you may retire when you wish Cao Cao heard of this extremely correct behavior and thought all the more of the man for itOne day Cao Cao noticed that the robe Guan Yu was wearing was old and frayed Taking his measurements Cao Cao had a new one made of fine brocade and presented it to himGuan Yu took it and put it on under the old robe so that the latter covered itWhy so very thrifty laughed Cao CaoIt is not thrift was his replyThe old robe was a gift from my brother and I wear it because it reminds me of himI could not allow the new gift to eclipse his old one How very high principled said Cao Cao sighingOne day when Guan Yu was at home there came a messenger to say that the two women had thrown themselves on the ground and were weeping They would not say whyGuan Yu set his dress in order went over and knelt by the door saying Why this grief SistersinLaw Lady Gan replied In the night I dreamed that the Uncle had fallen into a pit I woke up and told Lady Mi and we think he must be deadSo we weep Dreams are not to be credited he repliedYou dreamed of him because you were thinking of himPray do not grieve Just then Guan Yu was invited to another banquet so he took leave of the ladies and wentSeeing Guan Yu looked sad and tearful his host asked the reasonMy sistersinlaw have been weeping for my brother and I cannot help being sad in sympathy Cao Cao smiled and tried to cheer up his guestCao Cao plied Guan Yu with wine so that Guan Yu became quite intoxicated and sat stroking his beard and saying What a useless thing am II could do no service for my country and I have parted from my elder brother How many hairs in your beard suddenly asked his hostSome hundreds perhapsIn the autumn a few fall out but in the winter it is fullest Then I use a black silk bag to keep the hairs from being broken replied Guan YuCao Cao had a bag made for him to protect his beardSoon after when they were at court the Emperor asked what was the bag he saw on Guan Yus breastMy beard is rather long Your Majesty said Guan YuSo the Prime Minister gave me a bag to protect it The Emperor bade him take off the bag and show his beard in all its fullness and it fell in rippling waves below his breastReally a most beautiful beard said the EmperorThis is why people call himThe Man with the Beautiful Beard Another time after a banquet Cao Cao was seeing his guest start from the gate of his palace when he noticed that his charger was very thin Why is it so thin said Cao CaoMy worthless body is rather heavy and really too much for itIt is always out of condition Cao Cao at once told his attendants to bring out a certain steed and before long it appearedIt was red like glowing charcoal and a handsome creature in every wayDo you recognize it asked Cao CaoWhy it is no other than RedHare cried Guan YuYes it is RedHare said Cao CaoAnd he presented the horse all fully caparisoned to his guestGuan Yu bowed many times and thanked him again and again till Cao Cao began to feel displeased and said I have given you many things lovely handmaids and gold and silks and never won a bow of gratitude from you beforeThis horse seems to please you better than all the restWhy do you think so poorly of the damsels and so much of the steed I know the horse it can travel five hundred miles a day and I am very lucky to get him Now as soon as I find out where my brother is I can get to him in a single day said Guan YuCao Cao grumbled to himself and began to repent of his gift Fortune dealt a stunning blow still he played his part Partitioning his dwelling proved his purity of heartThe crafty minister desired to win him to his side But felt that failure was foredoomed however much he triedSaid Cao Cao to Zhang Liao I have treated Guan Yu pretty liberally but he still cherishes the desire to leave me Do you know if it is really so I will try to find out was the replySo Zhang Liao took an early opportunity of seeing Guan Yu and when the politeness of the visit were over Zhang Liao said I recommended you to the Prime Minister and you have not lost much by that I am deeply affected by his kindness and bounty said Guan Yu but though my body is here yet I am always thinking of my brother Your words do not express present conditions quite correctly One who lives in the world without discrimination and consideration of his relations with others is not the most admirable type of personEven Liu Bei never treated you better than does the Prime MinisterWhy then do you maintain this desire to get away I know only too well that he has been most kind but I have also received great kindness from Uncle Liu BeiBeside we have sworn to die together and I cannot remain here but before I go I must try to render the Prime Minister some signal service to prove my gratitude Supposing Liu Bei should have left the world whither will you go said Zhang LiaoI will follow him to the below realms of Nine Golden Springs There could no longer be the least doubt as to Guan Yus intentions and Zhang Liao told Cao Cao just how matters stood Cao Cao sighedTo serve ones chief with unswerving fidelity is a proof of the highest principle of all said heSaid Xun Yu He spoke of performing some act of service before leaving If he gets no chance of such a thing he will not be able to go Cao Cao agreed that this was so Liu Bei went to Yuan Shao for refugeHere Liu Bei was always sorrowful and when asked the reason said he did not know where his brothers were nor what had happened to his family since they fell into the hands of Cao CaoWhy should I not be sad when I have failed towards my country and my family said he I have long wished to attack Xuchang said Yuan ShaoNow it is autumn and just the time for an expedition so let us discuss plans for the destruction of Cao Cao Tian Feng at once opposed thisWhen Cao Cao attacked Xuzhou and Xuchang was undefended you let the chance slip byNow that Xuzhou has been captured and their soldiers are flushed with victory it would be madness to attempt itIt is necessary to await another chance Let me think about it said Yuan Shao He asked advice from Liu Bei whether to attack or to hold on Liu Bei replied Cao Cao is a rebelI think you are failing in your duty if you do not attack him Your words are good said Yuan Shao He made up his mind to moveBut again the adviser Tian Feng intervenedThen Yuan Shao grew angry saying You fellows who cultivate literature and despise war have made me miss a lot Tian Feng bowed his head and said Neglect your servants wise words and you will fail in the field Yuan Shao was so angry that he wanted to put Tian Feng to death However Liu Bei begged him off and he was only imprisonedSeeing the fate of his colleague another adviser Ju Shou assembled his clan and distributed among them all his possessions saying I go with the army If we succeed then nothing can exceed our glory but if we are defeated the risk I run is great His friends wept as they said farewellGeneral Yan Liang was appointed to the command of the advance guard to go to attack Baima Then Ju Shou first protested His mind is too narrow for such a postHe is brave but unequal to such a trust You are not the sort of man to measure my best generals replied Yuan ShaoThe army marched to Liyang and Governor Liu Yan of Dongjun sent an urgent call to Xuchang for aidCao Cao moved his armies hastilyAs soon as the news of battle got about Guan Yu went to see the Prime Minister and said Illustrious Sir the army is mobilized I volunteer for the van leader I scarcely dare put you to such inconvenience but presently if need arises I will call upon you So Guan Yu retired and one hundred fifty thousand soldiers marched out in three directionsOn the road the letters from Liu Yan arrived praying for help and Cao Cao marched the first fifty thousand troops to Baima and took up a position supported by the hillsIn the wide plains in front of them Yan Liang was encamped with one hundred thousand veteransCao Cao was frightened at the force opposed to him and returning to camp spoke to Song Xian who had once served under Lu Bu saying You are one of Lu Bus famous veteran generals can you give battle to this Yan Liang Song Xian agreed to tryHe armed himself mounted and rode to the frontYan Liang was there on horseback his sword lying crosswaysSeeing an opponent approaching he uttered a loud shout and galloped toward Song XianThe two met but after only three bouts Song Xian fell under a mighty slash from Yan Liangs swordWhat a terrible leader said Cao CaoHe has slain my comrade I want to go and avenge him then cried Wei XuCao Cao bade him go and he rode out spear set and in front of the army railed at Yan LiangYan Liang replied not a word but their two steeds came together and at the first blow from Yan Liangs sword Wei Xus forehead was halvedNow who again dares face him cried Cao Cao Xu Huang took up the challenge and he went outThe combat endured twenty bouts and then Xu Huang fled back to his own sideThe other generals were now greatly depressed at their failureCao Cao withdrew his army feeling very sad at the loss of two generals in quick succession Yan Liang also marched off his forceThen Cheng Yu went to see his chief saying I can produce a man the equal of Yan Liang Who cried Cao CaoNo other than Guan Yu I am afraid that if he is given an opportunity to perform that return service he spoke of he will leave me If Liu Bei is still alive he is with Yuan ShaoIf you get Guan Yu to defeat Yuan Shaos army Yuan Shao will look askance at Liu Bei and put him to deathLiu Bei gone where can Guan Yu go This argument appealed to Cao Cao at once and he sent to request Guan Yu to comePrevious to obeying the call Guan Yu went to say farewell to his sistersinlawYou may get news of the Uncle on the journey said they Yes said Guan Yu and left themArmed with his greendragon saber riding on the swift steed RedHare and having but a slender following Guan Yu was not long in arriving at Baima He saw Cao Cao who told him what had happened Yan Liang was too valiant for any to faceLet me look at him said Guan YuThen wine was served for his refreshment and while they were drinking it was reported that Yan Liang once again offered a challengeSo Cao Cao and his guest and staff went to the summit of a hill whence the enemy could be seenCao Cao and Guan Yu sat on the hill top and the commanders stood about themCao Cao pointed out Yan Liangs troops arrayed on the plains below The ensigns and banners waving fresh and bright amid the forest of spears and swords made a grand and imposing spectacle See how formidable these soldiers of the North of Yellow River are said Cao CaoI regard them as so many clay fowls and mud dogs said Guan YuCao Cao pointed out Yan Liang saying There under that grand umbrella in that embroidered robe and that silver breastplate and riding on horseback and gripping that huge sword is Yan Liang His head looks as though it was stuck on a pole for sale said Guan Yu just glancing over the army at his feet He is very terribleYou must not despise him said Cao CaoGuan Yu rose saying I am a poor thing but I will go over and bring you his head if you like Joking is not allowed in this army interposed Zhang LiaoPlease be careful what you say General Guan Yu quickly mounted turned down his mighty weapon and galloped down the hill his phoenix eyes rounded and his silkworm eyebrows fiercely bristlingHe dashed straight into the enemys array and the northern soldiers opened like falling waves and dissolving storms He made directly for the commanderNow Yan Liang sitting there in state saw a horseman rushing toward him and just as he began to ask who the rider of the red horse was lo the horseman was there Taken utterly by surprise the leader could make no defenseGuan Yus arm rose and the mighty weapon fellAnd with it fell Yan Liang Leaping from the saddle Guan Yu cut off his victims head and hung it to his horses neck Then he mounted and rode out just as if there was no army thereThe northern troops panic stricken made no fightCao Caos army attacked with full force and slew great numbers of themThey captured many horses and weapons and much military gearGuan Yu rode quickly back up the hill and laid the proof of his prowess at the feet of the Prime MinisterYou are more than human General cried Cao CaoWhat have I done to talk about said Guan YuMy brother Zhang Fei did the same thing in an army of a hundred legions and did it as easily as picking something from his own pocket Cao Cao marveled at the statement and turning to those about him said If you meet this Zhang Fei be careful And he bade them make a note on the overlap of their robes so that they should rememberThe beaten army returning northward met Yuan Shao on the road and told their story A redfaced warrior with a long beard wielding a huge longhandled sword broke into the army cut off the generals head and bore it off said theyWho was this asked Yuan ShaoJu Shou said It must have been Liu Beis brother Guan Yu it could be nobody else Yuan Shao was very angry and pointing to Liu Bei he said Your brother has slain my beloved leader You are in the plot tooWhy should I save you alive He bade the lictors take Liu Bei away and behead himMorning saw him guest on high Evening prisoner doomed to die Liu Beis actual fate will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER Yuan Shao Loses Another Leader Guan Yu Abandons Rank And Wealth As the last chapter closed Liu Bei had been condemned to dieLiu Bei spoke up however and said Pray hear one word Illustrious Sir before you decideI have lost sight of my brother since my misfortune at Xuzhou and know not whether Guan Yu be dead or aliveThere are many men in the world who resemble him Is every redfaced man with a beard named Guan YuShould you not rather seek some evidence Now Yuan Shao was impulsive and facile by nature and when Liu Bei spoke thus he suddenly turned upon Ju Shou saying By wrongly regarding what you said I nearly killed an innocent person Then Yuan Shao requested Liu Bei once more to resume his seat in the tent and give advice on how to avenge Yan LiangSoon from the lower end a voice was heard saying Yan Liang and I were as brothers and can I allow any other to avenge his death The speaker was a man of middle height with a face like a linlion a famous leader from the North of Yellow River named Wen ChouYuan Shao was pleased and said You are the only man who can do itI will give you one hundred thousand troops and you can cross the Yellow River and quickly smite that rebel Cao CaoYou cannot do it he will fail said Ju ShouThe proper course is to hold Yenjin and detach a force to GuanduIf you rashly cross the river and anything goes wrong not a soul will return Yuan Shao said That is always the way with you fellows always delaying and taking the dash out of the army You put off today and postpone tomorrow till success has become impossibleDo you forget that promptitude is what each soldier honors The adviser withdrew sadly sayingSuperiors do not curb their ambitions inferiors crave for achievements things are undoneEternal is the course of Yellow River shall I change it Thereafter Ju Shou feigned illness and went no more to the council Liu Bei said I have received much kindness at your hands and have been unable to show my gratitude I would accompany General Wen Chou that I may repay your bounty and also that I may hear news of my brother Yuan Shao gladly consented and ordered Wen Chou to share his command with Liu BeiBut the former objected saying Liu Bei has been so often defeated that it will augur ill for success this timeSince you wish I will give Liu Bei command of the rear guard of thirty thousand soldiers And this being approved three legions were told off under Liu Beis special command to follow the main bodyThe prowess displayed by Guan Yu in the bold attack on Yan Liang redoubled Cao Caos respect for him and Cao Cao memorialized the Throne that Guan Yu receive the title of Lord of Hanshou and a seal was cast for himJust then came the unexpected news that Yuan Shaos army had moved toward the Yellow River and was in position above YenjinCao Cao first sent to transfer the inhabitants to Siho and then led out an army to oppose Yuan ShaoHe issued an order to face about thus placing the rear companies in front The commissariat wagons were also placed in the van What is this reversal for asked Lu QianCao Cao replied When the supplies are in rear they are liable to be plunderedSo I have put them first But if you meet the enemy and they steal them Wait till the enemy appears I shall know what to do Lu Qian was much exercised at this new move of the Prime MinisterIn the meantime the supply train moved along the river toward YenjinPresently the foremost troops raised a great shout and Cao Cao sent to see what it meant The messenger came back saying Wen Chous army is approaching and the supply train has been abandoned and is at the mercy of the enemyThe main body is still far behind what to do next Thereupon Cao Cao pointed to two mounds saying We will take refuge here for the present All those near him hastened to the moundsThere Cao Cao ordered them all to loosen their dress lay aside their breastplates and rest a time The horsemen turned their steeds looseWen Chous soldiers approached under coverAs they drew near the officers told Cao Cao saying The rebels are near we ought to catch the horses and go back to Baima But Adviser Xun You checked them saying These are a bait for the enemy why retire Cao Cao glanced across at him and said He understands do not say anything Now having got possession of the supply carts the enemy next came to seize the horsesBy this time they had all broken ranks and were scattered each soldier going his own wayThen suddenly Cao Cao gave the order to go down from the mounds and smite them The surprise was completeWen Chous army was in confusion and Cao Caos army surrounded themWen Chou made a stand but those about him trampled each other down and he could do nothing but flee And he fledThen standing on the top of a mound Cao Cao pointed to the flying leader calling out There is one of the most famous generals of the north who can capture him Zhang Liao and Xu Huang both mounted and dashed after him crying Wen Chou do not run away Looking round the fugitive saw two pursuers and then he set aside his spear took his bow and adjusted an arrow which he shot at Zhang LiaoCease shooting you rebel shouted Xu HuangZhang Liao ducked his head and the shaft went harmlessly by save that it carried away the tassel of his cap He only pressed harder in pursuitThe next arrow however struck his horse in the head and the animal stumbled and fell throwing its rider to the earthThen Wen Chou turned to come back Xu Huang whirling his battleax stood in his way to stop Wen ChouBut Xu Huang saw behind Wen Chou several more horsemen coming to help and as they would have been too many for him he fledWen Chou pursued along the river bankSuddenly he saw coming toward him with banners fluttering in the breeze a small party of horse and the leader carried a great sword Stop cried Guan Yu for it was he and he attacked at once At the third bout Wen Chous heart failed him and he wheeled and fled following the windings of the riverBut Guan Yus steed was fast and soon caught up One blow and the hapless Wen Chou fellWhen Cao Cao saw from the mound that the leader of the enemy had fallen he gave the signal for a general onset and half of the northern army were drowned in the river And the carts with supplies and all the horses were quickly recoveredNow Guan Yu at the head of a few horsemen was thrusting here and striking there at the moment when Liu Bei with the thirty thousand reserve troops appeared on the battle field on the other bank of the riverAt once they told him that the redfaced longbearded warrior was there and had slain Wen Chou Liu Bei hastily pressed forward to try to get a look at the warriorHe saw across the river a body of horse and the banners bore the words Guan Yu Lord of HanshouThen it is my brother and he is really with Cao Cao said Liu Bei secretly thanking God that Guan Yu was safeLiu Bei made an attempt to wait about till he could call to Guan Yu but a great mass of Cao Caos soldiers came rushing down and he was forced to retireYuan Shao bringing reinforcements reached Guandu and built a stockadeTwo advisers Guo Tu and Shen Pei went in to see him and said Again that fellow Guan Yu has been in the battle he killed Wen ChouLiu Bei pretends ignorance of him Their master was angry and railed at Liu Bei The longcared rebelHow dare he do such a thing Soon Liu Bei appeared again Yuan Shao ordered him out to instant executionWhat crime have I committed asked Liu BeiYou sent your brother to slay one of my generals Is that no crime Pray let me explain before I dieCao Cao hated me and has always done so Now he has found out where I am and fearing that I may help you has got my brother to destroy your two generals feeling sure that when you heard of it you would be angry and put me to deathYou cannot fail to see this What he says is sense said Yuan Shao turning to his advisers and you two nearly brought on me the reproach of injuring the good Yuan Shao ordered his attendants to retire and asked Liu Bei to come and sit by him Liu Bei came saying I am deeply thankful Illustrious Sir for your great kindness for which I can never be sufficiently grateful Now I desire to send some confidential messenger with a secret letter to my brother to tell him where I am and I am sure he will come without a moments delay He will help you to destroy Cao Cao to make up for having destroyed your two officersDo you approve of this If I got Guan Yu he would be ten times better than the Yan Liang and Wen Chou that I have lost replied Yuan Shao So Liu Bei prepared a letter But there was no one to take itYuan Shao ordered the army to withdraw to Wuyang where they made a large camp For some time nothing was doneThen Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun to defend the strategic points at Guandu while he led the bulk of the army back to the capitalThere he gave many banquets in honor of the services of Guan Yu and then he told Lu Qian that putting the supplies in the front of the army had been meant as a bait to draw the enemy to destructionOnly Xun You understood that said Cao Cao in conclusion Every one present praised his ingenuityEven while the banquet was proceeding there arrived news of a rising of Yellow Scarves rebels at Runan led by Liu Pi and Gong DuThey were very strong and Cao Hong had been defeated in several engagements Now he begged for helpGuan Yu hearing this said I should like to have the opportunity of performing some service by destroying these rebels You have already rendered noble services for which you have not been properly requited I could hardly trouble you again said Cao CaoI have been idle too long I shall get ill said Guan YuCao Cao then let him to go and gave him fifty thousand troops with Yu Jin and Yue Jin as generals under him They were to leave soonThen Xun Yu said privily to his master He always cherishes the idea of returning to Liu Bei He will leave you if he hears any newsDo not let him go on this expedition If he does well this time I will not let him go into battle again said Cao CaoIn due time the force led by Guan Yu drew near the rebels in Runan and made their campOne night just outside his camp two spies were caught and taken in to Guan Yu who in one of them recognized Sun QianThe attendants being dismissed Guan Yu questioned Sun Qian After we lost sight of each other I have heard not a word of you what are you doing here said Guan YuAfter I escaped I drifted hither and thither till I had the good fortune to reach Runan and Liu Pi and Gong Du the Yellow Scarves leaders took me inBut why are you with Cao Cao GeneralAnd where are your sistersinlawAre they well Guan Yu told him all that had happened I have heard lately that Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao I would have liked to go and join him but I have not found a convenient opportunityNow the two men I am with have taken the side of Yuan Shao against Cao CaoBy good luck you were coming here so I got command of a small party of scouts to be able to see you and tell youPresently our two leaders will pretend to be defeated and you and the two ladies can go over to Yuan Shao And you will see your brother Since he is there I certainly must go at once to see himBut it is a misfortune that I have slain two of Yuan Shaos generals I fear things are not in my favor said Guan YuLet me go first and see how the land lies I will come back and tell you I would risk a myriad deaths to see my brother said Guan YuBut I must go to say farewell to Cao Cao Sun Qian was sent away that night and next day Guan Yu led out his army to offer battleGong Du in armor went out to the front of the line of battle and Guan Yu said You people why have you risen against the government Why do you blame us when you have turned your back on your own lord replied Gong DuHow have I turned my back on my lord Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao and you are with Cao Cao what is that Guan Yu could not reply but he whirled round his sword and rode forwardGong Du fled and Guan Yu followedGong Du turned and said to Guan Yu Do not forget your old chiefs kindnessNow attack as soon as you can and I will give up the defense Guan Yu understood and urged on his troops The leaders of the rebels pretended they were worsted and they all scattered So Runan was retakenHaving pacified the people Guan Yu quickly led his army back to the capital where he was met by Cao Cao and congratulated on his success and feastedWhen this was all over Guan Yu went to the dwelling of his sistersinlaw to pay his respects at their gateHave you been able to get any news of Uncle Liu Bei in your two expeditions asked Lady GanNone replied Guan YuAs he retired from the door he heard sounds of bitter weeping within He is dead said theyOur brotherinlaw thinks we shall be greatly distressed and thus he hides the truth from us One of the old soldiers who acted as guard hearing the sounds of perpetual grief took pity on them and said Do not weep ladies your lord is with Yuan Shao in the North of Yellow River How do you know that said theyI went out with General Guan Yu and one of the soldiers told me The two ladies summoned Guan Yu and reproached him saying Uncle Liu Bei never betrayed you and yet you remain here enjoying the bounty of Cao Cao and forgetting the old timesAnd you tell us falsehoods Guan Yu bowed his head saying My brother really is in the North of Yellow River but I dared not tell you lest it should become knownSomething must be done but done carefully and it needs time BrotherinLaw you should hasten said Lady GanGuan Yu withdrew feeling that he must evolve some scheme of departure without further loss of time It caused him much uneasinessYu Jin having found out that Liu Bei was in the north told Cao Cao who at once sent Zhang Liao to find out Guan Yus intentionsZhang Liao entered jauntily and congratulated Guan Yu saying They tell me you obtained news of your brother in the battlefield I felicitate you My lord was there indeed but I met him notI see nothing to be glad about Is there any difference between the relationship of you two and that of any other two brothers Guan Yu replied You and I stand in the relationship of friends Liu Bei and I are friends and brothers beside and prince and minister in addition to bothOur relationship cannot be discussed in usual terms Well now that you know where your brother is are you going to him How can I go back on what I said beforeI am sure you will explain fully to the Prime Minister Zhang Liao went back and told his master who said I must find a way to keep him here While Guan Yu was pondering over his difficulties they told him that a friend had come to inquire for himThe visitor was introduced but Guan Yu did not recognize himWho are you asked Guan YuI am Chen Zhen of Nanyang in the service of Yuan Shao In great perturbation Guan Yu sent away the attendants and they being gone said There is some special reason for your visit For reply Chen Zhen drew out a letter and handed it to his host who recognized that it was from his brother Liu BeiThe letter readI the writer and you Sir pledged ourselves in the Peach Garden to die togetherWhy then are we apart and yet alive our kindly feelings destroyed our sense of right outragedIf you desire to obtain fame and acquire riches and honor I will offer my head without hesitation so that your achievement is fulfilledMore might be said but I await your commands with great anxiety Guan Yu finished the letter with a bitter cry I always wanted to find my brother but I did not know where he was How can he think such evil of me said heLiu Bei looks for you very eagerly and if you are still bound by the old pledge you should go quickly said Chen ZhenAny one born into the world without the essential virtue of sincerity is no true humanI came here openly and can go in no other wayNow will I write a letter which I will ask you to bear to my brother that as soon as I can take leave of Cao Cao I will bring the ladies and come to him But what if Cao Cao refuse to let you go said Chen ZhenThen would I rather die I will not remain here Then Sir quickly write your letter and relieve your brother from his anxiety So Guan Yu wrote like thisI the humble one know full well that a human of principle does not betray and a human of loyalty despises deathI have been a student in my youth and know somewhat of the proprieties I sigh and weep at the memory of the fraternal affection that made Yangjue Ai and Zuo Botao die rather than separate I was in charge of Xiapi but the place lacked provision and there was no helpI would have fought to the death but there was on my shoulders the responsibility for my sistersinlawWherefore I had to take care of my body lest I betrayed your trust And so I made a prisoner of myself hoping to find a way of releaseI heard of you lately in RunanI must however bid farewell to Cao Cao and bring the ladies with me when I comeMay I perish victim to the superhuman powers if I have harbored any traitorous thoughtInk and paper are poor substitutes for what I would say but I look to see you soon Chen Zhen left with this missive and Guan Yu went to tell the womenThen he proceeded to the Prime Ministers palace to say farewellBut Cao Cao knew what he was coming for and at the gate Guan Yu found the board intimating that no one could be received So he had to return However he bade his own few soldiers prepare to start at any momentHe also gave orders that everything received from Cao Cao was to be left in the quarters nothing was to be takenNext day he again proceeded to the Palace to say farewell to his patron but again found the board hanging there to show there was no admissionSo it was several times he could never enterThen he went to see Zhang Liao but he was indisposedThis means Cao Cao will not let me go thought Guan YuBut I am going and I shall hesitate no longer So he wrote this letterAs a young man I entered the service of the Imperial Uncle and pledged myself to share his fortunesHeaven and Earth witnessed this oathWhen I lost the city I made three requests which you grantedNow I hear my brother is with Yuan Shao and I remembering our pledge cannot but go to himThough your bounty is great I forget not the bond of the past wherefore I write this letter of farewell trusting that when you have read it you will be content for me to postpone to another season the proof of my gratitude Guan Yu sealed and sent it to the PalaceThen he deposited in the treasury of his dwelling all the gold and silver he had received hung his seal of lordship of Hanshou in the middle of the reception hall and left taking his sistersinlaw with him in a carriageHe rode RedHare and carried the greendragon saber in his hand With a small escort of guards those formerly under his command he left the city by the north gateThe wardens would have stopped him but Guan Yu frightened them with a fierce shoutHaving got out he told the escort to go in front with the carriage while he would remain behind to guard against pursuit So they pushed the carriage toward the high roadIn the city Guan Yus letter reached the Prime Minister while he was consulting about what to doHe read it and exclaimed So he has left Then the warden of the gate came to report that Guan Yu had forced his way out and was gone with a carriage a horse and a score of guardsNext came the servants from his house to report that he had left taking nothing of the treasure nor any one of the waiting maidsEverything was left in the house Even his seal was there His only escort were the few soldiers of his original forceSuddenly from the assembly of officers rose a voice saying With three thousand of mailed horse I will bring him back alive Their eyes turned to the speaker who was General Cai YangOn the dragons cave he turns his back But numberless wolves infest his trackWhat came of this offer to pursue will be seen in the next chapter CHAPTER The Man of Beautiful Beard Rides On A Solitary Journey Guan Yu Slays Six Generals Through Five Passes Now of all the officers in Cao Caos army the two friendly toward Guan Yu were Zhang Liao and Xu Huang The others treated Guan Yu with respect except Cai Yang who was decidedly inimicalSo this Cai Yang was ready to pursue and capture Guan Yu as soon as he heard of his departure But Cao Cao accepted Guan Yus going as naturalHe does not forget his old leader and he was perfectly open in all his actions He is a gentleman and you would do well to follow his example said Cao CaoSo Cao Cao bade the wouldbe pursuer be gone and say no more about pursuit You were exceedingly good to Guan Yu said Cheng Yu but he went off very rudely He certainly left a screed behind with his reasons but he affronted you and that is no light matterNow to let him join Yuan Shao is to add wings to a tigerYou would better catch him and put him to death so as to guard against future evil Cao Cao replied But he had my promise and can I break my wordEach has his masterDo not pursue But Cao Cao said to Zhang Liao He has rejected all I gave him so bribes were powerless with him in whatever shape I have the greatest respect for such as himHe has not yet gone far and I will try to strengthen his attachment to me and make one appeal to sentimentRide after him and beg him to stop till I can come up and bid farewell and offer him a sum of money for his expenses and a fighting robe that he may remember me kindly in after days So Zhang Liao rode out quite alone Cao Cao followed him leisurely with an escort of a score or soNow the steed that Guan Yu rode was RedHare and it was very fastNo one could have come up with him but that there was the ladies carriage to escort and so RedHare had to be held in and go slowSuddenly Guan Yu heard a shout behind him a voice crying Go slowly Guan Yu He turned and made out the person to be Zhang LiaoOrdering the pushers of the carriage to press on along the high road he reined in his steed held the greendragon saber ready for a stroke and waited for Zhang Liao to come up Of course you have come to take me back Zhang Liao said Guan YuNo the Prime Minister seeing that you are going a long journey wishes to see you on your way and told me to hasten forward and beg you to wait till he can come upThat is the only thing Seeing that he is coming along with mailed men I shall fight to the very last said Guan YuAnd he took up his position on a bridge where he waited the approach of the party who advanced quicklyFour of Cao Caos generals Xu Chu Xu Huang Yu Jin and Li Dian followed closeSeeing Guan Yu was ready to fight Cao Cao ordered his escort to open out in two lines and then it was seen they carried no arms This relieved his mind for it proved to Guan Yu they meant no attackWhy do you go in such haste Guan Yu asked Cao CaoGuan Yu inclined his head but did not dismount saying I informed you in writing that since my lord was in the North of Yellow River I had to leave at onceI went to your palace again and again but was refused admittance So I wrote a letter of farewell sealed up the treasure resigned my lordship seal and left everything for youI hope you recall the promise you once made me Cao Cao replied My desire is to keep my troth with all people I cannot go back on my wordHowever you may find the journey expensive and therefore I have here prepared a sum of money to help you Then from horseback Cao Cao held out a packet of goldGuan Yu said I have sufficient left from your former bounty keep that for presents to your soldiers Why should you refuse thisIt is but an insignificant return for great services My services have been all trifling not worth mentioning Really Guan Yu you are the most highprincipled of humansI am very sorry my luck is too poor to retain you at my sidePray accept just this robe to show you I am not quite ungrateful said Cao CaoAnd one of his generals dismounting held up a silken coat in both handsGuan Yu even still fearful of what might happen would not dismount but he reached down his sword and took the robe on its point Then he threw it over his shoulders and turned to thank the giver saying I thank you Sir Prime Minister for the robe and trust we shall meet again So saying Guan Yu went down from the bridge and bore away to the north He is a very rude man said Xu Chu who was of the escortWhy do you not take him prisoner Cao Cao replied He was absolutely alone facing scores of us he was justified in being suspiciousBut my word has gone forth and he is not to be pursued Cao Cao and his escort returned the Prime Minister very sad when he thought of the man who had goneGuan Yu went down from the bridge and started in the wake of the carriage carrying the two ladies which should have gone about ten miles while this interview had been going onHe could see no signs of it and rode hither and thither looking on all sidesPresently he heard some one shouting from a hill calling him by name to haltHe saw a youth wearing a yellow turban and dressed in a silk robe He held a spear in his hand and was mounted on a horse from the neck of which dangled a bloody head Behind him were a hundred or so men on foot and they advanced quicklyWho are you asked Guan YuThe young man dropped his spear dismounted and made a low bowGuan Yu feared this was some ruse so he only checked his horse and gripped his sword the more firmly saying Sir I desire you to tell me your name My name is Liao HuaI belong to a Xiangyang familySince these troubled times began I have been an outlaw among the rivers and lakes and I and my comrades have lived by plunder We are about five hundred in allBy chance my friend Du Yuan came across two ladies in a carriage just now and quite wrongly he took them prisoners and brought them to the hold in the hillsI questioned the servants and so found out who they were and who was escorting them So I wished them to be set free to pursue their journeyDu Yuan opposed this and spoke so illmannerly that I killed himAnd here is his headI pray you pardon me Where are the two ladies They are among the hills replied Liao HuaBring them down here at once said Guan YuIn a short time a party of the brigands pushed the carriage down the hill and the ladies sat there before him Then Guan Yu dismounted laid aside his sword and stood respectfully before them with his arms crossed Sisters have you been alarmed asked heThey replied We should have suffered at the hands of Du Yuan had it not been for Liao Hua How did Liao Hua come to save the ladies asked Guan Yu of those who stood byThey said Du Yuan carried off the ladies and proposed that he and Liao Hua should have one each as wifeBut Liao Hua had found out they were of gentle birth and worthy and was for treating them with respectWhen Du Yuan disagreed Liao Hua slew him Hearing this Guan Yu bowed to Liao Hua and thanked himLiao Hua then wanted to join himself and his troop to Guan Yu but Guan Yu seeing he was a Yellow Scarf would have nothing to do with him So Guan Yu simply thanked him for his kindness to the ladiesLiao Hua offered some presents but these were also declinedSo Liao Hua took his leave and presently disappeared in a valley among the hillsGuan Yu told his sisters the story of his interview with Cao Cao and the gift of a robe and then he urged the carriage on its wayTowards dark they came to a farm where they would restThe farmer an old graybeard came out to welcome the party and asked who they wereGuan Yu described himself as the brother of Liu Bei and said his nameSurely you are no other than the slayer of Yan Liang and Wen Chou said the venerable hostThat is so replied Guan YuCome in said the old man joyfullyMy two sistersinlaw are in the carriage said Guan Yu will you let your women folks go out to receive them As Guan Yu remained standing there the host asked him to be seated but he would not sit while the women were present and remained standing in a respectful attitude till the old mans wife had returned and ushered the ladies into the inner apartmentsThen the old man set to the entertainment of his guest in the guest hallGuan Yu asked his nameHe replied I am called Hu HuaIn the days of the Emperor Huan I was an officer of the court but I resigned and retired into private lifeI have a son Hu Ban with Governor Wang Zhi of Yingyang and if you should be going that way General I should like to send him a letter by you Guan Yu said he would take the letterNext day after an early meal the ladies got into their carriage the host handed his letter to Guan Yu and the little party once more took the road They went toward LuoyangPresently they approached a pass known as the Dongling Pass guarded by Commander Kong Xiu and five hundred soldiersWhen the soldiers saw a carriage being pushed toward the pass they ran to tell their commander who came out to accost the travelersGuan Yu dismounted and returned the officers salute and Kong Xiu said Whither are you going I have left the Prime Minister to go into the North of Yellow River to find my brother But Yuan Shao is my masters rivalYou have authority from him to go thither I left hurriedly and could not get it If you have no authority you must wait while I send to request orders To remain while you send and receive an answer will delay me greatly said Guan YuI must stand by my instructions that is the only thing to do said Kong XiuThen you refuse to let me pass If you want to go through leave the family as a gage At this Guan Yu got very angry and made to cut at the commander on the spot but Kong Xiu withdrew into the gate and beat the drums for an attackThereupon the soldiers armed themselves mounted and came down to oppose the passage crying Dare you go through eh The carriage was sent off to a safe distance and then Guan Yu rode at full speed directly at the commander of the guard who set his spear and came to meet himThe two steeds met and the men engaged but at the first stroke of the greendragon saber the commander of the gate fell to the earth deadHis troops fledSoldiers do not flee cried Guan YuI killed him because I could do no otherwiseI have nothing against you but I would ask you to tell the Prime Minister how this thing came to pass that Kong Xiu wished to kill me and so I slew him in self defense The soldiers bowed before him and Guan Yu with the carriage passed through the gates and continued their way to LuoyangBut one of the guards of the pass went quickly in advance and informed the Governor of Luoyang Han Fu of the slaughter of Kong XiuWherefore Han Fu assembled his officers to take counselMeng Tan one of his generals said This Guan Yu must be a fugitive or he would have a safe conductOur only course is to stop him or we shall incur blame The man is fierce and brave Remember the fate of Yan Liang and Wen ChouIt seems vain to oppose him by force and so we must think out some trap for him said Han Fu I have a ruse ready said Meng Tan I will close the gate with thorny blockades and I will go to fight with him I will engage and then flee and you can shoot him from an ambush along the roadIf we can get him and his party and send them prisoners to the capital we ought to be well rewarded This course was determined upon and soon they heard that Guan Yu was approachingHan Fu strung his bow and filled his quiver with arrows and with one thousand soldiers took up position along the passThen as the party approached Han Fu said Who is the traveler who comes Guan Yu bowed low and said He is a certain Guan Yu Lord of Hanshou and he wishes to go through the pass Have you a letter from the Prime Minister In the hurry of departure I did not get any My special orders from him are to hold this pass and make examination of all spies that may go to and froAny person without an authority must be a fugitive Then Guan Yu began to be angry saying I have killed Kong Xiu at Dongling PassDo you also seek death Who will capture him for me cried Han Fu and Meng Tan offered himself He rode out whirling his double swords and made straight for Guan YuGuan Yu sent back the carriage out of danger and then rode toward Meng TanThey engaged but very soon Meng Tan turned his steed and fledGuan Yu pursued Meng Tan intent only on leading his enemy toward the ambush took no account of the speed of RedHareVery soon Meng Tan was caught up and a stroke of the mighty sword cut him in two piecesThen Guan Yu stopped and turned back The archers in the gate shot their hardest and though it was a long way off one of them lodged an arrow in his left arm He pulled it out with his teeth but the blood streamed down as he rode toward Governor Han Fu The men scattered Guan Yu rode straight at his next victim He raised his sword and made an oblique cut which sliced off the head and shoulder of Han Fu Then Guan Yu drove off the soldiers and returned to escort the carriageHe bound up his wound and fearing lest any one might take advantage of his weakness he made no long halts on the road but hurried toward River Si PassThe warden of this pass was Bian Xi of Bingzhou a warrior whose weapon was a comethammerHe had been a Yellow Scarf and had gone over to Cao Cao who had given him this postAs soon as he heard of the coming of the redoubtable Guan Yu he cudgeled his brains for a ruse to use against him He decided upon an ambush In the Guardian Temple at the pass he placed two hundred axmen and swordsmen He reckoned on enticing Guan Yu to the temple for refreshment and when he let fall a cup as signal the hidden ruffians would rush outAll being thus arranged and ready he went out to welcome Guan Yu in friendly guise and Guan Yu dismounted at his coming Bian Xi began very amiablyYour name General makes the very earth tremble and every one looks up to youThis return to the Imperial Uncle proves you to be noble and true Guan Yu in reply told him the story of the men he had slain in the last two passesBian Xi replied You slew them that is wellWhen I see the Prime Minister I will explain to him the inner reasons for these acts Guan Yu thought he had found a friend and so mounted and rode through the passWhen he came to the temple a number of priests came out to meet him with clanging bellsThis temple named Guardian of the State had a courtyard in which the Emperor Ming had burned incense in the past In the temple were thirty priests and among these there happened to be one Pu Jing who came from the same village as Guan YuHis religious name was TransversePeace Hearing who the visitor was TransversePeace came forward to speak with himGeneral said TransversePeace it is many a long year since you left Pudong Yes said Guan Yu nearly twenty years Do you recognize this poor priest I left the village many years ago I do not recognize you My house and yours were only separated by a rivulet said the priestNow Bian Xi seeing TransversePeace holding forth about village matters thought TransversePeace would blab about the ambush so Bian Xi bade him be silent I want to invite the General to a feast You priest fellows seem to have a lot to say said Bian XiNot too much said Guan YuNaturally when fellow villagers meet they talk of old times Bian Xi invited the visitor into the guest room to take tea but Guan Yu said The two ladies are out there in the carriage they ought to have some first So the priest bade them take some tea to the ladies and then he led Guan Yu within at the same time lifting the priest knife which he wore at his side and looking meaningfully at Guan YuThe latter understood and told his people to bring along his weapon and keep close at his sideWhen Bian Xi invited Guan Yu to go into the Hall of the Laws for some refreshment Guan Yu turned to him saying Is this invitation with good intention or evil Bian Xi was so taken aback that he could make no reply and then Guan Yu saw that many armed men were concealed behind the arrasThen Guan Yu shouted loudly at Bian Xi saying What means this I thought you an honorable manHow dare you The traitor saw that his plot had failed and called to the assassins to come out and fall to but Guan Yu had a short sword in his hand and slashed at any one who came nearSo they scattered Their commander ran down the hall and tried to escape among the side buildings but Guan Yu threw aside the short sword took up the greendragon saber and went after Bian XiThe latter was trying to get into position to throw his comethammer but Guan Yu cut the cord and the weapon was useless Guan Yu followed Bian Xi in and out and soon caught up with himThen with one blow Guan Yu cut him in halvesThe fight over Guan Yu sought the two ladies who were surrounded by soldiers These fled at sight of the terrible warriorSeeking out the priest his fellow countryman he thanked him for the timely warning which had saved him from deathI cannot remain here after this said TransversePeace I shall pack up my few garments and my alms bowl and take to the road vague in my wanderings as the clouds in the skyBut we shall meet again and till then take care of yourself Then Guan Yu took leave and retook the road to YingyangThe Governor of this city was named Wang Zhi and he was related to Han Fu by their childrens marriageHearing of the death of his relative Wang Zhi set about a scheme to kill Guan Yu secretlyHe sent soldiers to guard the city gates and when he heard that Guan Yu approached he went himself and received Guan Yu with a smiling countenance and bade Guan Yu welcomeGuan Yu told him the object of his journeyYou General have been able to get some exercise on the road but the ladies in their carriage must be cramped and fatigued I pray you come into the city and all of you remain the night in the official travelers quartersTomorrow you can set forth again The offer was tempting and his host seemed in earnest so the two ladies went into the city where they found everything very comfortably prepared for themAnd though Guan Yu declined the Governors invitations to a banquet refreshments for the travelers were sent to their lodgingsGuan Yu was fatigued from the trials of the journey and as soon as the evening meal was over he bade the ladies retire to rest while he sat down in the main room quite alone for he bade all to get repose while they couldHis horse was given a good feed for onceHe sat with his armor loosened in order to be more at ease Now Governor Wang Zhi had a secretary named Hu Ban to whom he had entrusted the arrangements for the destruction of his guestSaid Wang Zhi This Guan Yu is a traitor to the Prime Minister and a fugitive On the road he has murdered several Commanders of Passes and is guilty of serious crimesBut he is too strong and valiant for any ordinary soldier to overcomeSo this evening a whole company of a thousand troops will surround his lodging each one armed with a torch and we will burn him They will start the fire about midnightEvery one of the party will perishI will come with a force to stand by and assist if necessary These orders received Hu Ban passed them on to the soldiers who began secretly to prepare dry wood and other combustibles which they piled up at the gate of the rest houseHu Ban thought within himself that he would like to know what manner of man was this Guan Yu whose fame had spread so far so he determined to get a peep at the guest He went to the rest house and inquired where Guan Yu wasThe General is the man in the main hall reading was the replyHu Ban noiselessly made his way to the outside of the room and peeped in He saw the famous warrior stroking his beard with his left hand while he read by the light of a lamp placed on a low table An involuntary exclamation of wonder escaped at the majesty of the figureReally a god Hu Ban sighedWho is there suddenly asked the reader at the soundHu Ban entered and said I am the Governors secretary Hu Ban Surely you are the son of Hu Hua who lives outside Xuchang said Guan YuI am he replied Hu BanThen Guan Yu called up his followers and bade them look among the baggage for the letter which they broughtGuan Yu handed it to the secretary who read it and then breathed long saying I very nearly caused the death of a good man Then he betrayed the whole plot saying This Wang Zhi is a wicked man who wanted to kill you At this moment you are surrounded and at the third watch they will set fire to this placeNow I will go and open the city gates while you hastily prepare for flight Guan Yu was greatly surprised but he quickly buckled up his armor got his steed ready roused the two ladies and put them into their carriage Then they left the rest house and as they passed out they saw the soldiers all about them each with a torchThe party hastened to the outskirts of the city and found the gate already open and they lost no time in getting clear of the cityHu Ban returned to give orders to fire the rest houseThe fugitives pressed on but before long they saw lights coming up behind them and Wang Zhi called out to them to stopGuan Yu reined in his horse and began to abuse him crying Worthless fellowWhat had you against me that you wished to burn me to death Wang Zhi whipped up his steed and set his spear but Guan Yu cut him through with the short sword he wore at his side and scattered his followersThen the carriage pushed on Guan Yus heart was filled with gratitude to Hu BanWhen they drew near Huazhou some one told Liu Yan who rode out to welcome him Liu Yan had been once rescued by Guan Yu who slew Yan Liang and Wen Chou and lifted the siege of the cityGuan Yu did not dismount but bowed from horseback saying Have you been quite well since we parted Whither are you going Sir replied Liu YanI have left the Prime Minister and am on my way to find my brother Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao who is at enmity with the Prime Minister How can you be allowed to go to him asked Liu YanThat matter was settled long ago The Yellow River Ferry is an important point and is guarded by a commander of Xiahou Dun he will not let you cross But suppose then you provide boats for me Though there are boats I dare not give them to you Well formerly I slew Yan Liang and Wen Chou and saved you a grave dangerNow you refuse me a ferry boat I am afraid Xiahou Dun will know of it and make it a fault against me Guan Yu perceived that no help was to be expected from this man so he pushed on and presently reached the ferryThere the Commander of the Guard Qin Qi came out to question himI am one Guan Yu Lord of Hanshou Whither are you bound I go to the North of Yellow River to seek my brother Liu Bei and I respectfully ask you to grant me a passage over the river Where is the authority of the Prime Minister I am not on a mission from the Prime Minister so why should I have such an authority I have orders from my chief to guard the ferry and you will not cross even if you grew wings you should not fly over Guan Yus choler aroseDo you know that I have been the death of all those who have hitherto tried to stop me said heYou have only slain a few officers of no rank or reputation but you dare not kill me Where would you stand beside Yan Liang and Wen Chou asked Guan YuQin Qi grew angry and he loosed his rein Sword in hand he came at a gallopThe two met but in the first encounter Qin Qis head was swept off by the terrible greendragon saberHe who opposed me is dead you others need not be afraid cried Guan YuBe quick and prepare me a boat The boat was soon at the landing and the two women stepped on board followed by Guan YuThey crossed and were then in the country of Yuan ShaoIn the course of his journey to this point Guan Yu had forced five passes and slain six generalsHis seal hung up the treasury locked his courtly mansion left He journeyed toward his brother dear too long from his side leftThe horse he rode was famed for speed as for endurance great His good sword made a way for him and opened every gateHis loyalty and truth forth stand a pattern unto all His valor would frighten rushing streams and make high mountains fallAlone he traveled lustily this was death to meet his blade He has been themed by myriads his glory never will fadeI did not willingly slay a single one of them mused Guan Yu as he rode along There was no help for itNevertheless when Cao Cao hears of it he will regard me as ungrateful for his bounty Before long he saw a rider on the road who soon hailed him and proved to be Sun QianI have never heard a word from you since we lost sight of each other at Runan how have you fared said Guan Yu After your departure Liu Pi and Gong Du retook the cityI was sent by them to Yuan Shao to try to make peace with him and succeeded so that Yuan Shao invited Liu Bei to go to him and share in the deliberations for a concerted attack on Cao CaoBut to my disgust the leaders of Yuan Shaos army showed great jealousy of each other so that Tian Feng got into gaol Ju Shou was degraded and others quarreledThen Yuan Shao vacillated and hesitated so that your brother and I consulted how we might get away from them allNow the Uncle is at Runan with Liu Pi and thinking you could not know that and might suffer some harm if you unwillingly went to Yuan Shao I have come to warn youIt is good fortune to find you like thisNow we can hasten to Runan and you will meet your brother Guan Yu took Sun Qian to make his bow to the ladies who asked after his adventures and Sun Qian said Uncle Liu Bei were nearly executed due to Yuan Shaos sudden bursts of anger after the deaths of Yan Liang and Wen ChouNow however he is out of his way and safe at Runan and you will meet him soon The ladies covered their faces and wept at the recital of his dangersThen the party no longer traveled north but took the road toward RunanNot long after a great cloud of dust was noticed behind them and that presently made out a hundred of horsemen These were led by Xiahou Dun who shouted out to Guan Yu to stopOne by one the pass commanders stopped his progress and were slain The river crossed another army comes and he must fight againHow finally Guan Yu escaped death will appear in the succeeding chapterCHAPTER  Putting Cai Yang To Death The Brothers Doubts Disappear Meeting At Gucheng Lord and Liege Fortify Each Other Sun Qian had joined Guan Yu in escorting the two ladies and they were on the road to Runan when Xiahou Dun suddenly determined to pursue So with a couple of hundred horse Xiahou Dun set outWhen Xiahou Dun was seen approaching Guan Yu bade Sun Qian go ahead with the carriage while he remained to deal with the pursuersWhen they were near enough Guan Yu said In coming after me thus you do not reinforce the magnanimity of your master Replied Xiahou Dun The Prime Minister has sent no definite instructionsYou have caused the death of several people among them one of my commanders and so I have come to capture you You have behaved most grosslyThe Prime Minister will decide Thereupon Xiahou Dun dashed forward with his spear ready to thrustBut at that moment a rider came up behind him at full gallop crying You must not fight with Guan Yu Guan Yu stayed his steed at once and waitedThe messenger came up drew from his bosom an official letter and said to Xiahou Dun The Prime Minister loves General Guan Yu for his loyalty and honor and fearing lest Guan Yu might be stopped at the various passes he sent me with this letter to show when necessary at any point on the road But this Guan Yu has slain several commanders of the passes does the Prime Minister know that said Xiahou DunThe messenger said these things were unknownThen said Xiahou Dun I will arrest him and take him to the Prime Minister who may set him free or not as he wills Do you think I fear anything you can do said Guan Yu getting wrathful And he rode forwardXiahou Dun nothing loth set his spear and prepared for battleThey met and had reached the tenth encounter when a second horseman came up at full speed crying Generals wait a little Xiahou Dun stayed his hand and asked the messenger saying Am I to arrest him No replied the messengerFearing lest he should have difficulties at the passes the Prime Minister has sent me with a dispatch to say he is to be released Did the Prime Minister know that he had slain several commanders on the way He did not know Since he was ignorant of that I may not let this Guan Yu go and Xiahou Dun gave the signal to his men to close in round Guan YuBut Guan Yu flourished his sword and made to attack them and a fight was again imminent when a third rider appeared who cried Guan Yu give way and do not fight The speaker was Zhang Liao Both combatants made no further move but awaited his arrivalZhang Liao said I bring the Prime Ministers order that since he has heard that Guan Yu has slain certain commanders on the way he fears that some will hinder his passage Wherefore he has sent me to deliver his command at each gate that Guan Yu is to be suffered to pass freely Xiahou Dun said Qin Qi was the son of Cai Yangs sister and he was confided to my especial careNow this Guan Yu has killed him and how can I refrain When I see his uncle Cai Yang I will explainBut now the main point is that you have the Prime Ministers orders to let Guan Yu pass and you may not despise his wish So the only thing for Xiahou Dun to do was to retire and he didWhither are you going then said Zhang Liao to Guan YuI fear my brother is no longer with Yuan Shao and now I am going to find him wherever he is As you do not know where to go why not return to the Prime Minister Where is the sense of that said Guan Yu with a smileBut Zhang Liao you return and try to arrange pardon for my faults With this Guan Yu saluted Zhang Liao and took his leaveZhang Liao retired and joined Xiahou DunGuan Yu quickly regained the carriage and as they went along side by side he told Sun Qian what had happenedSeveral days later a heavy rain storm came on which soaked everythingLooking about for protection they noticed a farm under the shelter of a precipice and took their way thitherAn old man came out to them to whom they told their storyWhen they had finished the old fellow said My name is Guo Chang and I have lived here many yearsI am very pleased to greet the man whom I have known so long by reputation Guo Chang quickly killed a sheep for their refreshment and brought out wine for the two men The two ladies were entertained in the inner apartmentsAnd while they refreshed themselves their baggage was put out to dry and their steeds were fedAs the day closed in they saw several youths come along and their host said My son is come to pay his respects This is my humble son said Guo Chang presenting a lad to Guan YuWhat has he been doing asked Guan YuHe has just come in from hunting The young fellow went outThe old man continued All my family have been farmers or scholars He is my only son and instead of following in the footsteps of his ancestors he cares for nothing but gadding about and hunting unhappily Why unhappily said Guan YuIn these days of disorder a good soldier can make a name for himself If he would only learn the military arts that would be something of a career but he is nothing but a vagabond and does everything he should notHe is a grief to me Guan Yu sighed in sympathy The old gentleman stayed till a late hour and when he took his leave his two guests began to prepare for restSuddenly outside there arose a great hubbub men shouting and horses neighingGuan Yu called to his people but as no one answered he and Sun Qian drew their swords and went into the stable yardThere they found their hosts son on the ground shouting to his followers to fightGuan Yu asked what it was all about and his guards told him The young fellow had tried to steal RedHare but had been badly kickedWe heard shouting and went to see what it meant when his men had set on us Guan Yu was very wrathfulYou mean thieves Would you steal my horse cried heBut before he could do anything his host came running out saying It was not with my consent that my son did this evil thing I know he is very guilty and deserves deathBut his mother loves him tenderly and I pray you be generous and pardon him Really he is unworthy of his father said Guan YuWhat you told me shows he is a degenerateFor your sake I pardon him Then Guan Yu told his own people to keep a better lookout sent the people about their business and in company with Sun Qian went away to restNext morning both host and hostess were up betimes waiting to thank Guan Yu for forgiving their sons mad freak My son has insulted your tiger dignity I know and I am deeply affected by your kindness in not punishing him said the old manBring him here and I will talk to him said Guan YuHe went out before daylight with a lot of his fellow rogues and I know not where he is So Guan Yu bade them farewell got the ladies into their carriage and they moved out of the farmyard Guan Yu and Sun Qian riding abreast as escort They took the road toward the hillsBefore they had gone far they saw a large party of men led by a couple of riders pouring down one of the gullies One of the riders wore a yellow turban and a battle robeThe other was Guo Changs sonThe wearer of the turban called out saying I am one of the commanders of Zhang Jue the Lord of HeavenWhoever you may be leave that horse you are riding for meYou may then go free Guan Yu greeted the speech with a hearty laugh O you mad ignoramusIf you had ever been with Zhang Jue as a bandit you would have learned to know Liu Bei Guan Yu and Zhang Fei the three brothers I have heard of the ruddy long beard called Guan Yu but I have never seen himWho may you be Guan Yu then laid aside his sword stopped his horse and drew off the bag that covered his beard thus showing its magnificenceThe turban wearer immediately slipped out of the saddle laid an angry hand on his companion and they both bowed low in front of Guan Yus steedWho are you asked Guan YuI am Pei YuanshaoAfter the death of Zhang Jue I was left forlorn and I got together a few others like myself and we took refuge in the forestsThis morning early this fellow came to tell us that a guest at his fathers farm had a valuable horse and proposed to me to steal itI did not think I should meet you General The wretched Guo Changs son implored that his life might be spared and Guan Yu pardoned him for his fathers sakeThen Guan Yu covered his face and crept awayYou did not recognize me how then did you know my name asked Guan YuPei Yuanshao replied Not far from here is a mountain called the Sleeping Bull where lives a certain Zhou Cang a very powerful man who came from the west He has a stiff curly beard and looks very handsomeHe also was a commander in the rebel army who took to the forest when his leader perishedHe has told me a lot about you but I have never had the happiness of seeing you Said Guan Yu Under the green wood trees is no place for a heros footYou would better abandon this depraved life and return to the path of virtueDo not work out your own destruction As they were talking a troop of horsemen appeared in the distanceThey belonged to Zhou Cang as Pei Yuanshao said and Guan Yu waited for them to approachThe leader was very dark complexioned tall and armed with a spearAs soon as he drew near enough to see he exclaimed joyfully This is General Guan Yu In a moment he had slipped out of the saddle and was on his knees by the roadside Zhou Cang renders obeisance said heSaid Guan Yu O Warrior where have you known me I was one of the Yellow Scarves and I saw you then My one regret was that I could not join youNow that my good fortune has brought me here I hope you will not reject meLet me be one of your foot soldiers to be always near you to carry your whip and run by your stirrupI will cheerfully die for you As he seemed thoroughly in earnest Guan Yu said But if you follow me what of your companions They may do as they please follow me or go their ways Thereupon they all shouted We will follow Guan Yu dismounted and went to ask the ladies what they thought of thisLady Gan replied BrotherinLaw you have traveled thus far alone and without fighters you have safely passed many dangers and never wanted their assistanceYou refused the service of Liao Hua why then suffer this crowdBut this is only a my view and you must decide What you say SisterinLaw is to the point Therefore returning to Zhou Cang he said It is not that I am lacking in gratitude but my sistersinlaw do not care for a large followingWherefore return to the mountains till I shall have found my brother when I will surely call you Zhou Cang replied I am only a rough uncouth fellow wasting his life as a brigandMeeting you General is like seeing the full sun in the skies and I feel that I can never bear to miss you againAs it might be inconvenient for all my people to follow you I will bid my companion lead them away but I will come and follow you on foot wherever you go Guan Yu again asked his sistersinlaw what they thought of thisLady Gan said one or two made no difference and so Guan Yu consentedBut Pei Yuanshao was not satisfied with this arrangement and said he wished also to followZhou Cang said If you do not stay with the band they will disperse and be lostYou must take command for the moment and let me accompany General Guan YuAs soon as he has a fixed abode I will come to fetch you Somewhat discontentedly Pei Yuanshao accepted the situation and marched off while his onetime colleague joined the train of Guan Yu and they went toward RunanThey traveled quickly for some days and then they saw a city on a hillThe natives told them This city is called GuchengA few months before a warrior suddenly appeared drove out the magistrate and took possession Then he has begun to recruit soldiers buy up horses and lay in stores The warriors name is Zhang Fei Now he has a large force and no one in the neighborhood dare face him To think that I should find my brother like this said Guan Yu delightedI have had never a word of him nor knew I where he was since Xuzhou fell So Guan Yu dispatched Sun Qian into the city to tell its new commander to come out to meet him and provide for their sistersinlawNow after being separated from his brothers Zhang Fei had gone to the Mangdang Hills where he had remained a month or so while he sent far and near for tidings of Liu BeiThen as he happened to pass Gucheng he had sent in to borrow some grain but had been refusedIn revenge he had driven away the magistrate and taken possession of the city He found the place well suited to his needs at the momentAs directed by Guan Yu Sun Qian entered the city and after the usual ceremonies told Zhang Fei the news Liu Bei has left Yuan Shao and gone to Runan and Guan Yu with your sistersinlaw is at the gatesHe wishes you to go out and receive them Zhang Fei listened without a word till he came to the request to go out to meet his brotherAt that point he called for his armor and when he had put it on laid hold of his long octaneserpent halberd mounted and rode out with a large company at his backSun Qian was too astonished to ask what this meant and simply followedGuan Yu was very glad when he saw his brother coming put up his weapons and with Zhou Cang at his back rode toward him at full speedBut as Guan Yu approached he saw all the signs of fierce anger on Zhang Feis face and Zhang Fei roared as he shook his spear threatening Guan YuGuan Yu was entirely taken aback and called out anxiously Brother what does this meanIs the Peach Garden Pledge quite forgotten What impudence is this that you come to see me since your disgraceful behavior shouted Zhang FeiWhat disgraceful behavior has been mine said Guan YuYou have betrayed your brother you have surrendered to Cao Cao and you have received title and office at his handsAnd now you are come to exploit meOne of us shall die Guan Yu said Really you do not understand and it is hard for me to explainBut ask the two ladies here Worthy Brother and they will tell you At this the ladies lifted the curtain of the carriage and called outBrother why is this Zhang Fei said Wait a while sisters and see me slay this traitorAfter that I will conduct you into the city Said Lady Gan Since he knew not where you were our brother took shelter with Cao CaoAnd since he knew that his elder brother was at Runan he has braved every danger to escort us thus far on the roadPray take a correct view of his conduct Lady Mi also chimed in When your brother went to Xuchang no other course was open to him Sisters do not let him blind you to the truthReal loyalty prefers death to dishonorNo good person can serve two masters Guan Yu said Brother cease to wrench me I pray you Sun Qian said Guan Yu came expressly to seek you How much more nonsense will you talk roared Zhang Fei How can he be trueheartedHe came to capture me I say Had I come to capture you I should have come with troops and horses said Guan YuAnd are there not troops and horses said Zhang Fei pointing to a point behind Guan YuGuan Yu turned and there he saw a cloud of dust rising as though a squadron of horse was comingAnd soon they were near enough and from their trumpets and banners they showed themselves to be of Cao Caos armyNow will you try to cajole me further cried Zhang Fei in a rageHe set his octaneserpent halberd and was just coming on when Guan Yu said Brother wait a while see me slay the leader of these that I may prove myself no traitor Well if you are really true prove it by slaying that leader whoever he may be before I have finished three rolls of the drum Zhang Feis condition was acceptedSoon the attacking force was near enough to make out the leader to be Cai YangSword in hand Cai Yang rode at full speed crying So I have found you slayer of my nephewI have a command to capture you and will execute it Guan Yu made no replyRaising his sword ready to strike he moved out and the drums began to beatBefore a roll could be completed the fight was over and Cai Yangs head had rolled on the groundHis force scattered and fledGuan Yu however captured the young ensign bearer and questioned him The youth said The fact is the Prime Minister had not given an orderIncensed at the loss of his nephew Cai Yang wished to cross the river to pursue and attack you General although the Prime Minister refused permissionTo satisfy him the Prime Minister had sent Cai Yang to attack Runan and the meeting at this place is entirely an accident Guan Yu bade him repeat this story to his brotherZhang Fei also questioned him concerning all that had happened in the capital and the recital of the whole story satisfied Zhang Fei of the fidelity of Guan YuJust then messengers came from the city to Zhang Fei to saySome scores of horsemen has arrived at the south gateThey seem in a great hurry but no one know them Zhang Fei with still a lingering doubt in his mind went to look at the newcomers and there saw some forty mounted archers with light bows and short arrowsHastily dismounting to see them better he found they were Mi Zhu and Mi FangQuickly slipping out of the saddle they came up and Mi Zhu said After the dispersal at Xuzhou when we lost sight of you we returned to our village whence we sent all around for news of youWe heard that Guan Yu had surrendered to Cao Cao and our lord was in the North of Yellow River with Yuan ShaoThe one of whom we could hear nothing was yourselfBut yesterday while on our way we fell in with some travelers who told us a certain General Zhang Fei of such and such an appearance had suddenly occupied Gucheng and we felt it must be youSo we came to inquire and we happily fell in with you here Zhang Fei replied Guan Yu and Sun Qian are here and my two sisters are with themThey had heard where my elder brother was This news added to the joy of the two newcomers who went to see Guan Yu and the women and then they all entered the city When the ladies had settled down a little they related the whole story of the adventures on the road at which Zhang Fei was overcome with remorse and bowed before his brother bitterly weeping Mi Zhu and Mi Fang were greatly affected Then Zhang Fei related what had happened to himA day was spent in banquets and next day Zhang Fei wished his newly found brother to go with him to Runan to see their elder brother Liu BeiBut Guan Yu said No you take care of the ladies here while Sun Qian and I go to get news So Guan Yu and Sun Qian with a small escort set out When they reached Runan they were received by Liu Pi Liu Bei is no longer in the cityAfter waiting some days he has come to the conclusion that the soldiers are too few and has gone back to Yuan Shao to consult with him said Liu PiGuan Yu was greatly disappointed and Sun Qian did his best to console him saying Do not be sorrowful it only means the trouble of another journey into the North of Yellow River to tell Uncle Liu Bei and then we can all meet at Gucheng So spoke Sun Qian and Guan Yu accepted itThey took leave of Liu Pi and returned to Gucheng where they related what had happenedZhang Fei wanted to go with them into the North of Yellow River but Guan Yu opposed this saying Seeing you have this city it makes a rallying point for us and a resting place We must not abandon it lightlySun Qian and I will go and while sway we look to you to keep the city safe How can you go after killing the two generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou That will not stop meAnd after I am there I can act according to circumstances Then Guan Yu summoned Zhou Cang and asked him saying How many followers are there with Pei Yuanshao at Sleeping Bull Mountain I should think four or five hundred Now said Guan Yu I am going to take the shortest road to find my brotherCan you go to summon your army and lead them along the high road to assist me With instructions to bring up this force Zhou Cang left while Guan Yu and Sun Qian and their small escort went off to the northWhen they drew near the boundary Sun Qian said You must be careful how you go over you ought to stop here while I go in see Uncle Liu Bei and take the necessary steps Seeing the wisdom of this Guan Yu stopped there and sent his companion in advance he and his followers going up to a nearby farm as an abiding placeWhen they got to the farm out came a venerable man leaning on a staffAfter exchanging salutes Guan Yu told the old man all about himselfMy family name is also Guan my personal name being Ding said the old manI know your reputation and I am very happy to meet you Guan Ding sent for his two sons to come and make their bowHe put up Guan Yu in his house and provided for his escort in the farm buildingsIn the meantime Sun Qian had made his way to Jizhou City and told Liu Bei the whole storyLiu Bei said Jian Yong also is hereWe will send for him secretly to talk over this matter They did so and when the usual salutes had been exchanged they three began to consider the means of getting awayMy lord said Jian Yong you see Yuan Shao personally and say you wish to go to Jingzhou to see Liu Biao about a scheme for the destruction of Cao CaoThat will give an excuse That seems best said Liu Bei but will you go with me I have another plan to extricate myself said Jian YongHaving settled their plans Liu Bei soon went in to see his protector and suggested Liu Biao is strong and well posted his help should be sought against our enemy I have sent messengers repeatedly to ask his help said Yuan Shao but he is unwilling As he and I are of the same family he will not refuse me if I go and ask him said Liu BeiCertainly he is worth much more than Liu Pi you shall go I have just heard Yuan Shao continued that Guan Yu has left Cao Cao and wants to come hereIf he does I will put him to death out of revenge for my two beloved generalsYan Liang and Wen Chou Illustrious Sir you wished to employ him and so I sent for himNow you threaten to put him to deathThe two men he slew were but deers compared with such a tiger as he is When you exchange a couple of deers for a tiger you need not complain of the bargain Really I like him said Yuan Shao I was only jokingYou can send another messenger for him and tell him to come soon May I send Sun Qian for him Certainly After Liu Bei had gone Jian Yong came in and said to Yuan Shao If Liu Bei goes he will not come back I would better go to speak to Liu BiaoAnd I can keep a watch on Liu Bei Yuan Shao agreed and issued orders for both to goOn the subject of the mission Guo Tu came in to his chief to dissuade himSaid Guo Tu Liu Bei went to speak to Liu Pi but he accomplished nothingNow you are sending Jian Yong with him and I am sure neither will ever return Do not be too suspicious said Yuan Shao Jian Yong is clever enough That was the end of the interviewForthwith Liu Bei sent Sun Qian back to Guan Yu and then with Jian Yong took leave of Yuan Shao and rode out of the city As soon as they reached the border line they met Sun Qian and all three rode off to Guan Dings farm to meet Guan YuHe came out to welcome them bowed and then seized his brothers hands while tears streamed down his facePresently the two sons of their host came to bow to the visitorsLiu Bei asked their namesThese are of the same name as myself said Guan YuThe sons are Guan Ning who is a student and Guan Ping who is to be a soldier I have been thinking of sending the younger in your train General said old Guan Ding Would you take him What is his age said Liu BeiHe is eighteen Liu Bei said Since O Senior you are so kind I venture to suggest that your son should be adopted by my brother who has no son of his ownWhat think you of that Guan Ding was perfectly willing so he called Guan Ping and bade him make a sons obeisance to Guan Yu and to style Liu Bei Uncle Then it was time to get on their way lest they should be pursued and with Guan Yu went Guan PingGuan Ding and Guan Ning escorted them a long distance and then returnedThe party took the road to Sleeping Bull MountainBefore they had gone very far they met Zhou Cang with a small party He was woundedHe was introduced to Liu Bei who asked him how it was He replied Before I reached the hill a certain warrior all alone had fought with my friend Pei Yuanshao and killed him Then many of our troops surrendered to him and he occupied our old campWhen I reached it I tried to allure the soldiers back to my side but only succeeded with a few The others were too afraidI got angry and engaged the interloper who however worsted me time after time and wounded me thrice Who is the warriorWhat does he look like asked Liu BeiAll I know he is a doughty fighter I do not know his name Thereafter they advanced toward the hill with Guan Yu in front and Liu Bei in rearWhen they drew near Zhou Cang began to abuse his enemy who soon appeared mailed and armed coming down the hill like a tornadoSuddenly Liu Bei rode out waving his whip and shouting O Zhao Yun I am here to look for you Indeed the rider was Zhao YunHe instantly slipped out of the saddle and bowed by the roadside Liu Bei dismounted to talk with him and ask how he came to be thereWhen I left you I had no idea that Gongsun Zan was a man who would listen to no reason The result was disaster and he perished in the flames Yuan Shao invited me to him several times but I thought too little of him to goThen I wanted to go to Xuzhou to you but you had lost that place and Guan Yu had gone over to Cao Cao and you had joined Yuan ShaoSeveral times I thought of coming to you but I feared Yuan ShaoSo I drifted from one place to another with nowhere to rest till I happened to come this way and Pei Yuanshao tried to steal my horse So I slew him and took possession of his campI heard Zhang Fei was in Gucheng but thought it might be only a rumorAnd so the days have passed till this happy meeting Liu Bei told Zhao Yun all that had happened to him since they parted and so did Guan YuSaid Liu Bei The first time I saw you I felt drawn to you and did not want to part from youI am very happy to meet you again In all my wanderings trying to find a lord worth serving I have seen no one like youNow I have reached your side that is enough for all my lifeI care not what may happen to me Next they burned the camp on Sleeping Bull Mountain after which they all took the road back to Gucheng where they were welcomedThey exchanged the stories of their several adventures and the two ladies related the valiant deeds of Guan Yu whereat Liu Bei was too affected to speakThen they performed a great sacrifice to Heaven and Earth with the slaughter of a bull and a horse The soldiers also were recompensed for their toils Liu Bei surveyed the conditions around him and found therein much to rejoice at His two brothers were restored to his side and none of his helpers were missing Moreover he had gained Zhao Yun and Guan Yu had acquired an adopted son Guan Ping Another commander had joined his ranks in the person of Zhou Cang There was every occasion for feasting and gratificationScattered wide were the brothers none knew anothers retreat Joyfully now they foregather dragon and tigers meetAt this time the forces under the command of Liu Bei Guan Yu Zhang Fei Zhao Yun Sun Qian Jian Yong Mi Zhu Mi Fang Guan Ping and Zhou Cang numbered four or five thousand soldiersLiu Bei was in favor of leaving Gucheng and occupying Runan and just then Liu Pi and Gong Du the commanders of that city sent to invite him to go there So they went There they devoted all their efforts to strengthen their army both horse and footYuan Shao was much annoyed when Liu Bei did not return and at first was for sending a force after himHowever Guo Tu dissuaded himLiu Bei needs cause you no anxiety Cao Cao is your one enemy and must be destroyedEven Liu Biao though strongly posted on the river is none too terribleThere is Sun Ce on the southeast of the Great River strong feared with wide domain of six territories a large army and able counselors and leaders you should make an alliance there against Cao Cao Guo Tu won his chief to his view and wrote to Sun Ce sending the letter by Chen Zhen Just as one warrior leaves the north Another from the east comes forthFuture chapters will reveal the outcome of these dispositions CHAPTER The Little Chief Of The South Slays Yu Ji The Green Eyed Boy Lays Hold On The South Sun Ce gradually became supreme on the southeast of the Great River In the fourth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  he took Lujiang by the defeat of the Governor Liu Xun He dispatched Yu Fan with a dispatch to Governor Hua Xin of Yuzhang and Hua Xin surrenderedThence Sun Ces renown increased and he boldly sent a memorial on his military successes to the Emperor by the hand of Zhang HongCao Cao saw in Sun Ce a powerful rival and said He is a lion difficult to contend with So Cao Cao betrothed his niece daughter of Cao Ren to Sun Kuang the youngest brother of Sun Ce thus connecting the two families by marriageCao Cao also retained Zhang Hong near him in the capitalThen Sun Ce sought the title of Grand Commander one of the highest offices of state but Cao Cao prevented the attainment of this ambition and Sun Ce keenly resented it Henceforward his thoughts turned toward an attack on Cao CaoAbout this time the Governor of Wujun Xu Gong sent a secret letter to the capital to Cao Cao sayingSun Ce is a turbulent fellow of the Xiang Yu type  and the government ought under the appearance of showing favor to him to recall him to the capital for he is a danger in the southern regions But the bearer of this letter was captured on the Great River and sent to Sun Ce who immediately put him to deathThen Sun Ce treacherously sent to ask the author of the letter to come and consult over some affair The unsuspecting Xu Gong cameSun Ce produced the letter saying So you wish to send me to the land of the dead eh And thereupon the executioners came in and strangled Xu GongThe family of the victim scattered but three of his clients determined to avenge him if only they could find some means of attacking Sun CeOne day Sun Ce went hunting in the hills to the west of Dantu A stag was started and Sun Ce pressed after it at topmost speed and followed it deep into the forestPresently he came upon three armed men standing among the treesRather surprised to see them there he reined in and asked who they wereWe belong to Han Dangs army and are shooting deer was the reply So Sun Ce shook his bridle to proceedBut just as he did so one of the men thrust at him with a spear and wounded his thighSun Ce drew the sword at his side dashed forward and tried to cut down the aggressor The blade of his sword suddenly fell to the ground only the hilt remaining in his handThen one of the assassins drew his bow and an arrow wounded Sun Ce in the cheekSun Ce plucked out the arrow and shot at the offender who fell but the other two attacked him furiously with their spears shouting We are Xu Gongs men and his avengers Sun Ce then understoodBut he had no weapons save his bow against themHe tried to draw off keeping them at bay striking with his bow but the fight was getting too much for him and both he and his steed were wounded in several placesHowever just at the critical moment Cheng Pu and some of his own officers came up and they minced the assassins into pieces But their lord was in a sorry plight His face was streaming with blood and some of the wounds were very severeThey tore up his robe and therewith bound up his wounds and they carried him homeA poem in praise of the three avengers says O Sun Ce was a warrior and a stranger he to fear But he was basely murdered while hunting of the deerYet were they leal who slew him to avenge a murdered lord Self immolated like Yu Rang they dreaded not the swordBadly wounded Sun Ce was borne to his homeThey sent to call the famous physician Hua Tuo but he was far away and could not be found However a disciple of his came and the wounded man was committed to his careThe arrowheads were poisoned said the physician and the poison has penetrated deepIt will take a hundred days of perfect repose before danger will be pastBut if you give way to passion or anger the wounds will not heal Sun Ces temperament was hasty and impatient and the prospect of such a slow recovery was very distastefulHowever he remained quiet for some twenty of the hundred days Then came Zhang Hong from the capital and Sun Ce insisted on seeing and questioning himCao Cao fears you my lord very greatly said Zhang Hong and his advisers have exceeding respect for you all except Guo Jia What did Guo Jia say asked the sick chieftain Zhang Hong remained silent which only irritated his master and caused him to demand to be toldSo Zhang Hong had to speak the truth He said The fact is Guo Jia told Cao Cao that he needed not fear you that you were frivolous and unready impulsive and shallow just a stupid swaggerer who would one day come to his death at the hands of some mean person This provoked the sick man beyond endurance The fool how dare he say this of me cried Sun Ce I will take Xuchang from Cao Cao I swear It was no more a question of repose Ill as he was he wanted to begin preparations for an expedition at once They remonstrated with him reminded him of the physicians orders and urged him to restYou are risking your priceless self in a moments anger said Zhang ZhaoThen arrived Chen Zhen the messenger from Yuan Shao and Sun Ce would have him brought inHe said My master wishes to ally himself with the South Land in an attack on Cao Cao Such a proposal was just after Sun Ces heartAt once he called a great meeting of his officers in the wall tower and prepared a banquet in honor of the messengerWhile this was in progress Sun Ce noticed many of his officers whispering to each other and they all began to go down from the banquet chamber He could not understand this and inquired of the attendants near him what it meantThey told him Saint Yu Ji has just gone by and the officers have gone down to pay their respects to him Sun Ce rose from his place and went and leaned over the railing to look at the manHe saw a Taoist priest in snowy garb leaning on his staff in the middle of the road while the crowd about him burnt incense and made obeisanceWhat wizard fellow is this Bring him here said Sun Ce This is Yu Ji said the attendantsHe lives in the east and goes to and fro distributing charms and draughtsHe has cured many people as everybody will tell you and they say he is a saintHe must not be profaned This only angered Sun Ce the more and he told them to arrest the man at once or disobey at their perilSo there being no help for it they went down into the road and hustled the saint up the stepsYou madman How dare you incite humans to evil said Sun Ce I am but a poor priest of the Langye MountainsMore than half a century ago when gathering simples in the woods I found near the Diamond Spring a book called The Way of Peace It contains a hundred and more chapters and taught me how to cure the diseases of humansWith this in my possession I had only one thing to do to devote myself to spreading its teachings and saving humankind I have never taken any thing from the people Can you say I incite people to evil deeds You say you take nothing whence came your clothes and your foodThe fact is you are one of the Yellow Scarves and you will work mischief if you are left alive Then turning to his attendants Sun Ce ordered Take him away and put him to death Zhang Zhao interceded The Taoist Saint has been here in the east these many yearsHe has never done any harm and does not deserve death or punishment I tell you I will kill these wizard fellows just as I would cattle The officials in a body interceded even the guest of honor Chen Zhen but in vain Sun Ce refused to be placatedHe ordered Yu Ji to be imprisonedThe banquet came to an end and Chen Zhen retired to his lodging Sun Ce also returned to his palaceHis treatment of the Taoist Holy Man was theme of general conversation and soon reached the ears of his motherLady Wu sent for her son to the ladies apartments and said to him They tell me you have put Saint Yu Ji in bondsHe has cured many sick people and the common folk hold him in great reverenceDo not harm him He is simply a wizard who upsets the multitude with his spells and craft He must be put to death replied Sun Ce Lady Wu entreated him to stay his hand but he was obstinateDo not heed the gossip of the streets Mother said heI must be judge of these matters However Sun Ce sent to the prison for Yu Ji in order to interrogate himNow the gaolers having a great respect for Yu Ji and faith in his powers were very indulgent to him and did not keep him in the collarHowever when Sun Ce sent for him he went with collar and fetters all completeSun Ce had heard of their indulgence and punished the gaolers and ordered the prisoner thereafter to be put in constant tortureZhang Zhao and many others moved by pity made a petition which they humbly presented and they offered to become surety for himSun Ce said to them Gentlemen you are all great scholars but why do you not understand reasonFormerly in Jiaozhou was Imperial Protector Zhang Jing who was deluded by these vicious doctrines into beating drums twanging lyres burning incense and such things He wore a red turban and represented himself as able to ensure victory to an army But he was slain by the enemyThere is nothing in all this only none of you will see itI am going to put this fellow to death in order to stop the spread of this pernicious doctrine Lu Fan interposed saying I know very well this Yu Ji can control the weatherIt is very dry just now why not make him pray for rain as an amercement We will see what sort of witchcraft he is equal to said Sun CeThereupon he had the prisoner brought in loosed his fetters and sent him up to an altar to intercede for rainThe docile Taoist Yu Ji prepared to do as he was bidden He first bathed himself then dressed himself in clean garments After that he bound his limbs with a cord and lay down in the fierce heat of the sunThe people came in crowds to look onSaid Yu Ji I will pray for three spans high of refreshing rain for the benefit of the people nevertheless I shall not escape death thereby The people said But if your prayer be efficacious our lord must believe in your powers The day of fate has come for me and there is no escape Presently Sun Ce came near the altar and announced that if rain had not fallen by noon he would burn the priestAnd to confirm this he bade them prepare the pyreAs it neared noon a strong wind sprang up and the clouds gathered from all quarters But there was no rainIt is near noon said Sun Ce Clouds are of no account without rainHe is only an impostor Sun Ce bade his attendants lay the priest on the pyre and pile wood around him and apply the torchFanned by the gale the flames rose rapidly Then appeared in the sky above a wreath of black vapor followed by roaring thunder and vivid lightning peal on peal and flash on flash And the rain fell in a perfect delugeIn a short time the streets became rivers and torrents It was indeed a threespan fallYu Ji who was still lying upon the pile of firewood cried in a loud voice O Clouds cease thy rain and let the glorious sun appear Thereupon officials and people helped the priest down loosened the cord that bound him and bowed before him in gratitude for the rainBut Sun Ce boiled with rage at seeing his officers and the people gathered in groups and kneeling in the water regardless of the damage to their clothing Rain or shine are as nature appoints them and the wizard has happened to hit upon a moment of change what are you making all this fuss about cried heThen he drew his sword and told the attendants to smite the Taoist Saint therewith They all besought him to hold his handYou want to follow Yu Ji in rebellion I suppose cried Sun CeThe officers now thoroughly cowed by the rage of their lord were silent and showed no opposition when the executioners seized the Taoist Saint and beheaded himAs the head fell they saw just a wreath of black smoke drift away to the northeast where lay the Langye MountainsThe corpse was exposed in the market place as a warning to enchanters and wizards and such peopleThat night there came a very violent storm and when it calmed down at daylight there was no trace of the body of Yu JiThe guards reported this and Sun Ce in his wrath sentenced them to deathBut as he did so he saw Yu Ji calmly walking toward him as if the Taoist Saint were still aliveSun Ce drew his sword and darted forward to strike at the wraith but he fainted and fell to the groundThey carried him to his chamber and in a short time he recovered consciousnessHis mother Lady Wu came to visit him and said My son you have done wrong to slay the holy one and this is your retribution Mother when I was a boy I went with Father to wars where people are cut down as one cuts reed stalks There is not much retribution about such doingsI have put this fellow to death and so checked a great evilWhere does retribution come in This comes of want of faith she repliedNow you must avert the evil by meritorious deeds My fate depends on Heaven wizards can do me no harm so why avert anything His mother saw that it was useless to try persuasion but she told his attendants to do some good deeds secretly whereby the evil should be turned asideThat night about the third watch as Sun Ce lay in his chamber he suddenly felt a chill breeze which seemed to extinguish the lamps for a moment although they soon brightened again and he saw in the lamp light the form of Yu Ji standing near his bedSun Ce said I am the sworn foe of witchcraft and I will purge the world of all such as deal in magicYou are a spirit and how dare you approach me Reaching down a sword that hung at the head of his bed he hurled it at the phantom which then disappearedWhen his mother heard this story her grief redoubledSun Ce ill as he was went to see his mother and did his utmost to reassure her She said Confucius the Teacher saysHow abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them and Prayer has been made to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds You must have faithYou sinned in putting Saint Yu Ji to death and retribution is sureI have already sent to have sacrifices performed at the JadePure Monastery and you should go in person to prayMay all come right Sun Ce could not withstand such a mandate from his mother so mustering all his strength he managed to get into a sedan chair and went to the monastery where the Taoists received him respectfully and begged him to light the incenseHe did so but he returned no thanks To the surprise of all the smoke from the brazier instead of floating upwards and dissipating collected in a mass that gradually shaped itself into an umbrella and there on the top sat Yu JiSun Ce simply spat abuse and went out of the temple As he passed the gates lo Yu Ji stood there gazing at him with angry eyesDo you see that wizard fellow said he to those about himThey said they saw nothingMore angry than ever he flung his sword at the figure by the gate The sword struck one of his escorts who fellSun Ce told them to bury the manBut as he went out of the courtyard he saw Yu Ji walking inThis temple is nothing more than a lurking place for sorcerers and wizards and such people said Sun CeWhereupon he took a seat in front of the building and sent for five hundred soldiers to pull the place downWhen they went up on the roof to strip off the tiles Sun Ce saw Yu Ji standing on the main beam flicking tiles to the groundMore angry than ever Sun Ce told them to drive out the priests belonging to the place and burn itThey did so and when the flames rose their highest Sun Ce saw the dead Taoist Yu Ji standing in the midst of the fireSun Ce returned home still in a bad humor which increased when he saw the form of Yu Ji standing at his gateHe would not enter but mustered his army and went into camp outside the city walls And there he summoned his officers to meet him and talk over joining Yuan Shao in an attack on Cao Cao They assembled but they remonstrated with him and begged him to consider his precious healthThat night he slept in the camp and again saw Yu Ji this time with his hair hanging looseSun Ce raged at the vision without cessationNext day his mother called him into the city and he went She was shocked at the change in his appearance he looked so utterly miserable Her tears fellMy son said Lady Wu how wasted you are He had a mirror brought and looked at himself he was indeed so gaunt and thin that he was almost frightened and exclaimed How do I come to look so haggard While he spoke Yu Ji appeared in the mirrorHe struck it and shrieked Then the half healed wounds reopened and he fainted He was raised and borne withinWhen he recovered consciousness he said This is the end I shall die He sent for Zhang Zhao and his other chief officers and his brother Sun Quan and they gathered in his chamber He gave them his dying charge saying In the disordered state of the empire the domains of Wu and Yue  with its strong defense of the three rivers and resourceful lands has a brilliant futureYou Zhang Zhao must assist my brother So saying Sun Ce handed his seal to Sun Quan saying For manipulating the might of Wu so as to make it the deciding force among the factions and then obtaining the whole empire you are not so suited as I but in encouraging the wise and confiding in the able and getting the best out of every one for the preservation of this land I should not succeed as you willRemember with what toil and labor your father and I have won what we possess and take good care thereof Sun Quan wept as he knelt to receive the seal and the dying Sun Ce turned to his mother saying Mother the days allotted of Heaven have run out and I can no longer serve my tender motherI have given over the seal to my brother and trust that you will advise him early and late and see that he lives worthy of his predecessors AlasYour brother is full young for such a task said his mother weeping I know not what may happen He is far abler than I and fully equal to the task of rulingShould he have doubts upon internal affairs he must turn to Zhang Zhao for outer matters he must consult Zhou YuIt is a pity Zhou Yu is absent so that I cannot give him my charge face to face To his brothers Sun Ce said When I am gone you must help your brotherShould any discord arise in the family let the others punish the wrongdoer and let not his ashes mingle with those of his ancestors in the family vaults The young men wept at these wordsThen he called for his wife Lady Qiao and said Unhappily we have to part while still in the full vigor of life You must care for my motherYour sister will come to see you presently and you can ask her to tell her husband Zhou Yu to help my brother in all things and make my brother keep to the way I have taught him to walk in Then Sun Ce closed his eyes and soon after passed awayHe was only twentysixPeople called him first of the chieftains The east had felt his might He watched like a tiger crouchingStruck as a hawk in flight There was peace in the lands he ruled His fame ran with the windBut he died and left to another The great scheme in his mindAs his brother breathed his last Sun Quan sank by the bed and weptThis is not the time to mourn said Zhang ZhaoFirst see to the funeral ceremonies and that the government is safe So the new ruler dried his tearsThe superintendence of the funeral was confided to Sun Jing and then Zhang Zhao led his young master to the hall to receive the felicitations of his officersSun Quan was endowed with a square jaw and a large mouth he had green eyes and a dark brown beardFormerly when Minister Liu Wan had gone to Wu to visit the Sun family he said of the family of brothers I have looked well at them all and they are all clever and perspicacious but none of them have the very ultimate degree of good fortune Only the second Sun Quan has the look of a deep thinkerHis face is remarkable and his build unusual and he has the look of one who will come to great honor When Sun Quan succeeded to his brother and his brothers might there was still some reorganization to be doneSoon Zhou Yu had arrived WujunThe young ruler received him very graciously and said I need have no anxiety now that you have come Zhou Yu had been sent to hold BaqiuWhen he heard that his chief had been wounded he thought it well to return to see how he wasBut Sun Ce had died before Zhou Yu could arriveHe hurried to be present at the funeralWhen Zhou Yu went to wail at the coffin of his late chief Lady Wu the dead mans mother came out to deliver her sons last injunctionsWhen she had told him the last charge Zhou Yu bowed to the earth saying I shall exert the puny powers I have in your service as long as I live Shortly after Sun Quan came in and after receiving Zhou Yus obeisance said I trust you will not forget my brothers charge to you Zhou Yu bowed saying I would willingly suffer any form of death for you How best can I maintain this great charge which I have inherited from my father and brother He who wins people prospers he who loses them failsYour present plan should be to seek humans of high aims and farseeing views and you can establish yourself firmly My brother bade me consult Zhang Zhao for internal administration and yourself on external matters said Sun Quan Zhang Zhao is wise and understanding and equal to such a taskI am devoid of talent and fear to take such responsibility but I venture to recommend to you as a helper one Lu Su a man of LinhuaiThis mans bosom hides strategy and his breast conceals tacticsHe lost his father in early life and has been a perfectly filial son to his motherHis family is rich and renowned for charity to the needyWhen I was stationed at Juchao I led some hundreds of soldiers across Linhuai We were short of grain Hearing that the Lu family had two granaries there each holding three thousand carts I went to ask for helpLu Su pointed to one granary and said Take that as a gift Such was his generosityHe has always been fond of fencing and horse archery He was living in QueHis grandmother died while he was there and he went to bury her in Dongcheng and then his friend Liu Ziyang wished to engage him to go to Chaohu and join Zheng Bao However he hesitated about that and has not gone yetYou should invite him without loss of time Sun Quan at once sent Zhou Yu to engage the services of this man and Zhou Yu set outWhen the obeisance was over Zhou Yu laid before Lu Su the inducements that his own master held outLu Su replied I have been engaged by Liu Ziyang to go to Chaohu and I am just starting thither Said Zhou Yu Of old Ma Yuan said to Liu Xiu This is an age when not only do princes select their ministers but ministers must also choose their princes Now our General Sun Quan calls to him the wise and treats his officers wellThus he engages the help of the wonderful and gets the services of the extraordinary in a way that few others doBut if you are not engaged elsewhere come with me to the South Land as the best thing to do Lu Su returned with Zhou Yu and saw Sun Quan who treated him with the greatest deference and with him discussed affairs very fullyThe conference proved so interesting that it went on all day and neither felt fatigueOne day at the close of the usual reception Sun Quan kept Lu Su to dine with him They sat up late and by and by slept on the same couch as would the closest of friendsIn the dead of night Sun Quan said to his bedfellow The dynasty is failing and everything is at sixes and sevensI have received a great charge from my father and brother and I am thinking of imitating the actions of the celebrated Protectors of Reign Wen and Huan and becoming the leader of the feudal lords and I pray you instruct me Lu Su replied Of old the Founder of Han the Supreme Ancestor wished to honor and serve Emperor Yi of Qin but could not on account of Xiang Yus evildoingsNow Cao Cao can be compared with Xiang Yu how can you be the protector of the EmperorMy humble opinion is that the Hans have fallen beyond hope of recovery and Cao Cao cannot be destroyed and that the only key to your big schemes is to secure your present position in order to keep the master hand and control the combinations among the othersNow take advantage of the turmoil in the north to smite Huang Zu and attack Liu Biao in JingzhouThereby you will command the whole length of the Great River Then you may consolidate the empire and become the Son of HeavenThis was how the Supreme Ancestor acted Hearing this Sun Quan was very greatly pleased He threw on some clothing got up and thanked his newlyfound adviserNext day Sun Quan gave Lu Su costly gifts and sent robes and silks to his motherLu Su then recommended a friend of his to Sun Quans notice a man of wide reading and great abilityHe was also a filial son His name was Zhuge Jin and he came from NanyangSun Quan treated Zhuge Jin as a superior guestThis man dissuaded Sun Quan from making common cause with Yuan Shao but advised him rather to favor Cao Cao against whom he could plan when occasion servedSun Quan therefore sent back the messenger Chen Zhen with dispatches that broke off all negotiationsHearing of Sun Ces death Cao Cao was for sending an expedition against the southBut Zhang Hong dissuaded him saying It would be mean to take advantage of the period of mourningAnd if you should not overcome him you will make him an enemy instead of being a friendIt would be preferable to treat him generously So Cao Cao memorialized the Throne and obtained for Sun Quan the title of General and Governor of Kuaiji while Zhang Hong was appointed Commander under Sun QuanAnd a seal of office was sent to Sun Quan by Zhang HongThe new appointment pleased Sun Quan and he was greatly glad to get Zhang Hong back again Then Zhang Hong was sent to act jointly with Zhang Zhao in the administration Zhang Hong was the means of getting another into Sun Quans serviceHis friend was Gu Yong a disciple of the Historian Cai YongGu Yong was a man of few words and an abstainer from wineHe was very correct in all things Sun Quan appointed Gu Yong Governor DeputyHenceforward Sun Quans rule was very prosperous and he waxed mightily in influence and won the love of all the peopleWhen Chen Zhen had returned and related the events in the South Land and told of the honors that Cao Cao had obtained for Sun Quan in return for his support Yuan Shao was very wroth and he set about preparing for an attack on Xuchang with a force of seven hundred thousand northern soldiersAlthough in the south they rest from war They rattle the spears beneath the northern starLater it will be seen which side conquered CHAPTER Shunning Advice Yuan Shao Loses Leaders and Granaries Using Strategy Cao Cao Scores Victory At GuanduHearing that Yuan Shao was hastening to attack at Guandu Xiahou Dun wrote to the capital urgently asking for reinforcements and Cao Cao told off seventy thousand troops with which he marched Xun Yu was left to guard the capitalJust as Yuan Shaos army was starting Tian Feng sent out a remonstrance from his prison cell saying My lord a hasty attack in full scale will bring disaster to our armyIt is best now to wait upon such times as Heaven should appoint Peng Ji said to Yuan Shao Why does this Tian Feng utter illomened wordsMy lord is sending forth an army in the cause of humanity and justice Easily moved to anger Yuan Shao was going to execute Tian Feng but this time he forbore at the entreaties of many of his officersHowever he was not appeased for he said I will punish Tian Feng when I return from conquering Cao Cao Meanwhile Yuan Shao hastened to startThe banners of his host filled the horizon their swords were as trees in the forestThey marched to Yangwu and there made a strong campThen Ju Shou once more opposed any hasty movement saying Though our soldiers are many they are not so bold as the enemy however veterans as are the enemy they have not ample suppliesTherefore they will wish to force on a speedy battle while our policy is to hold them off and delayIf we can keep from a decisive battle long enough the victory will be ours without fighting This advice did not appeal to Yuan ShaoSaid he threateningly Tian Feng spoke discouraging words to my armies and I will assuredly put him to death on my returnHow dare you follow in the same way Yuan Shao summoned the lictors and sent away the adviser in chains saying When I have overcome Cao Cao then will I deal with you and Tian Feng together  The huge army was camped in four divisions one toward each point of the compass The camps were thirty miles in circuitScouts and spies were sent out to discover the strong and the weak points of the enemyCao Caos army arrived and were smitten with fear when they heard of the strength of their enemyThe leader called together his councilThen said Adviser Xun You The enemy are many but not terribleOurs is an army of veterans every soldier of ours worth ten of theirs but our advantage lies in a speedy battle for unhappily our stores are insufficient for a long campaign You speak to the point said Cao CaoI think the same Therefore Cao Cao issued orders to press noisily forward and force on a battleYuan Shaos soldiers took up the challenge and the two sides were arrayedOn Yuan Shaos side Shen Pei placed ten thousand of crossbowmen in ambush on the two wings while five thousand of archers held the centerThe signal for general attack was a bomb and the onset was to continue through three rolls of the drum Yuan Shao wore a silver helmet and breastplate and an embroidered robe held in by a jeweled beltHe took up his post in the center with his commandersGao Lan Zhang He Han Meng Chunyu Qiong and others ranged right and leftHis banners and ensigns made a brave showWhen Cao Caos armys center opened and the banners moved aside the chieftain appeared on horseback with his staff of doughty leaders all fully armedXu Chu Zhang Liao Xu Huang Li Dian and othersPointing with his whip at Yuan Shao Cao Cao cried In the presence of the Emperor I pressed your claims to consideration and obtained for you the title of Regent Marshal why do you now plan rebellion Yuan Shao replied You take the title of a minister of Han but you are really a rebel against the HouseYour crimes and evil deeds reach to the heavens and you are worse than the usurper Wang Mang and the rebel Dong ZhuoWhat are these slanderous words about rebellion that dare you address to me I have a command to make you prisoner I have the Girdle Decree to arrest rebels replied Yuan ShaoThen Cao Cao became wrathful and bade Zhang Liao ride forth as his championFrom the other side rode Zhang He on a curvetting steedThe two champions fought four or five bouts with no advantage to eitherIn his heart Cao Cao thought the contest amazingThen Xu Chu whirled up his sword and went to help From the other side to match him rode out Gao Lan with his spear set and the contestants were now four battling two and twoThen Cao Cao ordered three thousand troops under Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong to attack the opponents arrayThereupon on Yuan Shaos side Shen Pei gave the signal for attack and the legion of crossbowmen on the wings shot and the center archers let fly all together The arrows flew all over the field in front and Cao Caos troops could not advanceThey hastened away toward the south Yuan Shao threw his soldiers on their rear and they were brokenThey fled away toward Guandu and Yuan Shao advanced another stageHe camped near them Then Shen Pei said Now send one hundred thousand soldiers to guard Guandu and get near Cao Caos camp then build up observation mounds to get a clear view of the enemy and choose vantage points whence to shoot arrows into the midst of their hostIf we can force him to evacuate this place we shall have gained a strategic point whence Capital Xuchang can be attacked Yuan Shao adopted this suggestionFrom each of the camps they sought out the strongest veterans who dug with iron spades and carried earth to raise mounds near Cao Caos camp Cao Caos soldiers saw what their enemies were doing and were anxious to make a sortie and drive them offBut the archers and crossbowmen came out commanding the narrow throat through which it was necessary to attack and stayed themAt the end of ten days they had build up more than half a hundred mounds and on the summit of each was a lofty tower whence the archers could command their opponents campCao Caos soldiers were greatly frightened and held up their bucklers to keep off the various missilesFrom the mounds the arrows flew down like a fierce rain after each roll of drumsThe soldiers of Yuan Shaos army laughed and jeered when they saw their enemies crouching under their shields and crawling on the ground to avoid their missilesCao Cao saw that his troops were getting out of hand under this attack so he called a councilLiu Ye spoke up saying Let us make catapults and so destroy them Cao Cao at once had models brought and set cunning workers to make these stonethrowing machinesThey soon constructed some hundreds and placed them along the walls of the camp inside just opposite the high ladders on the enemys mounds Then Cao Caos troops watched for Yuan Shaos archers to ascend the towersAs soon as the archers began to shoot all the catapults began to heave stone balls into the skies and they wrought great havocThere was no shelter from the falling stones and enormous numbers of the archers were killedYuan Shaos troops called these machines Rumblers and after their appearance the archers dared not ascend the mounds to shoot Then Shen Pei the strategist thought out another planHe set troops to tunnel under the walls into the midst of Cao Caos camp and called this corps The Sappers Cao Caos soldiers saw the enemy digging out pits behind the mounds and told the chief who at once sought a counter plan from Liu YeAs Yuan Shao can no longer attack openly he is attacking secretly and is tunneling a road under ground into the midst of our camp said Liu YeBut how to meet it We can surround the camp with a deep moat which renders their tunnel useless So a deep moat was dug as quickly as possible and when the enemy sappers arrived thereat lotheir labor had been in vain and the sap was uselessCao Cao held Guandu throughout the eighth and ninth months when his army being worn out and provisions failing he began to think of giving up and returning to the capitalAs he could not make up his mind he referred his difficulties by letter to Xun Yu whom he had left to guard Xuchang The reply he got was to this effectI have received your command to decide whether to continue the campaign or retireIt appears to me that Yuan Shao assembled such large forces at Guandu with the expectation of winning a decision You Sir are very weak while he is very strong and if you cannot get the better of him he will be able to work his will on you and this will be a crisis of the empireYour opponents are indeed numerous but their leader knows not how to use themWith your military genius and discernment where are you not sure to succeedNow though your numbers are small your situation is still brighter than Liu Bangs when he faced against Xiang Yu in Jungyang and ChenggaoYou are securely entrenched with your hands on Yuan Shaos throat and even if you cannot advance that state of things cannot endure forever but must changeThis is the time to play some unexpected move and you must not miss itThe device I leave to your illustrious ingenuity This letter greatly pleased Cao Cao and he urged upon his troops to use every effort to maintain the positionYuan Shao then retired some ten miles and Cao Cao sent out scouts to ascertain his new dispositionsOne of Xu Huangs officers Shi Huan captured an enemy spy and sent him to his chiefXu Huang interrogated him and found out that a convoy of supplies was expected and that this spy and others had been sent to find out what were the risks of the routeXu Huang went at once to tell Cao CaoWhen Xun You heard that the commander of the convoy was Han Meng he said That fellow is a valiant foolA few thousand light horse sent to intercept him can capture the whole train and cause much trouble in the enemys camp Whom should I send asked Cao CaoYou might send Xu Huang he is capable of such a task So Xu Huang was deputed and he took with him Shi Huan who had captured the spy and his company And this party was supported by Zhang Liao and Xu ChuIt was night when the commissariat train of many thousands of wagons drew near Yuan Shaos campAs they passed through a defile Xu Huang and Shi Huan came out and stopped the trainHan Meng galloped up to give battle but was soon overcomeThe guard was scattered and soon the whole train was in flames The escort and their leader fled awayThe glow of the flames seen from Yuan Shaos camp caused great consternation which became fear when the escaped soldiers rode in and told their tale Yuan Shao sent out Zhang He and Gao Lan to try to intercept the raiders and they came upon Xu Huang and his companyJust as Zhang He and Gao Lan were attacking reinforcements from Zhang Liao and Xu Chu came up and the Yuan Shaos troops were between two firesThey were cut to pieces and the successful generals of Cao Cao rode back to Guandu where they were richly rewardedAs an additional safeguard Cao Cao made a supporting outpost in front of the main camp to be the apex of a triangle of defenseWhen Han Meng returned with his woeful tidings Yuan Shao was angry and threatened to put him to deathHis colleagues begged him off Then said Shen Pei Food is very important for an army in the field and must be defended with the greatest diligenceWuchao is our main depot and must be carefully guarded My plans being complete said Yuan Shao you may as well return to Capital Yejun of Jizhou and undertake the control of the suppliesLet there be no shortage So Shen Pei left the army Then a force of twenty thousand troops was told off to defend the depot in WuchaoThe leaders of this body were Chunyu Qiong Gui Yuanjin Han Juzi Lu Weihuang and Zhao RuiOf these generals Chunyu Qiong was a hard man and a heavy drinker who in his cups was a terror to the soldiersUnder the idle life of guarding the supply depot the leaders gave themselves up to indulgence and drank heavilyIn Cao Caos army also food was getting scarce and a message was sent to Capital Xuchang to send grain quicklyThe messenger with the letter however had not gone far when he fell into the hands of Yuan Shaos guards who took him to the adviser Xu YouSeeing from the letter that Cao Cao was short of supplies Xu You went to Yuan Shao and told him saying Cao Cao and we have been at grips here for a long time and Capital Xuchang must be undefendedA small army sent quickly could take it and at the same moment an attack here would deliver Cao Cao into our handsNow is the moment to strike for his supplies are short Yuan Shao replied Cao Cao is full of ruses and this letter is artfully designed to bring about a battle to suit himself If you do not take this chance he will do you some injury by and by Just at this juncture in came a dispatch from Yejun in which after some details regarding the forwarding of grain Shen Pei said he had discovered that Xu You had been in the habit of receiving bribes while in Jizhou and had winked at his relatives collecting excess taxes One of his son and nephew were then in prisonAt this Yuan Shao turned on Xu You angrily and said How can you have the face to stand before me and propose plans you extortionate fellowYou and Cao Cao have old liking for each other and he has bribed you to do his dirty work for him and help his base schemes Now you want to betray my armyI ought to take off your head but temporarily I will let your neck carry it awayGet out and never let me see you again The discredited adviser sighed and went out saying Faithful words offend his ear He is a pest and unworthy of advice from meAnd now that Shen Pei has injured my son and nephew how can I look my fellow folks in the face again And Xu You drew his sword to end his life But his people prevented thatThey said If Yuan Shao rejects your honest words then assuredly he will be taken by Cao CaoYou are an old friend of Cao Caos why not abandon the shade for the sunlight Just these few words awakened Xu You to consciousness of his position and he decided to leave Yuan Shao and go over to Cao Cao for he was an old friend Vainly now for chances lost Yuan Shao sighs once he was greatHad he taken Xu Yous advice Cao Cao had not set up a stateXu You stealthily left the camp and set out for Cao Caos lines He was captured on the way He told his captorsI am an old friend of the Prime Minister go and tell the Prime Minister that Xu You of Nanyang wishes to see him They did soCao Cao was resting in his tent his clothing loose and comfortable after the toils of the day When he heard who wished to see him he arose quite joyfully and hastily ran out on bare feet to receive Xu You Cao Cao went forth to greet him They saw each other in the distance and Cao Cao clapped his hands with gladness bowing to the ground when near enough to his visitorXu You hastened to help him rise saying Sir you a great minister should not thus salute a simple civilian like me But you are my old friend and no name or office makes any difference to us replied Cao Cao Having been unable to choose the lord I would serve I bowed my head before Yuan Shao wishing to support him sincerelyBut he was deaf to my words and disregarded my plans Wherefore I have left him and come now to see my old friend from whom I hope employment If Xu You is willing to come then have I indeed a helper said Cao CaoI desire you to give me a scheme for the destruction of Yuan Shao I counseled him to send a light force to take Capital Xuchang and at the same time attack here in full scale so that head and tail be both attacked Cao Cao was alarmed saying If he does so I am lost How much grain have you in store said the new adviserEnough for a year I think not quite said Xu You smilingWell half a year The visitor shook out his sleeves rose and hurried toward the door of the tent saying I offer him good counsel and he repays me with deceitCould I have expected it Cao Cao held him back Do not be angry said he I will tell you the truth Really I have here only enough for three months Everybody says you are a marvel of wickedness and indeed it is true said Xu You But who does not know that in war there is no objection to deceit replied Cao CaoThen whispering in Xu Yous ear he said Actually here I have only supplies for this months use O do not throw dust in my eyes any more Your grain is exhausted and I know it Cao Cao was startled for he thought no one knew of the straits he was inHow did you find that out said Cao CaoXu You produced the captured letter saying Who wrote that Where did you get it Whereupon Xu You told Cao Cao the story of the captured messengerCao Cao seized him by the hand saying Since our old friendship has brought you to me I hope you have some plan to suggest to me Xu You said To oppose a great army with a small one is to walk in the way of destruction unless you inflict quick defeatI can propose a plan which will defeat the innumerable hordes of Yuan Shao without fighting a battleBut will you follow my advice I very much desire to know your plan said Cao Cao Your enemys stores of all kinds are at Wuchao where the commander of the guard is that drunkard Chunyu QiongYou can send some of your trusty veterans to pretend they belong to one of Yuan Shaos generals Jiang Qi sent to help guard the depot These soldiers can find an opportunity to fire the grain and stores of all kinds which will upset all Yuan Shaos calculations In three days Yuan Shao is no more Cao Cao greatly approvedHe treated Xu You very liberally and kept him in his campForthwith he chose five thousand of horse and foot ready for the expeditionZhang Liao protested saying The enterprise will be futile as the grain depot will certainly be well guardedWithout caution we may be victims of the treachery on the part of the newly arrived Xu You Xu You is no traitor said Cao CaoHe has come sent by Heaven to defeat Yuan ShaoIf we do not get grain it will be hard to hold out and I have either to follow his advice or sit still and be hemmed inIf he were a traitor he would hardly remain in my campMoreover this raid has been my desire for a long timeHave no doubts the raid will certainly succeed Well then you must look out for an attack here while the camp is undefended That is already well provided for said Cao Cao gleefully The arrangements for the raid on the grain depot were made with extreme care to ensure successCao Cao assigned Xun You Jia Xu and Cao Hong to guard the main camp together with Xu You Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan to guard the left camp Cao Ren and Li Dian to guard the right camp When all was ready they set out Cao Cao himself in the center with Zhang Liao and Xu Chu as van leaders and Xu Huang and Yu Jin as rear guard The army showed the ensigns of their opponents The troops carried bundles of grass and faggots to make a blaze The soldiers were gagged and the horses tied round the muzzles so as to prevent any noise They set out at duskThe night was fine and the stars shone brightlyJu Shou still a prisoner in Yuan Shaos camp saw the stars were very brilliant and told his gaolers to conduct him out to the central pavilion whence he could study themWhile watching he saw the planet Venus invade the quarter of the Bear and Lyra which startled him very greatly Some misfortune is near said Ju ShouSo although it was still night he went to see his masterBut Yuan Shao was sleeping after indulgence in too much wine and was in bad humor However when they had roused him saying that the prisoner had a secret message to deliver he got upWhile I happened to be studying the aspect of the heavens said the night visitor I saw Venus then between Hydra and Cancer suddenly shoot into the neighborhood of the Bear and LyraThere is danger of a robber raid and special precautions must be taken at the grain depotLose no time in sending good soldiers and vigorous leaders thither and keep a lookout on the byways among the hills that you may escape the wiles of Cao Cao You are a criminal said Yuan ShaoHow dare you come with such wild nonsense to upset my armies And turning to the gaolers Yuan Shao continued I bade you confine him why did you let him come Then he issued orders to put the gaolers to death and appointed others to keep the prisoner in close custodyJu Shou went away wiping his falling tears and sighing deeply Our soldiers destruction is at hand and I know not where our poor corpses may find a resting place Blunt truth offended Yuan Shao Too stupid any plan to make His stores destroyed this is evident That Jizhou also is at stake Cao Caos raiding party went along through the nightPassing one of Yuan Shaos outpost camps they were challengedCao Cao sent forward a man to say Jiang Qi has orders to go to Wuchao to guard the grain stores Seeing that the raiders marched under the ensigns of Yuan Shao the guard had no suspicions and let them passAt every post this ruse was effective and they got safely throughThey reached their objective at the end of the fourth watch the straw and wood were placed in position without loss of time and the blaze started Then Cao Caos commanders beat to attackAt this time Chunyu Qiong and his companions were all asleep after a heavy drinking boutHowever when the alarm was given they sprang up and asked what was the matterThe hubbub was indescribable Very soon the fuddled officers were caught with hooks and hauled out of their campYuan Shaos generals Gui Yuanjin and Zhao Rui were just returning from taking grain to the camp and seeing the flames arise they hastened to assistSome of Cao Caos soldiers ran to him saying The enemy is coming up in the rearSend reinforcements But Cao Cao only replied Press on to the front till the enemy is actually close at hand and then face about So the attack was pressed on and they all hastened forwardVery soon the fire gained strength and thick smoke hung all around filling the skyWhen Gui Yuanjin and Zhao Rui drew near Cao Cao turned about and attacked themThey could not stand this for a moment and both generals were killed Finally the stores of grain and forage were utterly destroyedThe commander Chunyu Qiong was made prisoner and taken to Cao Cao who ordered him to be deprived of ears nose and hands He was bound on a horse and sent thus horribly mutilated to his master From Yuan Shaos camp the flames of the burning depot were seen away in the north and they knew what they meant Yuan Shao hastily summoned his officers to a council to send a rescue partyZhang He offered to go with Gao Lan but Guo Tu said You may not go it is certain that Cao Cao is there in person wherefore his camp is undefendedLet loose our soldiers on the camp and that will speedily bring Cao Cao back againThis is how Sun Bin besieged Wei and thereby rescued Hao  But Zhang He said Not so Cao Cao is too wily not to have fully prepared against a chance attackIf we attack his camp and fail and Chunyu Qiong should be caught we shall all be captured too Guo Tu said Cao Cao will be too intent on the destruction of the grain to think of leaving a guardI entreat you to attack his camp So Yuan Shao sent five thousand soldiers under Zhang He and Gao Lan to attack Cao Caos camp and he sent ten thousand with Jiang Qi to go to recover the grain storeNow after overcoming Chunyu Qiong Cao Caos troops dressed themselves in the armor and clothing of the defeated soldiers and put out their emblems thus posing as defeated force running back to their own headquartersAnd when they happened upon Jiang Qis rescue body they said they had been beaten at Wuchao and were retreating So Cao Caos troops were suffered to pass without molestation while Jiang Qi hastened onBut soon Jiang Qi came to Zhang Liao and Xu Chu who cried out Stop And before Jiang Qi could make any opposition Zhang Liao had cut him downSoon his force were killed or dispersed and the victors sent false messengers to Yuan Shaos camp to say that Jiang Qi had attacked and driven away the attackers of the granaries So no more relief were sent that wayHowever Yuan Shao sent reinforcements to GuanduIn due course the Yuan Shaos force came down upon Cao Caos camp at Guandu and the defendersXiahou Dun Cao Ren and Cao Hongat once came out and fought them on three sides so that they were worstedBy the time reinforcements arrived Cao Caos army returning from the raid had also come and Yuan Shaos army were attacked in the rear So they were quite surroundedHowever Zhang He and Gao Lan managed to force their way out and got away When the remains of the defenders of the grain stores reached their masters camp they were musteredSeeing the mutilated state of their one time leader Yuan Shao asked how Chunyu Qiong had come to betray his trust and to suffer thus and the soldiers told their lord The General was intoxicated at the time of the attack So Yuan Shao ordered Chunyu Qiong to be forthwith executedGuo Tu fearing lest Zhang He and Gao Lan would return and testify the whole truth began to intrigue against them First Guo Tu went to his lord saying Those two Zhang He and Gao Lan were certainly very glad when your armies were defeated Why do you say this asked Yuan ShaoO they have long cherished a desire to go over to Cao Cao so when you sent them on the duty of destroying his camp they did not do their best and so brought about this disaster Yuan Shao accordingly sent to recall these two to be interrogated as to their faults But Guo Tu sent a messenger in advance to warn them as though in friendly guise of the adverse fate that awaited themSo when the orders reached them to return to answer for their faults Gao Lan asked For what reason are we recalled Indeed I do not know said the messengerGao Lan drew his sword and killed the messengerZhang He was astonished at this demonstration but Gao Lan said Our lord has allowed some one to malign us and say we have been bought by Cao CaoWhat is the sense in our sitting still and awaiting destructionRather let us surrender to Cao Cao in reality and save our lives I have been wanting to do this for some time replied Zhang HeWherefore both with their companies made their way to Cao Caos camp to surrenderWhen they arrived Xiahou Dun said to his master These two have come to surrender but I have doubts about them Cao Cao replied I will meet them generously and win them over even if they have treachery in their hearts The camp gates were opened to the two officers and they were invited to enterThey laid down their weapons removed their armor and bowed to the ground before Cao Cao who said If Yuan Shao had listened to you he would not have suffered defeatNow you two coming to surrender are like Wei Zi leaving the falling House of Shang to go to Yin and Han Xin leaving Xiang Yu to go over to the rising House of Han Cao Cao made then Generals and conferred upon Zhang He the title of Lord of Duting and upon Gao Lan Lord of Donglai which pleased them muchAnd so as Yuan Shao had formerly driven sway his adviser Xu You so now he had alienated two leaders and had lost his stores at Wuchao and his army was depressed and downheartedWhen Xu You advised Cao Cao to attack Yuan Shao as promptly as he could the two newly surrendered generals volunteered to lead the waySo Cao Cao sent Zhang He and Gao Lan to make a first attack on the camp and they left in the night with three thousand troopsThe fighting went on confusedly all night but stayed at dawn Yuan Shao had lost half of his armyThen Xun You suggested a plan to Cao Cao saying Now is the moment to spread a report that an army will go to take Suanzao and attack Yejun and another to take Liyang and intercept the enemys retreatYuan Shao when he hears of this will be alarmed and tell off his troops to meet this new turn of affairs and while he is making these new dispositions we can have him at great disadvantage Cao Cao adopted the suggestion and care was taken that the report spread far aroundIt came to the ears of Yuan Shaos soldiers and they repeated it in camp Yuan Shao believed it and ordered his son Yuan Tan with fifty thousand troops to rescue Yejun and General Xin Ming with another fifty thousand to go to Liyang and they marched away at onceCao Cao heard that these armies had started and at once dispatched troops in eight divisions to make a simultaneous attack on the nearly empty campYuan Shaos troops were too dispirited to fight and gave way on all sidesYuan Shao without waiting to don his armor went forth in simple dress with an ordinary cap upon his head and mounted his steedHis youngest son Yuan Shang followed himFour of the enemy generalsZhang Liao Xu Chu Xu Huang and Yu Jinwith their forces pressed in his rear and Yuan Shao hastened across the river abandoning all his documents and papers baggage treasure and stores Only eight hundred horsemen followed him over the streamCao Caos troops followed hard but could not come up with him however they captured all his impedimenta and they slew some eighty thousands of his army so that the watercourses ran blood and the drowned corpses could not be countedIt was a most complete victory for Cao Cao and he made over all the spoil to the armyAmong the papers of Yuan Shao was found a bundle of letters showing secret correspondence between him and many persons in the capital and army Cao Caos personal staff suggested that the names of those concerned should be abstracted and the persons arrested but their lord said Yuan Shao was so strong that even I could not be sure of safety how much less other people So Cao Cao ordered the papers to be burned and nothing more was saidNow when Yuan Shaos soldiers ran away Ju Shou being a prisoner could not get away and was capturedTaken before Cao Cao who knew him Ju Shou cried aloud I will not surrender Said Cao Cao Yuan Shao was foolish and neglected your advice why still cling to the path of delusionHad I had you to help me I should have been sure of the empire Ju Shou was well treated in the camp but he stole a horse and tried to get away to Yuan ShaoThis angered Cao Cao who recaptured him and put him to death which he met with brave composureI have slain a faithful and righteous man then said Cao Cao sadlyAnd the victim was honorably buried at GuanduHis tomb bore the inscription This is the tomb of Ju Shou the Loyal and Virtuous Ju Shou was honest and virtuous The best in Yuan Shaos train From him the stars no secrets held In tactics all was plainFor him no terrors had grim deathToo lofty was his spirit His captor slew him but his tomb Bears witness to his meritCao Cao now gave orders to attack JizhouIn feeling over confident thats where ones weakness lay The other bettered him by plans which never went astrayThe following chapter will tell who won the next campaign CHAPTER Cao Cao Overcomes Yuan Shao In Cangting Liu Bei Seeks Shelter With Liu Biao In Jingzhou Cao Cao lost no time in taking advantage of Yuan Shaos flight but smote hard at the retreating armyYuan Shao without helmet or proper dress and with few followers crossed hastily to the north bank at Liyang He was met by one of his generals Jiang Yiqu who took him in and comforted him and listened to the tale of misfortunesNext Jiang Yiqu called in the scattered remnants of the army and when the soldiers heard that their old lord was alive they swarmed to him like ants so that Yuan Shao quickly became strong enough to attempt the march to JizhouSoon the army set out and at night halted at Huang HillsThat evening sitting in his tent Yuan Shao seemed to hear a far off sound of lamentationHe crept out quietly to listen and found it was his own soldiers telling each other tales of woe This one lamented an elder brother lost that one grieved for his younger brother abandoned a third mourned a companion missing a fourth a relative cut off And each beat his breast and weptAnd all said Had he but listened to Tian Feng we had not met this disaster And Yuan Shao very remorseful said I did not hearken unto Tian Feng and now my soldiers have been beaten and I was nearly lostHow can I return and look him in the face Next day the march was resumed and Yuan Shao met Peng Ji with reinforcements to whom he said I disregarded Tian Fengs advice and have brought myself to defeatNow shall I be greatly ashamed to look him in the face This tribute to Tian Fengs prescience roused the jealousy of Peng Ji who replied Yes when he heard the news of your defeat though he was a prisoner he clapped his hands for joy and said Indeed just as I foretold How dare he laugh at me the blockhead Assuredly he shall die said Yuan ShaoWhereupon Yuan Shao wrote a letter and sent therewith a sword to slay the prisonerMeanwhile Tian Fengs gaoler came to him one day saying Above all humans I felicitate you What is the joyful occasion and why felicitate said Tian FengThe gaoler replied Imperial Protector Yuan Shao has been defeated and is on his way back he will treat you with redoubled respect Now am I a dead man said Tian FengWhy say you that Sir when all people give you joy The Imperial Protector appears liberal but he is jealous and forgetful of honest adviceHad he been victorious he might have pardoned me now that he has been defeated and put to shame I may not hope to live But the gaoler did not believe Tian FengBefore long came the letter and the sword with the fatal orderThe gaoler was dismayed but the victim said I knew all too well that I should have to die The gaoler weptTian Feng said An able person born into this world who does not recognize and serve the right lord is ignorantToday I die but I am not deserving of pity Whereupon he cut his throat in the prisonJu Shou but yesterday was killed Tian Feng ends his life his fate fulfilled The North of Yellow Rivers main beams break one by one Mourn ye that Yuan House Its day is doneThus died Tian Feng pitied of all who heard of his fateWhen Yuan Shao came home in Jizhou he was with troubled mind and distorted thoughtsHe could not attend to the business of government and became so ill that his second wife who came of the Liu family and had replaced the first wife after her death besought him to make his last dispositionsNow three sons had been born to Yuan Shao Yuan Tan the eldest who was commander at Qingzhou Yuan Xi who ruled over Youzhou and Yuan Shang borne to him by Lady Liu This youngest son was very handsome and noble looking and his fathers favorite So he was kept at home After the defeat at Guandu the lads mother was constantly urging that her son should be named as successor and Yuan Shao called together four of his counselors to consider this matter These four happened to be divided in their sympathiesShen Pei and Peng Ji being in favor of the youngest son and Xin Ping and Guo Tu supporters of the eldestWhen they met to consult Yuan Shao said As there is nought but war and trouble outside our borders it is necessary that tranquillity within be early provided for and I wish to appoint my successor My eldest son is hard and cruel my second is mild and unfitThe third has the outward form of a hero appreciates the wise and is courteous to his subordinatesI wish him to succeed but I wish that you tell me your opinions Guo Tu said Yuan Tan is your first born and he is in a position of authority beyond your controlIf you pass over the eldest in favor of the youngest you sow the seeds of turbulenceThe prestige of the army has been somewhat lowered and enemies are on our border Should you add to our weakness by making strife between father and son elder and younger brothersRather consider how the enemy may be repulsed and turn to the question of the heirship later Then the natural hesitation of Yuan Shao asserted itself and he could not make up his mindSoon came news that his sons Yuan Tan was coming from Qingzhou with sixty thousand troops Yuan Xi coming from Youzhou with fifty thousand troops and his nephew Gao Gan coming from Bingzhou with fifty thousand troops to help him and he turned his attention to preparations for fighting Cao CaoWhen Cao Cao drew up his victorious army on the banks of Yellow River the aged natives brought an offering of food and sauce to bid him welcomeTheir venerable and hoary appearances led Cao Cao to treat them with the highest respect and he invited them to be seated and said to them Venerable Sirs what may be your age We are nearly a hundred replied the old villagersI should be very sorry if my army had disturbed your village said Cao CaoOne of them said In the days of the Emperor Huan a yellow star was seen over by way of the ancient states of Chu and Song in the southwestYin Kui of Liaodong who was learned in astrology happened to be passing the night here and he told us that the star foretold the arrival in these parts fifty years hence of a true and honest man here in the Yellow RiverThat is exactly fifty years agoNow Yuan Shao is very hard on the people and they hate himYou Sir having raised this army in the cause of humanity and righteousness out of pity for the people and to punish crimes and having destroyed the hordes of Yuan Shao at Guandu just fulfill the prophecy of Yin Kui and the millions of the land may look now for tranquillity How dare I presume that I am he said Cao Cao with a smileWine was served and refreshments brought in and the old gentlemen was sent away with presents of silk stuffsAnd an order was issued to the army that if any one killed so much as a fowl or a dog belonging to the villagers he should be punished as for murderAnd the soldiers obeyed with fear and trembling while Cao Cao rejoiced in his heartIt was told Cao Cao that the total army from the four regions under the Yuan family amounted to two hundred thirty thousand soldiers and they were camped at CangtingCao Cao then advanced nearer them and made a strong campNext day the two armies were arrayed over against each otherOn one side Cao Cao rode to the front surrounded by his commanders and on the other appeared Yuan Shao supported by his three sons his nephew and his leadersCao Cao spoke first Yuan Shao your schemes are poor your strength is exhausted why still refuse to think of surrenderAre you waiting till the sword shall be upon your neckThen it will be too late Yuan Shao turned to those about him saying Who dares go out His son Yuan Shang was anxious to exhibit his prowess in the presence of his father so he flourished his pair of swords and rode forthCao Cao pointed him out to his officers and asked Any one knows him He is the youngest son of Yuan Shao was the replyBefore they had finished speaking from their own side rode out Shi Huan armed with a spearThe two champions fought a little while and suddenly Yuan Shang whipped up his horse made a feint and fledHis opponent followed Yuan Shang took his bow fitted an arrow turned in his saddle and shot at Shi Huan wounding him in the left eye He fell from the saddle and died on the spotYuan Shao seeing his son thus get the better of his opponent gave the signal for attack and the whole army thundered forward The onslaught was heavy but presently the gongs on both sides sounded the retire and the battle ceasedWhen he had returned to camp Cao Cao took counsel to find a plan to overcome Yuan ShaoThen Cheng Yu proposed the plan of the Ten Ambushes and persuaded Cao Cao to retire upon the river placing troops in ambush as he went Thus would Yuan Shao be inveigled into pursuit as far as the river when Cao Caos army would be forced to make a desperate stand or be driven into the water Cao Cao accepted this suggestion and told off ten companies of five thousand soldiers each to lie in ten ambush on two sides of the road of retreatThe arrangement of the ambushes were thuson the left first company under Xiahou Dun second company Zhang Liao third company Li Dian fourth company Yue Jin fifth company Xiahou Yuan on the right first company was under Cao Hong second company Zhang He third company Xu Huang fourth company Yu Jin fifth company Gao LanXu Chu commanded the advanced frontNext day the ten companies started first and placed themselves right and left as orderedIn the night Cao Cao ordered the advanced front to feign an attack on the camp which roused all the enemy in all their campsThis done Xu Chu retreated and Yuan Shaos army came in pursuitThe roar of battle went on without cessation and at dawn Cao Caos army rested on the river and could retreat no fartherThen Cao Cao shouted There is no road in front so all must fight or die The retreating army turned about and advanced vigorouslyXu Chu simply flew to the front smote and killed ten generals and threw Yuan Shaos army into confusion They tried to turn and march back but Cao Cao was close behindThen the drums of the enemy were heard and right and left there appeared two ambush companies of Gao Lan and Xiahou YuanYuan Shao collected about him his three sons and his nephew and they were enabled to cut an arterial alley out and fleeThree miles further on they fell into another ambush of Yue Jin and Yu Jin and here many troops of Yuan Shao were lost so that their corpses lay over the countryside and the blood filled the water coursesAnother three miles and they met the third pair of Li Dian and Xu Huang barring their road Here they lost heart and bolted for an old camp of their own that was near and bade their men prepare a mealBut just as the food was ready to eat down came Zhang Liao and Zhang He and burst into the campYuan Shao mounted and fled as far as Cangting when he was tired and his steed spent But there was no rest for Cao Cao came in close pursuit It seemed now a race for lifeBut presently Yuan Shao found his onward course again blocked by Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong and he groaned aloudIf we do not make most desperate efforts we are all captives said he And they plunged forwardHis second son Yuan Xi and his nephew Gao Gan were wounded by arrows and most of his soldiers were dead or had disappearedHe gathered his sons into his arms and wept bitterly Then he fell into a swoonHe was picked up but his mouth was full of blood which ran forth in a bright scarlet stream He sighed saying Many battles have I fought and little did I think to be driven to thisHeaven is afflicting meYou would better return each to his own and swear to fight this Cao Cao to the end Then Yuan Shao bade Xin Ping and Guo Tu as quickly as possible follow Yuan Tan to Qingzhou and prepare to give battle to Cao Cao lest he should invadeYuan Xi was told to go to Youzhou and Gao Gan to Bingzhou So each started to prepare armies and horses for repulsing Cao CaoYuan Shao with his youngest son Yuan Shang and the remnant of his officers went away to Jizhou and military operations were suspended for a timeMeanwhile Cao Cao was distributing rewards to his army for the late victory and his spies were scouting all about JizhouHe soon learned that Yuan Shao was ill and that the youngest son Yuan Shang and Shen Pei were in command of the city while his brothers and cousin had returned each to his ownCao Caos advisers were in favor of a speedy attackBut he objected saying Jizhou is large and well supplied Shen Pei is an able strategist and it behooves me to be carefulI would rather wait till the autumn when the crops have been gathered in so that the people will not suffer While the attack was being talked over there came letters from Xun YuLiu Bei was strengthening himself at Runan with the force of Liu Pi and Gong Du and when he heard that you was attacking Jizhou he said he would take the opportunity to march on the capital Wherefore you Sir should hasten homeward to defend Xuchang This news disconcerted Cao CaoHe left Cao Hong in command on the river bank with orders to maintain the appearance of strength there while he led the main part of his army to meet the threatened attack from RunanMeanwhile Liu Bei his brothers and the leaders having gone forth with the intention of attacking the capital had reached a point near the Rang Mountains when Cao Cao came upon themSo Liu Bei camped by the hills and divided his army into three sending Guan Yu and Zhang Fei with ten thousand troops each to entrench themselves southeast and southwest respectively of the main body which he and Zhao Yun commandedWhen Cao Cao came near Liu Bei beat his drums and went out to where Cao Cao had already arrayed his armyCao Cao called Liu Bei to a parley and when the latter appeared under his great standard Cao Cao pointed his whip at him and railed saying I treated you as a guest of the highest consideration why then do you turn your back on righteousness and forget kindness Liu Bei replied Under the name of Prime Minister you are really a rebelI am a direct descendant of the family and I have a secret decree from the Throne to take such offenders as you As he said these words he produced and recited the decree which is known as the Girdle Mandate Cao Cao grew very angry and ordered Xu Chu to go out to battle and as Liu Beis champion out rode Zhao Yun with spear ready to thrustThe two warriors exchanged thirty bouts without advantage to eitherThen there arose an earthrending shout and up came the two brothers Guan Yu from the southeast and Zhang Fei from the southwestThe three armies then began a great attack which proved too much for Cao Caos troops fatigued by a long march and they were worsted and fledLiu Bei having scored this victory returned to campNext day he sent out Zhao Yun again to challenge the enemy but it was not accepted and Cao Caos army remained ten days without movement Then Zhang Fei offered a challenge which also was not acceptedAnd Liu Bei began to feel anxiousThen unexpectedly came news that the enemy had stopped a train of supplies brought by Gong Du and at once Zhang Fei went to the rescueWorse still was the news that followed that an army led by Xiahou Dun had got in behind to attack Runan Quite dismayed Liu Bei said If this be true I have enemies in front and rear and have no place to go He then sent Guan Yu to try to recover the city and thus both his brothers were absent from his sideOne day later a horseman rode up to say that Runan had fallen its defender Liu Pi had fled and Guan Yu was surroundedTo make the matters worse the news came that Zhang Fei who had gone to rescue Gong Du was in like caseLiu Bei tried to withdraw his troops fearing all the time an attack from Cao Cao Suddenly the sentinels came in sayingXu Chu is at the camp gate offering a challenge Liu Bei did not allow his army to go out They waited till dawn and then Liu Bei bade the soldiers get a good meal and be ready to startWhen ready the foot went out first the horsemen next leaving a few troops in the camp to beat the watches and maintain an appearance of occupationAfter traveling a some miles they passed some mounds Suddenly torches blazed out and on the summit stood one who shouted Do not let Liu Bei run away I the Prime Minister am here awaiting you Liu Bei dashed along the first clear road he sawZhao Yun said Fear not my lord only follow me And setting his spear Zhao Yun galloped in front opening an arterial alley as he went Liu Bei gripped his double swords and followed closeAs they were winning through Xu Chu came in pursuit and engaged Zhao Yun and two other companies led by Yu Jin and Li Dian bore down as wellSeeing the situation so desperate Liu Bei plunged into the wilds and fledGradually the sounds of battle became fainter and died away while he went deeper and deeper into the hills a single horseman fleeing for his lifeHe kept on his way till daybreak when a company suddenly appeared beside the roadLiu Bei saw these men with terror at first but was presently relieved to find they were led by the friendly Liu Pi They were a company of his defeated army escorting the family of their chief With them also were Sun Qian Jian Yong and Mi Fang They told him The attack on us was too strong to be resisted and so we were compelled to abandon the defense and the enemy followed and only Guan Yus timely arrival saved us from destruction I do not know where my brother is said Liu Bei All will come right if you will push on said Liu PiThey pushed onBefore they had gone far the beating of drums was heard and suddenly appeared Zhang He with a thousand soldiersHe cried Liu Bei quickly dismount and surrender Liu Bei was about to retire when he saw a red flag waving from a rampart on the hills and down came rushing another body of troops under Gao LanThus checked in front and his retreat cut off Liu Bei looked up to Heaven and cried O Heaven why am I brought to this state of miseryNothing is left me now but death And he drew his sword to slay himselfBut Liu Pi stayed his hand saying Let me try to fight a way out and save you Death is nothing to me As he spoke Gao Lans force was on the point of engaging hisThe two leaders met and in the third bout Liu Pi was cut downLiu Bei at once rushed up to fight but just then there was sudden confusion in the rear ranks of the opponents and a warrior dashed up and thrust at Gao Lan with his spear Gao Lan fell from his steedThe newcomer was Zhao YunHis arrival was most opportuneHe urged forward his steed thrusting right and left and the enemys ranks broke and scatteredThen the first force under Zhang He came into the fight and the leader and Zhao Yun fought thirty or more bouts However this proved enough for Zhang He turned his horse away recognizing that he was worstedZhao Yun vigorously attacked but was forced into a narrow space in the hills where he was hemmed inWhile seeking for some outlet they saw Guan Yu Guan Ping and Zhou Cang with three hundred men coming alongSoon Zhang He was driven off and then Liu Beis troops came out of the narrow defile and occupied a strong position among the hills where they made a camp Liu Bei sent Guan Yu for news of the missing brotherZhang Fei had been attacked by Xiahou Yuan who had killed Gong Du but had vigorously resisted beaten him off and followed him up Then Yue Jin had come along and surrounded Zhang FeiIn this pass he was found by Guan Yu who had heard of his plight from some of his scattered soldiers met on the way Now they drove off the enemy The two brothers returned Soon they heard of the approach of a large body of Cao Caos armyLiu Bei then bade Sun Qian guard his family and sent him on ahead while he and the others kept off the enemy sometimes giving battle and anon marchingSeeing that Liu Bei had retired too far Cao Cao let him go and left the pursuitWhen Liu Bei collected his army he found they numbered only a thousand and this halting and broken force marched as fast as possible to the westComing to a river they asked the natives its name and were told it was the Han River and near it Liu Bei made a temporary campWhen the local people found out who was in the camp they presented flesh and wine A feast was given upon a sandy bank of the Han RiverAfter they had drunk awhile Liu Bei addressed his faithful followers saying All you Fair Sirs have talents fitting you to be advisers to a monarch but your destiny has led you to follow poor meMy fate is distressful and full of misery Today I have not a spot to call my own and I am indeed leading you astrayTherefore I say you should abandon me and go to some illustrious lord where you may be able to become famous At these words they all covered their faces and weptGuan Yu said Brother you are wrong to speak thusWhen the great Founder of Han contended with Xiang Yu he was defeated many times but he won at the NineMile Mountains and that achievement was the foundation of a dynasty that endured for four centuriesVictory and defeat are but ordinary events in a soldiers career and why should you give up Success and failure both have their seasons said Sun Qian and we are not to grieveJingzhou which your illustrious relative Liu Biao commands is a rich and prosperous country Liu Biao is of your house why not go to him Only that I fear he may not receive me said Liu Bei Then let me go and prepare the wayI will make Liu Biao come out to his borders to welcome you So with his lords approval Sun Qian set off immediately and hastened to JingzhouWhen the ceremonies of greeting were over Liu Biao asked the reason of the visitSaid Sun Qian The princely Liu Bei is one of the heroes of the day although just at the moment he may lack soldiers and leadersHis mind is set upon restoring the dynasty to its pristine glory and at Runan the two commanders Liu Pi and Gong Du though bound to him by no ties were content to die for the sake of his idealsYou Illustrious Sir like Liu Bei are a scion of the imperial stockNow the Princely One has recently suffered defeat and thinks of seeking a home in the east with Sun Quan I have ventured to dissuade him saying that he should not turn from a relative and go to a mere acquaintance telling him that you Sir are well known as courteous to the wise and condescending to scholars so that they flock to you as the waters flow to the east sea and that certainly you would show kindness to one of the same ancestryWherefore he has sent me to explain matters and request your commands He is my brother said Liu Biao and I have long desired to see him but no opportunity has occurred I should be very happy if he would come Cai Mao who was sitting by here broke in No noLiu Bei first followed Lu Bu then he served Cao Cao and next he joined himself to Yuan Shao And he stayed with none of these so that you can see what manner of man he isIf he comes here Cao Cao will assuredly come against us and fightBetter cut off this messengers head and send it as an offering to Cao Cao who would reward you well for the service Sun Qian sat unmoved while this harangue was pronounced saying at the end I am not afraid of deathLiu Bei the Princely One is true and loyal to the state and so out of sympathy with Lu Bu or Cao Cao or Yuan ShaoIt is true he followed these three but there was no help for it Now he knows your chief is a member of the family so that both are of the same ancestry and that is why he has come far to join himHow can you slander a good man like that Liu Biao bade Cai Mao be silent and said I have decided and you need say no more Whereat Cai Mao sulkily left the audience chamberThen Sun Qian was told to return with the news that Liu Bei would be welcome and Imperial Protector Liu Biao went ten miles beyond the city to meet his guestWhen Liu Bei arrived he behaved to his host with the utmost politeness and was warmly welcomed in returnThen Liu Bei introduced his two sworn brothers and friends and they entered Jingzhou City where Liu Bei finally was lodged in the Imperial Protectors own residenceAs soon as Cao Cao knew whither his enemy had gone he wished to attack Liu Biao but Cheng Yu advised against any attempt so long as Yuan Shao the dangerous enemy was left with power to inflict damageHe said My lord should return to the capital to refresh the soldiers so that they may be ready for a north and south campaign in the mild spring weather Cao Cao accepted his advice and set out for the capitalIn the first month of the eighth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  Cao Cao once again began to think of war and sent to garrison Runan as a precaution against Liu BiaoThen after arranging for the safety of the capital he marched a large army to Guandu the camp of the year before and aimed at JizhouAs to Yuan Shao who had been suffering from bloodspitting but was now in better health he began to think of measures against Xuchang but Shen Pei dissuaded him saying You are not yet recovered from the fatigues of last yearIt would be better to make your position impregnable and set to improving the army When the news of Cao Caos approach arrived Yuan Shao said If we allow the foe to get close to the city before we march to the river we shall have missed our opportunity I must go out to repel this army Here his son Yuan Shang interposed Father you are not sufficiently recovered for a campaign and should not go so farLet me lead the army against this enemy Yuan Shao consented and he sent to Qingzhou and Youzhou and Bingzhou to call upon his other two sons and his nephew to attack Cao Cao at the same time as his own armyAgainst Runan they beat the drum And from Jizhou the armies comeTo whom the victory will be seen in the next chapter CHAPTER  Jizhou Taken Yuan Shang Strives River Zhang Cut Xun You SchemesYuan Shang was puffed up with pride after his victory over Shi Huan and without deigning to wait the arrival of his brothers he marched out with thirty thousand troops to Liyang to meet the army of Cao CaoZhang Liao came out to challenge him and Yuan Shang accepting the challenge rode out with spear set But he only lasted to the third bout when he had to give wayZhang Liao smote with full force and Yuan Shang quite broken fled pellmell to JizhouHis defeat was a heavy shock to his father Yuan Shao who had a severe fit of hemorrhage at the news and swoonedLady Liu his wife got him to bed as quickly as possible but he did not rally and she soon saw it was necessary to prepare for the end So she sent for Shen Pei and Peng Ji that the succession might be settledThey came and stood by the sick mans bed but by this time he could no longer speak he only made motions with his hands When his wife put the formal question Is Yuan Shang to succeed Yuan Shao nodded his headShen Pei at the bedside wrote out the dying mans testamentPresently Yuan Shao uttered a loud moan a fresh fit of bleeding followed and he passed awayBorn of a line of nobles famous for generations He himself in his youth was wayward always and headstrong Vainly he called to his side generals skilled and courageous Gathered beneath his banner countless legions of soldiers For he was timid at heart a lamb dressed as a tiger Merely a cowardly chicken phoenixfeathered but spurlessPitiful was the fate of his house for when he departed Brother with brother strove and quarrels arose in the householdShen Pei and some others set about the mourning ceremonies for the dead manHis wife Lady Liu put to death five of his favorite concubines and such was the bitterness of her jealousy that not content with this she shaved off the hair and slashed the faces of their poor corpses lest their spirits should meet and rejoin her late husband in the land of shades beneath the Nine Golden SpringsHer son followed up this piece of cruelty by slaying all the relatives of the unhappy concubines lest they should avenge their deathShen Pei and Peng Ji declared Yuan Shang successor with the titles of Regent Marshal and Supreme Imperial Protector of the four regions of Jizhou Qingzhou Youzhou and Bingzhou and sent in a report of the death of the late Imperial ProtectorAt this time Yuan Tan the eldest son had already marched out his army to oppose Cao Cao but hearing of his fathers death he called in Guo Tu and Xin Ping to consult as to his course of actionIn your absence my lord said Guo Tu the two advisers of your younger brother will certainly set him up as lord wherefore you must act quickly Those two Shen Pei and Peng Ji have already laid their plans said Xin PingIf you go you will meet with some misfortune Then what should I do asked Yuan TanGuo Tu replied Go and camp near the city and watch what is taking place while I enter and inquire Accordingly Guo Tu entered the city and sought an interview with the young Imperial ProtectorWhy did not my brother come asked Yuan Shang after the usual salutesGuo Tu said He cannot come as he is in the camp unwell By the command of my late father I take the lordshipNow I confer upon my brother the rank of General of the Flying Cavalry and I wish him to go at once to attack Cao Cao who is pressing on the borders I will follow as soon as my army is in order There is no one in our camp to give advice said Guo TuI wish to have the services of Shen Pei and Peng Ji I also need the help of these two said Yuan ShangAnd as I am always working at schemes I do not see how I can do without them Then let one of these two go replied Guo TuYuan Shang could do no other than accede to this request so he bade the two men cast lots who should goPeng Ji drew the lot and was appointed receiving a seal of office Then he accompanied Guo Tu to the campBut when he arrived and found Yuan Tan in perfect health he grew suspicious and resignedYuan Tan angrily refused to accept his resignation and was disposed to put him to death but Guo Tu privately dissuaded him saying Cao Cao is on the borders and Peng Ji must be kept here to allay your brothers suspicionsAfter we have beaten Cao Cao we can at once make an attempt on Jizhou Yuan Tan agreed and forthwith broke up his camp to march against the enemyHe reached Liyang and lost no time in offering battleHe chose for his champion Wang Zhao and when he rode out Cao Cao sent Xu Huang to meet himThese two had fought but a few bouts when Wang Zhao was slainAt once Cao Caos army pressed forward and Yuan Tan suffered a severe defeatYuan Tan drew off his army and retired into Liyang whence he sent to his brother for reinforcementsYuan Shang and his adviser Shen Pei discussed the matter and only five thousand troops were sentCao Cao hearing of the dispatch of this meager force sent Li Dian and Yue Jin to waylay them and the half legion was destroyedWhen Yuan Tan heard of the inadequate force sent and their destruction he was very wrath and roundly abused Peng JiPeng Ji replied Let me write to my lord and pray him to come himself So Peng Ji wrote and the letter was sent When it arrived Yuan Shang again consulted Shen Pei who said Guo Tu your elder brothers adviser is very guilefulFormerly he left without discussion because Cao Cao was on the borderIf Cao Cao be defeated there will certainly be an attempt on youThe better plan is to withhold assistance and use Cao Caos hand to destroy your rival Yuan Shang took his advice and no help was sentWhen the messenger returned to Liyang without success Yuan Tan was very angry and showed it by putting Peng Ji to death He also began to talk of surrendering to Cao CaoSoon spies brought news of this to Yuan Shang and again Shen Pei was called inYuan Shang said If Yuan Tan goes over to Cao Cao they will both attack Jizhou and we shall be in great danger Finally Shen Pei and Xu You were left to take care of the defense of the city and Yuan Shang marched his army to the rescue of his brother Who dares lead the van said Yuan ShangTwo brothers named Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang volunteered and thirty thousand troops were given them They were the first to reach LiyangYuan Tan was pleased that Yuan Shang had decided to play a brotherly part and come to his aid so he at once abandoned all thought of going over to the enemyHe being in the city Yuan Shang camped outside making that an oxhorn formation of their strategic positionBefore long Yuan Xi the second brother and their cousin Gao Gan arrived with their legions and also camped outside the city Engagements took place daily and Yuan Shang suffered many defeats On the other hand Cao Cao was victorious and elatedIn the second month of the eighth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  Cao Cao made separate attacks on all four armies and won the day against eachThen the Yuans abandoned Liyang and Cao Cao pursued them to Jizhou where Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang went into the city to defend it while their brother and cousin camped about ten miles away making a show of great forceWhen Cao Cao had made many attacks without success Guo Jia proffered the following plan He said There is dissension among the Yuans because the elder has been superseded in the succession The brothers are about equally strong and each has his party If we oppose them they unite to assist each other but if we have patience they will be weakened by family strifeWherefore send first a force to reduce Liu Biao in Jingzhou and let the fraternal quarrels developWhen they have fully developed we can smite them and settle the matter Cao Cao approved of the planSo leaving Jia Xu as Governor of Liyang and Cao Hong as guard at Guandu the army went away toward JingzhouThe two brothers Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang congratulated each other on the withdrawal of their enemy and their brother Yuan Xi and their cousin Gao Gan marched their armies back to their own districts Then the quarrels beganYuan Tan said to his confidants Guo Tu and Xin Ping I the eldest have been prevented from succeeding my father while the youngest son born of a second wife received the main heritageMy heart is bitter Said Guo Tu Camp your army outside invite your brother and Shen Pei to a banquet and assassinate themThe whole matter is easily settled And Yuan Tan agreedIt happened that Adviser Wang Xiu came just then from Qingzhou whom Yuan Tan took into his confidenceWang Xiu opposed the murder plan saying Brothers are as ones limbsHow can you possibly succeed if at a moment of conflict with an enemy you cut off one of your handsIf you abandon your brother and sever relationship whom will you take in all the world as a relationThat fellow Guo Tu is a dangerous mischiefmaker who would sow dissension between brothers for a momentary advantage and I beg you to shut your ears and not listen to his persuasions This was displeasing to Yuan Tan and he angrily dismissed Wang Xiu while he sent the treacherous invitation to his brother Yuan Shang and Shen Pei talked over the matterShen Pei said I recognize one of Guo Tus stratagems and if you go my lord you will be the victim of their plotRather strike at them at once Whereupon Yuan Shang rode out to battleHis brother Yuan Tan seeing him come with fifty thousand troops knew that his treachery had been discovered so he also took the fieldWhen the forces were near enough Yuan Tan opened on Yuan Shang with a volley of abuseYou poisoned my father and usurped the succession now you come out to slay your elder brother The battle went against Yuan TanYuan Shang himself took part in the fight risking the arrows and the stones He urged on his troops and drove his brother off the fieldYuan Tan took refuge in Pingyuan Yuan Shang drew off his army to his own cityYuan Tan and Guo Tu decided upon a new attack and this time they chose General Cen Bi as Leader of the VanYuan Shang went to meet himWhen both sides had been arrayed and the banners were flying and the drums beating Cen Bi rode out to challenge and railed at his opponentAt first Yuan Shang was going to answer the challenge himself but Lu Kuang had advancedLu Kuang and Cen Bi met but had fought only a few bouts when Cen Bi fellYuan Tans soldiers were once more defeated and ran away to PingyuanShen Pei urged his master to press for the advantage and Yuan Tan was driven into the city where he fortified himself and would not go outSo the city was besieged on three sidesYuan Tan asked his strategist what should be done next and Guo Tu said The city is short of food the enemy is flushed with victory and we cannot stand against themMy idea is to send some one to offer surrender to Cao Cao and thus get him to attack JizhouYour brother will be forced to return thither which will leave you free to join in the attackWe may capture Yuan Shang Should Cao Cao begin to get the better of your brothers army we will lend our force to help Yuan Shang against Cao Cao and as Cao Caos base of supply is distant we shall drive him offAnd we can seize on Jizhou and begin our great design Supposing this scheme be attempted who is the man for a messenger I have one Xin Pi Xin Pings younger brother he is the magistrate here in this very placeHe is a fluent speaker and good scholar and suited to your purpose So Xin Pi was summoned and came readily enoughLetters were given him and an escort of three thousand soldiers took him beyond the border He traveled as quickly as possibleAt that time Cao Caos camp was at the Xiping Pass and he was attacking Liu Biao who had sent Liu Bei out to offer the first resistance No battle had yet taken placeSoon after his arrival Xin Pi was admitted to the Prime Ministers presence and after the ceremonies of greeting Cao Cao asked the object of the visitXin Pi explained that Yuan Tan wanted assistance and presented his dispatchesCao Cao read them and told the messenger to wait in his camp while he called his officers to a council The council met Cheng Yu said Yuan Tan has been forced into making this offer because of the pressure of his brothers attackPut no trust in him Lu Qian and Man Chong said You have led your armies here for a special purpose how can you abandon that and go to assist Yuan Tan Gentlemen not one of you is giving good advice interposed Xun You This is how I regard itSince there is universal trouble in the midst of which Liu Biao remains quietly content with his position between the River Zhang and the River Han it is evident that he has no ambition to enlarge his bordersThe Yuans hold four regions and have many legions of soldiers Harmony between the two brothers means success for the family and none can foresee what will happen in the empire Now take advantage of this fraternal conflict and let them fight till they are weakened and have to yield to our Prime Minister Then Yuan Shang can be removed and when the times are suitable Yuan Tan can be destroyed in his turn Thus peace will ensue This present combination of circumstances is to be taken advantage of to full measure Cao Cao realized the truth of this and treated Xin Pi wellAt a banquet Cao Cao said But is this surrender of Yuan Tan real or falseDo you really think that Yuan Shangs army is sure to overcome him Xin Pi replied Illustrious Sir do not inquire into the degree of sincerity rather regard the situationThe Yuans have been suffering military losses for years and are powerless without while their strategists are put to death withinThe brothers seize every chance to speak evil of each other and their country is dividedAdd to this famine supplemented by calamities and general exhaustion and everybody wise as well as simple can see that the catastrophe is near and the time ordained of Heaven for the destruction of the Yuans is at handNow you have a force attacking the capital of Jizhou Yejunand if Yuan Shang will not return to give aid the place of refuge is lostIf he helps then Yuan Tan will follow up and smite him making use of your power to destroy the remnant of his brothers army just as the autumn gale sweeps away the fallen leavesNow Liu Biaos Jingzhou is rich the government peaceful the people submissive and it cannot be shakenMoreover there is no greater threat to it than the North of Yellow RiverIf that be reduced then the task is completeI pray you Sir think of it I am sorry that I did not meet you earlier said Cao Cao much gratified with this speechForthwith orders were given to return and attack JizhouLiu Bei fearing this retirement was only a ruse allowed it to proceed without interference and himself returned to JingzhouWhen Yuan Shang heard that Cao Cao had crossed the Yellow River he hastily led his army back to Yejun ordering Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang to guard the rearYuan Tan started from Pingyuan with a force in pursuitHe had proceeded only a dozen miles when he heard a bomb and two bodies of troops came out in front of him and checked his progress Their leaders were Lu Xiang and Lu KuangYuan Tan reined in and addressed them saying While my father lived I never treated you badly why do you support my brother and try to injure me The two generals had no reply to make but they dismounted and bowed before him yielding submissionYuan Tan said Do not surrender to me but to the Prime Minister And he led them back to camp where he waited the arrival of Cao Cao and then presented the pair Cao Cao received them wellHe promised his daughter to Yuan Tan to wife and he appointed the two brothers as advisersWhen Yuan Tan asked Cao Cao to attack Jizhou the reply was Supplies are short and difficult to transportI must turn the waters of River Ji into the White River whereby to convey my grain and afterwards I can advance Ordering Yuan Tan to remain in Pingyuan Cao Cao retired into camp at LiyangThe two brothers Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang who were renegades from Yuan Shang were now raised to noble rank and followed the army as supernumerariesGuo Tu noted this advancement and said to Yuan Tan He has promised you a daughter to wife I fear that bodes no goodNow he has given titles of nobility to the two Lus and taken them with him This is a bait for the northern people and at the same time he intends evil toward usYou my lord should have two generals seals engraved and send them secretly to the brothers so that you may have friends at court ready for the day when Cao Cao shall have broken your brothers power and we can begin to work against him The seals were engraved and sent As soon as the Lu brothers received them they informed Cao Cao who smiled saying He wants your support so he sends you seals as officersI will consider it as soon as Yuan Shang has been dealt withIn the meantime you may accept the seals till I shall decide what to do Thenceforward Cao Cao planned Yuan Tans doomShen Pei and his master also discussed the current situationYuan Shang said Cao Cao is getting grain into the White River which means an attack on Jizhou what is to be done Shen Pei replied Send letters to Yin Kai Commander of Wuan bidding him camp at Maocheng to secure the road to Shangdang and direct Ju Gu son of Ju Shou to maintain Handan as a distant auxiliaryThen you may advance on Pingyuan and attack Cao Cao The plan seemed goodYuan Shang left Shen Pei and Chen Lin in charge of Yejun appointed two Commanders Ma Yan and Zhang Yi as Van Leaders and set out hastily for PingyuanWhen Yuan Tan heard of the approach of his brothers army he sent urgent messages to Cao Cao who said to himself I am going to get Jizhou this time Just at this time it happened that Xun You came down from the capitalWhen he heard that Yuan Shang was attacking his brother Yuan Tan he sought Cao Cao and said You Sir sit here on guard are you waiting till Heavens thunder shall strike the two Yuans I have thought it all out said Cao CaoThen he ordered Cao Hong to go and fight against Yejun while he led another army against Yin Kai in MaochengYin Kai could make no adequate defense and was killed by Xu ChuHis soldiers ran away and presently joined Cao Caos armyNext Cao Cao led the army to Handan and Ju Gu came out to fight himZhang Liao advanced to fight with Ju Gu and after the third encounter Ju Gu was defeated and fledZhang Liao went after him and when their two horses were not far apart Zhang Liao took his bow and shotThe fleeing warrior fell as the bowstring twanged Cao Cao completed the rout and Ju Gus force was broken upNow Cao Cao led his armies to an attack on YejunCao Hong had arrived before and a regular siege beganThe army encompassed the city and began by throwing up great mounds They also tunneled subterranean ways Within the city Shen Pei turned his whole care to the defense and issued the severest commandsThe Commandant of the East Gate Feng Li got intoxicated and failed to keep his watch for which he was severely punishedFeng Li resented this sneaked out of the city went over to the besiegers and told them how the place could be attackedThe earth within the Pearly Gate is solid enough to be tunneled and entrance can be effected there said the traitorSo Feng Li was sent with three hundred men to carry out his plan under cover of darknessAfter Feng Li had deserted to the enemy Shen Pei went every night to the wall to inspect the soldiers on dutyThe night of the sapping he went there as usual and saw that there were no lights outside the city and all was perfectly quietSo he said to himself Feng Li is certain to try to come into the city by an underground road Whereupon he ordered his troops to bring up stones and pile them on the cover of the tunnel openingThe opening was stopped up and the attacking party perished in the tunnel they had excavatedCao Cao having failed in this attempt abandoned the scheme of underground attack He drew off the army to a place above the River Huan to await till Yuan Shang should return to relieve the cityYuan Shang heard of the defeat of Yin Kai and Ju Gu and the siege of his own city and bethought himself of relieving itOne of his commanders Ma Yan said The high road will surely be ambushed we must find some other wayWe can take a byroad from the Western Hills and get through by River Fu whence we can fall upon Cao Caos camp The plan was acceptable and Yuan Shang started off with the main body Ma Yan and Zhang Yi being rear guardCao Caos spies soon found out this move and when they reported it he said If Yuan Shang comes by the high road I shall have to keep out of the way if by the Western Hills byroad I can settle him in one battleAnd I think he will show a blaze as a signal to the besieged that they may make a sortieI shall prepare to attack both So Cao Cao made his preparationsNow Yuan Shang went out by River Fu east toward Yangping and near this he camped Thence to Yejun was five miles River Fu ran beside the campHe ordered his soldiers to collect firewood and grass ready for the blaze he intended to make at night as his signalHe also sent Li Fu a civil officer disguised as an officer of Cao Caos army to inform Shen Pei of his intentions Li Fu reached the city wall safely and called out to the guards to openShen Pei recognized his voice and let him in Thus Shen Pei knew of the arrangements for his relief and it was agreed that a blaze should be raised within the city so that the sortie could be simultaneous with Yuan Shangs attack Orders were given to collect inflammablesThen said Li Fu As your food supply is short it would be well for the old people the feeble soldiers and the women to surrenderThis will come upon them as a surprise and we will send the soldiers out behind them Shen Pei promised to do all this and next day they hoisted on the wall a white flag with the words The populace of Jizhou surrender on it Ho ho This means no food said Cao Cao They are sending away the noncombatants to escape feeding themAnd the soldiers will follow behind them Cao Cao bade Zhang Liao and Xu Huang laid an ambush of three thousand troops on both sides while he went near the wall in full statePresently the gates were opened and out came the people supporting their aged folks and leading their little ones by the hand Each carried a white flagAs soon as the people had passed the gate the soldiers followed with a rushThen Cao Cao showed a red flag and the ambushing soldiers led by Zhang Liao and Xu Huang fell upon the sortie The troops tried to return and Cao Caos force made a direct attackThe chase continued to the drawbridge but there Cao Caos force met with a tremendous shower of arrows and crossbow bolts which checked the advance Cao Caos helmet was struck and the crest carried awayHis leaders came to pull him back and the army retiredAs soon as Cao Cao had changed his dress and mounted a fresh horse he set out at the head of the army to attack Yuan Shangs camp Yuan Shang led the defense The attack came simultaneously from many directions the defenders were quite disorganized and presently defeatedYuan Shang led his troops back by the Western Hills and made a camp under their shelter Thence he sent messengers to urge Ma Yan and Zhang Yi to bring up the supportsHe did not know that Cao Cao had sent Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang to persuade these two into surrender and that they had already passed under Cao Caos banner and he had conferred upon them the title of lordshipJust before going to attack the Western Hills Cao Cao sent Lu Xiang Lu Kuang Ma Yan and Zhang Yi to seize the source of Yuan Shangs suppliesYuan Shang had realized he could not hold the hills so he went by night to LankouBefore he could get camped he saw flaring lights springing up all around him and soon an attack began He was taken aback and had to oppose the enemy with his men half armed his steeds unsaddledHis army suffered and he had to retreat another fifteen miles By that time his force was too enfeebled to show any resistance and as no other course was possible he sent the Imperial Protector of Yuzhou Yin Kui to Cao Caos camp and ask that he might surrenderCao Cao feigned to consent but that night he sent Zhang Liao and Xu Huang to raid Yuan Shangs campThen it became flight abandoning everything seals emblems of office and even personal clothing Yuan Shang made for the Zhongshan MountainsThen Cao Cao came to attack Jizhou City and to help out this Xun You suggested drowning the city by turning the course of the River ZhangCao Cao adopted the suggestion and at once sent a small number of men to dig a channel to lead the water to the city All told it was seventeen milesShen Pei saw the diggers from the city wall and noticed that they made only a shallow channelHe chuckled saying to himself What is the use of such a channel to drown out the city from a deep river So he made no preparations to keep out the waterBut as soon as night came on Cao Cao increased his army of diggers tenfold and by daylight the channel was deepened to twenty spans and the water was flowing in a great stream into the city where it already stood some spans deepSo this misfortune was added to the lack of foodXin Pi now displayed the captured seal and garments of Yuan Shang hung out on spears to the great shame of their late owner and called upon the people of the city to surrenderThis angered Shen Pei who avenged the insult by putting to death on the city wall the whole of the Xin family who were within the city There were eighty of them and their severed heads were cast down from the wallsXin Pi wept exceedinglyShen Peis nephew Shen Rong one of the gate wardens was a dear friend of Xin Pi and the murder of Xin Pis family greatly distressed him He wrote a secret letter offering to betray the city and tied it to an arrow which he shot out among the besiegersThe soldiers found it gave it to Xin Pi who took it to his chief Cao Cao issued an orderThe family of the Yuans should be spared when the city should be taken and that no one who surrendered should be put to death The next day the soldiers entered by the west gate opened for them by Shen RongXin Pi was the first to prance in on horseback and the army followedWhen Shen Pei who was on the southeast of the city saw the enemy within the gates he placed himself at the head of some horsemen and dashed toward themHe was met and captured by Xu Huang who bound him and led him outside the cityOn the road they met Xin Pi who ground his teeth with rage at the murderer of his relatives and then struck the prisoner over the head with his whip crying Murder Blood drinkerYou will meet your death Shen Pei retorted Traitor Seller of the cityI am very sorry I was not to have slain you before When the captive was taken into Cao Caos presence Cao Cao said Do you know who opened the gate to let me in No I know not It was your nephew Shen Rong who gave up the gate said Cao CaoHe was always unprincipled and it has come to this said Shen PeiThe other day when I approached the city why did you shoot so hard at me I am sorry we shot too little As a faithful adherent of the Yuans you could do no otherwiseNow will you come over to me Never I will never surrender Xin Pi threw himself on the ground with lamentations saying Eighty of my people murdered by this ruffian I pray you slay him O Prime Minister Alive I have served the Yuans said Shen Pei dead I will be their ghost I am no flattering timeserver as you areKill me Cao Cao gave the order they led him away to put him to deathOn the execution ground he said to the executioners My lord is in the north I pray you not to make me face the south So Shen Pei knelt facing the north and extended his neck for the fatal stroke Who of all the official throng In the North was true like Shen Pei Sad his fate He served a fool But faithful as the ancient humansStraight and true was every word Never from the road he swervedFaithful unto death he died Gazing toward the lord hed servedThus died Shen Pei and from respect for his character Cao Cao ordered that he be buried honorably on the north of the cityThe Prime Minister then entered the city of YejunAs he was starting he saw the executioners hurrying forward a prisoner who proved to be Chen LinYou wrote that manifesto for Yuan Shao If you had only directed your diatribe against me it would not have matteredBut why did you shame my forefathers said Cao CaoWhen the arrow is on the string it must fly replied Chen LinThose about Cao Cao urged him to put Chen Lin to death but he was spared on account of his genius and given a civil postNow Cao Caos eldest son was named Cao Pi At the taking of the cities he was eighteen years of ageWhen he was born a dark purplish halo hung over the house for a whole dayOne who understood the meaning of such manifestations had secretly told Cao Cao that the halo belonged to the imperial class and portended honors which could not be put into wordsAt eight the lad could compose very skillfully and he was well read in ancient history Now he was an adept at all military arts and very fond of fencingHe had gone with his father on the expedition to Jizhou When Yejun had fallen he led his escort in the direction of the Yuan family dwelling and when he reached it he strode in sword in handWhen some commander would have stayed him saying that by order of the Prime Minister no one was to enter the house Cao Pi bade them begoneThe guards fell back and he made his way into the private rooms where he saw two women weeping in each others arms He went forward to slay themFour generations of honors gone like a dream Fate follows on ever surely though slow she seems The fate of the two women will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER  A Gallant Warrior Cao Pi Marries Lady Zhen An Expiring Star Guo Jia Settles LiaodongAs was said Cao Pi having made his way into the Yuans palace saw two women there whom he was about to killSuddenly a red light shone in his eyes and he pausedLowering his sword he said Who are you Thy handmaid is the widow of the late Yuan Shao Lady Liu said the elder of the two and this is the wife of Yuan Xi his second son She was of the Zhen familyWhen Yuan Xi was sent to command in Youzhou her family objected to her going so far from home and she stayed behind Cao Pi drew Lady Zhen toward him and looked at her closelyHer hair hung disordered her face was dusty and tearstained but when with the sleeve of his inner garment he had wiped sway these disfigurements he saw a woman of exquisite loveliness with a complexion clear as jade touched with the tender bloom of a flower petal a woman indeed beautiful enough to ruin a kingdomI am the son of the Prime Minister said he turning to the elder womanI will guarantee your safety so you need fear nothing He then put by his sword and sat down at the upper end of the roomAs Cao Cao was entering the gate of the conquered city of Yejun Xu You rode up very quickly passed him and pointed with his whip at the gate saying Sir Prime Minister you would not have been here but for my plans Cao Cao laughed but his generals were very annoyedWhen he reached the residence he stopped at the gate and asked Has anyone had gone in The guard at the gate said Your son is within Cao Cao called him out and chided him but the wife of the late Imperial Protector interposed saying But not for your son we had not been savedI desire to present to you a lady of the Zhen family as a handmaid to your son Cao Cao bade them bring out the girl and she bowed before himAfter looking at her intently he said Just the wife for him And he told Cao Pi to take Lady Zhen to wifeAfter the conquest of Jizhou had been made quite sure Cao Cao made a ceremonial visit to the Yuan family cemetery where he sacrificed at the tomb of his late rival bowed his head and lamented bitterly Turning to his generals he said Not long ago when Yuan Shao and I worked together in military matters he asked me saying If this disturbance does not cease what fronts should be held and I replied asking him what he thoughtHe said In the North of Yellow River to the south I would hold the Yellow River on the north guard against Yan and Dai  and absorb the hordes from the Gobi DesertThence southward I would try for the empire and do you not think I might succeed I replied saying I depend upon the wisdom and force of the world directed by scholars then every thing would be possible These words seem as if spoken only yesterday and now he is gone Thinking over it I cannot refrain from tears His officers were deeply affectedCao Cao treated the widow generously giving her gold and silks and food to her contentHe also issued a further order that the taxes in the North of Yellow River would be remitted in consideration of the sufferings of the people during the warlike operationsHe sent up a memorial to the Throne and formally became Imperial Protector of JizhouOne day Xu Chu riding in at the east gate met Xu You who called out to him Would you fellows be riding through here if it had not been for me Xu Chu replied We fellows those who survive and those who perished risked our lives in bloody battle to get this city so do not brag of your deeds You are a lot of blockheads not worth talking about said Xu YouXu Chu in his anger drew his sword and ran Xu You through Then he took Xu Yous head and went to tell Cao Cao the reason Said Cao Cao He and I were old friends and we could joke togetherWhy did you kill him Cao Cao blamed Xu Chu very severely and gave orders that the corpse should be buried honorablyCao Cao inquired for any wise and reputable people who were known to be living in the region and was toldCommander Cui Yan of Dongwu who had on many occasions given valuable advice to Yuan ShaoAs the advice was not followed he had pleaded indisposition and remained at home Cao Cao sent for this man gave him an office and said to him According to the former registers there are three hundred thousand households in the region so that one may well call it a major region Cui Yan replied The empire is rent and the country is torn the Yuan brothers are at war and the people have been stripped naked Yet Sir you do not hasten to inquire after local conditions and how to rescue the people from misery but first compute the possibilities of taxationCan you expect to gain the support of our people by such means Cao Cao accepted the rebuke changed the policy thanked him and treated him all the better for itAs soon as Jizhou was settled Cao Cao sent to find out the movements of Yuan Tan He heard Yuan Tan was ravaging Ganling Anping Bohai and HejianMoreover the scouts brought the news that Yuan Shang had fled to Zhongshan and Yuan Tan led an expedition against him but Yuan Shang would not face a battle He had gone away to Youzhou to his brother Yuan XiYuan Tan having gathered Yuan Shangs troops prepared for another attempt on JizhouWhereupon Cao Cao summoned himYuan Tan refused to come and Cao Cao sent letters breaking off the marriage between Yuan Tan and his daughterSoon after Cao Cao led an expedition against Yuan Tan and marched to Pingyuan whereupon Yuan Tan sent to Liu Biao to beg assistance Liu Biao sent for Liu Bei to consult about this Liu Bei said Cao Cao is very strong now that he has overcome Jizhou and the Yuans will be unable to hold out for longNothing is to be gained by helping Yuan Tan and it may give Cao Cao the loophole he is always looking for to attack this place My advice is to keep the army in condition and devote all our energies to defense Agreed but what shall we say said Liu BiaoWrite to both the brothers as peacemaker in gracious terms Accordingly Liu Biao wrote thus to Yuan TanWhen the superior person would escape danger that person does not go to an enemy stateI heard recently that you had crooked the knee to Cao Cao which was ignoring the enmity between him and your father rejecting the duties of brotherhood and leaving behind you the shame of an alliance with the enemyIf your brother the successor to Jizhou has acted unfraternally your duty was to bend your inclination to follow him and wait till the state of affairs had settledWould it not have been very noble to bring about the redress of wrongs And to Yuan Shang Liu Biao wrote Your brother the ruler of Qingzhou is of an impulsive temperament and confuses right with wrongYou ought first to have destroyed Cao Cao in order to put an end to the hatred which your father bore him and when the situation had become settled to have endeavored to redress the wrongs Would not that have been wellIf you persist in following this mistaken course remember the hound and the hare both so wearied that the peasant got them all From this letter Yuan Tan saw that Liu Biao had no intention of helping him and feeling he alone could not withstand Cao Cao he abandoned Pingyuan and fled to Nanpi whither Cao Cao pursued himThe weather was very cold and the river was frozen so that the grain boats could not moveWherefore Cao Cao ordered the inhabitants to break the ice and tow the boats When the peasants heard the order they ran awayCao Cao angrily wished to arrest and behead themWhen they heard this they went to his camp in a body and offered their heads to the swordIf I do not kill you my order will not be obeyed said Cao Cao Yet supposing I cut off your heads but I cannot bear to do that severityQuickly flee to the hills and hide so that my soldiers do not capture you The peasants left weepingThen Yuan Tan led out his army against Cao CaoWhen both sides were arrayed Cao Cao rode to the front pointed with his whip at his opponent and railed at him saying I treated you well why then have you turned against me Yuan Tan replied You have invaded my land captured my cities and broken off my marriage yet you accuse me of turning against you Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang to go out and give battleYuan Tan bade Peng An accept the challengeAfter a few bouts Peng An was slain and Yuan Tan having lost fled and went into Nanpi where he was besiegedYuan Tan panicstricken sent Xin Ping to see Cao Cao and arrange surrender He is nothing but a tickleminded child said Cao Cao He is never of the same mind two days running and I cannot depend upon what he saysNow your brother Xin Pi is in my employ and has a post of importance you would better remain here also Sir Prime Minister you are in error said Xin PingIt is said that the lords honor is the servants glory the lords sadness is the servants shameHow can I turn my back on the family I have so long served Cao Cao felt he could not be persuaded and sent him backXin Ping returned and told Yuan Tan the surrender could not be arranged and Yuan Tan turned on him angrily saying Your brother is with Cao Cao and you want to betray me also At this unmerited reproach such a huge wave of anger welled up in Xin Pings breast that he was overcome and fell in a swoonThey carried him out but the shock had been too severe and soon after he diedYuan Tan regretted his conduct when it was too lateThen Guo Tu said Tomorrow when we go out to battle we will drive the people out in front as a screen for the soldiers and we must fight a winning battle That night they assembled all the common people of the place and forced into their hands swords and spearsAt daylight they opened the four gates and a huge party with much shouting came out at each peasantry carrying arms in front and soldiers behind them They pushed on toward Cao Caos camps and a melee began lasted till near midday But this was quite indecisive although heaps of dead lay everywhereSeeing that success was at best only partial Cao Cao rode out to the hills near and thence had the drums beaten for a new attack under his own eyeHis officers and troops seeing that he could observe them in person exerted themselves to the utmost and Yuan Tans army was severely defeatedOf the peasantry driven into the battlefield multitudes were slainCao Hong who displayed very great valor burst into the press of battle and met Yuan Tan face to face The two slashed and hammered at each other and Yuan Tan was killed Guo Tu saw that his side was wholly disorganized and tried to withdraw into the shelter of NanpiYue Jin saw this and opened a tremendous discharge of arrows so that Guo Tu fell and the moat was soon filled with deadThe city fell to Cao Cao he entered and set about restoring peace and orderThen suddenly appeared a new army under two of Yuan Xis generals Jiao Chu and Zhang NanCao Cao led out his troops to meet them but the two commanders laid down their arms and yieldedThey were rewarded with the rank of lordshipThen Zhang Yan the leader of the Black Hills Brigands came with one hundred thousand troops and gave in his submission He was made General Who Pacifies the NorthBy an order of Cao Cao the head of Yuan Tan was exposed and death was threatened to any one who should lament for himNevertheless a man dressed in mourning attire was arrested for weeping below the exposed head at the north gateTaken into Cao Caos presence he said he was Wang Xiu and had been an officer in Qingzhou He had been expelled because he had remonstrated with Yuan Tan but when the news of Yuan Tans death came he had come to weep for his late masterDid you know of my command said Cao CaoI knew it Yet you were not afraid When one has received favors from a man in life it would be wrong not to mourn at his deathHow can one stand in the world if one forgets duty through fearIf I could bury his body I would not mind death Cao Cao said And there were many such as this in the northWhat a pity that the Yuan family could not make the best of themBut if they had done so I should never have dared to turn my eyes toward this place The intrepid mourner was not put to deathThe remains of Yuan Tan were properly interred and Wang Xiu was well treated and even given an appointment In his new position Wang Xiu was asked for advice about the best way to proceed against Yuan Shang who had fled to his brother but Wang Xiu remained silent thereby winning from Cao Cao renewed admiration for his constancyHe is indeed loyal said Cao CaoThen he questioned Guo Jia who advised him saying Give Yuan Xis former generals the command and ask them to attack Youzhou Whereupon Jiao Chu and Zhang Nan were given the command and reinforced by the armies under Lu Xiang Lu Kuang Ma Yan and Zhang Yi to bring about the surrender of Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang Then six generals to attack Youzhou along three routesOther armies led by Li Dian Yue Jin and Zhang Yan were sent against Gao Gan at Bingzhou The two Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang heard of Cao Caos advance with dismay for they had no hope of successful resistanceTherefore they abandoned Youzhou and hastily marched into Liaoxi to seek refuge with the Wuhuan tribespeople in the frontier Wuhuan StateThen Wuhuan Chu new Imperial Protector of Youzhou was not disposed to incur the enmity of the powerful Cao Cao so he called his subordinates together to swear them to support him and said I understand that Cao Cao is the most powerful man of the day and I am going to support him and those who do not go with me I shall put to death Each in turn smeared his lips with the blood of sacrifice and took the oath till it came to the turn of Han HengInstead he dashed his sword to the ground crying I have received great promotions and benefits from the YuansNow my lord has been vanquished my knowledge was powerless to save him my bravery insufficient to cause me to die for him I have failed in my duty But I refuse to commit the crowning act of treachery and ally myself with Cao Cao This speech made the others turn paleThe chief said For a great undertaking there must be lofty principlesHowever success does not necessarily depend upon universal support and since Han Heng is actuated by such sentiments then let him follow his conscience So Wuhuan Chu turned Han Heng out of the assemblyWuhuan Chu then went out of the city to meet and welcome Cao Caos army and rendered his submissionHe was well received and the title given him of General Who Guards the North Then the scouts came to reportGenerals Li Dian Yue Jin and Zhang Yan had marched to Bingzhou but that Gao Gan had occupied Wine Jar Pass and could not be dislodged So Cao Cao marched thither himselfThe defender still maintaining his position Cao Cao asked for plansXun You proposed that a band should go over pretending to be desertersCao Cao assented and then called the two Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang to whom he gave whispered orders They left with their companiesSoon they came near the pass and called out saying We are old officers in Yuan Shaos armies forced into surrender to Cao CaoWe find him so false and he treats us so meanly that we want to return to help our old masterWherefore quickly open your gates to us Gao Gan was suspicious but he let the two officers come up to the pass and when they had stripped off their armor and left their horses they were permitted to enterAnd they said to Gao Gan Cao Caos troops are new to the country and not settled you ought to fall upon their camp this very eveningIf you approve we will lead the attack Gao Gan decided to trust them and prepared to attack giving the two brothers the leadership of ten thousand soldiersBut as they drew near Cao Caos camp a great noise arose behind them and they found themselves in an ambush attacked on all sidesRealizing too late that he had been the victim of a ruse Gao Gan retreated to the pass but found it occupied by Li Dian and Yue Jin Gao Gan then made the best of his way to the Chieftain of the Xiongnu PeopleCao Cao gave orders to hold the passes and sent companies in pursuitWhen Gao Gan reached the boundary of the Xiongnu State he met Ce Xian the Khan of the northern tribespeopleGao Gan dismounted and made a low obeisance saying Cao Cao is conquering and absorbing all the borders and your turn O King will come quicklyI pray you help me and let us smite together for the safety of the northern regions Ce Xian the Khan replied I have no quarrel with Cao Cao why then should he invade my landDo you desire to embroil me with him He would have nothing to do with Gao Gan and sent him swayAt his wits end Gao Gan decided to try to join Liu Biao and go southward so far on his journey as Shanglu when he was taken prisoner and put to death by Governor Wang YanHis head was sent to Cao Cao and Wang Yan received lordship for this service Thus Bingzhou was conqueredThen Cao Cao began to discuss the overthrow of Wuhuan StateCao Hong speaking in the name of his brother officials said The two Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang are nearly done for and too weak to be fearedThey have fled far into the Sea of Sand and if we pursue them thither it may bring down Liu Biao and Liu Bei upon the capital Should we be unable to rescue it the misfortune would be immense Wherefore we beg you to return to Xuchang But Guo Jia was of different adviceYou are wrong said heThough the prestige of our lord fills the empire yet the peoples of the desert relying upon their inaccessibility will not be prepared against usWherefore I say attack and we shall conquer themBeside Yuan Shao was kind to the nomads and the two brothers have been more so They must be destroyedAs for Liu Biao he is a mere gossip who needs not cause the least anxiety And Liu Bei is unfit for any heavy responsibility and will take no trouble over a light oneYou may leave the base with perfect safety and make as long an expedition as you chooseNothing will happen You speak well O Guo Jia said Cao CaoHe led his legions heavy and light to the edge of the desert with many wagons The expedition marched into the desertThe rolling ocean of yellow sand spread its waves before them and they saw far and near the eddying sand pillars and felt the fierce winds that drove them forwardThe road became precipitous and progress difficultCao Cao began to think of returning and spoke thereof to Guo Jia who had advised the journeyGuo Jia had speedily fallen victim to the effects of the climate and at this time he lay in his cart very illCao Caos tears fell as he said My friend you are suffering for my ambition to subdue the Gobi DesertI cannot bear to think you should be ill You have always been very good to me said the sick man and I can never repay what I owe you The country is exceedingly precipitous and I am thinking of going back what think you Guo Jia replied The success of an expedition of this kind depends upon celerityTo strike a sudden blow on a distant spot with a heavy baggage train is difficult To ensure success the need is light troops and a good road to strike quickly before an enemy has time to prepareNow you must find guides who know the road well Then the sick adviser was left at Yizhou for treatment and they sought among the natives for some persons to serve as guidesTian Chou one of Yuan Shaos old generals knew those parts well and Cao Cao called him and questioned himTian Chou said Between autumn and summer this route is under water the shallow places too heavy for wheeled traffic the deep parts insufficient for boats It is always difficultTherefore you would do better to return and at Lulong cross the Baitan Pass into the desert Then advance to Liucheng and smite before there is time to prepareOne sudden rush will settle King Mao Dun For this valuable information and plan Tian Chou was made General Who Calms the North and went in advance as leader and guideNext after him came Zhang Liao and Cao Cao brought up the rearThey advanced by double marchesTian Chou led Zhang Liao to White Wolf Hills where they came upon Yuan Xi Yuan Shang and Mao Dun and a force of ten thousand cavalryZhang Liao galloped to inform his chief and Cao Cao rode up to the top of an eminence to survey the foeHe saw a large mass of cavalry without any military formation advancing in a disorderly crowdSaid he They have no formation we can easily rout them Then he handed over his ensign of command to Zhang Liao who with Xu Chu Yu Jin and Xu Huang made a vigorous attack from four different points with the result that the enemy was thrown into confusionZhang Liao rode forward and slew Mao Dun and the other generals gave inYuan Xi and Yuan Shang with a few thousand of horse got away east into Liaodong Cao Cao then led his army into LiuchengFor his services Tian Chou was conferred the rank of Lord of Liucheng and Commander of that countyBut Tian Chou declined the rank saying with tears I am a renegade and a fugitiveIt is my good fortune that you spared my life and how can I accept a rank for betraying LulongI would rather die than accept the lordship Cao Cao recognized that reason was on Tian Chous side and conferred upon him the office of Court CounselorCao Cao then pacified the Xiongnu Chieftains collected a large number of horses and at once set out on the homeward marchThe season was winter cold and dry For seventy miles there was no water and grain also was scanty The troops fed on horse flesh They had to dig very deep three or four hundred spans to find waterWhen Cao Cao reached Yizhou he rewarded those who had remonstrated with him against the expeditionHe said I took some risk in going so far but by good fortune I have succeeded with the aid of Heaven I have secured victoryI could not be guided by your advice but still they were counsels of safety and therefore I reward you to prove my appreciation of advice and that hereafter you may not fear to speak your minds Adviser Guo Jia did not live to see the return of his lordHis coffin was placed on the bier in a hall of the government offices and Cao Cao went thither to sacrifice to his manesCao Cao mourned for him crying Alas Heaven has smitten me Guo Jia is dead Then turning to his officers he said You gentlemen are of the same age as myself but he was very young to dieI needed him for the future generation and unhappily he has been torn from me in the flower of his ageMy heart and my bowels are torn with grief The servants of the late adviser presented his last testament which they said his dying hand had written and he had told them to say If the Prime Minister shall follow the advice given herein then Liaodong will be secure Cao Cao opened the cover and read nodding his head in agreement and uttering deep sighsBut no other person knew what was written thereinShortly after Xiahou Dun at the head of a delegation presented a petition saying For a long time the Governor of Liaodong Gongsun Kang has been contumacious and it bodes ill for peace that the Yuan brothers have fled to himWould it not be well to attack before they move against you I need not trouble your tiger courage Sirs said Cao Cao smilingWait a few days and you will see the heads of our two enemies sent to me They could not believe itAs has been related the two Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang escaped to the east with a few hundreds of horseThe Governor of Liaodong was a son of Gongsun Du the Warlike the General of Han Gongsun Kang was a native of XiangpingWhen he heard that Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang were on their way to his territory he called a council to decide upon his planAt the council Gongsun Gong rose saying When Yuan Shao was alive he nourished the plan of adding this territory to his ownNow his sons homeless with a broken army and no officers are coming here it seems to me like the dove stealing the magpies nestIf we offer them shelter they will assuredly intrigue against usI advise that they be inveigled into the city put to death and their heads sent to Cao Cao who will be most grateful to us Said the Governor Gongsun Kang I have one fear Cao Cao will come against usIf so it would be better to have the help of the Yuans against him Then you can send spies to ascertain whether Cao Caos army is preparing to attack usIf it is then save the Yuans alive if not then follow my advice It was decided to wait till the spies came backIn the meantime Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang had taken counsel together as they approached Liaodong saying Liaodong has a large army strong enough to oppose Cao Cao We will go thither and submit till we can slay the Governor and take possession Then when we are strong enough we will attack and recover our own land With these intentions they went into the cityThey were received and lodged in the guests quarters but when they wished to see Gongsun Kang he put them off with the excuse of indispositionHowever before many days the spies returned with the news that Cao Caos army was quiescent and there was no hint of any attackThen Gongsun Kang called Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang into his presence But before they came he hid swordsmen and axmen behind the arras in the hallWhen the visitors came and had made their salutations Gongsun Kang bade them be seatedNow it was bitterly cold and on the couches where they were sitting were no coveringsSo Yuan Shang said May we have cushions The host said When your heads take that long long journey will there be any cushions Before Yuan Shang could recover from his fright Gongsun Kang shouted Why do you not begin At this out rushed the assassins and the heads of the two brothers were cut off as they satPacked in a small wooden box they were sent to Cao Cao at YizhouAll this time Cao Cao had been calmly waitingHis impatient officers had petitioned in a body saying Lets march to the capital to ward off Liu Biaos threat if we are not going to attack the east Cao Cao said I am waiting for the heads of the enemyWe will go as soon as the heads arrive In their secret hearts they laughed But then surely enough messenger soon came from Liaodong bringing the headsThen they were greatly surprised and when the messenger presented Gongsun Kangs letters Cao Cao cried Just as Guo Jia said He amply rewarded the messenger and the Governor of Liaodong was made Lord of Xiangping and General of the Left ArmyWhen the officers asked what had happened Cao Cao told them what the late adviser had predicted He read to them the dead officers testament which ran something like thisYuan Xi and Yuan Shang are going to LiaodongIllustrious Sir you are on no account to attack for Gongsun Kang has long lived in fear lest the Yuans should absorb his country When they arrive Gongsun Kang will hesitateIf you attack he will save the Yuans to help him if you wait they will work against each otherThis is evident The officers simply jumped with surprise to see how perfectly events had been foreseenThen Cao Cao at the head of all his officers performed a grand sacrifice before the coffin of the wise Guo JiaHe had died at the age of thirtyeight after eleven years of meritorious and wonderful service in wars When Heaven permitted Guo Jias birth It made him ablest man on earth He knew by rote all histories From him war kept no mysteriesLike Fan Lis his plans were quite decisive As Chen Pings his strokes were most incisiveToo soon he ran his earthly race Too soon the great beam fell from placeWhen Cao Cao returned to Jizhou he sent off the coffin of his late adviser to Capital Xuchang where it was interredThen Cheng Yu and others said As the north has been overcome it is time to settle the south Cao Cao was pleased and said That has long occupied my thoughts The last night he spent in Jizhou Cao Cao went to the eastern corner tower and stood there regarding the sky His only companion was Xun You Presently Cao Cao said That is a very brilliant glow there in the southIt seems too strong for me to do anything there What is there that can oppose your heavenhigh prestige said Xun YouSuddenly a beam of golden light shot up out of the earthSurely a treasure is buried there remarked Xun YouThey went down from the city wall called some guards and led them to the point whence the light proceeded There the men were ordered to digThe southern skies with portents glow The northern lands their treasures showWhat the diggers found will appear in the next chapter CHAPTER Behind The Screen Lady Cai Overhears A Secret Across The Tan Torrent The Dilu Horse Carries Its MasterThe diggers at the spot whence the golden light proceeded presently unearthed a bronze bird Looking at it Cao Cao turned to his companion saying What is the portent You will remember that the mother of the praiseworthy King Shun  dreamed of a jade bird before his birth so certainly it is a felicitous omen said Xun YouCao Cao was very pleased and he ordered forthwith the building of a lofty tower to celebrate the find and they began to dig foundations and cut timber to burn tiles and to smooth bricks for the Bronze Bird Tower on the banks of the River ZhangCao Cao set a year for the buildingHis younger son Cao Zhi said If you build a terraced tower you should add two others one on each side The center tower as the tallest should be called the Bronze Bird Tower the side towers named Jade Dragon Tower and Golden Phoenix TowerThen connect these by flying bridges and the effect will be noble My son your words are very good and by and bye when the building is complete I can solace my old age therein Cao Cao had five sons but this one Cao Zhi was the most clever and his essays were particularly elegantHis father was very fond of him and seeing that the young man took an interest in the building Cao Cao left him with his elder brother Cao Pi at Yejun to superintend the work while he led a halfamillion army that had recently been captured from the Yuans back to Capital Xuchang When he arrived he distributed rewards liberally and memorialized the Throne obtaining the title of the Pure Lord for the late Guo JiaAnd he took Guo Jias son Guo Ye to be brought up in his own familyNext Cao Cao began to consider the reduction of Liu Biaos powerXun You said The Grand Army has only just returned from the north and needs restWait half a year that the soldiers may recover from the fatigue of the campaign and both Liu Biao and Sun Quan will fall at the first roll of the drums Presently Cao Cao approved of this plan and to rest his troops he assigned certain lands to them to till while they restedIn Jingzhou Liu Biao had been very generous to Liu Bei ever since he had come a fugitive seeking shelterOne day at a banquet there came news that two generals Zhang Wu and Chen Sun who had tendered their submission had suddenly begun plundering the people in Jiangxia They evidently meant rebellion If they really rebel it will cause a lot of trouble said Liu Biao rather dismayedDo not let that trouble you I will go and settle it said Liu BeiPleased with this proposal Liu Biao told off thirty thousand troops and placed them under his friend and the army marched as soon as the orders were issued In a short time it reached the scene and the two malcontents came out to fight Liu Bei Guan Yu Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun took their stand beneath the great banner and looked over at the enemyZhang Wu was riding a handsome prancing horse and Liu Bei said He certainly has a fine steed As he spoke Zhao Yun galloped out with his spear set and dashed toward the enemyZhang Wu came out to meet him but the combat was very brief for Zhang Wu was soon killed by a spear thrust Thereupon Zhao Yun laid a hand upon the bridle of the fallen mans horse to lead it back to his own sideThe slain rebels companion Chen Sun at once rode after Zhao Yun whereupon Zhang Fei uttered a loud shout and rode out to meet himWith one thrust Zhang Fei slew the rebelTheir followers now scattered and Liu Bei speedily restored order in Jiangxia and returned to Jingzhou City Liu Biao grateful for this service rode out to the boundary to welcome the victorsThey reentered the city and grand banquets were instituted at which they emptied great goblets in congratulations over the victoryAt one of these banquets the Imperial Protector said With such heroism as my brother has shown Jingzhou has one upon whom to relyBut a source of sorrow is the borders with the lands of Yue Wu and Shu  from which a raid may come at any timeZhang Lu of Shu and Sun Quan of Yue and Wu are to be feared But I have three bold generals said Liu Bei quite equal to any task you can set themSend Zhang Fei to keep ward on the southern border of Yue Guan Yu to guard the city of Guzi against Zhang Lu in the west and Zhao Yun holding the Three Gorges will protect you from Sun QuanWhy need you grieve The scheme appealed strongly to the Imperial Protector but Cai Mao did not approveSo he spoke to his sister Liu Biaos wife saying Liu Bei is putting his troops in such commanding positions all round the regionThat is the danger Lady Cai thus influenced by her brother undertook to remonstrate and that night began by saying to Liu Biao The Jingzhou army seem to have a great liking for Liu Bei they are always coming and going You ought to take precautionsI do not think you should let them stay in the cityWhy not send them on some mission Liu Bei is a good man replied the Imperial ProtectorI think others differ from you said the ladyLiu Biao said nothing but muttered to himselfSoon after he went out of the city to see Liu Bei and noticed he was riding a very handsome horse They told him it was a prize taken from the recently conquered rebels and as he praised it very warmly Liu Bei presented it to himLiu Biao was delighted and rode it back to the cityKuai Yue saw it and asked where it had come fromThe Imperial Protector told him it was a gift from Liu BeiKuai Yue said My passedaway brother Kuai Liang knew horses very well and I am not a bad judgeThis horse has teartracks running down from its eyes and a white blaze on its forehead It is called a Dilu horse and it is a danger to his masterThat is why Zhang Wu was killedI advise you not to ride it Liu Biao began to thinkSoon after he asked Liu Bei to a banquet and in the course of it said You kindly presented me with a horse lately and I am most grateful but you may need it on some of your expeditions and if you do not mind I would like to return it Liu Bei rose and thanked himThe Imperial Protector continued You have been here a long time and I fear I am spoiling your career as a warriorNow Xinye in Xiangyang is no povertystricken town how would you like to garrison it with your own troops Liu Bei naturally took the offer as a command and set out as soon as he could taking leave of the Imperial Protector the next day And so he took up his quarters in XinyeWhen he left Jingzhou City he noticed in the gate a person making him emphatic salutations and the man presently said You should not ride that horse Liu Bei looked at the man and recognized in the speaker one of the secretaries of Liu Biao named Yi Ji a native of ShanyangSo he hastily dismounted and asked whyYi Ji replied Yesterday I heard that Kuai Yue told the Imperial Protector that that horse was a Dilu horse and brought disaster to its ownerThat is why it was returned to youHow can you mount it again I am deeply touched by your affection replied Liu Bei but a persons life is governed by fate and what a horse can interfere with that Yi Ji admitted his superior view and thereafter he kept in touch with Liu Bei wherever he wentThe arrival of Liu Bei in Xinye was a matter of rejoicing to all the inhabitants and the whole administration was reformedIn the spring of the twelfth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  Liu Beis wife Lady Gan game birth to a son who was named Liu ShanThe night of his birth a crane settled on the roof of the house screeched some forty times and then flew away westwardJust at the time of birth a miraculous incense filled the chamberLady Gan one night had dreamed that she was looking up at the sky and the constellation of the Great Bear had fallen down her throat And she conceived soon after While Cao Cao was absent from the capital on his northern expedition Liu Bei went to Liu Biao and said to him Why do you not take this opportunity to march against the capitalAn empire might follow from that I am well placed here was the reply Why should I attempt other things Liu Bei said no moreThen the Imperial Protector invited him into the private apartments to drink and while they were so engaged he suddenly began to sigh despondentlyO Brother why do you sigh thus asked Liu BeiI have a secret sorrow that is difficult to speak about said Liu BiaoLiu Bei was on the point of asking what it was when Lady Cai came and stood behind the screen whereat Liu Biao hung his head and became silentBefore long host and guest bade each other farewell and Liu Bei went back to his own place at XinyeThat winter they heard that Cao Cao had returned from Liucheng and Liu Bei sighed when he reflected that his friend had paid no heed to his adviceUnexpectedly a messenger came from the capital city with a request that Liu Bei would go thither to consult with the Imperial Protector So he started at once with the messenger to Jingzhou CityHe was received very kindly and when the salutations were over the two men went into the private quarters at the rear to dine Presently Liu Biao said Cao Cao has returned and he is stronger than ever I am afraid he means to absorb this regionI am sorry I did not follow your advice for I have missed an opportunity In this period of disruption with strife on every side one cannot pretend that there will be no more opportunitiesIf you only take what that offers there will be nothing to regret What you say Brother is quite to the point replied Liu BiaoThey drank on for a time till presently Liu Bei noticed that his host was weeping and when he asked the cause of these tears Liu Biao replied It is that secret sorrow I spoke of to you before I wished to tell you but there was no opportunity that day O Brother what difficulty have you and can I assist youI am entirely at your service My first wife of the Chen family bore me a son Liu Qi my eldestHe grew up virtuous but weakly and unfitted to succeed me in my office Later I took a wife of the Cai family who bore me a son named Liu Zong fairly intelligentIf I pass over the elder in favor of the younger there is the breach of the rule of primogeniture and if I follow law and custom there are the intrigues of the Cai family and clan to be reckoned with Further the army is in the hollow of their handsThere will be trouble and I cannot decide what to do Liu Bei said All experience proves that to set aside the elder for the younger is to take the way of confusionIf you fear the power of the Cai faction then gradually reduce its power and influence but do not let doting affection lead you into making the younger your heir Liu Biao pondered silentBut Lady Cai had had a suspicion why her lord had summoned Liu Bei and what was the subject of discussion so she had determined to listen secretlyShe was behind the screen when the matter was talked over and she conceived deep resentment against Liu Bei for what he had saidOn his side Liu Bei felt that his advice had fallen upon a forbidden subject and he arose and walked across the roomAs he did so he noticed that he was getting heavy and stiff and a furtive tear stole down his cheek as he thought of the pastWhen he returned and sat down his host noticed the traces of weeping and asked the cause of his sorrowIn the past I was always in the saddle and I was slender and litheNow it is so long since I rode that I am getting stout and the days and months are slipping by wasted I shall have old age on me in no time and I have accomplished nothingSo I am sad I have heard a story that when you were at Xuchang at the season of green plums you and Cao Cao were discussing heroes You mentioned this name and that to him as humans of parts and he rejected every one of them Finally he said that you and he were the only two humans of real worth in the whole empireIf he with all his power and authority did not dare to place himself in front of you I do not think you need grieve about having accomplished nothing At this flattering speech Liu Bei as wine was getting the better of him and in a half maudlin manner replied If I only had a starting point then I would not be afraid of any one in a world full of fools His host said no more and the guest feeling that he had slipped up in speech rose as if drunk took leave and staggered out saying he must return to his lodging to recover The episode has been celebrated in a poemWhen with crooking fingers counting Cao Cao reckoned up the forceful Humans of real determination Only two he found and one was Liu Bei But by inaction He had grown both fat and slothful Yet the months and years in passing Fretted him with nought accomplishedThough Liu Biao kept silence when he heard the words of Liu Bei yet he felt the more uneasy After the departure of his guest he retired into the inner quarters where he met his wifeLady Cai said I happened to be behind the screen just now and so heard the words of Liu Bei They betray scant regard for other people and mean that he would take your territory if he couldIf you do not remove him it will go ill with you Her husband made no reply but only shook his headThen Lady Cai took counsel with her kinsman Cai Mao who said Let me go to the guesthouse and slay him forthwith and we can report what we have done His sister consented and he went out and that night told off a party of soldiers to do the foul deedNow Liu Bei sat in his lodging by the light of a single candle till about the third watch when he prepared to retire to bedHe was startled by a knock at his door and in came Yi Ji who had heard of the plot against his new master and had come in the darkness to warn himHe related the details of the plot and urged speedy departureI have not said farewell to my host how can I go away said Liu BeiIf you go to bid him farewell you will fall a victim to the Cai faction said Yi JiSo Liu Bei said a hasty goodbye to his friend called up his escort and they all mounted and rode away by the light of the stars toward XinyeSoon after they had left the soldiers arrived at the guesthouse but their intended victim was already well on his way Naturally the failure of the plot chagrined the treacherous Cai Mao but he took the occasion to scribble some calumnious verses on one of the partitionsThen he went to see Liu Biao to whom he said Liu Bei has treacherous intentions as can be seen from some lines written on the wallAnd his hurried departure is suspicious Liu Biao felt doubtful but he went to the guesthouse and there on the wall he read this poem Too long far too long I have dreamed life away Gazing at scenery day after dayA dragon can never be kept in a pond He should ride on the thunder to heaven and beyondGreatly angered by what he read Liu Biao drew his sword and swore to slay the writerBut before he had gone many paces his anger had already died down and he said to himself I have seen much of the man but have never known him write versesThis is the handiwork of some one who wishes to sow discord between us So saying he turned back and with the point of his sword scraped away the poem Then putting up his sword he mounted and rode homeBy and bye Cai Mao reminded him saying The soldiers are awaiting your orders to go to Xinye and arrest Liu Bei There is no hurry he replied Cai Mao saw his brotherinlaws hesitation and again sought his sisterShe said Soon there is to be the great gathering at Xiangyang and we can arrange something for that day Next day Cai Mao petitioned the Imperial Protector saying We have had several fruitful harvests recentlyI pray you Sir attend the Full Harvest Festival at Xiangyang it would be an encouragement to the people I have been feeling my old trouble lately I certainly cannot go replied he but my two sons can go to represent me and to receive the guests They are full young replied Cai MaoThey may make some mistakes Then go to Xinye and request Liu Bei to receive the guests said Liu Biao Nothing could have pleased Cai Mao more for this would bring Liu Bei within reach of his plot Without loss of time he sent to Liu Bei requesting him to go to preside at the Festival It has been said that Liu Bei made the best of his way home to XinyeHe felt that he had offended by that slip in speech but determined to keep silence about it and attempt no explanation So he discussed it with nobody Then came the message asking him to preside at the Festival and he needed counselSun Qian said You have seemed worried and preoccupied lately and I think something untoward happened at JingzhouYou should consider well before you accept this invitation Thereupon Liu Bei told his confidants the whole storyGuan Yu said You yourself think your speech offended the Imperial Protector but he said nothing to show displeasureYou need pay no attention to the babble of outsiders like Yi JiXiangyang is quite near and if you do not go Liu Biao will begin to suspect something really is wrong You speak well said Liu BeiSaid Zhang Fei Banquets are no good gatherings are no better it is best not to go Let me take three hundred horse and foot as escort there will be no trouble then said Zhao Yun That is the best course said Liu BeiThey soon set out for the gathering place and Cai Mao met them at the boundary and was most affable and courteous Soon arrived the Imperial Protectors sons at the head of a great company of officers civil and military Their appearance put Liu Bei more at easeHe was conducted to the guesthouse and Zhao Yun posted his men so as to guard it completely while he himself armed remained close to his chiefLiu Qi said to Liu Bei My father is feeling unwell and could not come wherefore he begs you Uncle Liu Bei to preside at the various ceremonies and give encouragement to the officers who administer the region Really I am unfit for such responsibilities said Liu BeiBut my brothers command must be obeyed Next day it was reported that the officials from fortyone counties of nine territories of Jingzhou had all arrivedThen Cai Mao said to Kuai Yue This Liu Bei is the villain of the age and if left alive will certainly work harm to usHe must be got rid of now I fear you would forfeit everybodys favor if you harmed him replied Kuai YueI have already secretly spoken in these terms to Imperial Protector Liu Biao said Cai Mao and I have his word here So it may be regarded as settled then we can prepare Cai Mao added My brothers are readyCai He is posted on the road to the Xian Hills from the east gate Cai Zhong and Cai Xun are on the north and south roadsNo guard is needed on the west as the Tan Torrent is quite safeguard enoughEven with legions he could not get over that Kuai Yue replied I notice that Zhao Yun never leaves himI feel sure he expects some attack I have placed five hundred men in ambush in the city We will tell Wen Ping and Wang Wei to invite all the military officers to a banquet at one of the pavilions outside the city and Zhao Yun will be among themThen will be our opportunity Cai Mao thought this a good device for getting Zhao Yun out of the wayNow oxen and horses had been slaughtered and a grand banquet preparedLiu Bei rode to the residence on the horse of ill omen and when he arrived the steed was led into the back part of the enclosure and tethered thereSoon the guests arrived and Liu Bei took his place as master of the feast with the two sons of the Imperial Protector one on each side The guests were all arranged in order of rankZhao Yun stood near his lord sword in hand as a faithful henchman should doThen Wen Ping and Wang Wei came to invite Zhao Yun to the banquet they had prepared for the military officersBut he declinedHowever Liu Bei told him to go and after some demur he went Then Cai Mao perfected his final arrangements placing his people surrounding the place like a ring of ironThe three hundred guards that formed the escort of Liu Bei were sent away to the guesthouse All were ready and awaiting the signal At the third course Yi Ji took a goblet of wine in his hands and approached Liu Bei at the same time giving him a meaningful look Then in a low voice he said Make an excuse to get sway Liu Bei understood and presently rose and went to the inner chamber and then he went to the backyard There he found Yi Ji who had gone thither after presenting the cup of wineYi Ji then told him saying Cai Mao plots to kill you and all the roads have been guarded except that to the westMy lord must to lose no time to depart Liu Bei was quite taken aback However he got hold of the Dilu horse opened the door of the garden and led it out Then he took a flying leap into the saddle and galloped off without waiting for the escort He made for the west gateAt the gate the wardens wanted to question him but he only whipped up his steed and rode throughThe guards at the gate ran off to report to Cai Mao who quickly went in pursuit with five hundred soldiersAs has been said Liu Bei burst out at the west gate Before he had gone far there rolled before him a river barring the way It was the Tan Torrent many score spans in width which pours its waters into the River Xiang Its current was very swiftLiu Bei reached the bank and saw the river was unfordableSo he turned his horse and rode back Then not far off he saw a cloud of dust and knew that his pursuers were therein He thought that it was all overHowever he turned again toward the swift river and seeing the soldiers now quite near plunged into the streamA few paces and he felt the horses fore legs floundering in front while the water rose over the skirt of his robeThen he plied the whip furiously crying Dilu Dilu why betray me Whereupon the good steed suddenly reared up out of the water and with one tremendous leap was on the western bankLiu Bei felt as if he had come out of the cloudsIn after years the famous court official Su Dongpo wrote a poem on this leap over the Tan TorrentIm growing old the leaves are sere My sun slopes westward soon will sink And I recall that yesteryear I wandered by Tan River brinkIrresolute anon I paused Anon advanced and gazed around I marked the autumns reddened leaves And watched them eddying to the groundI thought of all the mighty deeds Of him who set the House of Han On high and all the struggles since The battlefields the blood that ran I saw the nobles gathered round The board set in the Banquet Hall Amid them one above whose head There hung a sword about to fallI saw him quit that festive throng And westward ride a lonely way I saw a squadron follow swift Intent the fugitive to slayI saw him reach the River Tan Whose swirling current rushes by Adown the bank he galloped fast Now leap my steed I heard him cryHis steeds hoofs churn the swollen stream What chills he that the waves run highHe hears the sound of clashing steel Of thundering squadrons coming nighAnd upward from the foaming waves I saw two peerless beings soar One was a destined western king And him another dragon bore The Tan still rolls from east to west Its roaring torrent never dryThose dragons twain ah Where are they Yes where But there is no replyThe setting sun in dark relief Against the glowing western sky Throws out the everlasting hills While saddened here I stand and sighHumans died to found the kingdoms three Which now as misty dreams remain Of greatest deeds the traces oft Are faint that fleeting years retain Thus Liu Bei crossed the rolling riverThen he turned and looked back at the other bank which his pursuers had just gainedWhy did you run sway from the feast called out Cai MaoWhy did you wish to harm one who has done you no injury replied Liu BeiI have never thought of such a thing do not listen to what people say to you But Liu Bei saw that his enemy was fitting an arrow to his bowstring so he whipped up his steed and rode away southwestWhat spirits aided him said Cai Mao to his followersThen Cai Mao turned to go back to the city but in the gate he saw Zhao Yun coming out at the head of his company of guardsBy wondrous leap the dragon steed his riders life could save Now follows him on vengeance bent his masters henchman braveThe next chapters will tell what fate befell the traitor CHAPTER  Liu Bei Meets A Recluse At Nanzhang Shan Fu Sees A Noble Lord At XinyeJust as Cai Mao was going into the city he met Zhao Yun and his three hundred coming outIt had happened that while at the banquet Zhao Yun had noticed some movement of soldiers and horses and had at once gone to the banquethall to see if all was well with his lord Missing Liu Bei from his place Zhao Yun had become anxious and gone to the guesthouseThere he heard that Cai Mao had gone off to the west gate with troops So he quickly took his spear mounted and went he and the escort in hot haste along the same roadMeeting Cai Mao near the gate he said Where is my lord He left the banquethall quite suddenly and I know not whither he has gone was the replyNow Zhao Yun was cautious and careful and had no desire to act hastily so he urged his horse forward till he came to the river There he was checked by a torrent without ford or bridgeAt once he turned back and shouted after Cai Mao You invited my lord to a feast what means this going after him with a squadron of horse Cai Mao replied It is my duty to guard the officials of fortyone counties who have assembled here as I am the Chief Commander Whither have you driven my lord asked Zhao YunThey tell me he rode quite alone out through the west gate but I have not seen him Zhao Yun was anxious and doubtfulAgain he rode to the river and looked around This time he noticed a wet track on the farther sideHe thought to himself that it was almost an impossible crossing for a person and a horse so he ordered his followers to scatter and searchBut they also could find no trace of Liu BeiZhao Yun turned again to the city By the time he had reached the wall Cai Mao had gone withinHe then questioned the gate wardens and they all agreed in saying that Liu Bei had ridden out at full gallop That was all they knewFearing to reenter the city lest he should fall into an ambush Zhao Yun started for Xinye After that marvelous lifesaving leap over the Tan Torrent Liu Bei felt elated but rather dazedHe could not help telling himself My safety is due to an especial interposition of Providence Following a tortuous path he urged his steed toward NanzhangBut the sun sank to the west and his destination seemed yet a long way offThen he saw a young cowherd seated on the back of a buffalo and playing on a short flute If I were only as happy sighed Liu BeiHe checked his horse and looked at the lad who stopped his beast ceased playing on the pipe and stared fixedly at the strangerYou must be Liu Bei the general who fought the Yellow Scarves said the boy presently Liu Bei was taken abackHow can you know my name a young rustic like you living in such a secluded place said heOf course I do not know you but my master often has visitors and they all talk about Liu Bei the tall man whose hands hang down below his knees and whose eyes are very prominent They say he is the most famous man of the dayNow you General are just such a man as they talk about and surely you are he Well who is your master My masters name is Sima HuiHe belongs to Yingchuan and his Taoist appellation is WaterMirror Who are your masters friends that you mentioned They are Pang Degong and Pang Tong of Xiangyang And who are they Uncle and nephewPang Degong is ten years older than my master the other is five years youngerOne day my master was up in a tree picking mulberries when Pang Tong arrived They began to talk and kept it up all day my master did not come down till the eveningMy master is very fond of Pang Tong and calls him brother And where does your master live In that wood there in front said the cowherd pointing to it There he has a farmstead I really am Liu Bei and you might lead me to your master that I may salute him The cowherd led the way for about one mile when Liu Bei found himself in front of a farm houseHe dismounted and went to the center door Suddenly came to his ear the sound of a lute most skillfully played and the air was extremely beautifulHe stopped his guide and would not allow him to announce a visitor but stood there rapt by the melodySuddenly the music ceasedHe heard a deep laugh and a man appeared saying Amidst the clear and subtle sounds of the lute there suddenly rang out a high note as though some noble man was near That is my master said the lad pointingLiu Bei saw before him a tall figure slender and straight as a pine tree a very chosen vessel Hastening forward he salutedThe skirt of his robe was still wet from the riverYou have escaped from a grave danger today Sir said WaterMirrorLiu Bei was startled into silence and the cowherd said to his master This is Liu Bei WaterMirror asked him to enter and when they were seated in their relative positions as host and guest Liu Bei glanced round the roomUpon the bookshelves were piled books and manuscripts The window opened upon an exquisite picture of pines and bamboos and a lute lay upon a stone couch The room showed refinement in its last degreeWhence come you Illustrious Sir asked the hostBy chance I was passing this way and the lad pointed you out to me So I came to bow in your honored presenceI cannot tell what pleasure it gives me WaterMirror laughed saying Why this mystery Why must you conceal the truthYou have certainly just escaped from a grave danger Then Liu Bei told the story of the banquet and the flightI knew it all from your appearance said his host Your name has long been familiar but whence comes it that up to the present you are only a homeless devil I have suffered many a check during my life said Liu Bei and through one of them am I here now It should not be so but the reason is that you still lack the one person to aid you I am simple enough in myself I know but I have Sun Qian Mi Zhu and Jian Yong on the civil side and for warriors I have Guan Yu Zhang Fei and Zhao YunThese are all most loyal helpers and I depend upon them not a little Your fighting generals are good fit to oppose a legion The pity is you have no really able adviserYour civilians are but pallid students of books not humans fitted to weave and control destiny I have always yearned to find one of those marvelous recluses who live among the hills till their day arriveSo far I have sought in vain You know what the Teacher Confucius said In a hamlet of ten households there must be one true human Can you say there is no one I am simple and uninstructed I pray you enlighten me You have heard what the street children singIn eight and nine years begins decay Four years then comes the fateful day When destiny will show the way And the dragon flies out of the mire This song was first heard when the new reign style was adopted The first line was fulfilled when Imperial Protector Liu Biao lost his first wife and when his family troubles beganThe next line relates to the approaching death of Liu Biao and there is not a single person among all his crowd of officers who has the least abilityThe last two lines will be fulfilled in you General Liu Bei started up in surprise crying How could such a thing be WaterMirror continued At this moment the marvelously clever ones of the earth are all here and you Sir ought to seek them Where are theyWho are they said Liu Bei quicklyIf you could find either SleepingDragon or BloomingPhoenix you could restore order in the empire But who are these two His host clapped his hands smiled and said Good very good When Liu Bei persisted and pressed home his questions WaterMirror said It is getting lateYou might stay the night here General and we will talk over these things tomorrow He called to a lad to bring wine and food for his guest and his horse was taken to the stable and fedAfter Liu Bei had eaten he was shown to a chamber opening off the main room and went to bedBut the words of his host would not be banished and he lay there only dozing till far into the nightSuddenly he became fully awake at the sound of a knock at the door and a person entering And he heard his host say Where are you from Liu Bei rose from his couch and listened secretlyHe heard the visitor reply It has long been said that Liu Biao treated good humans as good humans should be treated and bad humans as they should be treatedSo I went to see for myself But that reputation is undeserved He does treat good people correctly but he cannot use them and he treats wicked people in the right way all but dismissing themSo I left a letter for him and went away and here I am WaterMirror replied You capable enough to be the adviser of a king ought to be able to find some one fit to serve Why did you cheapen yourself so far as to go to Liu BiaoBeside there is a real hero right under your eyes and you do not know him It is just as you say replied the strangerLiu Bei listened with great joy for he thought this visitor was certainly one of the two he was advised to look for Liu Bei would have shown himself then and there but he thought that would look strangeSo he waited till daylight when he sought out his host and said Who was it came last night A friend of mine was the reply Liu Bei begged for an introductionWaterMirror said He wants to find an enlightened master and so he has gone elsewhere When Liu Bei asked his name his host only replied Good good And when Liu Bei asked who they were who went by the names of SleepingDragon and BloomingPhoenix he only elicited the same replyLiu Bei then bowing low before his host begged him to leave the hills and help him to bring about the restoration of the ruling house to its prerogativesBut WaterMirror replied Humans of the hills and woods are unequal to such a taskHowever there must be many far abler than I who will help you if you seek them While they were talking they heard outside the farm the shouts of troops and neighing of horses and a servant came in to say that a general with a large company of soldiers had arrivedLiu Bei went out hastily to see who these were and found Zhao Yun He was much relieved and Zhao Yun dismounted and entered the houseLast night on my return to Xinye said Zhao Yun I could not find my lord so I followed at once and traced you hereI pray you return quickly as I fear an attack on the city So Liu Bei took leave of his host and the whole company returned to XinyeBefore they had gone far another army appeared and when they had come nearer they saw Guan Yu and Zhang FeiThey met with great joy and Liu Bei told them of the wonderful leap his horse had made over the torrent All expressed surprise and pleasureAs soon as they reached the city a council was called and Zhao Yun said You ought first of all to indite a letter to Liu Biao telling him all these things The letter was prepared and Sun Qian bore it to the seat of government in Jingzhou CityHe was received and Liu Biao at once asked the reason of Liu Bei hasty flight from the festivalWhereupon the letter was presented and the bearer related the machinations of Cai Mao and told of the escape and the amazing leap over the Tan TorrentLiu Biao was very angry sent for Cai Mao and berated him soundly saying How dare you try to hurt my brother And he ordered Cai Mao out to executionLiu Biaos wife Cai Maos sister prayed for a remission of the death penalty but Liu Biao refused to be appeasedThen spoke Sun Qian saying If you put Cai Mao to death I fear Uncle Liu Bei will be unable to remain here Then Cai Mao was reprieved but dismissed with a severe reprimandLiu Biao sent his elder son Liu Qi back with Sun Qian to apologizeWhen Liu Qi reached Xinye Liu Bei welcomed him and gave a banquet in his honorAfter some little drinking the chief guest suddenly began to weep and presently said My step mother Lady Cai always cherishes a wish to put me out of the way and I do not know how to avoid her angerCould you advise me Uncle Liu Bei exhorted him to be careful and perfectly filial and nothing could happenSoon after the young man took his leave and wept at partingLiu Bei escorted Liu Qi well on his way and pointing to his steed said I owe my life to this horse had it not been for him I had been already below the Nine Golden Springs It was not the strength of the horse but your noble fortune Uncle They parted the young man weeping bitterlyOn reentering the city Liu Bei met a person in the street wearing a hempen turban a cotton robe confined by a black girdle and black shoes He came along singing a song The universe is rived O Now nears the end of all The noble mansion quakes O What beam can stay the fallA wise one waits his lord OBut hidden in the glen The seeker knows not him O Nor me of common humans Liu Bei listenedSurely this is one of the people WaterMirror spoke of thought he He dismounted spoke to the singer and invited him into his residenceThen when they were seated he asked the strangers name I am from Yingchuan and my name is San FuI have known you by repute for a long time and they said you appreciated humans of ability I wanted to come to you but every way of getting an introduction seemed closedSo I bethought me of attracting your notice by singing that song in the market place Liu Bei thought he had found a treasure and treated the newcomer with the greatest kindnessThen San Fu spoke of the horse that he had seen Liu Bei riding and asked to look at itSo the animal was brought roundIs not this a Dilu horse said San FuBut though it is a good steed it risks his masterYou must not ride it It has already fulfilled the omens said Liu Bei and he related the story of the leap over the Tan TorrentBut that was saving his master not risking him it will surely harm some one in the end But I can tell you how to avert the omen I should be glad to hear it said Liu BeiIf you have an enemy against whom you bear a grudge give him this horse and wait till it has fulfilled the evil omens on this person then you can ride it in safety Liu Bei changed color What SirYou are but a new acquaintance and you would advise me to take an evil course and to harm another for my own advantage No SirI cannot listen His guest smiled saying People said you were virtuous I could not ask you directly so I put it that way to test you Liu Beis expression changedHe rose and returned the compliment saying But how can I be virtuous while I lack your teaching When I came here I heard the people saying Since Liu Bei came here O blessed dayWeve had good luck long may he staySo you see the effects of your virtue extend to the ordinary people Thereupon San Fu was made Commanding Adviser of the armyThe one idea that held Cao Cao after his return from Jizhou was the capture of Jingzhou He sent Cao Ren and Li Dian with the two brothers Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang who had surrendered to camp at Fankou with thirty thousand troops and so threaten Jingzhou and Xiangyang Thence he sent spies to find out the weak pointsThen the two Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang petitioned Cao Ren saying Liu Bei is strengthening his position at Xinye and laying in large supplies Some great scheme is afoot and he should be checkedSince our surrender we have performed no noteworthy service and if you will give us five thousand soldiers we promise to bring you the head of Liu Bei Cao Ren was only too glad and the expedition set outThe scouts reported this to Liu Bei who turned to San Fu for adviceSan Fu said They must not be permitted to cross the boundarySend Guan Yu and Zhang Fei left and right each with one thousand troops one to attack the enemy on the march the other to cut off the retreatYou and Zhao Yun will make a front attack Guan Yu and Zhang Fei started and then Liu Bei went out at the gate with two thousand troops to oppose the enemyBefore they had gone far they saw a great cloud of dust behind the hills This marked the approach of the Lu brothers Presently both sides being arrayed Liu Bei rode out and stood by his standardHe called out Who are you who thus would encroach on my territory I am the great General Lu Kuang and I have the order of the Prime Minister to make you prisoner said the leaderLiu Bei ordered Zhao Yun to go out and the two generals engagedVery soon Zhao Yun with a spear thrust had disposed of his opponent and Liu Bei gave the signal to attackLu Xiang could not maintain his position and led his troops offSoon his force found themselves attacked by an army rushing in from the side led by Guan Yu The loss was more than a half and the remainder fled for safetyAbout three miles farther on they found their retreat barred by an army under Zhang Fei who stood in the way with a long spear ready to thrust crying out Zhang Fei is waiting Zhang Fei bore down upon Lu Xiang who was slain without a chance of striking a blowThe troops again fled in disorderThey were pursued by Liu Bei and the greater part killed or capturedThen Liu Bei returned into Xinye where he rewarded San Fu and feasted his victorious soldiersSome of the defeated troops took the news of the deaths of the leaders and the capture of their comrades to Cao Ren at FankouCao Ren much distressed consulted Li Dian who advised saying The loss is due to our underestimation of our enemy Now we should stay where we are hold on and request reinforcements Not so said Cao RenWe cannot support calmly the death of two leaders and the loss of so many soldiers We must avenge them quicklyXinye is but a crossbowslug of a place and not worth disturbing the Prime Minister for Liu Bei is a man of metal said Li DianDo not esteem him lightly What are you afraid of said Cao RenThe Rule of War says To know your enemy and yourself is the secret of victory replied Li DianI am not afraid of the battle but I do not think we can conquer You are a traitor cried Cao Ren angrilyThen I will capture Liu Bei myself Do so and I will guard this city said Li DianIf you do not go with me it is a proof that you are a traitor retorted Cao RenAt this reproach Li Dian felt constrained to join the expedition So they told off twenty five thousand troops with which they crossed the River Yu for XinyeThe officers all keenly felt the shame of many slain The chief determines on revenge and marches out againWhat measure of success the expedition met with will be related in the next chapter CHAPTER  Shan Fus Strategy Fankou Is Captured Xu Shus AffectionZhuge Liang Is Recommended In hot anger Cao Ren lost no time in marching out to avenge the loss of so many of his army He hastily crossed the River Yu to attack Xinye and trample it in the dust When San Fu got back into the city he said to Liu Bei When Cao Ren now at Fankou hears of his losses he will try to retrieve them and will come to attack us What is the counter move asked Liu Bei As he will come with all his force his own city will be left undefended we will surprise it By what ruse The adviser leaned over and whispered to his chiefWhatever the plan was it pleased Liu Bei who made arrangementsSoon the scouts reported Cao Ren crossing the river with a mighty hostJust as I guessed said San Fu hearing of itThen he suggested that Liu Bei should lead out one army against the invadersLiu Bei did so and when the formation was complete Zhao Yun rode to the front as champion and challenged the other sideLi Dian rode out and engagedAt about the tenth bout Li Dian found he was losing and retired toward his own sideZhao Yun pressed after him but was checked by a heavy discharge of arrows from the wings Then both sides stopped the battle and retired to their camps Li Dian reported to his chief Our enemy are brave very full of spirit and we will be hard to overcomeWe would better retreat to Fankou and wait for reinforcements Cao Ren angrily replied You damped the armys spirit before we started and now you betray usYou have been bought and you deserve death Cao Ren called in the executioners and they led away their victimBut the other officers came to intercede and Li Dian was sparedHowever he was transferred to the command of the rear while Cao Ren himself led the attackNext day the drums beat an advance and Cao Ren having drawn up his soldiers sent a messenger over to ask if Liu Bei recognized his plan of battle array So San Fu went on a hill and looked over itThen he said to Liu Bei The arrangement is called The Eight Docked Gates and the names of the gates are Birth Exit Expanse Wound Fear Annihilation Obstacle and DeathIf you enter by one of the three Birth Exit or Expanse you succeed if by one of the gates Wound Fear or Annihilation you sustain injuriesThe other two gates Obstacles and Death will bring the endNow though the eight gates are all there quite correct the central keypost is lacking and the whole formation can be thrown into confusion by entry from the southeast and exit due west Wherefore certain orders were issued and Zhao Yun leading five hundred troops rode out on his prancing steed to break the arrayHe burst in as directed at the southeast and with great clamor and fighting reached the centerCao Ren made for the north but Zhao Yun instead of following him made a dash westward and got throughThence he turned round to the southeast again and smote till Cao Rens army was in disarray Liu Bei gave a general advance signal and the victory was completeThe beaten enemy retired San Fu forbade pursuit and they returnedThe loss of the battle convinced Cao Ren of the wisdom of his colleague Li Dian and he sent for Li Dian to consultThey certainly have some very able person in Liu Beis army since my formation was so quickly broken said Cao RenMy chief anxiety is about Fankou said Li DianI will raid their camp this night said Cao RenIf I succeed we will decide upon what should be done nextIf I fail we will return to Fankou Their camp will be well prepared against such a thing and you will fail said Li DianHow can you expect to fight successfully when you are so full of doubts said Cao Ren angrily He held no more converse with his cautious colleague but himself took command of the van and set outLi Dian was relegated to the rearThe attack on the enemys camp was fixed for the second watchNow as San Fu was discussing plans with his chief a whirlwind from the northeast went by which San Fu said There will be a raid on the camp tonight How shall we meet it said Liu BeiThe plans are quite ready was the reply San Fu whispered them to the chiefSo at the second watch when the enemy arrived they saw fires on all sides the stockades and huts burningCao Ren understood at once that all hope of a surprise was vain and he turned to get away as quickly as possibleThis was the signal for Zhao Yun to fall on and that cut Cao Rens return roadHe hastened north toward the river and reached the bank but while waiting for boats to cross the stream up came Zhang Fei and attackedBy dint of great efforts and with the support of Li Dian Cao Ren got into a boat but most of the soldiers were drowned in the stream As soon as he got to the farther shore he bolted for FankouHe reached the wall and hailed the gate but instead of a friendly welcome he heard the rolling of drums which was soon followed by the appearance of a body of troops Guan Yu led themI took the city a long time ago shouted Guan YuThis was a severe shock to Cao Ren who turned to fleeAs soon as he faced about Guan Yu attacked and killed many of his forceThe remnant hastened to XuchangOn the road the beaten general wondered who had advised his opponents with such success and he asked the natives for the answerWhile the defeated Cao Ren had to find his way back to the capital Liu Bei had scored a great successAfterwards he marched to Fankou where he was welcomed by Magistrate Liu Mi himself a scion of the ruling family who had been born in Changsha He received Liu Bei as a guest in his own house and gave banquets and treated him exceedingly wellIn the train of the Magistrate Liu Bei saw a very handsome and distinguishedlooking young man and asked who he wasLiu Mi replied He is my nephew Kou Feng an orphan whom I am taking care of Liu Bei had taken a great liking for the lad and proposed to adopt himHis guardian was willing and so the adoption was arrangedThe young mans name was changed to Liu Feng When Liu Bei left he took his adopted son with himLiu Feng was then made to bow before Guan Yu and Zhang Fei as unclesGuan Yu was doubtful of the wisdom of adopting another son saying You have a son why do you think it necessary to adopt anotherIt may cause confusion HowI shall treat him as a father should and he will serve me as befits a son Guan Yu was displeasedThen Liu Bei and San Fu began further discussions of strategy and they decided to leave Zhao Yun with one thousand soldiers to guard Fankou and they returned to XinyeIn the meantime Cao Caos defeated generals had gone backWhen they saw the Prime Minister Cao Ren threw himself on the ground weeping and acknowledging his faults He told the tale of his lossesThe fortune of war said Cao CaoBut I should like to know who laid Liu Beis plans That was San Fu said Cao RenWho is he asked Cao CaoCheng Yu said The man is not San FuWhen young this man was fond of fencing and used to take up the quarrels of other men and avenge their wrongsAt the end of Emperor Ling he killed a man to avenge his friend and then he let down his hair muddled his face and was trying to escape when a lictor caught him and questioned him He would not replySo they carted him through the streets beating a drum and asking if any one recognized him Nobody dared own to knowing him if they did soHowever his comrades managed to release him secretly and he ran away under some other name Then he turned to study and wandered hither and thither wherever scholars were to be found He was a regular disputant with Sima HuiHis real name is Xu Shu and he comes from YingchuanSan Fu is merely an assumed name How does he compare with yourself asked Cao CaoTen times cleverer It is a pityIf able people gather to Liu Bei his wings will soon growWhat is to be done Xu Shu is there now but if you wanted him it would not be difficult to call him replied Cheng YuHow could I make him come said Cao CaoHe is noted for his affection for his mother His father died young leaving his mother a widow with one other sonNow that son is dead and his mother Lady Xun has no one to care for herIf you sent and got his mother here and told her to write and summon her son he would surely come Cao Cao sent without loss of time and had the old lady brought to the capital where he treated her exceedingly wellPresently he said I hear you have a very talented son who is now at Xinye helping on that rebel Liu Bei against the government There he is like a jewel in a muckheap it is a pitySupposing you were to call him I could speak of him before the Emperor and he might get an important office Cao Cao bade his secretaries bring along the four precious things of the study with which Lady Xun could write to her sonWhat sort of a man is Liu Bei asked sheCao Cao replied A common sort of person from Zhuo irresponsible enough to style himself Imperial Uncle and so claiming some sort of connection with the Hans He is neither trustworthy nor virtuousPeople say he is a superior man as far as externals go but a mean man by nature Lady Xun answered in a hard voice Why do you malign him so bitterlyEvery one knows he is a descendant of one of the Han princes and so related to the House He has condescended to take a lowly office and is respectful to all people He has a reputation for benevolence Every one young and old cowherds and firewood cutters all know him by name and know that he is the finest and noblest man in the worldIf my son is in his service then has he found a fitting masterYou under the name of a Han minister are really nothing but a Han rebelContrary to all truth you tell me Liu Bei is a rebel whereby you try to induce me to make my son leave the light for darknessAre you devoid of all sense of shame As Lady Xun finished speaking she picked up the inkstone to strike Cao CaoThis so enraged him that he forgot himself and the need for caution and bade the executioners lead off the old woman and put her to deathAdviser Cheng Yu however stopped this act saying This old lady wished to dieBut if you kill her your reputation will be damaged and hers enhancedBeside that will add a keen desire for revenge to the motives which led Xu Shu to labor in the interest of Liu BeiYou would better keep her here so that Xu Shus body and his thoughts may be in different placesHe can not devote all his energies to helping our enemy while his mother is here If you keep her I think I can persuade the son to come and help you So the outspoken old lady was saved She was given quarters and cared forDaily Cheng Yu went to ask after her health falsely claiming to being a sworn brother of her sons and so entitled to serve her and treat her as a filial son would have doneHe often sent her gifts and wrote letters to her so that she had to write in replyAnd thereby he learned her handwriting so that he could forge a home letter When he could do this without fear of detection he wrote one and sent it by the hand of a trusty person to Xinye One day a man arrived inquiring for one San Fu he claimed to have a letter from home for himThe soldiers led the man to San FuThe man said he was an official carrier of letters and had been told to bring this oneSan Fu quickly tore it open and readOn your brothers death recently I was left alone no relative was near and I was lonely and sadTo my regret the Prime Minister Cao Cao inveigled me into coming to the capital and now he says you are a rebel and he has throw me into bonds However thanks to Cheng Yu my life has been spared so far and if you would only come and submit too I should be quite safeWhen this reaches you remember how I have toiled for you and come at once that you may prove yourself a filial sonWe may together find some way of escape to our own place and avoid the dangers that threaten meMy life hangs by a thread and I look to you to save meYou will not require a second summon Tears gushed from Xu Shus eyes as he read and with the letter in his hand he went to seek his chief to whom he told the true story of his lifeI heard that Liu Biao treated people well and went to him I happened to arrive at a time of confusionI saw he was of no use so I left him very soonI arrived at the retreat of Sima Hui the WaterMirror late one night and told him and he blamed me for not knowing a master when I saw oneThen he told me of you and I sang that wild song in the streets to attract your attentionYou took me you used meBut now my aged mother is the victim of Cao Caos wiles She is in prison and he threatens to do worseShe has written to call me and I must goI hoped to be able to render you faithful service but with my dear mother a captive I should be uselessTherefore I must leave you and hope in the future to meet you again Liu Bei broke into loud moans when he heard that his adviser was to leaveThe bond between mother and son is divine said Liu Bei and I do not need to be reminded where your duty liesWhen you have seen your venerable mother perhaps I may have again the happiness of receiving your instruction Having said farewell Xu Shu prepared to leave at once However at Liu Beis wish he consented to stay over the nightThen Sun Qian said privately to his master Xu Shu is indeed a genius but he has been here long enough to know all our secretsIf you let him go over to Cao Cao he will be in his confidence and that will be to our detrimentYou ought to keep him at all costs and not let him goWhen Cao Cao sees Xu Shu does not come he will put the mother to death and that will make Xu Shu the more zealous in your service for he will burn to avenge his mothers death I cannot do thatIt would be very cruel and vile to procure the death of his mother that I might retain the sons servicesIf I kept him it would lead to a rupture of the parental lien and that would be a sin I would rather die than commit Both were grieved and sighedLiu Bei asked the parting guest to a banquet but he declined saying With my mother a prisoner I can swallow nothing nay though it were brewed from gold or distilled from jewels Alas Your departure is as if I lost both my hands said Liu BeiEven the liver of a dragon or the marrow of a phoenix would be bitter in my mouth They looked into each others eyes and weptThey sat silent till dawnWhen all was ready for the journey the two rode out of the city side by side At Daisy Pavilion they dismounted to drink the stirrup cupLiu Bei lifted the goblet and said It is my mean fortune that separates me from you but I hope that you may serve well your new lord and become famous Xu Shu wept as he replied I am but a poor ignorant person whom you have kindly employedUnhappily I have to break our intercourse in the middle but my venerable mother is the real causeThough Cao Cao use all manner of means to coerce me yet will I never plan for him After you are gone I shall only bury myself in the hills and hide in the forests said Liu BeiXu Shu said I had in my heart for you the position of leader of the chieftains but my plans have been altogether upset by my mother I have been of no advantage to you nor should I do any good by remainingBut you ought to seek some person of lofty wisdom to help you in your great enterpriseIt is unseemly to be downcast I shall find none to help better than you my master How can I permit such extravagant praise said Xu ShuI am only a useless blockhead As he moved off he said to the followers Officers I hope you will render the Princely One good service whereby to write his name large in the countrys annals and cause his fame to glow in the pages of history Do not be like me a person who has left his work half done They were all deeply affected Liu Bei could not bring himself to part from his friendHe escorted him a little further and yet a little further till Xu Shu said I will not trouble you O Princely One to come further Let us say our farewell here Liu Bei dismounted took Xu Shu by the hands and said Alas We partEach goes his way and who knows if we shall meet again His tears fell like rain and Xu Shu wept alsoBut the last goodbyes were said and when the traveler had gone Liu Bei stood gazing after the little party and watched it slowly disappear At the last glimpse he broke into lamentation He is goneWhat shall I do One of the trees shut out the traveler from his sight and Liu Bei pointed at it saying Wish that I could cut down every tree in the countryside Why said his officersBecause they hinder my sight of Xu Shu Suddenly they saw Xu Shu galloping backSaid Liu Bei He is returning can it he that he is going to stay So he hastened forward to meet Xu Shu and when they got near enough he cried This return is surely for no slight reason Checking his horse Xu Shu said In the turmoil of my feelings I forgot to say one wordThere is a person of wonderful skill living about seven miles from the city of Xiangyang why not seek him Can I trouble you to ask him to visit me He will not condescend to visit you you must go to himBut if he consents you will be as fortunate as the Zhou when they got the aid of Lu Wang or the Han when Zhang Liang came to help How does the unknown compare with yourself With meCompared with him I am as a wornout carthorse to a palomino an old crow to a phoenixThis man often compares himself with the ancient sages Guan Zhong and Yue Yi but in my opinion he is far their superiorHe has the talent to measure the heavens and mete the earth he is a man who overshadows every other in the world I would know his name He belongs to Langye and his name is Zhuge Liang He is of the family of the former General Zhuge FengHis father Zhuge Gui was the Governor Deputy of Taishan but died young and the young fellow went with his uncle Zhuge Xuan to JingzhouImperial Protector Liu Biao was an old friend of his uncle and Zhuge Liang became settled in XiangyangThen his uncle died and he and his younger brother Zhuge Jun returned to their farm in Nanyang and worked as farmersThey used to amuse themselves with the composition of songs in the Liangfu styleOn their land was a ridge of hills called the Sleeping Dragon and the elder of the brothers took it as a name and called himself Master SleepingDragonThis is your man he is a veritable geniusYou ought really to visit him and if he will help you you need feel no more anxiety about peace in the empire WaterMirror spoke that time of two persons SleepingDragon and BloomingPhoenix and said if only one of them could be got to help me all would be wellSurely he whom you speak of is one of them BloomingPhoenix is Pang Tong of Xiangyang and SleepingDragon is Zhuge Liang Liu Bei jumped with delight Now at last I know who the mysterious ones areHow I wish they were hereBut for you I should have still been like a blind man said heSome one has celebrated in verse this interview where Xu Shu from horseback recommended Zhuge Liang Liu Bei heard that his able friend Must leave him with saddened heart For each to the other had grown very dear Both wept when it came to partBut the parting guest then mentioned a name That echoed both loud and deep Like a thunder clap in a springtime sky And there wakened a dragon from sleepThus was Zhuge Liang recommended to Liu Bei and Xu Shu rode awayNow Liu Bei understood the speech of the hermit WaterMirror and he woke as one from a drunken sleepAt the head of his officers he retook the road to the city and having prepared rich gifts set out with his brothers for Nanyang Under the influence of his emotions at parting Xu Shu had mentioned the name and betrayed the retreat of his friend Now he thought of the possibility that Zhuge Liang would be unwilling to play the part of helper in Liu Beis scheme so Xu Shu determined to go to visit himHe therefore took his way to Sleeping Dragon Ridge and dismounted at the cottageAsked why he had come he replied I wished to serve Liu Bei of Yuzhou but my mother has been imprisoned by Cao Cao and has sent to call me Therefore I have had to leave himAt the moment of parting I commended you to himYou may expect him speedily and I hope Sir you will not refuse your aid but will consent to use your great talents to help him Zhuge Liang showed annoyance and said And so you have made me the victim of the world sacrifice So saying Zhuge Liang shook out his sleeves and left the roomThe guest shamefacedly retired mounted his horse and hastened on his way to the capital to see his motherTo help the lord he loved right well He summoned the aid of another When he took the distant homeward way At the call of a loving motherWhat was the sequel will appear in the following chapters CHAPTER Sima Hui Recommends A Scholar To Liu Bei Liu Bei Pays Three Visits To The Sleeping Dragon Ridge As has been said Xu Shu hastened to the capitalWhen Cao Cao knew Xu Shu had arrived he sent two of his confidants Xun Yu and Cheng Yu to receive the newcomer at the city gate and so Xu Shu was led first to the Prime Ministers palaceWhy did such an illustrious scholar as you bow the knee to Liu Bei said Cao Cao I am young and I fled to avoid the results of certain escapades I spent some time as a wanderer and so came to Xinye where I became good friends with him But my mother is here and when I thought of all her affection I could no longer remain absent Now you will be able to take care of your mother at all timesAnd I may have the privilege of receiving your instructions Xu Shu then took his leave and hastened to his mothers dwellingWeeping with emotion he made his obeisance to her at the door of her room But she was greatly surprised to see him and said What have you come here for I was at Xinye in the service of Liu Bei of Yuzhou when I received your letterI came immediately His mother suddenly grew very angry Striking the table she cried You shameful and degenerate sonFor years you have been a vagabond in spite of all my teachingYou are a student and know the books You must then know that loyalty and filial piety are often opposedDid you not recognize in Cao Cao a traitor a man who flouts his king and insults the mighty onesDid you not see that Liu Bei was virtuous and upright as all the world knows Moreover he is of the House of Han and when you were with him you were serving a fitting master Now on the strength of a scrap of forged writing with no attempt at any inquiry you have left the light and plunged into darkness and earned a disgraceful reputation Truly you are stupidHow can I bear to look upon youYou have besmirched the fair fame of your forefathers and are of no use in the world The son remained bowed to the earth not daring to lift his eyes while his mother delivered this vilifying tirade As she said the last word she rose suddenly and left the roomSoon after one of the servants came out to say Lady Xun had hanged herselfXu Shu rushed in to try to save her but was too late A eulogy of her conduct has been written thusWise Mother Xun fair is your fame The storied page glows with your name From dutys path you never strayed The familys renown you madeTo train your son no pains you spared For your own body nothing caredYou stand sublime from us apart Through simple purity of heartBrave Liu Beis virtues you extolled You blamed Cao Cao the basely boldOf blazing fire you felt no fear You blenched not when the sword came neat But dreaded lest a willful son Should dim the fame his fathers wonYes Mother Xun was of one mold With famous heroes of old Who never shrank from injury And even were content to dieFair meed of praise while still alive Was yours and ever will surviveMother Xun your memory While time rolls on shall never At sight of his mother dead Xu Shu fell in a swoon and only recovered consciousness after a long timeBy and bye Cao Cao heard of it and sent mourning gifts and in due course went in person to condole and sacrificeThe body was interred on the south of the capital and the dead womans unhappy son kept vigil at her tombHe steadily rejected all gifts from Cao CaoAt that time Cao Cao was contemplating an attack on the southHis adviser Xun Yu dissuaded him saying The winter is not favorable for this campaignMy lord should await milder weather And Cao Cao yieldedBut he began to prepare and led the River Zhangs waters aside to form a lake which he called the Aquamarine Lake where he could accustom his soldiers to fight on the water As has been said Liu Bei prepared gifts to offer to Zhuge Liang on his visitOne day his servants announced a stranger of extraordinary appearance wearing a lofty headdress and a wide beltSurely this is he said Liu Bei and hastily arranging his dress he went to welcome the visitorBut the first glance showed him that it was the recluse of the mountains Sima Hui However Liu Bei was glad to see him and led him into the inner apartment as he would an old friendThere Liu Bei conducted him to the seat of honor and made his obeisance saying Since leaving you that day in the mountains I have been overwhelmed with military preparations and so have failed to visit you as courtesy demandedNow that the brightness has descended upon me I hope this dereliction of duty may be pardoned I hear Xu Shu is hereI have come expressly to see him replied WaterMirror bluntly He has lately left for XuchangA messenger came with a letter telling of the imprisonment of his mother Then he has just fallen into Cao Caos trap for that letter was a forgeryI have known his mother to be a very noble woman and even if she were imprisoned by Cao Cao she would not summon her son like thatCertainly the letter was a forgeryIf the son did not go the mother would be safe if he went she would be a dead woman But how asked Liu Bei dismayedShe is a woman of the highest principles who would be greatly mortified at the sight of her son under such conditions Liu Bei said Just as your friend was leaving he mentioned the name of a certain Zhuge LiangWhat think you of him WaterMirror laughed saying If Xu Shu wanted to go he was free to go But why did he want to provoke Zhuge Liang into coming out and showing compassion for some one else Why do you speak like that asked Liu BeiHe replied Five persons Zhuge Liang of Nanyang Cui Zhouping of Boling Shi Guangyuan of Yingchuan Meng Gongwei of Runan and Xu Shu of Yingchuan were the closest of friends They formed a little coterie devoted to meditation on essential refinementOnly Zhuge Liang arrived at a perception of its meaningHe used to sit among them with his arms about his knees muttering and then pointing to his companions he would say You gentlemen would become governors and protectors if you were in official life When they asked him what was his ambition he would only smile and always compared himself with the great ancient scholars Guan Zhong and Yue YiNo one could gauge his talents How comes it that Yingchuan produces so many able humans said Liu BeiThat old astrologer Yin Kui used to say that the stars clustered thick over the region and so there were many wise humans Now Guan Yu was there and when he heard Zhuge Liang so highly praised he said Guan Zhong and Yue Yi are the two most famous leaders mentioned in the Spring and Autumn and the Warring States Periods They well overtopped the rest of humankindIs it not a little too much to say that Zhuge Liang compares with these two In my opinion he should not be compared with these two but rather with two others said WaterMirrorWho are these two asked Guan YuOne of them is Lu Wang who laid the foundations of the Zhou Dynasty so firmly that it lasted eight hundred years and the other Zhang Liang who made the Han glorious for four centuries Before the surprise called forth by this startling statement had subsided WaterMirror walked down the steps and took his leaveLiu Bei would have kept him if he could but he was obdurateAs he stalked proudly away he threw up his head and said Though SleepingDragon has found his lord he has not been born at the right timeIt is a pity What a wise hermit was Liu Beis comment Soon after the three brothers set out to find the abode of the wise manWhen they drew near the Sleeping Dragon Ridge they saw a number of peasants in a field hoeing up the weeds and as they worked they sang The earth is a checkered board And the sky hangs over all Under it humans are contending Some rise but a many fallFor those who succeed this is well But for those who go under roughTheres a dozing dragon hard by But his sleep is not deep enough Liu Bei and his brothers stopped to listen to the song and calling up one of the peasants asked who made itIt was made by Master SleepingDragon said the laborer Then he lives hereaboutWhere South of this hill there is a ridge called the Sleeping Dragon and close by is a sparse wood In it stands a modest cottageThat is where Master Zhuge Liang takes his repose Liu Bei thanked him and the party rode onSoon they came to the ridge most aptly named for indeed it lay wrapped in an atmosphere of calm beauty A poet wrote of it thusNot far from Xiangyang There stands clear cut against the sky A lofty ridge and at its foot A gentle stream goes gliding by The contour curving up and down Although by resting cloud its marred Arrests the eye and here and there The flank by waterfalls is scarredThere like a sleeping dragon coiled Or phoenix hid among thick pines You see secure from prying eyes A cot reedbuilt on rustic lines The roughjoined doors pushed by the wind Swing idly open and disclose The greatest genius of the world Enjoying still his calm reposeThe air is full of woodland scents Around are hedgerows trim and green Closegrowing intercrossed bamboos Replace the painted doorway screenBut look within and books you see By every couch near every chair And you may guess that common humans Are very seldom welcomed there The hut seems far from human ken So far one might expect to find Wild forest denizens there trained To serve in place of humankindWithout a hoary crane might stand As warden of the outer gate Within a longarmed gibbon come To offer fruit upon a plateBut enter there refinement reigns Brocaded silk the lutes protect And burnished weapons on the walls The green of pines outside reflect For he who dwells within that hut Is talented beyond compare Although he lives the simple life And harvest seems his only careHe waits until the thunderous call Shall bid him wake nor sleep again Then will he forth and at his word Peace over all the land shall reign Liu Bei soon arrived at the door of the retreat dismounted and knocked at the rough door of the cottage A youth appeared and asked what he wantedLiu Bei replied I am Liu Bei General of the Han Dynasty Lord of Yicheng Imperial Protector of Yuzhou and Uncle of the EmperorI am come to salute the Master I cannot remember so many titles said the lad Then simply say that Liu Bei has come to inquire after him The Master left this morning early Whither has he gone His movements are very uncertainI do not know whither he has gone When will he return That also is uncertainPerhaps in three days perhaps in ten The disappointment was keenLet us go back since we cannot see him said Zhang FeiWait a little time said Liu BeiIt would be better to return said Guan Yu then we might send to find out when this man had come back So Liu Bei agreed first saying to the boy When the Master returns tell him that Liu Bei has been here They rode away for some miles Presently Liu Bei stopped and looked back at the surroundings of the little cottage in the woodThe mountains were picturesque rather than grand the water clear rather than profound the plain was level rather than extensive the woods luxuriant rather than thick Gibbons ranged through the trees and cranes waded in the shallow waterThe pines and the bamboos vied with each other in verdure It was a scene to linger uponWhile Liu Bei stood regarding it he saw a figure coming down a mountain path The mans bearing was lofty he was handsome and dignified He wore a comfortablelooking bonnet on his head and a black robe hung about his figure in easy folds He used a staff to help him down the steep path Surely that is he said Liu BeiHe dismounted and walked over to greet the stranger whom he saluted deferentially saying Are you not Master SleepingDragon Sir Who are you General said the strangerI am Liu Bei I am not Zhuge Liang but I am a friend of his My name is Cui Zhouping Long have I known of youI am very glad to see you replied Liu BeiAnd now I pray you be seated just where we are and let me receive your instruction The two men sat down in the wood on a stone and the two brothers ranged themselves by Liu Beis sideCui Zhouping began saying General for what reason do you wish to see Zhuge Liang Liu Bei replied The empire is in confusion and troubles gather everywhereI want your friend to tell me how to restore order You Sir wish to arrest the present disorder although you are a kindly man and from the oldest antiquity the correction of disorder has demanded stern measuresOn the day that Liu Bang first put his hand to the work and slew the wicked ruler of Qin order began to replace disorderGood government began with the Supreme Ancestor  and endured two hundred years two centuries of tranquillity Then came Wang Mangs rebellion and disorder took the place of orderAnon arose Liu Xiu who restored the Han Dynasty and order once more prevailedWe have had two centuries of order and tranquillity and the time of trouble and battles is due The restoration of peace will take time it cannot be quickly accomplishedYou Sir wish to get Zhuge Liang to regulate times and seasons to repair the cosmos but I fear the task is indeed difficult and to attempt it would be a vain expenditure of mental energyYou know well that he who goes with the favor of Heaven travels an easy road he who goes contrary meets difficultiesOne cannot escape ones lot one cannot evade fate Master replied Liu Bei your insight is indeed deep and your words of wide meaning but I am a scion of the House of Han and must help itDare I talk of the inevitable and trust to fate Cui Zhouping replied A simple denizen of the mountain wilds is unfitted to discuss the affairs of empire But you bade me speak and I have spoken perhaps somewhat madly Master I am grateful for your instructionBut know you whither Zhuge Liang has gone I also came to see him and I know not where he is said Cui ZhoupingIf I asked you Master to accompany me to my poor bit of territory would you come I am too dilatory too fond of leisure and ease and no longer have any ambitionsBut I will see you another time And with these words Cui Zhouping saluted and left The three brothers also mounted and started homewardPresently Zhang Fei said We have not found Zhuge Liang and we have had to listen to the wild ravings of this socalled scholarThere is the whole result of this journey His words were those of a deep thinker replied Liu BeiSome days after the return to Xinye Liu Bei sent to find out whether Zhuge Liang had returned and the messenger came back saying that he had Wherefore Liu Bei prepared for another visitAgain Zhang Fei showed his irritation by remarking Why must you go hunting after this villagerSend and tell him to come Silence said Liu Bei The Teacher Mencius said To try to see the sage without going his way is like barring a door you wish to enter Zhuge Liang is the greatest sage of the day how can I summon him So Liu Bei rode away to make his visit his two brothers with him as beforeIt was winter and exceedingly cold floating clouds covered the whole sky Before they had gone far a bitter wind began to blow in their faces and the snow began to flySoon the mountains were of jade and the trees of silverIt is very cold and the earth is frozen hard no fighting is possible now Said Zhang Fei Yet we are going all this way to get advice which will be useless to us Where is the sense of itLet us rather get back to Xinye out of the cold Liu Bei replied I am set upon proving my zeal to Zhuge Liang but if you my brother do not like the cold you can return I do not fear death do you think I care for the coldBut I do care about wasting my brothers energies said Zhang FeiSay no more said Liu Bei and they traveled onWhen they drew near the little wood they heard singing in a roadside inn and stopped to listen This was the songAlthough possessed of talent rare This man has made no name Alas The day is breaking late That is to show his fame O friends you know the Lu Wangs taleThe aged man constrained to leave His cottage by the sea To follow in a princes train His counselor to beEight hundred feudal chieftains met Who came with one accord The happy omen that white fish That leapt the boat aboard The gory field in distant wildsWhence flowed a crimson tide And him acknowledged chief in war Whose virtues none denied That Zhang Liang a Gaoyang rustic Fond of wine who left his native place And went to serve so faithfully The man of handsome face And one who spoke of ruling chiefs In tones so bold and free But sitting at the festive board Was full of courtesy And one that was he who laid in dust Walled cities near four score But humans of doughty deeds like these On earth are seen no moreNow had these humans not found their lord Would they be known to fame Yet having found they served him well And so achieved a nameThe song ended the singers companion tapping the table sang We had a famous founder Who drew his shining sword Cleansed all the land within the seas And made himself its lordIn time his son succeeded him And so from son to son The lordship passed held firm until Four hundred years had runThen dawned a day of weaklier sons The fiery virtue failed Then ministers betrayed their trust Court intrigues vile prevailedThe omens came a serpent Coiled on the dragon throne While in the hall of audience Unholy haloes shoneNow bandits swarm in all the land And noble strives with chief The common people sore perplexed Can nowhere find reliefLets drown our sorrows in the cup Be happy while we may Let those who wish run after fame That is to last for ayeThe two men laughed loud and clapped their hands as the second singer ceased Liu Bei thought full surely the longed for sage was there so he dismounted and entered the innHe saw the two merrymakers sitting opposite each other at a table One was pale with a long beard the other had a strikingly refined faceLiu Bei saluted them and said Which of you is Master SleepingDragon Who are you Sir asked the longbearded oneWhat business have you with SleepingDragon I am Liu BeiI want to inquire of him how to restore tranquillity to the world Well neither of us is your man but we are friends of hisMy name is Shi Guangyuan and my friend here is Meng Gongwei I know you both by reputation said Liu Bei gladly I am indeed fortunate to meet you in this haphazard way Will you not come to SleepingDragons retreat and talk for a timeI have horses here for you We idle folks of the wilds know nothing of tranquilizing states Please do not trouble to askPray mount again and continue searching SleepingDragon So he remounted and went his way He reached the little cottage dismounted and tapped at the door The same lad answered his knock and he asked whether the Master had returnedHe is in his room reading said the boyJoyful indeed was Liu Bei as he followed the lad inIn front of the middle door he saw written this pair of scrolls By purity inspire the inclination By repose affect the distantAs Liu Bei was looking at this couplet he heard some one singing in a subdued voice and stopped by the door to peep in He saw a young man close to a charcoal brazier hugging his knees while he sang The phoenix dies high O And only will perch on a magnolia treeThe scholar is hidden O Till his lord appear he can patient be He tills his fields OHe is wellcontent and I love my home He awaits his day OHis books and his lute to leave and roamAs the song ended Liu Bei advanced and saluted saying Master long have I yearned for you but have found it impossible to salute youLately WaterMirror spoke of you and I hastened to your dwelling only to come away disappointedThis time I have braved the elements and come again and my reward is here I see your face and I am indeed fortunate The young man hastily returned the salute and said General you must be that Liu Bei of Yuzhou who wishes to see my brother Then Master you are not SleepingDragon said Liu Bei starting backI am his younger brother Zhuge JunHe has another elder brother Zhuge Jin now with Sun Quan in the South Land as a counselorZhuge Liang is the second of our family Is your brother at home Only yesterday he arranged to go a jaunt with Cui Zhouping Whither have they gone Who can sayThey may take a boat and sail away among the lakes or go to gossip with the priests in some remote mountain temple or wander off to visit a friend in some far away village or be sitting in some cave with a lute or a chessboard Their goings and comings are uncertain and nobody can guess at them What very poor luck have ITwice have I failed to meet the great sage Pray sit a few moments and let me offer you some tea Brother since the master is not here I pray you remount and go said Zhang FeiSince I am here why not a little talk before we go home again said Liu BeiThen turning to his host he continued Can you tell me if your worthy brother is skilled in strategy and studies works on war I do not know This is worse than the other grumbled Zhang FeiAnd the wind and snow are getting worse we ought to go back Liu Bei turned on him angrily and told him to stopZhuge Jun said Since my brother is absent I will not presume to detain you longer I will return your call soon Please do not take that troubleIn a few days I will come againBut if I could borrow paper and ink I would leave a note to show your worthy brother that I am zealous and earnest Zhuge Jun produced the four treasures of the scholar and Liu Bei thawing out the frozen brush between his lips spread the sheet of delicate notepaper and wrote Liu Bei has long admired your fame He has visited your dwelling twice but to his great regret he has gone empty awayHe humbly remembers that he is a distant relative of the Emperor that he has undeservedly enjoyed fame and rank When he sees the proper government wrested aside and replaced by pretense the foundation of the state crumbling away hordes of braves creating confusion in the country and an evil cabal behaving unseemly toward the rightful Prince then his heart and gall are torn to shredsThough he has a real desire to assist yet is he deficient in the needful skill Wherefore he turns to the Master trusting in his kindness graciousness loyalty and righteousnessWould the Master but use his talent equal to that of Lu Wang and perform great deeds like Zhang Liang then would the empire be happy and the throne would be secureThis is written to tell you that after purification of mind with fasting and of body with fragrant baths Liu Bei will come again to prostrate himself in your honored presence and receive enlightenment The letter written and given to Zhuge Jun Liu Bei took his leave exceedingly disappointed at this second failureAs he was mounting he saw the serving lad waving his hand outside the hedge and heard him call out The old Master is coming Liu Bei looked and then saw a figure seated on a donkey leisurely jogging along over a bridge The rider of the donkey wore a cap with long flaps down to his shoulders and his body was wrapped in a fox fur robe A youth followed him bearing a jar of wine As he came through the snow he hummed a songThis is eve the sky is overcast The north wind comes with icy blast Light snowflakes whirl down until A white pall covers dale and hillPerhaps above the topmost sky White dragons strive for mastery The armor scales from their forms riven Are scattered over the world winddrivenAmid the storm there jogs along A simple wight who croons a songO poor plum trees the gale doth tear Your blossoms off and leave you bare Here at last is SleepingDragon thought Liu Bei hastily slipping out of the saddleHe saluted the donkey rider as he neared and said Master it is hard to make way against this cold windI and my companions have been waiting long The rider got off his donkey and returned the bow while Zhuge Jun from behind said This is not my brother it is his fatherinlaw Huang Chenyan Liu Bei said I chanced to hear the song you were singing it is very beautiful Huang Chenyan replied It is a little poem I read in my son inlaws house and I recalled it as I crossed the bridge and saw the plum trees in the hedgeAnd so it happened to catch your ear Noble Sir Have you seen your soninlaw lately asked Liu Bei That is just what I have come to do now At this Liu Bei bade him farewell and went on his wayThe storm was very grievous to bear but worse than the storm was the grief in his heart as he looked back at Sleeping Dragon RidgeOne winters day through snow and wind A prince rode forth the sage to find Alas His journey was in vain And sadly turned he home againThe stream stood still beneath the bridge A sheet of ice draped rock and ridge His steed benumbed with biting cold But crawled as he were stiff and oldThe snowflakes on the riders head Were like pearblossoms newly shed Or like the willowcatkins light They brushed his cheek in headlong flightHe stayed his steed he looked around The snow lay thick on tree and mound The Sleeping Dragon Ridge lay white A hill of silver glistening brightAfter the return to Xinye the time slipped away till spring was near Then Liu Bei cast lots to find the propitious day for another journey in search of Zhuge Liang The day being selected he fasted for three days and then changed his dress ready for the visitHis two brothers viewed the preparations with disapproval and presently made up their minds to remonstrateThe sage and the fighting generals never agree A warrior despises humilityThe next chapter will tell what they said CHAPTER Zhuge Liang Plans For The Three Kingdoms Sun Quan Attacks Xiakou To Take Revenges Nothing discouraged by two unsuccessful visits to the retreat of the sage whose advice he sought to secure Liu Bei made preparations for a third visitHis brothers disapproved and Guan Yu said Brother you have sought him twice surely this is showing even too much deferenceI do not believe in this fame of his for learning he is avoiding you and dare not submit to the testWhy so obstinately hold this idea You are wrong my brotherIn the Spring and Autumn Period Prince Huan of Qi paid five visits to the Hermit of the Eastern Suburb before he got to see his faceAnd my desire to see Zhuge Liang is even greater than his I think you are mistaken said Zhang FeiHow can this villager be such a marvel of wisdomYou should not go again and if he will not come I will bring him with a hempen rope Have you forgotten the great King Wens visit to Lu Wang the old man of the Eastern SeaIf he could show such deference to a wise man where am I too deferentialIf you will not go your brother and I will go without you said Liu BeiIf you two go how can I hang back said Zhang FeiIf you go then you must be polite Zhang Fei said he would not forget himself and the three set outWhen they were a quarter of mile from the little cottage Liu Bei dismounted deciding to show his respect by approaching the house on footVery soon he met Zhuge Jun whom he saluted with great deference inquiring whether his brother was at homeHe returned last evening you can see him today General As Zhuge Jun said this he went off with some swagger Fortune favors me this time said Liu Bei I am going to see the Master That was a rude fellow said Zhang Fei it would not have hurt him to have conducted us to the houseWhy did he go off like that Each one has his own affairs said Liu BeiWhat power have we over him Soon the three stood at the door and they knockedThe serving lad came out and asked their business and Liu Bei said very deferentially I would trouble the servant of the genius gentle page to inform the Master that Liu Bei wishes to pay his respects to him My master is at home but he is asleep In that case do not announce me Liu Bei bade his two brothers wait at the door quietly and he himself entered with careful steps There was the man he sought lying asleep on the couch stretched on a simple mat Liu Bei saluted him with joined hands at a respectful distanceThe time passed and still the sleeper did not wakeThe two brothers left without beginning to feel impatient also came in and Zhang Fei was annoyed at seeing his revered elder brother respectfully standing by while another sleptWhat an arrogant fellow is this Master said heThere is our brother waiting while he sleeps on perfectly carelesslyI will go to the back of the place and let off a bomb and see if that will rouse him No no you must do nothing of the kind whispered Guan Yu and then Liu Bei told them to go out againJust then Liu Bei noticed that the Master moved He turned over as though about to rise but instead he faced the wall and again fell asleep The serving lad made as if he would rouse his master but Liu Bei forbade him to be disturbed and Liu Bei waited yet another weary hourThen Zhuge Liang woke up repeating to himself the lines Can any know what fate is hisYet have I felt throughout my life The day would come at last to quit The calm retreat for toil and strife As he finished he turned to the lad saying Have any of the usual people come Liu Bei the Uncle of the Emperor is here said the boyHe has been waiting a long time Why did you not tell me said he rising from the couchI must dress Zhuge Liang rose and turned into a room behind to dressIn a short time he reappeared his clothing properly arranged to receive his visitor Then Liu Bei saw coming toward him a young man rather below medium height with a refined faceHe wore a headwrap and a long cranewhite gown He moved with much dignity as though he was rather more than mortalLiu Bei bowed saying I am one of the offshoots of the Han family a simple person from Zhuo I have long known the Masters fame which has indeed thundered in my earTwice I have come to visit you without success Once I left my name on your writing table you may have my note Zhuge Liang replied This hermit is but a dilatory person by temperamentI know I have to thank you for more than one vain visit and I am ashamed to think of them These courteous remarks and the proper bows exchanged the two men sat in their relative positions as host and guest and the serving lad brought teaThen Zhuge Liang said From your letter I know that you grieve for both people and governmentIf I were not so young and if I possessed any talent I would venture to question you Liu Bei replied Sima Hui and Xu Shu have both spoken of you can it be that their words were vainI trust O Master that you will not despise my worthlessness but will condescend to instruct me The two men you speak of are very profound scholarsI am but a peasant a mere farmer and who am I that I should talk of empire politicsThose two misled you when they spoke of meWhy do you reject the beautiful jewel for a worthless pebble But your abilities are world embracing and marvelousHow can you be content to allow time to pass while you idle away life in these secluded hauntsI conjure you O Master to remember the inhabitants of the world and remove my crass ignorance by bestowing instruction upon me But what is your ambition General Liu Bei moved his seat nearer to his host and said The Hans are sinking designing ministers steal away their authority I am weak yet I desire to restore the state to its right mind But my ignorance is too vast my means are too slender and I know not where to turnOnly you Master can lighten my darkness and preserve me from fallingHow happy should I be if you would do so Zhuge Liang replied One bold human after another has arisen in various parts of the empire ever since the days of the rebel Dong ZhuoCao Cao was not so powerful as Yuan Shao but he overcame Yuan Shao by seizing the favorable moment and using his soldiers properlyNow he is allpowerful he rules an immense army and through his control of the court the various feudal lords as well You cannot think of opposing himThen the Suns have held their territory in the South Land for three generations Their position in that old state of Wu may not appear too secure but they have popularity to appeal to You can gain support but win no success thereThe Region of Jingzhou in the north rests on the two Rivers Han and Mian their interests lie in all to the south of them on the east they touch Wu and on the west they extend to the ancient states of Ba and ShuThis is the area in which decisive battles have to be won and one must hold it in order to be secure and Heaven has virtually made it yoursThe Region of Yiazhou in the west is an important place fertile and extensive a country favored of Heaven and that through which the Founder of Han obtained the empireIts ruler Liu Zhang is ignorant and weak The people are noble and the country prosperous but he does not know how to hold it all and all the able people of the region are yearning for an enlightened princeAs you are a scion of the Family well known throughout the land as trusty and righteous a whole hearted hero who greatly desires to win the support of the wise if you get possession of Yiazhou and Jingzhou if on the west you are in harmony with the Rong Tribes on the south win over the ancient states of Yi and Viet make an alliance with Sun Quan of Wu and maintain good government you can await confidently the day when Heaven shall offer you the desired opportunity Then you may depute a worthy leader to go to the northeast while you take command of an expedition to the northwest and will you not find the warmest welcome prepared for you by the people This done the completion of the task will be easy The Hans will be restoredAnd these are my counsels in all these operations if you will only undertake them Zhuge Liang paused while he bade the lad bring out a mapAs this was unrolled Zhuge Liang went on There you see the fiftyfour counties of the westShould you wish to take the overlordship you will yield to Cao Cao in the north till the time of Heaven be come to Sun Quan in the south till the Earth may become favorable You General will be the lord of Human and complete the trinityJingzhou is to be taken first as a home the Western Land of Rivers next for the foundation of dominationWhen you are firmly established you can lay your plans for the attainment of the whole empire As Zhuge Liang ceased his harangue Liu Bei left his place and saluted him saying Your words O Master render everything so clear that the clouds are swept aside and I see the clear skyBut Jingzhou belongs to Liu Biao my kinsman and Yiazhou to another kinsman Liu Zhang I could hardly take the lands from them I have studied the stars and I know Liu Biao is not long for this world the other is not the sort of man to endure Both places will certainly fall to you Liu Bei bowed his acknowledgmentsAnd so in one conversation Zhuge Liang proved that he who had lived in complete retirement all his life knew and foresaw the tripod division into which the empire was to break True indeed is it that throughout all the ages no one has ever equaled his intelligence and mastery of the situationBehold when Liu Bei frets that he is weak Then SleepingDragon is not far to seek When he desires to know how things will hap The Master smiling shows him on the mapThough I be of small repute and scanty virtue said Liu Bei I hope O Master you will not despise me for my worthlessness but will leave this retreat to help meI will assuredly listen most reverently to your words Zhuge Liang replied I have long been happy on my farm and am fond of my leisure I fear I cannot obey your command Liu Bei weptIf you will not O Master what will become of the people The tears rolled down unchecked upon the lapel and sleeves of Liu Beis robeThis proved to Zhuge Liang the sincerity of his desire and Zhuge Liang said General if you will accept me I will render what trifling service I can Then Liu Bei was greatly delightedHe called in Guan Yu and Zhang Fei to make their bow and brought out the gifts he had preparedZhuge Liang refused all the giftsThese are not gifts to engage your services but mere proof of my regard said Liu BeiThen the presents were acceptedThey all remained that night at the farmNext day Zhuge Jun returned and his brother said to him Uncle Liu Bei has come thrice to see me and now I must go with himKeep up the farm in my absence and do not let the place go to ruin for as soon as my work is accomplished I will certainly return Then turning from his humble home He thought of peaceful days to come When he should take the homeward way And never beyond the valley stray But duty kept him in the west And there he found his place of restAn old poem may be quoted here The Founder of Han seized his gleaming blade And at Mangdang Hills the blood of the white snake flowedHe conquered Qin destroyed Chu and entered XianyangAfter two centuries of rule the line was near broken But Liu Xiu restored the glory at Capital LuoyangAnd his children occupied the throne Till decay began in the days of Huan and Ling The Emperor Xian removed the capital to Xuchang And within the four seas all was confusion Bold spirits started up in fierce contention Cao Cao seized the favorable moment And the imperial authority passed into his handsWhile the Suns made to themselves A glorious heritage at the Great River Solitary and poor Liu Bei wandered from place to place Till he found a haven in XinyeSorely distressed he was at the sorrows of the people But SleepingDragon conceived a noble ambition Within his breast were thoughts Of great things to be accomplished by force of armsThen because of the parting words of Xu Shu And by the thrice repeated visits to his retreat The great hero found and knew his mentorWhen the age of Zhuge Liang was but thrice nine years He turned from his books put aside his lute And left the peaceful fields he had loved Under his guidance Jingzhou was taken And the two Lands of the Rivers conqueredHe unrolled great schemes as one all knowing In speech he went to and fro in the world The sound of war drums rolled from his tongue The words from his heart stirred one to the utmost depthsThe dragon pranced the tiger glared And peace was brought to the world Through all the ages his fame shall never decayAfter taking leave of Zhuge Jun Liu Bei and his followers left for Xinye with Zhuge Liang as companionWhen they took up their abode there Zhuge Liang was treated as a mentor eating at the same table sleeping on the same couch as Liu Bei They spent whole days conversing over the affairs of the empire Zhuge Liang said Cao Cao is training his troops for naval service in Aquamarine Lake and hence certainly intends to invade the country south of the Great RiverWe ought to send our spies to ascertain what Cao Cao and Sun Quan are really doing So spies were dispatched Now after Sun Quan succeeded to the heritage of his father and brother he sent far and wide to invite people of ability to aid himHe established lodging places for them in Kuaiji in Wu and directed Gu Yong and Zhang Hong to welcome and entertain all those who cameAnd year by year they flocked in one recommending anotherAmong them were Kan Ze of Kuaiji Yan Jun of Pengcheng Xue Yong of Beishan Cheng Bing of Runan Zhu Huan of Wujun Lu Ji of the same place Zhang Wen of Wucheng Luo Tong of Kuaiji and Wu Can of Wushang and all these scholars were treated with great deference Many able leaders came alsoAmong them were Lu Meng of Runan Lu Xun of Wujun Xu Sheng of Langye Pan Zhang of Dongjun and Ding Feng of LujiangThus Sun Quan obtained the assistance of many poeple of ability both in peace and war and all went well with himIn the seventh year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  Cao Cao had broken the power of Yuan Shao Then he sent a messenger to the South Land ordering Sun Quan to send his son to court to serve in the retinue of the EmperorSun Quan however hesitated to comply with this request and the matter was the subject of much discussionHis mother Lady Wu sent for Zhou Yu and Zhang Zhao and asked their adviceZhang Zhao said Cao Cao wishes a son to be present at court as a hostage whereby he has a hold upon us as formerly was the case with all the feudal chiefsIf we do not comply with this request he will doubtless attack the territoryThere is some peril Zhou Yu said Our lord has succeeded to the heritage and has a large army of veterans and ample supplies He has able officers ready to do his bidding and why should he be compelled to send a hostage to any perosnTo send a hostage is to be forced into joining Cao Cao and to carry out his behests whatever they beThen we shall be in his powerIt would be better not to send but rather to wait patiently the course of events and prepare plans to attack That is also my opinion said the DowagerSo Sun Quan dismissed the messenger but did not send his sonCao Cao resented this and had since nourished schemes against the South LandBut their realization had been delayed by the dangers on the north and so far no attack had been madeLate in the eighth year  Sun Quan led his armies against Huang Zu and fought on the Great River where he was successful in several battlesOne of Sun Quans leaders Ling Cao led a fleet of light vessels up the river and broke into Xiakou but was killed by an arrow of Gan Ning a general of Huang ZuLing Cao left a son Ling Tong fifteen years of age who led another expedition to recover his fathers corpse and was so far successful After that as the war was inclined to go against him Sun Quan returned again to his own countryNow Sun Quans younger brother Sun Yi was Governor of Dangyang He was a hard man and given to drink and in his cups very harsh to his people ordering the infliction of severe floggingsTwo of his officers Military Inspector Gui Lan and Secretary Dai Yuan bore their chief a grudge and sought to assassinate himThey took into their confidence one Bian Hong of the escort and the three plotted to kill their master at a great assembly of officials at Dangyang amid the banquetsSun Yis wife Lady Xu was skilled in divination and on the day of the great banquet she cast a most inauspicious lotWherefore she besought her husband to stay away from the assembly But he was obstinate and wentThe faithless guardsman followed his master in the dusk when the gathering dispersed and stabbed him with a daggerThe two prime movers at once seized Bian Hong and beheaded him in the market place Then they went to Sun Yis residence which they plunderedGui Lan was taken with the beauty of the dead Governors wife and told her I had avenged the death of your husband and you must go with me Lady Xu pleaded saying It is too soon after my husbands death to think of remarriage but as soon as the thirtyday mourning sacrifices are over I will be yours She thus obtained a respite which she utilized to send for two old generals of her husband Sun Gao and Fu Ying They came and she tearfully told her tale My husband had great faith in youNow Gui Lan and Dai Yuan have compassed his death and have laid the crime on Bian Hong They have plundered my house and carried off my servants Worse than this Gui Lan insists that I shall be his wifeTo gain time I have pretended to favor this proposal and I pray you now send the news to my husbands brother and beg him to slay these two miscreants and avenge this wrong I will never forget your kindness in this life or the next And she bowed before themThey wept also and said We were much attached to our master and now that he has come to an untimely end we must avenge himDare we not carry out your behests So they sent a trusty messenger to Sun QuanOn the day of the sacrifices Lady Xu called in her two friends and hid them in a secret chamber Then the ceremonies were performed in the great hallThese over she put off her mourning garb bathed and perfumed herself and assumed an expression of joyShe laughed and talked as usual so that Gui Lan rejoiced in his heart thinking of the pleasure that was to be hisWhen night came she sent a servant girl to call her suitor to the Palace where she entertained him at supperWhen he had well drunk she suggested that they should retire and led him to the chamber where her friends were waiting He followed without the least hesitationAs soon as she entered the room she called out Where are you Generals Out rushed Sun Gao and Fu Ying and the drunken Gui Lan incapable of any resistance was dispatched with daggersNext Lady Xu invited Dai Yuan to a supper and he was slain in similar fashionAfter that she sent to the houses of her enemies and slew all thereinThis done she resumed her mourning garb and the heads of the two men were hung as a sacrifice before the coffin of her husbandVery soon her brotherinlaw came with an army and hearing the story of the deeds of the two generals from the widow gave them the commandership and put them over Dangyang When Sun Quan left he took the widow to his own home to pass the remainder of her daysAll those who heard of her brave conduct were loud in praise of her virtueFull of resource and virtuous few in the world are like her Guilefully wrought she and compassed the death of the lusty assassins Faithful servants are always ready to deal with rebellion None can ever excel that heroine famous in WuThe brigandage that had troubled the South Land had all been suppressed and a large fleet of seven thousand battleships was in the Great River ready for serviceSun Quan appointed Zhou Yu to be the Supreme Admiral and CommanderinChief over all military forcesIn the twelfth year  the Dowager Wu feeling her end approaching called to her the two advisers Zhou Yu and Zhang Zhao and spoke thus I came of a family of the old Wu but losing my parents in early life my brother Wu Jing and I went into the old Yue and then I married into this familyI bore my husband four sons not without premonitions of the greatness to be theirsWith my first Sun Ce I dreamed of the moon and with my second Sun Quan of the sun which omens were interpreted by the soothsayer as signs of their great honorUnhappy Sun Ce died young but Sun Quan inherited and it is he whom I pray you both assist with one accordThen may I die in peace And to her son she said These two you are to serve as they were your teachers and treat them with all respectMy younger sister and I both were wives to your father and so she is also a mother to you and you are to serve her after I am gone as you now serve meAnd you must treat your sister with affection and find a handsome husband for her Then she died and her son mourned for her that yearThe following year they began to discuss an attack upon Huang ZuZhang Zhao said The armies should not move during the period of mourning However Zhou Yu more to the point said Vengeance should not be postponed on that account it could not wait upon times and seasons Still Sun Quan halted between two opinions and would not decideThen came Commander Lu Meng who said to his master While I was at Dragon Gorge one leader of Huang Zu Gan Ning from Lingjiang offered to surrender I found out all about himHe is something of a scholar is forceful fond of wandering about as a knighterrantHe assembled a band of outlaws with whom he roamed over the rivers and lakes where he would terrorize everybodyHe wore a bell at his waist and at the sound of this bell every one fled and hidHe fitted his boats with sails of Xichuan brocade and people called him the Pirate with Sails of Silk Then he reformedHe and his band went to Liu Biao but they left him when they saw he would never accomplish anything and now they would serve under your banner only that Huang Zu detains them at XiakouFormerly when you were attacking Huang Zu he owed the recovery of Xiakou to this same Gan Ning whom he treated without liberalityWhen Commander Su Fei recommended Gan Ning for promotion Huang Zu said he is unsuited for any high position as after all he is no more than a pirate So Gan Ning became a disappointed and resentful manSu Fei tried to win him over to good humor and invited him to wine parties and said I have put your name forward many times but our chief says he has no place suitable for youHowever time slips away and mans life is not very long One must make the most of itI will put you forward for the magistracy of Exian whence you may be able to advance So Gan Ning got away from Xiakou and would have come to you then but he feared that he would not be welcomed since he had assisted Huang Zu and killed Ling CaoI told him you were always ready to welcome able people and would nourish no resentment for former deedsAfter all every person was bound to do his best for his masterHe would come with alacrity if he only felt sure of a welcomeI pray you express your pleasure This was good news for Sun Quan and he said With his help I could destroy Huang Zu Then Sun Quan bade Lu Meng bring Gan Ning to see himWhen the salutations were over the chief said My heart is entirely captivated by your coming I feel no resentment against youI hope you will have no doubts on that score and I may as well tell you that I desire some plan for the destruction of Huang Zu Gan Ning replied The dynasty is decadent and without influenceCao Cao will finally absorb the country down to the river unless he is opposedLiu Biao provides nothing against the future and his sons are quite unfitted to succeed himYou should lay your plans to oust him at once before Cao Cao anticipates youThe first attack should be made on Huang Zu who is getting old and avaricious so that every one hates himHe is totally unprepared for a fight and his army is undisciplined He would fall at the first blowIf he were gone you would control the western passes and could conquer the lands of Ba and Shu  And you would be securely established The advice is most valuable said Sun Quan and he made his preparationsZhou Yu was appointed CommanderinChief Lu Meng was Van Leader Dong Xi and Gan Ning were GeneralsSun Quan himself would command the main army of one hundred thousand troopsThe spies reported that Huang Zu at the news of an expedition against him called his officers together to consult He placed Su Fei in chief command He also appointed Chen Jiu and Deng Long as Van Leaders and prepared for general defenseHe had two hundreds of warships under the command of Chen Jiu and Deng Long On these he placed strong bows and stiff crossbows to the number of more than a thousand and secured the boats to heavy hawsers so that they formed a barrier in the riverAt the approach of the southern fleet the drums beat for the ships to attack Soon arrows and bolts flew thick forcing back the invaders who withdrew till several miles of water lay between them and the defendersWe must go forward said Gan Ning to Dong XiSo they chose a hundred light craft and put picked men on them fifty to a boat Twenty were to row the boats and thirty to fight These latter were armored swordsmen Careless of the enemys missiles these boats advanced got to the defenders fleet and cut the hawsers of their ships so that they drifted hither and thither in confusionGan Ning leaped upon one boat and killed Deng LongChen Jiu left the fleet and set out for the shoreLu Meng dropped into a small boat and went among the larger ships setting them on fireWhen Chen Jiu had nearly reached the bank Lu Meng reckless of death went after him got ahead and struck him full in the breast so that he fellBefore long Su Fei came along the bank with reinforcements but it was too late the armies of the South Land had already landed and there was no hope of repelling them Su Fei fled into the open country but he was made prisonerSu Fei was taken to Sun Quan who ordered that he be put into a cagecart and kept till Huang Zu should be captured Then he would execute the pairAnd the attack was pressed on day and night they wrought to capture XiakouHe sees his ships cut loose and burned By the Silksailed Pirate he once spurnedFor Huang Zus fate see next chapter CHAPTER At Jingzhou The Son Of Liu Biao Thrice Begs Advice At Bowang Slope The Directing Instructor Plans His First Battle Now Sun Quan fought against XiakouWhen Huang Zu recognized that he was beaten and could not maintain his position he abandoned Jiangxia and took the road to Jingzhou Gan Ning foreseeing this had laid an ambush outside the east gate of JiangxiaSoon after the fugitive with a small following had burst out of the gate he found his road blockedFrom horseback Huang Zu said I treated you well in the past why do you now press me so hard Gan Ning angrily shouted I did good service for you and yet you treated me as a pirateNow what have you to say There was nothing to be said and Huang Zu turned his horse to escapeBut Gan Ning thrust aside his troops and himself rode in pursuit Then he heard a shouting in his rear and saw General Cheng Pu coming upFearing lest this other pursuer should overpass him and score the success he desired for himself Gan Ning fitted an arrow to his bow and shot at the fugitive Huang Zu was hit and fell from his steed Then Gan Ning cut off his head After this joining himself to Cheng Pu the two returned bearing the ghastly trophy to their lordSun Quan ordered them to place it in a box to be taken back home and offered as a sacrifice to the manes of his fatherHaving rewarded the soldiers for the victory and promoted Gan Ning Sun Quan next discussed the advisability of sending a force to hold JiangxiaBut his adviser Zhang Zhao said It is impossible to try to hold one distant city aloneIt is better to return home and prepare for the expedition that Liu Biao will surely send in revengeWe will meet and defeat his worn army push home the attack and capture his whole region Sun Quan saw the advice was wise so he left Jiangxia and led his army home to the South LandNow Su Fei was still confined but he got some one to go to Gan Ning to beg him to plead for mercy Gan Ning had expected this although the prisoner had said no word and he was averse from leaving his friend and onetime protector to perishI should not have forgotten him even if he had said nothing said Gan NingWhen the army had returned Sun Quan gave orders for Su Feis execution that his head might be offered with that of Huang ZuThen Gan Ning went in to his lord and said weeping Long ago if it had not been for Su Fei my bones would have been rotting in some ditch and how then could I have rendered service under your bannerNow he deserves death but I cannot forget his kindness to me and I pray you take away the honors you have bestowed on me as a setoff to his crime Sun Quan replied Since he once showed kindness to you I will pardon him for your sakeBut what can be done if he run away If he be pardoned and escape death he will be immeasurably grateful and will not go awayIf he should then will I offer my life in exchange So the condemned man escaped death and only one head was offered in sacrificeAfter the sacrificial ceremonies a great banquet was spread in honor of the victoriesAs it was proceeding suddenly one of the guests burst into loud lamentations drew his sword and rushed upon Gan NingGan Ning hastily rose and defended himself with the chair on which he had been sittingThe host looked at the assailant and saw it was Ling Tong whose father Ling Cao had fallen under an arrow shot by Gan Ning The son was now burning to avenge his fathers deathHastily leaving his place Sun Quan checked the angry officer saying If he slew your noble father then remember each was fighting for his lord for whom he was bound to exert himself to the utmostBut now that you both are under one flag and are of one house you may not recall an ancient injuryYou must regard my interests continually Ling Tong beat his head upon the floor and cried saying But how can I not avenge this It is a blood feud and we may not both live under the same sky The guests interfered beseeching the man to forgo his revenge and at last he ceased from his murderous intentionBut he sat glaring wrathfully at his enemySo soon after Gan Ning was dispatched with five thousand troops and one hundred warships to guard Xiakou where he was beyond the reach of Ling Tongs wrathThen Sun Quan promoted Ling Tong and so he was somewhat appeasedFrom about this time the South Land enlarged her fleets and soldiers were sent to various points to guard the river banksThe brother of the chieftain Sun Kuang was placed in command at Wujun and Sun Quan himself with a large army camped at ChaisangZhou Yu CommanderinChief of the army and Supreme Admiral of the navy was on the Poyang Lake training the naval forces and general preparations were made for defense and attack By his spies Liu Bei had tidings of the doings in the lower portion of the Great River and knew of the death of Huang ZuSo he consulted Zhuge Liang as to his actionWhile they were discussing matters there arrived a messenger from Liu Biao begging Liu Bei to go to see himZhuge Liang advised him to go and said This call is to consult you about avenging Huang ZuYou must take me with you and let me act as the circumstances directThere are advantages to be got Leaving Guan Yu in command at Xinye Liu Bei set forth taking Zhang Fei with five hundred soldiers as his escortOn the way he discussed the course of action with his adviser who said First you must thank Liu Biao for having saved you from the evil that Cai Mao planned against you at XiangyangHowever you must not undertake any expedition against the South Land but say you must return to Xinye to put your army in good order With this admonition Liu Bei came to Jingzhou and was lodged in the guesthouse Zhang Fei and the escort camped without the walls In due course Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang were received and after the customary salutations Liu Bei apologized for his conduct at the banquetThe host said Worthy Brother I know you were the victim of a vile plot and I should have put the prime mover to death for it had there not been so universal a prayer for mercyHowever I remitted that penaltyI hope you do not consider that I was wrong Cai Mao hall little to do with it I think it was due to his subordinates replied Liu BeiLiu Biao said Jiangxia is lost as you know Huang Zu is dead So I have asked you to come that we might take measures of vengeance Huang Zu was harsh and cruel and never used his people in the proper waythat was the real cause of his fallBut have you reflected what Cao Cao may do on the north if we attack the south I am getting old and weak and I am unable to manage affairs properly will you aid me BrotherAfter I am gone you will have this region Why do you say this my brotherThink you that I am equal to such a task Here Zhuge Liang glanced at Liu Bei who continued But give me a little time to think it over And at this point he took his leaveWhen they had reached their lodging Zhuge Liang said Why did you decline his offer of the region He has always been most kind and courteousI could not take advantage of his weakness A perfectly kind and gracious lord sighed Zhuge LiangSoon after the son of the Imperial Protector Liu Qi was announced and Liu Bei received him and led him inThe young man began to weep saying My mother cannot bear the sight of me My very life is in danger Can you not save me Uncle My worthy nephew this is a family affairYou should not come to me Zhuge Liang who was present smiled Liu Bei turned to him to know what he should doThis is a family affair I cannot touch it replied Zhuge LiangThe young man soon left and when Liu Bei was saying goodbye he whispered I will get Zhuge Liang to return your call and you can do so and soHe will advise you Liu Qi thanked him and leftNext day when the call was to be returned Liu Bei pretended to be suffering from colic and made that an excuse to send Zhuge Liang to return the callThe adviser went and when he had reached the Palace dismounted and was led in Liu Qi conducted him into one of the inner rooms and when the tea had been brought said I am an object of my stepmothers dislike can you advise me what to do As a mere stranger guest I can hardly have anything to do with your own bone and flesh mattersIf I did and the story got abroad much harm might ensue With this he rose to take leave But Liu Qi was unwilling to say farewellHe said Your glory has turned in my direction you cannot mean to go away so pointlessly Liu Qi led his visitor into a private chamber and had refreshments brought While they ate and drank Liu Qi repeated his first requestwhat was he to do since his stepmother disliked himIt is not the sort of thing I can advise in replied Zhuge Liang as he rose for the second time to take leave Master if you will not reply that is wellBut why incontinently leave me So the adviser once more seated himself and Liu Qi said There is an ancient writing I should like to show you And he led his visitor to a small upper roomWhere is the writing said Zhuge LiangInstead of answering Liu Qi wept saying My stepmother cannot bear me my life is in danger O Master will you not say a word to save me Zhuge Liang flushed and rose to go awayBut he found the ladder by which they had mounted had been removed Again Liu Qi besought some advice saying Master you fear lest it may get abroad Is that why you are silentHere we are between earth and sky and what you say will come out of your mouth directly into my ear No other soul can hearNow can you tell me what to do Sow not dissension among relatives said Zhuge LiangIs it possible for me to make any plan for you Then is my life indeed in danger said the young manI will die at your feet So saying Liu Qi pulled out a dagger and threatened to make an end of himselfZhuge Liang checked him saying There is a way I pray you tell me You have heard of the old tale of the brothers Shen Sheng and Chong Er have you notShen Sheng stayed at home and died his brother Chong Er went away and lived in peaceNow that Huang Zu is gone and Jiangxia is weakly defended why do you not ask to be sent there to guard itThen you would be out of the way of harm Liu Qi thanked him Then he called to his people to restore the ladder and he escorted Zhuge Liang down to the level groundZhuge Liang returned to Liu Bei and related the whole interviewThe young man soon acted on the advice given him but his father would not at first consent to let him go To settle his doubts Liu Biao sent for Liu Bei who said Jiangxia is important and your son is the most suitable man to defend it You must let him goThe southeast will be defended by your son the northwest I will look after I hear that Cao Cao has been training a naval force and I am afraid he has intentions against usWe must be on our guard I know all about it you need feel no anxiety said Liu BeiHe took leave of his relative and went home while Liu Qi received command of three thousand soldiers and went to guard JiangxiaAt this time Cao Cao suppressed the three highest officers of state and exercised their functions himself as the Prime MinisterHe appointed as his general secretaries Mao Jie and Cui Yan and as literary secretary Sima YiSima Yi of Henei was grandson of Sima Juan Governor of Yingchuan son of Sima Fang Governor of Jingzhao and younger brother of Sima Lang Secretary GeneralCao Cao then called his officers to a council to discuss an expedition against the southXiahou Dun opened the debate saying Liu Bei is drilling his army at Xinye and is a source of dangerHe should be destroyed Accordingly Xiahou Dun was appointed Commanding General and four assistantsYu Jin Li Dian Xiahou Lan and Han Haowere given him With these he led one hundred thousand troops to Bowang whence he could observe XinyeXun Yu was opposed to this and said Liu Bei is a famous warrior and he has lately taken to himself as his Directing Instructor Zhuge LiangCaution is needed Xiahou Dun replied Liu Bei is a mean rat I will certainly take him prisoner Do not despise him said Xu ShuRemember he has Zhuge Liang to help him and so he is like a tiger who has grown wings Cao Cao said Who is this Zhuge Liang He has taken a Taoist cognomen of SleepingDragonHe is a perfect genius god and devil combined the greatest marvel of the ageDo not despise him How does he stand as compared with you asked Cao Cao There is no comparisonI am a mere glowworm spark he is the glory of the full moon replied Xu ShuYou are mistaken replied Xiahou Dun This Zhuge Liang of yours is of no account Who would fear himIf I do not take him and his master prisoners in the first battle then here is my head a free gift to our lord the Prime Minister Hasten to comfort me with news of victory said Cao Cao Xiahou Dun hastened to departThe advent of Zhuge Liang and the extravagant deference shown him did not please Liu Beis sworn brothers who grumbled saying He is very young although he is clever and learned Our brother really treats him too well We have not seen any evidence of his wonderful skill Liu Bei replied You do not know his worthI have him as if the fish has got into the water againPray do not discuss this matter further my brothers They withdrew silent but dissatisfiedOne day a man presented Liu Bei with a yaks tail and he at once put it in his cap as an ornament Zhuge Liang came in and noticed it at onceThen you have renounced all ambitions my lord you are just going to attend to this sort of thing Zhuge Liang quietly remarkedLiu Bei snatched off his cap and flung it away saying I was only amusing myself with the thing How do you think you stand compared with Cao Cao asked Zhuge LiangInferior Yes your army is less than ten thousand and the chances are ten thousand to one that he will attackHow can we meet him I am greatly distressed about it but I see no way You might recruit and I will train themThen we might be able to oppose him So recruiting began and three thousand were enlistedZhuge Liang set about drilling them diligentlySoon they heard that Xiahou Dun was leading an army of one hundred thousand troops against themWhen he heard it Zhang Fei said to his brother Guan Yu We will get this Zhuge Liang to go and fight them Just at that moment they were summoned to their brother who asked their adviceWhy not send the Water Brother said Zhang Fei For method I rely on Zhuge Liang but for action I put my faith in you my brothersAre you going to fail me They went out and Zhuge Liang was called I fear your brothers will not obey me said Zhuge LiangWherefore if I am to direct the campaign you must give me a seal of office and a sword of authority So Liu Bei gave him bothArmed with these ensigns of power Zhuge Liang assembled the officers to receive their ordersWe will go just to see what he will do said Zhang Fei to Guan YuIn the assembly Zhuge Liang spoke saying On the left of Bowang are Yushan HillsOn the right is Anlin Forest There we will prepare an ambushGuan Yu will go to Yushan Hills with one thousand soldiersHe is to remain there quiescent till the enemy has passed but when he sees a flame in the south that will be the signal to attack He will first burn their baggage train Zhang Fei will go to a valley behind Anlin ForestWhen he sees the signal he is to go to the old stores depot at Bowang and burn that Liu Feng and Guan Ping will take five hundred soldiers each prepare combustibles and be ready with them beyond Bowang Slope The enemy will arrive about dusk and then the two generals can start the blareZhao Yun now recalled from Fankou is to lead the attack but he is to lose and not win And our lord is to command the reserveSee that each one obeys these orders and let there be no mistakes Then said Guan Yu All of us are to go out to meet the enemy but I have not yet heard what you are going to do I am going to guard the city Zhang Fei burst into a laugh We are to go out to bloody battle and you are to stay quietly at home quite comfortable Here is the sword and here the seal replied the strategist displaying the emblems of authorityDisobedience of orders will be death Liu Bei said Do you not understand that the plans elaborated in a little chamber decide success over thousands of milesDo not disobey the command my brothers Zhang Fei went out smiling cynicallyGuan Yu remarked Let us await the result If he fails then we can look to it The brothers leftNone of the officers understood anything of the general line of strategy and though they obeyed orders they were not without doubts and misgivingsZhuge Liang said to Liu Bei You may now lead your soldiers to the hills and camp till the enemy shall arrive tomorrow eveningThen you are to abandon the camp and move away retreating till the signal is seen Then you will advance and attack with all forceMi Zhu Mi Fang and I will guard the city In the city Zhuge Liang prepared banquets to celebrate the victory and also prepared the books to record exceptional services Liu Bei noted all these things with not a little trouble in his heart Cao Caos army of one hundred thousand troops in due course reached BowangThen half of them the veterans were told off for the first attack and the remainder were to guard the baggage train and supplies Thus they marched in two divisionsThe season was autumn and a chilly wind began to blow They pressed forwardPresently they saw a cloud of dust ahead of them and Xiahou Dun ordered the ranks to be reformed He questioned the guides as to the name of the placeThe place in front is Bowang Slope and behind us is the River Luo was the replyThen Xiahou Dun rode to the front to reconnoiter leaving Yu Jin and Li Dian to finish setting out the battle arrayPresently Xiahou Dun began to laugh and when they asked the cause of this merriment he replied Xu Shu praised Zhuge Liang to the very skies as something more than humanBut now that I see how he has placed his soldiers and the stuff he has put into his vanguard it seems to me that he is sending dogs or sheep against tigers and leopardsI bragged a little when I said I would take him prisoner but I am going to make good my boast Then he rode forward at full speedZhao Yun rode to meet him and Xiahou Dun opened a volley of abuse You lot followers of Liu Bei are only like wraiths following devils This angered Zhao Yun and a combat beganIn a little time Zhao Yun turned and retreated as if he was worstedXiahou Dun pressed after him and kept up the chase for some three miles Then Zhao Yun suddenly turned again and offered fight but only to retreat after a few passesSeeing these tactics Han Hao one of Xiahou Duns generals rode up to his chief and urged him to use caution saying I fear he is trying to lead us into an ambush With such antagonists as these I should not fear even Ten Ambushes replied Xiahou Dun pressing forward eagerlyJust as he reached the slope he heard the roar of a bomb and out came Liu Bei to attackHere is your ambush said Xiahou Dun laughingI will get to Xinye this evening before I have done Xiahou Dun urged his soldiers forward and his opponents retired in measure as he advancedAs evening came on thick clouds overcast the whole sky The wind increased but the leader still urged his troops after the retreating foeThe two generals in the rear came to a narrow part of the road with reeds and rushes thick all round themThose who despise the enemy are beaten said Li Dian to Yu JinAway south there the roads are narrow and streams and mountains make the country difficultThe forests are dense and if the enemy used fire we should be lost You are right replied Yu JinI will get on and warn the Commanding General perhaps he will stopYou can halt those who come up Yu Jin rode forward shouting at the top of his voice Halt the train Xiahou Dun saw him coming up and asked what was the matter Yu Jin said The roads here are narrow and difficult Around us are thick forests What if they use fire Xiahou Duns ferocity had then somewhat abated and he turned his steed toward his main body Then there arose a shout behind himA rushing noise came from in the reeds and great tongues of flame shot up here and thereThese spread and soon the fire was in the four quarters and the eight sides and fanned by a strong windXiahou Duns troops were thrown into confusion and trampled each other down Many perishedZhao Yun turned on them again to make a slaughter Xiahou Dun dashed through the fire and smoke to escapeNow Li Dian saw that things were going very badly so he turned to get back to Bowang but fell upon a body of troops in the way led by Guan Yu He desperately dashed into their midst and managed to get clearYu Jin saw the supplies were being destroyed and there was nothing left to guard so he escaped along a byepathTwo other generals who came to try to save the baggage train met Zhang Fei and Xiahou Lan was slain forthwith but Han Hao managed to fleeNext morning the countryside was strewn with corpses and drenched with bloodThe armies met on Bowang Slope And Zhuge Liang fought with fire A perfect strategist he bent All humans to his desire But poor Cao Cao his enemy He trembled in his shoes Before the man whod never fought But yet could armies useXiahou Dun drew up the battered remains of his army and led them back to Xuchang Zhuge Liang ordered his armies to collect and as Guan Yu and Zhang Fei rode homeward they confessed saying Zhuge Liang is really a fine strategist Before long they saw Mi Zhu and Mi Fang leading out a small body of soldiers among them was a light carriage in which the Directing Instructor Zhuge Liang was seating Guan Yu and Zhang Fei dismounted and bowed before him The remaining bodies came in The spoil was distributed among the soldiers and all returned to Xinye where the populace lined the roads to bid them welcome We owe our lives to the Prince they cried to Liu Bei Said Zhuge Liang Xiahou Dun has been driven off but Cao Cao will come with a stronger force And what shall we do replied Liu BeiMy plan is quite ready said Zhuge LiangAlways battles nowhere rest for horse or human Must rely on ruses dodging where one canThe plan prepared against Cao Cao will be unfolded in the next chapter CHAPTER Lady Cai Discusses The Renunciation of Jingzhou Zhuge Liang Burns XinyeWhen Liu Bei asked how his adviser hoped to repel Cao Cao Zhuge Liang replied Xinye is a small city and unfitted for our lengthy occupation Liu Biao is ill and failing fast so this is the time to take his region as a base where we may be safe against Cao Cao You speak well but Liu Biao has shown me great kindness and I could not bear to serve him an ill turn If you do not take this opportunity you will regret it ever after said Zhuge LiangI would rather perish than do what is wrong We will discuss it again replied Zhuge Liang When Xiahou Dun reached the capital he presented himself to his master in bonds and craved death But his master loosed him and let him tell his tale And he said I was the victim of Zhuge Liangs evil machinations he attacked with fire As a soldier from your youth you should have remembered that fire was a likely weapon in narrow roads Li Dian and Yu Jin reminded me I am sorry enough now Cao Cao rewarded Li Dian and Yu Jin who had warned their leaderLiu Bei as strong as he is now certainly is a menace to our existence and he must be quickly destroyed said Xiahou Dun He is one of my anxieties replied Cao CaoSun Quan is the other The rest do not countWe must take this chance to sweep the south clean Then orders were issued to prepare an army of five hundred thousand troops in five divisions of ten legions each Each division had two leaders Cao Ren and Cao Hong were in command of the first division Zhang Liao and Zhang He the second Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan the third Yu Jin and Li Dian the fourth The fifth body was led by Cao Cao himselfThe van was commanded by Xu Chu The horse day of the seventh moon of the thirteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity was fixed for the march The High Minister Kong Rong offered a remonstrance He said Liu Bei and Liu Biao are both of the Imperial House and should not be attacked without grave reasonsSun Quan in the six territories of the South Land is terrible as a crouching tiger and with the Great River as his defense he is very secure If Sir Prime Minister you undertake this unjustifiable expedition you will forfeit the respect of the world I fear All three of them are disobedient ministers and rebels and how can I fail to punish them replied Cao Cao Cao Cao was angry and bade the adviser go from his presencePresently he gave formal orders that he would put to death any one who remonstrated on the subject of his expeditionKong Rong went forth from the Palace sadly Casting his eyes up to heaven he cried Where is the chance of success when the perfectly inhumane attacks the perfectly humaneHe must be defeated One of the clients of the Imperial Inspector Chi Lu whom Kong Rong had always treated contemptuously and disdainfully happened to hear this apostrophe and told his patron who carried the tale to Cao Cao Chi Lu also added to it saying Kong Rong habitually speaks disrespectfully of the Chief Minister and has been very friendly with Mi Heng In fact the insults that Mi Heng had hurled at you had been deliberately arranged and intrigued by Kong Rong Kong Rong and Mi Heng seemed to admire each other hugely and Mi Heng used to say Confucius is not dead because Kong Rong is he and the other used to reply And his treasured disciple Yan Hui has risen again because Mi Heng is he Chi Lus tale angered Cao Cao who ordered the arrest execution of the high ministerNow Kong Rong had two sons both young who were sitting at home playing chess when one of their servants ran in and said Your father has just been carried off for execution why do you not run away The youths replied When the nest is pulled down are the eggs left unbroken Even at that moment the same executors came and carried off the whole household The two youths were beheaded The fathers corpse was exposed in the streetsMinister Zhi Xi wept over the corpseThis public exhibition of sympathy rekindled Cao Caos anger and he was going to punish it with deathHowever this additional punishment was prevented by Adviser Xun Yu who said You should not slay a righteous man who came to mourn over his friends corpseZhi Xi had often warned Kong Rong against the danger Kong Rongs severe rectitude might lead him into Zhi Xi took up the remains of father and sons and buried themKong Rong who dwelt on the north sea shore A noble reputation bore With him all guests warm welcome found And ceaselessly the wine went roundFor skill in letters he was famed In speech he dukes and princes shamed Historians his merits tell Recorders say that he did well After wreaking his wrath on Kong Rong Cao Cao issued the order to march Xun Yu was left in command of the capitalAbout this time the Imperial Protector of Jingzhou became seriously ill and he summoned Liu Bei to his chamberLiu Bei went accompanied by his two brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei and Directing Instructor Zhuge LiangLiu Biao said The disease has attacked my very vitals and my time is short I confide my orphans to your guardianshipMy sons is unfit to succeed to my place and I pray you my brother administer the region after my death Liu Bei wept saying I will do my utmost to help my nephews what else could I do indeed Even at this moment came the news of the march of Cao Caos armies and Liu Bei taking hasty leave of his kinsman was forced to hurry to his station The evil tidings aggravated the sick mans condition and he began to make his last arrangementsIn his testament he appointed Liu Bei the guardian of his son Liu Qi who was to succeed in the lordshipThis arrangement greatly angered his wife Lady CaiShe closed the inner doors against all and confided to her own partisans of whom Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were her confidants the keeping of the outer gatesThe heir was at Jiangxia and he came to make filial inquiries as soon as his fathers condition became serious But Cai Mao refused him admittance and said Your father sent you to guard JiangxiaSuch a very responsible post should by no means have been quitted without ordersSuppose it was attacked what might not happen If your father sees you he will be very angry and it will make him worse That would be most undutiful and you should return to your command at once Liu Qi stood out for some time but admittance was denied him in spite of his tearsSo he returned to his post Meanwhile Liu Biao rapidly grew worseHe anxiously looked for his son but Liu Qi came not Suddenly Liu Biao uttered piercing shrieks and then passed away When the Yuans were lords of the north And Liu Biao held the bank of the river It seemed so strong were they both That they would endure foreverBut the family affairs troubled their states And meddling confusion made It was mournful indeed to see How quickly the houses decayedSo Imperial Protector Liu Biao died Then the widow and her partisans took counsel together and forged a testament conferring the lordship of Jingzhou on the second son Liu Zong before they published the news of the deathThe wrongful heir was then fourteen years of age But he was a cunning boy so he assembled the officials and said My father has passed away and my elder brother is at Jiangxia More than that our uncle is at XinyeYou have made me lord but if my brother and uncle come here with an army to punish me for usurping the lordship what explanation can I offer At first no one repliedThen Adviser Li Gui rose and said You speak well Now hasten to send letters of mourning to your brother and ask him to come and take his inheritance Also call upon Liu Bei to come and assist in the administration Then shall we be safe against our enemiesCao Cao on the north and Sun Quan on the southI consider this the most excellent plan But Cai Mao replied harshly Who are you to speak thus wildly and oppose the testament of our late lord Li Gui began to abuse him saying You and your party have fabricated this testament setting aside the rightful heirNow the whole region is in the hands of the Cai family and if our dead lord knew your doings he would slay you Cai Mao ordered the lictors to take Li Gui away to executionHe was hurried out but his tongue ceased notSo the younger son was placed in his fathers seat and the Cai clan shared among them the whole military authority of the regionThe defense of Jingzhou was confided to Liu Xian and Deng Yi while Lady Cai and her son took up their residence in Xiangyang so as to be out of the reach of the rightful heir and his uncleThey interred the remains of the late Imperial Protector on the east of Xiangyang near the bank of the Han River No notice of the death was sent to Liu Qi the son or to Liu Bei his uncleLiu Zong arrived at Xiangyang but before he had had time to recover from the fatigue of the journey the startling news of the approach of Cao Caos great army came inHe summoned Kuai Yue and Cai Mao and others to ask counselOne of the secretaries Fu Xuan offered his advice saying Not only are we threatened by a great army from the north but the elder son who is the real heir at Jiangxia and his uncle at Xinye are to be reckoned with These two have not been notified of the death and they will resent that We shall be in sad case if they also march against usBut if you will adopt my suggestion then our people will be as steady as Taishan Mountains and our young lords position and rank will be assured What is your plan asked the young lordTo offer the whole region to Cao Cao who will treat our young master most liberally What advice said Liu Zong angrilyAm I to yield my heritage to another before I have even fairly succeeded to it The advice is good said Kuai YueOpportunism is a policy and possibilities need considerationIn the name of government Cao Cao is fighting against his neighbors If our lord opposes him he will be termed contumaciousBeside any misfortune on our borders before our young lord is well established will react upon the internal administration and our people will be panicstricken at the mere news of the approach of a hostile armyHow could we then offer any resistance Liu Zong replied It is not that I disagree with you but I should be a laughing stock to the whole world were I to abandon my heritage without an effort He was interrupted by a speaker who said If their advice is good why not follow it They turned toward the speaker who was a certain Wang Can of Shanyang a lean cadaverous individual much below the middle height of a man However his talents did not conform to his physical appearanceWhen he was yet a youth he went to visit Minister Cai Yong then a vicechairman of the Secretariat and although many guests of exalted rank were present the host hastened to welcome the newcomer with the greatest deferenceThe others were astonished and asked why he was so respectful to a mere youth He is a young man with the highest gifts said Cai YongWang Can was widely read and had a most retentive memory better than any of his contemporaries If he glanced at a roadside monument as he passed he remembered every word of the inscriptionIf he saw people playing chess and the board was suddenly overthrown he could replace every pip in its proper placeHe was a good mathematician and his poems were exquisiteAt seventeen he was appointed a court official but did not take up the appointmentWhen the disturbance in the empire grew serious he sought refuge in Jingzhou where he was received with great honor as guest of the Imperial ProtectorWhat he said was this General how do you compare with Cao Cao Inferior replied Liu ZongWang Can continued Cao Cao has many soldiers and bold leaders he is able and resourcefulHe took Lu Bu at Xiapi and broke the power of Yuan Shao at Guandu He pursued Liu Bei into Longyou and destroyed Mao Dun at White Wolf Hills The destruction of such firmly established men shows his invincible characterNow he is on the way here and it will be very difficult to withstand himThe plan proposed is the best you can expect and you should not delay and hesitate till it is too late for ought but regret Worthy Sir you indeed speak to the point I must inform my mother said the young rulerBut just then they saw his mother appear from behind a screen she had been listening to all that was said Why refer to me when three such gentlemen coincide in their opinions said Lady CaiSo Liu Zong decided and the letter of surrender was composed and entrusted to one Song Zhong to convey secretly to Cao CaoSong Zhong went straight to Wancheng and presented the letter It was received with joy and the bearer well rewardedThe submission was accepted and Cao Cao said Tell Liu Zong to go out to meet me in the open country and he will be in perpetual tenure of his land Song Zhong left the city and took the homeward wayHe had nearly reached the ferry when he fell in with a party of horse On a closer look he saw the leader was Guan Yu The messenger tried to escape observation but was presently captured and taken to the leader to be questionedAt first he prevaricated but on being closely questioned told the whole storyThen he was carried off to Xinye and made to retell his story to Liu Bei who heard it with lamentationsZhang Fei said This being so I propose that we put this fellow to death then cross the river attack Xiangyang and make an end of the Cai tribe and Liu Zong as well Then we can attack Cao Cao But Liu Bei replied Hold on I have something more to say Then turning to the prisoner Liu Bei shouted When they did all this why did you not come to tell meAs things are now there is nothing to be gained by killing youYou may go Song Zhong stammered his thanks threw his arms over his head and ran awayLiu Bei was very sad Presently Yi Ji from Jiangxia was announced Liu Bei was very fond of this man and went down the steps to welcome him Then said Yi Ji The heir has heard that his father is dead but his stepmother and her family are keeping back the news so that they may set up Liu Zong He knows the news is true as he sent a special messenger to find outHe thinks you O Prince may not know and has sent me to inform you and his letter begs you to lead all the troops you can to Xiangyang to help him assert his claims Liu Bei opened and read the letterThen he said Yes you know that the younger son has usurped the lordship but you have not heard that he has already sent to offer Jingzhou to Cao Cao This news shocked Yi Ji who asked How know you this Liu Bei told of the capture of Song ZhongYi Ji said You can go to Xiangyang as if to attend the mourning ceremonies and so draw Liu Zong into coming out of the city to welcome you Then you can seize him slay his party and take the region Your advice is good said Zhuge Liang and my lord ought to take it Liu Bei wept saying In his last interview my brother confided his son and heir to my care If I lay hands upon another son and seize upon the inheritance how shall I be able to look my brother in the face when I meet him by and by beyond the grave If you do not act in this way now how will you repel Cao Cao who has already reached Wancheng said Zhuge Liang Our best plan is to take refuge in Fankou replied Liu BeiJust about this time the spies came to say that Cao Caos army had reached BowangSo Yi Ji was sent off with instructions to take measures for the defense of Jiangxia while Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang discussed plans for meeting the enemyZhuge Liang said My lord should not worryWe have burned the army of Cao Cao at Bowang Slope so we will see them fallen into another ruse in XinyeThis is no place to live in we will move over to Fankou Then notices were posted at all the gates that all the people without any exception were to follow their ruler at once to the new city to escape dangerBoats were prepared and the people sent away under the direction of Sun QianMi Zhu saw to the safe conveyance of the families of the officialsThen the officers assembled for orders Zhuge Liang gave directions Guan Yu is to go to the upper of the White River with one thousand troopsHis men are to carry bags to fill with sand and earth to dam the river till the enemy shall be heard about the third watch next day Then the waters are to be freed to drown one of the armies He is then to march down river Zhang Fei is to go to the Boling Ferry where the current is slowAfter the waters of the White River have been let loose on Cao Caos soldiers they will try to get over the river at the ferry They are to be attacked by Zhang Fei and his one thousand troopsZhao Yun is to divide three thousand troops into four parties and take one to the east gate The other three are for the other gates The roofs of the houses within the city walls are piled with sulfur saltpeter and other combustibles The intention is to set fire to the city when the army of the enemy has entered it for shelterThere will be a strong breeze next day in the evening which will fan the flamesWhen this wind begins to blow fire arrows are to be shot into the city from all sides When the flames are high there is to be a great shouting outside to add to the general terrorThe east gate is to be left free for escape but the flying men are to be smitten after passing the gateMi Fang and Liu Feng are to take command of two thousand troops one half with red flags and the other half with blueThey are to go to Magpie Tail Slope about ten miles from the city and campWhen they see the Cao Caos army coming along the red flags are to move left and the blue right to confuse the enemy so that they shall be afraid to advance furtherThen an ambush is to be laid to smite the enemy when the fire in Xinye starts After that Mi Fang and Liu Feng are to go to the river to meet us After the battle all generals shall gather at Fankou All the orders given the various leaders went their way to take up their positions and await the burning of the cityZhuge Liang and Liu Bei went away to an eminence whence they could watch what happened and where they would await the reports of victoryCao Hong and Cao Ren with their one hundred thousand troops preceded by Xu Chu leading three thousand of mailed men marched toward XinyeThey formed a mighty host and reached Magpie Tail Slope about noon Looking ahead they saw what seemed a goodly army with many blue and red flags Xu Chu pressed forward As he neared the flags moved from side to side and he hesitatedHe began to think It could be an ambush it is unwise to advance Finally Xu Chu decided to go no farther and called a halt and he rode back to the main body to see Cao RenThose troops are only makebelieve said Cao Ren Advance there is no ambushI will hasten up the supports So Xu Chu rode to his own command again and advancedWhen he reached the wood where he had seen the flags he saw no one at allIt was then late in the afternoon but he decided to move onThen he heard from the hills the sound of musical instruments and looking up saw on the hill top two umbrellas surrounded by many banners There sat Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang quietly drinkingAngry at their coolness Xu Chu sought for a way up but logs of wood and great stones were thrown down and he was driven backFurther from the rear of the hills came a confused roarHe could find no way to attack and the sun began to setThen Cao Ren and Cao Hong arrived and ordered an attack on Xinye that he might have a place to rest inThey marched to the walls and found the gates wide openThey entered and found a deserted city No one was visible This shows they are done said Cao Hong They have all run away people and allWe may as well occupy the city and rest our soldiers ready for tomorrow The soldiers were fatigued with marching and hungry as well so they lost no time in scattering among the houses and setting about preparing food in the deserted kitchens The leaders took up their quarters in the state residence to restAfter the first watch the wind began to blowSoon after the gate guards reported that a fire had startedThe careless men have let sparks fly about said Cao RenHe thought no more about it just then but along came other reports of like nature and soon he realized that fires breaking out in all quarters were not due to accident So he gave orders to evacuate the citySoon the whole city seemed on fire and a red glow hung in the skyThe army was beset with fire fiercer than what Xiahou Dun had experienced at Bowang Slope Thrice wicked was Cao Cao but he was bold Though all in the capital he controlled Yet with this he was not content So southward his ravaging army wentBut the autumn wind aiding the Spirit of Fire Wrought to his army destruction direOfficers and troops dashing through the smoke and fire in utter confusion sought some way of escape and hearing that the east gate was free they made for that quarterOut they rushed pellmell many being trodden down and trampled to death Those who got through took the road to the east But presently there was a shouting behind them and Zhao Yuns company came up and attackedThen Cao Caos troops scattered each fleeing for his life No stand was made A little later Mi Fang and Liu Feng came to take another toll The fleeing Cao Ren then had very few followers and those left him were scorched and burnedThey directed their way to the White River joyfully remembering that the river was shallow and fordable And they went down into the stream and drank their fill humans shouting and horses neighing Meantime Guan Yu higher up its course had dammed the river with sandbags so that its waters were collected in a lakeToward evening he had seen the red glow of the burning city and began to look out for his signalAbout the fourth watch he heard down stream the sounds of soldiers and horse and at once ordered the breaking of the dam The water rushed down in a torrent and overwhelmed the men just then in the bed of the river Many were swept away and drowned Those who escaped made their way to where the stream ran gently and got awayPresently Cao Ren and his troops reached the Boling Ferry in Boling Here where they thought there would be safety they found the road barredYou Cao Cao brigands shouted Zhang FeiCome and receive your fate Within the city the red flame leaps out On the river bank burning anger is met What happened will appear in later chaptersCHAPTER Liu Bei Leads His People Over The River Zhao Yun Rescues The Child Lord At DangyangThe last chapter closed with the attack made by Zhang Fei as soon as his brother had let loose the waters on the doomed armyHe met with Xu Chu and a combat began but a fight with such a warrior was not to Xu Chus taste and he ran awayZhang Fei followed till he came upon Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang and the three went upstream till they came to the boats that had been prepared by Liu Feng and Mi Fang when they all crossed over and marched toward Fankou As soon as they disembarked Zhuge Liang ordered the boats and rafts to be burnedCao Ren gathered in the remnants of his army and camped at Xinye while his colleague Cao Hong went to tell their lord the evil tidings of defeatHow dare he this rustic Zhuge Liang exclaimed Cao Cao angrilyCao Cao then hastily sent an overwhelming army to camp near the place and gave orders for enormous works against the city leveling hills and turning rivers to launch a violent assault on Fankou from every side at once Then Liu Ye came in to see his lord and said Sir you are new to this region and you should win over the peoples heartsLiu Bei has moved all the people from Xinye to Fankou If we march through the country the people will be ground to powderIt would be well to call upon Liu Bei first to surrender which will prove to the people that you have a care for themIf he yields then we get Jingzhou without fighting Cao Cao agreed and asked who would be a suitable messenger Liu Ye suggested Xu ShuHe is a close friend of Liu Bei and he is here with the army said Liu YeBut he will not come back objected Cao CaoIf he does not return he will be a laughing stock to the whole world he will come back Xu Shu was sent for and Cao Cao said My first intention was to level Fankou with the ground but out of pity for its people you may carry an offer to Liu Bei that if he will surrender he will not only not be punished but he shall be given rankBut if he holds on his present misguided course the whole of his followers shall be destroyed Now you are an honest man and so I confide this mission to you and I trust you will not disappoint me Xu Shu said nothing but accepted his orders and went to the city where he was received by both Liu Bei and Zhuge LiangThey enjoyed a talk over old times before Xu Shu mentioned the object of his missionThen he said Cao Cao has sent me to invite you to surrender thereby making a bid for popularityBut you ought also to know that he intends to attack the city from every point that he is damming up the White Rivers waters to be sent against you and I fear you will not be able to hold the cityYou ought to prepare Liu Bei asked Xu Shu to remain with them but Xu Shu said That is impossible for all the world would ridicule me if I stayedMy old mother is dead and I never forget my resentmentMy body may be over there but I swear never to form a plan for Cao Cao You have the SleepingDragon to help you and need have no anxiety about the ultimate achievement of your undertakingBut I must go And Xu Shu took his leaveLiu Bei felt he could not press his friend to stayXu Shu returned to Cao Caos camp and reported that Liu Bei had no intention of surrenderThis angered Cao Cao who gave orders to begin the advance and siegeWhen Liu Bei asked what Zhuge Liang meant to do Zhuge Liang replied We shall abandon Fankou and take Xiangyang But what of the people who have followed us They cannot be abandoned You can tell them to do as they wishThey may come if they like or remain here They sent Guan Yu to prepare boats and told Sun Qian to proclaim to the people that Cao Cao was coming that the city could not be defended and those who wished to do so might cross the river with the armyAll the people cried We will follow the Prince even if it be to death They started at once some lamenting some weeping the young helping the aged parents leading their children the strong soldiers carrying the womenAs the crowds crossed the river from both banks arose the sound of lamentation Liu Bei was much affected as he saw all this from the boatWhy was I ever born said he to be the cause of all this misery to the people He made to leap into the river but they held him back All were deeply sympatheticWhen the boat reached the southern shore he looked back at the weeping crowds waiting still on the other bank and was again moved to tearsHe bade Guan Yu hasten the boats before he mounted and rode onWhen Xiangyang came in sight they saw many flags flying on the walls and that the moat was protected by barbed barriers Liu Bei checked his horse and called out Liu Zong Good Nephew I only wish to save the people and nothing moreI pray you quickly open the gates But Liu Zong was too frightened to appearCai Mao and Zhang Yun went up to one of the fighting towers and ordered the soldiers to shoot arrows down on those without the wallsThe people gazed up at the towers and wept aloud Suddenly there appeared a general with a small following who cried out Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are two traitorsThe princely Liu Bei is a most upright man and has come here to preserve his people Why do you repulse him All looked at this man He was of middle height with a face dark brown as a ripe dateHe was from Yiyang and named Wei Yan At that moment he looked very terrible whirling his sword as if about to slice up the gate guards They lost no time in throwing open the gate and dropping the bridgeCome in Uncle Liu Bei cried Wei Yan and bring your army to slay these traitors Zhang Fei plunged forward to take Cai Mao and Zhang Yun but he was checked by his brother who said Do not frighten the people Thus Wei Yan let in Liu BeiAs soon as he entered he saw a general galloping up with a few men The newcomer yelled Wei Yan you nobody How dare you create troubleDo you not know me General Wen Ping Wei Yan turned angrily set his spear and galloped forward to attack the generalThe soldiers joined in the fray and the noise of battle rose to the skiesI wanted to preserve the people and I am only causing them injury cried Liu Bei distressedI do not wish to enter the city Jiangling is an important point we will first take that as a place to dwell in said Zhuge Liang That pleases me greatly said Liu BeiSo they led the people thither and away from XiangyangMany of the inhabitants of that city took advantage of the confusion to escape and they also joined themselves to Liu BeiMeanwhile within the inhospitable city Wei Yan and Wen Ping fought The battle continued for four or five watches all through the middle of the day and nearly all the combatants fell Then Wei Yan got awayAs he could not find Liu Bei he rode off to Changsha and sought an asylum with Governor Han Xuan Liu Bei wandered away from the city of Xiangyang that had refused shelterSoldiers and people his following numbered more than a hundred thousand The carts numbered scores of thousands and the burden bearers were innumerable Their road led them past the tomb of Liu Biao and Liu Bei turned aside to bow at the grave He lamented saying Shameful is thy brother lacking both in virtue and in talents I refused to bear the burden you wished to lay upon me wherein I was wrong But the people committed no sinI pray your glorious spirit descend and rescue these people His prayer was fraught with sorrow and all those about him weptJust then a scout rode up with the news that Fankou was already taken by Cao Cao and that his army were preparing boats and rafts to cross the riverThe generals of Liu Bei said Jiangling is a defensible shelter but with this crowd we can only advance very slowly and when can we reach the cityIf Cao Cao pursue we shall be in a parlous stateOur counsel is to leave the people to their fate for a time and press on to Jiangling But Liu Bei wept saying The success of every great enterprise depends upon humanity how can I abandon these people who have joined me Those who heard him repeat this noble sentiment were greatly affectedIn time of stress his heart was tender toward the people And he wept as he went down into the ship Moving the hearts of soldiers to sympathyEven today in the countryside Fathers and elders recall the Princely Ones kindness The progress of Liu Bei with the crowd of people in his train was very slowThe pursuers will be upon us quickly said Zhuge LiangLet us send Guan Yu to Jiangxia for succorLiu Qi should be told to bring soldiers and prepare boats for us at Jiangling Liu Bei agreed to this and wrote a letter which he sent by the hands of Guan Yu and Sun Qian and five hundred troops Zhang Fei was put in command of the rear guardZhao Yun was told to guard Liu Beis family while the others ordered the march of the peopleThey only traveled three or four miles daily and the halts were frequentMeanwhile Cao Cao was at Fankou whence he sent troops over the river toward XiangyangHe summoned Liu Zong but Liu Zong was too afraid to answer the call No persuasion could get him to goWang Wei said to him privately Now you can overcome Cao Cao if you are wise Since you have announced surrender and Liu Bei has gone away Cao Cao will relax his precautions and you can catch him unawaresSend a wellprepared but unexpected force to waylay him in some commanding position and the thing is doneIf you were to take Cao Cao prisoner your fame would run throughout the empire and the land would be yours for the takingThis is a sort of opportunity that does not recur and you should not miss it The young man consulted Cai Mao who called Wang Wei an evil counselor and spoke to him harshly You are madYou know nothing and understand nothing of destiny said Cai MaoWang Wei angrily retorted saying Cai Mao is the betrayer of the country and I wish I could eat him alive The quarrel waxed deadly and Cai Mao wanted to slay Wang Wei but eventually peace was restored by Kuai YueThen Cai Mao and Zhang Yun went to Fankou to see Cao CaoCai Mao was by instinct specious and flattering and when his host asked concerning the resources of Jingzhou he replied There are fifty thousand of horse one hundred fifty thousand of foot and eighty thousand of marinesMost of the money and grain are at Jiangling the rest is stored at various placesThere are ample supplies for a year How many war vessels are thereWho is in command said Cao CaoThe ships of all sizes number seven thousands and we two are the commanders Upon this Cao Cao conferred upon Cai Mao the title of the Lord Who Controls the South and Supreme Admiral of the Naval Force and Zhang Yun was his ViceAdmiral with the title of the Lord Who Brings ObedienceWhen they went to thank Cao Cao for these honors he told them saying I am about to propose to the Throne that Liu Biaos son should be perpetual Imperial Protector of Jingzhou in succession to his late father With this promise for their young master and the honors for themselves they retiredThen Xun You asked Cao Cao Why these two evident selfseekers and flatterers have been treated so generously Cao Cao replied Do I not know all about themOnly in the north where we have been we know nothing of war by water and these two men do I want their help for the presentWhen my end is achieved I can do as I like with them Liu Zong was highly delighted when his two chief supporters returned with the promise Cao Cao had given themSoon after he gave up his seal and military commission and proceeded to welcome Cao Cao who received him very graciouslyCao Cao next proceeded to camp near XiangyangThe populace led by Cai Mao and Zhang Yun welcomed him with burning incense and he on his part put forth proclamations couched in comforting termsCao Cao presently entered the city and took his seat in the residence in stateThen he summoned Kuai Yue and said to him graciously I do not rejoice so much at gaining Jingzhou as at meeting you friend Kuai Yue Cao Cao made Kuai Yue Governor of Jiangling and Lord of Fankou Wang Can Fu Xuan and Kuai Yues other adherents were all ennobledLiu Zong became Imperial Protector of Qingzhou in the north and was ordered to proceed to his region forthwithLiu Zong was greatly frightened and said I have no wish to become an actual official I wish to remain in the place where my father and mother live Said Cao Cao Your protectorship is quite near the capital and I have sent you there as a full official to remove you from the intrigues of this place In vain Liu Zong declined the honors thus thrust upon him he was compelled to go and he departed taking his mother with himOf his friends only Wang Wei accompanied him Some of his late officers escorted him as far as the river and then took their leaveThen Cao Cao called his trusty officer Yu Jin and said Follow Liu Zong and put him and his mother to death Our worries are thus removed Yu Jin followed the small partyWhen he drew near he shouted I have an order from the great Prime Minister to put you both to death mother and son you may as well submit quietly Lady Cai threw her arms about her son lifted up her voice and weptYu Jin bade his soldiers get on with their bloody workOnly Wang Wei made any attempt to save his mistress and he was soon killed The two mother and son were soon finished and Yu Jin returned to report his success He was richly rewardedNext Cao Cao sent to discover and seize the family of Zhuge Liang but they had already disappearedZhuge Liang had moved them to the Three Gorges It was much to Cao Caos disgust that the search was fruitless So Xiangyang was settled Then Xun You proposed a further advanceHe said Jiangling is an important place and very richIf Liu Bei gets it it will be difficult to dislodge him How could I have overlooked that said Cao CaoThen he called upon the officers of Xiangyang for one who could lead the way They all came except Wen PingCao Cao sent for him and soon he came alsoWhy are you late asked Cao CaoWen Ping said To be a minister and see ones master lose his own boundaries is most shamefulSuch an one has no face to show to any person and I was too ashamed to come His tears fell fast as he finished this speechCao Cao admired his loyal conduct and rewarded him with office of Governorship of Jiangxia and a title of Lordship and also bade him open the wayThe spies returned and said Liu Bei is hampered by the crowds of people who have followed him He can proceed only three or four miles daily and he is only one hundred miles away Cao Cao decided to take advantage of Liu Beis plight so he chose out five thousand of tried horsemen and sent them after the cavalcade giving them a limit of a day and a night to come up therewithThe main army would follow As has been said Liu Bei was traveling with a huge multitude of followers to guard whom he had taken what precautions were possibleZhang Fei was in charge of the rear guard and Zhao Yun was to protect his lords family Guan Yu had been sent to JiangxiaOne day Zhuge Liang came in and said There is as yet no news from Jiangxia there must be some difficulties I wish that you yourself would go there said Liu BeiLiu Qi would remember your former kindness to him and consent to anything you proposed Zhuge Liang said he would go and set out with Liu Feng the adopted son of Liu Bei taking an escort of five hundred troopsA few days after while on the march in company with three of his commandersJian Yong Mi Zhu and Mi Fanga sudden whirlwind rose just in front of Liu Bei and a huge column of dust shot up into the air hiding the face of the sun Liu Bei was frightened and asked What might that portend Jian Yong who knew something of the mysteries of nature took the auspices by counting secretly on his fingersPale and trembling he announced A calamity is threatening this very nightMy lord must leave the people to their fate and flee quickly I cannot do that said Liu BeiIf you allow your pity to overcome your judgment then misfortune is very near said Jian YongThus spoke Jian Yong to his lord who then asked what place was nearHis people replied Dangyang is quite close and there is a very famous mountain near it called Prospect Mountain Then Liu Bei bade them lead the way thitherThe season was late autumn just changing to winter and the icy wind penetrated to the very bones As evening fell longdrawn howls of misery were heard on every sideAt the middle of the fourth watch two hours after midnight they heard a rumbling sound in the northwestLiu Bei halted and placed himself at the head of his own guard of two thousand soldiers to meet whatever might comePresently Cao Caos men appeared and made fierce onslaught Defense was impossible though Liu Bei fought desperatelyBy good fortune just at the crisis Zhang Fei came up cut an arterial alley through rescued his brother and got him away to the east Presently they were stopped by Wen Ping Turncoat Can you still look humans in the face cried Liu BeiWen Ping was overwhelmed with shame and led his troops awayZhang Fei now fighting protected his brother till dawn By that time Liu Bei had got beyond the sound of battle and there was time to restOnly a few of his followers had been able to keep near him He knew nothing of the fate of his officers or the peopleHe lifted up his voice in lamentation saying Myriads of living souls are suffering from love of me and my officers and my loved ones are lostOne would be a graven image not to weep at such loss Still plunged in sadness presently he saw hurrying toward him Mi Fang with an enemys arrow still sticking in his face He exclaimed Zhao Yun has gone over to Cao Cao Liu Bei angrily bade him be silent crying Do you think I can believe that of my old friend Perhaps he has gone over said Zhang FeiHe must see that we are nearly lost and there are riches and honors on the other side He has followed me faithfully through all my misfortunes His heart is firm as a rockNo riches or honors would move him said Liu BeiI saw him go away northwest said Mi FangWait till I meet him said Zhang FeiIf I run against him I will kill him Beware how you doubt him said Liu Bei Have you forgotten the circumstances under which your brother Guan Yu had to slay Cai Yang to ease your doubts of himZhao Yuns absence is due to good reason wherever he has gone and he would never abandon me But Zhang Fei was not convincedThen he with a score of his men rode to the Long Slope BridgeSeeing a wood near the bridge an idea suddenly struck him He bade his followers cut branches from the trees tie them to the tails of the horses and ride to and fro so as to raise a great dust as though an army were concealed in the woodHe himself took up his station on the bridge facing the west with spear set ready for action So he kept watchNow Zhao Yun after fighting with the enemy from the fourth watch till daylight could see no sign of his lord and moreover had lost his lords family He thought bitterly within himself My master confided to me his family and the child lord Liu Shan and I have lost them How can I look him in the face I can only go now and fight to the deathWhatever happen I must go to seek the women and my lords son Turning about he found he had but some forty followers leftHe rode quickly to and fro among the scattered soldiers seeking the lost women The lamentations of the people about him were enough to make heaven and earth weepSome had been wounded by arrows others by spears they had thrown away their children abandoned their wives and were flying they knew not whither in crowdsPresently Zhao Yun saw a man lying in the grass and recognized him as Jian YongHave you seen the two mothers cried heJian Yong replied They left their carriage and ran away taking the child lord Liu Shan in their armsI followed but on the slope of the hill I was wounded and fell from my horse The horse was stolenI could fight no longer and I lay down here Zhao Yun put his colleague on the horse of one of his followers told off two soldiers to support Jian Yong and bade Jian Yong ride to their lord and tell him of the lossSay said Zhao Yun that I will seek the lost ones in heaven or hell through good or evil and if I find them not I will die in the desert Then Zhao Yun rode off toward the Long Slope BridgeAs he went a voice called out General Zhao Yun where are you going Who are you said Zhao Yun pulling up One of the Princely Ones carriage guardsI am wounded Do you know anything of the two ladies Not very long ago I saw the Lady Gan go south with a party of other womenHer hair was down and she was barefooted Hearing this without even another glance at the speaker Zhao Yun put his horse at full gallop toward the southSoon he saw a small crowd of people male and female walking hand in handIs Lady Gan among you he called outA woman in the rear of the party looked up at him and uttered a loud cryHe slipped off his steed stuck his spear in the sand and wept It was my fault that you were lostBut where are Lady Mi and our child lord Lady Gan replied She and I were forced to abandon our carriage and mingle with the crowd on foot Then a band of soldiers came up and we were separated I do not know where they areI ran for my life As she spoke a howl of distress rose from the crowd of fugitives for a thousand of soldiers appearedZhao Yun recovered his spear and mounted ready for action Presently he saw among the soldiers a prisoner bound upon a horse and the prisoner was Mi ZhuBehind Mi Zhu followed a general gripping a huge swordThe troops belonged to the army of Cao Ren and the general was Chunyu Dao Having captured Mi Zhu he was just taking him to his chief as a proof of his prowessZhao Yun shouted and rode at the captor who was speedily slain by a spear thrust and his captive was set freeThen taking two of the horses Zhao Yun set Lady Gan on one and Mi Zhu took the otherThey rode away toward Long Slope Bridge But there standing grim on the bridge was Zhang FeiAs soon as he saw Zhao Yun he called out Zhao Yun why have you betrayed our lord I fell behind because I was seeking the ladies and our child lord said Zhao YunWhat do you mean by talking of betrayal If it had not been that Jian Yong arrived before you and told me the story I should hardly have spared you Where is the master said Zhao YunNot far away in front there Conduct Lady Gan to him I am going to look for Lady Mi said Zhao Yun to his companion and he turned back along the road by which he had comeBefore long he met a leader armed with an iron spear and carrying a sword slung across his back riding a curvetting steed and leading ten other horsemenWithout uttering a word Zhao Yun rode straight toward him and engaged At the first pass Zhao Yun disarmed his opponent and brought him to earth His followers galloped awayThis fallen officer was no other than Xiahou En Cao Caos swordbearer And the sword on Xiahou Ens back was his mastersCao Cao had two swords one called Trust in God and the other Blue BladeTrust in God was the weapon Cao Cao usually wore at his side the other being carried by his swordbearerThe Blue Blade would cut clean through iron as though it were mud and no sword had so keen an edgeBefore Zhao Yun thus fell in with Xiahou En the later was simply plundering depending upon the authority implied by his officeLeast of all thought he of such sudden death as met he at Zhao Yuns hands So Zhao Yun got possession of a famous sword The name Blue Blade was chased in gold characters so that he recognized its value at once He stuck it in his belt and again plunged into the pressJust as he did so he turned his head and saw he had not a single follower left he was quite alone Nevertheless not for a single instant thought he of turning back he was too intent upon his questTo and fro back and forth he rode questioning this person and thatAt length a man said A woman with a child in her arms and wounded in the thigh so that she cannot walk is lying over there through that hole in the wall Zhao Yun rode to look and there beside an old well behind the broken wall of a burned house sat the mother clasping the child to her breast and weepingZhao Yun was on his knees before her in a momentMy child will live then since you are here cried Lady MiPity him O General protect him for he is the only son of his fathers flesh and bloodTake him to his father and I can die content It is my fault that you have suffered replied Zhao YunBut it is useless to say moreI pray you take my horse while I will walk beside and protect you till we get clear She replied I may not do thatWhat would you do without a steedBut the boy here I confide to your careI am badly wounded and cannot hope to livePray take him and go your wayDo not trouble more about me I hear shouting said Zhao Yun The soldiers will be upon us again in a momentPray mount quickly But really I cannot move she said Do not let there be a double loss And she held out the child toward him as she spokeTake the child cried Lady Mi His life and safety are in your hands Again and again Zhao Yun besought her to get on his horse but she would notThe shouting drew nearer and nearer Zhao Yun spoke harshly saying If you will not do what I say what will happen when the soldiers come up She said no moreThrowing the child on the ground she turned over and threw herself into the old well And there she perishedThe warrior relies upon the strength of his charger Afoot how could he bear to safety his young prince Brave motherWho died to preserve the son of her husbands line Heroine was she bold and decisive Seeing that Lady Mi had resolved the question by dying there was nothing more to be doneZhao Yun pushed over the wall to fill the well and thus making a grave for the ladyThen he loosened his armor let down the heartprotecting mirror and placed the child in his breast This done he slung his spear and remountedZhao Yun had gone but a short distance when he saw a horde of enemy led by Yan Ming one of Cao Hongs generals This warrior used a double edged three pointed weapon and he offered battleHowever Zhao Yun disposed of him after a very few bouts and dispersed his troopsAs the road cleared before him Zhao Yun saw another detachment barring his wayAt the head of this was a general exalted enough to display a banner with his name Zhang He of Hejian Zhao Yun never waited to parley but attackedHowever this was a more formidable antagonist and half a score bouts found neither any nearer defeat But Zhao Yun with the child in his bosom could only fight with the greatest caution and so he decided to fleeZhang He pursued and as Zhao Yun thought only of thrashing his steed to get away and little of the road suddenly he went crashing into a pitOn came his pursuer spear at poise Suddenly a brilliant flash of light seemed to shoot out of the pit and the fallen horse leapt with it into the air and was again on firm earthA bright glory surrounds the child of the imperial line now in danger The powerful charger forces his way through the press of battle Bearing to safety him who was destined to the throne two score years and two And the general thus manifested his godlike courageThis apparition frightened Zhang He who abandoned the pursuit forthwith and Zhao Yun rode offPresently he heard shouts behind Zhao Yun Zhao Yun stop and at the same time he saw ahead of him two generals who seemed disposed to dispute his way Ma Yan and Zhang Yi following and Jiao Chu and Zhang Nan in front his state seemed desperate but Zhao Yun quailed notAs the men of Cao Cao came pressing on Zhao Yun drew Cao Caos own sword to beat them offNothing could resist the Blue Blade Sword Armor clothing it went through without effort and blood gushed forth in fountains wherever it struckSo the four generals were soon beaten off and Zhao Yun was once again freeNow Cao Cao from a hilltop of the Prospect Mountain saw these deeds of derringdo and a general showing such valor that none could withstand him so Cao Cao asked of his followers whether any knew the manNo one recognized him so Cao Hong galloped down into the plain and shouted out We should hear the name of the warrior I am Zhao Yun of Changshan replied Zhao YunCao Hong returned and told his lord who said A very tiger of a leaderI must get him alive Whereupon he sent horsemen to all detachments with orders that no arrows were to be fired from an ambush at any point Zhao Yun should pass he was to be taken aliveAnd so Zhao Yun escaped most imminent danger and Liu Shans safety bound up with his saviors was also securedOn this career of slaughter which ended in safety Zhao Yun bearing in his bosom the child lord Liu Shan cut down two main banners took three spears and slew of Cao Caos generals half a hundred all men of renownBlood dyed the fighting robe and crimsoned his buff coat None dared engage the terrible warrior at Dangyang In the days of old lived the brave Zhao Yun Who fought in the battlefield for his lord in dangerHaving thus fought his way out of the press Zhao Yun lost no time in getting away from the battle field His white battle robe was soaked in bloodOn his way near the rise of the hills he met with two other bodies of troops under two brothers Zhong Jin and Zhong Shen One of these was armed with a massive ax the other a halberdAs soon as they saw Zhao Yun they knew him and shouted Quickly dismount and be bound He has only escaped from the tiger cave To risk the dragon pools sounding waveHow Zhao Yun escaped will be next related CHAPTER Screaming Zhang Fei Stops The Enemy At Long Slope Bridge Defeated Liu Bei Goes To Hanjin As related in the last chapter two generals appeared in front of Zhao Yun who rode at them with his spear ready for a thrustZhong Jin was leading flourishing his battleaxZhao Yun engaged and very soon unhorsed himThen Zhao Yun galloped away Zhong Shen rode up behind ready with his halberd and his horses nose got so close to the others tail that in Zhao Yun could see in his armor the reflection of the play of Zhong Shens weaponThen suddenly and without warning Zhao Yun wheeled round his horse so that he faced his pursuer and their two steeds struck breast to breastWith his spear in his left hand he warded off the halberd strokes and in his right he swung the Blue Blade Sword One slash and he had cut through both helmet and head Zhong Shen fell to the ground a corpse with only half a head on his bodyHis followers fled and Zhao Yun retook the road toward Long Slope Bridge But in his rear arose another tumultuous shouting seeming to rend the very sky and Wen Ping came up behindHowever although the man was weary and his steed spent Zhao Yun got close to the bridge where he saw standing all ready for any fray Zhang Fei Help me Zhang Fei he cried and crossed the bridgeHasten cried Zhang Fei I will keep back the pursuers About seven miles from the bridge Zhao Yun saw Liu Bei with his followers reposing in the shade of some treesHe dismounted and drew near weeping The tears also started to Liu Beis eyes when he saw his faithful commanderStill panting from his exertions Zhao Yun gasped out My faultdeath is too light a punishmentLady Mi was severely wounded she refused my horse and threw herself into a well She is dead and all I could do was to fill in the well with the rubbish that lay aroundBut I placed the babe in the breast of my fighting robe and have won my way out of the press of battleThanks to the little lords grand luck I have escapedAt first he cried a good deal but for some time now he has not stirred or made a soundI fear I may not have saved his life after all Then Zhao Yun opened his robe and looked the child was fast asleepHappily Sir your son is unhurt said Zhao Yun as he drew him forth and presented him in both handsLiu Bei took the child but threw it aside angrily saying To preserve that suckling I very nearly lost a great commander Zhao Yun picked up the child again and weeping said Were I ground to powder I could not prove my gratitude From out Cao Caos host a tiger rushed His wish but to destroy Though Liu Beis consort lost her life Zhao Yun preserved her boy Too great the risk you ran to save This child the father criedTo show he rated Zhao Yun high He threw his son asideWen Ping and his company pursued Zhao Yun till they saw Zhang Feis bristling mustache and fiercely glaring eyes before them There he was seated on his battle steed his hand grasping his terrible octaneserpent spear guarding the bridge They also saw great clouds of dust rising above the trees and concluded they would fall into an ambush if they ventured across the bridge So they stopped the pursuit not daring to advance furtherIn a little time Cao Ren Xiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Li Dian Yue Jin Zhang Liao Xu Chu Zhang He and other generals of Cao Cao came up but none dared advance frightened not only by Zhang Feis fierce look but lest they should become victims of a ruse of Zhuge LiangAs they came up they formed a line on the west side halting till they could inform their lord of the positionAs soon as the messengers arrived and Cao Cao heard about it he mounted and rode to the bridge to see for himselfZhang Feis fierce eye scanning the hinder position of the army opposite him saw the silken umbrella the axes and banners coming along and concluded that Cao Cao came to see for himself how matters stoodSo in a mighty voice he shouted I am Zhang Fei of Yan  who dares fight with me At the sound of this thunderous voice a terrible quaking fear seized upon Cao Cao and he bade them take the umbrella awayTurning to his followers he said Guan Yu had said that his brother Zhang Fei was the sort of man to go through an army of a hundred legions and take the head of its commanderinchief and do it easilyNow here is this terror in front of us and we must be careful As he finished speaking again that terrible voice was heard I am Zhang Fei of Yan who dares fight with me Cao Cao seeing his enemy so fierce and resolute was too frightened to think of anything but retreat and Zhang Fei seeing a movement going on in the rear once again shook his spear and roared What mean youYou will not fight nor do you run away This roar had scarcely begun when one of Cao Caos staff Xiahou Jie reeled and fell from his horse terrorstricken paralyzed with fearThe panic touched Cao Cao and spread to his whole surroundings and he and his staff galloped for their livesThey were as frightened as a suckling babe at a clap of thunder or a weak woodcutter at the roar of a tigerMany threw away their spears dropped their casques and fled a wave of panicstricken humanity a tumbling mass of terrified horses None thought of ought but flight and those who ran trampled the bodies of fallen comrades under foot Zhang Fei was wrathful and who dared To accept his challengeFierce he glared His thunderous voice rolled out and then In terror fled Cao Caos armed soldiersPanicstricken Cao Cao galloped westward with the rest thinking of nothing but getting away He lost his headdress and his loosened hair streamed behind himPresently Zhang Liao and Xu Chu came up with him and seized his bridle fear had deprived him of all selfcontrolDo not be frightened said Zhang LiaoAfter all Zhang Fei is but one man and not worthy of extravagant fearIf you will only return and attack you will capture your enemy That time Cao Cao had somewhat overcome his panic and become reasonable Two generals were ordered back to the bridge to reconnoiterZhang Fei saw the disorderly rout of the enemy but he dared not pursueHowever he bade his score or so of dustraising followers to cut loose the branches from their horses tails and come to help destroy the bridge This done he went to report to his brother and told him of the destruction of the bridgeBrave as you are Brother and no one is braver but you are no strategist said Liu Bei What mean you Brother Cao Cao is very deepYou are no match for himThe destruction of the bridge will bring him in pursuit If he ran away at a yell of mine think you he will dare return If you had left the bridge he would have thought there was an ambush and would not have dared to pass itNow the destruction of the bridge tells him we are weak and fearful and he will pursue He does not mind a broken bridgeHis legions could fill up the biggest rivers that we could get across So orders were given to march and they went by a byeroad which led diagonally to Hanjin by the road of MinyangThe two generals sent by Cao Cao to reconnoiter near Long Slope Bridge returned saying The bridge has been destroyed Zhang Fei has left Then he is afraid said Cao CaoCao Cao at once gave orders to set ten thousand men at work on three floating bridges to be finished that nightLi Dian said I fear this is one of the wiles of Zhuge Liang so be careful Zhang Fei is just a bold warrior but there is no guile about him said Cao Cao He gave orders for immediate advance Liu Bei was making all speed to HanjinSuddenly there appeared in his track a great cloud of dust whence came loud rolls of drums and shoutingsLiu Bei was dismayed and said Before us rolls the Great River behind is the pursuerWhat hope is there for us But he bade Zhao Yun organize a defenseNow Cao Cao in an order to his army had said Liu Bei is a fish in the fish kettle a tiger in the pitCatch him this time or the fish will get back to the sea and the tiger escape to the mountainsTherefore every general must use his best efforts to press on In consequence every leader bade those under him hasten forwardAnd they were pressing on at great speed when suddenly a body of soldiers appeared from the hills and a voice cried I have waited here a long time The leader who had shouted this bore in his hand the greendragon saber and rode the RedHare for indeed it was no other than Guan Yu He had gone to Jiangxia for help and had returned with a whole legion of ten thousand Having heard of the battle he had taken this very road to intercept pursuitAs soon as Guan Yu appeared Cao Cao stopped and said to his officers Here we are tricked again by that Zhuge Liang Without more ado he ordered a retreat Guan Yu followed him some three miles and then drew off to act as guard to his elder brother on his way to the river There boats were ready and Liu Bei and family went on boardWhen all were settled comfortably in the boat Guan Yu asked where was his sister the second wife of his brother Lady MiThen Liu Bei told him the story of Dangyang Alas said Guan YuHad you taken my advice that day of the hunting in Xutian we should have escaped the misery of this day But said Liu Bei on that day it was ware damaged when pelting rats Just as Liu Bei spoke he heard wardrums on the south bankA fleet of boats thick as a flight of ants came running up with swelling sails before the fair windHe was alarmedThe boats came nearer There Liu Bei saw the white clad figure of a man wearing a silver helmet who stood in the prow of the foremost shipThe leader cried Are you all right my uncle I am very guilty It was Liu QiHe bowed low as the ship passed saying I heard you were in danger from Cao Cao and I have come to aid you Liu Bei welcomed Liu Qi with joy and his soldiers joined in with the main body and the whole fleet sailed on while they told each other their adventuresUnexpectedly in the southwest there appeared a line of fighting ships swishing up before a fair wind Liu Qi said All my troops are here and now there is an enemy barring the wayIf they are not Cao Caos ships they must be from the South Land We have a poor chance What now Liu Bei went to the prow and gazed at themPresently he made out a figure in a turban and Taoist robe sitting in the bows of one of the boats and knew it to be Zhuge Liang Behind him stood Sun Qian When they were quite near Liu Bei asked Zhuge Liang how he came to be thereAnd he reported what he had done saying When I reached Jiangxia I sent Guan Yu to land at Hanjin with reinforcements for I feared pursuit from Cao Cao and knew that road you would take instead of JianglingSo I prayed your nephew to go to meet you while I went to Xiakou to muster as many soldiers as possible The newcomers added to their strength and they began once more to consider how their powerful enemy might be overcomeSaid Zhuge Liang Xiakou is strong and a good strategic point it is also rich and suited for a lengthy stayI would ask you my lord to make it a permanent campYour nephew can go to Jiangxia to get the fleet in order and prepare weapons Thus we can create two threatening angles for our positionIf we all return to Jiangxia the position will be weakened Liu Qi replied The Directing Instructors words are excellent but I wish rather my uncle stayed awhile in Jiangxia till the army was in thorough orderThen he could go to Xiakou You speak to the point Nephew replied Liu BeiThen leaving Guan Yu with five thousand troops at Xiakou he with Zhuge Liang and his nephew went to JiangxiaWhen Cao Cao saw Guan Yu with a force ready to attack he feared lest a greater number were hidden away behind so he stopped the pursuitHe also feared lest Liu Bei should take Jiangling so he marched thither with all hasteThe two officers in command at Jingzhou City Deng Yi and Liu Xian had heard of the death of their lord Liu Zong at Xiangyang and knowing that there was no chance of successful defense against Cao Caos armies they led out the people of Jingzhou to the outskirts and offered submissionCao Cao entered the city and after restoring order and confidence he released Han Song and gave him the dignified office of Director of Ambassadorial ReceptionsHe rewarded the othersThen said Cao Cao Liu Bei has gone to Jiangxia and may ally himself with the South Land and the opposition to me will be greater Can he be destroyed Xun You said The splendor of your achievements has spread wideTherefore you might send a messenger to invite Sun Quan to a grand hunting party at Jiangxia and you two could seize Liu Bei share Jingzhou with Sun Quan and make a solemn treatySun Quan will be too frightened not to come over to you and your end will be gained Cao Cao agreed He sent the letters by a messenger and he prepared his army horse and foot and marinesHe had in all eight hundred thirty thousand troops but he called them a million The attack was to be by land and water at the same time The fleet advanced up the river in two lines On the west it extended to Jingxia on the east to Qichun The stockades stretched one hundred miles The story of Cao Caos movements and successes reached Sun Quan then in camp at Chaisang He assembled his strategists to decide on a scheme of defenseLu Su said Jingzhou is contiguous to our borders It is strong and defensive its people are richIt is the sort of country that an emperor or a king should haveLiu Biaos recent death gives an excuse for me to be sent to convey condolence and once there I shall be able to talk over Liu Bei and the officers of the late Imperial Protector to combine with you against Cao CaoIf Liu Bei does as I wish then success is yours Sun Quan thought this a good plan so he had the necessary letters prepared and the gifts and sent Lu Su with themAll this time Liu Bei was at Jiangxia where with Zhuge Liang and Liu Qi he was endeavoring to evolve a good plan of campaignZhuge Liang said Cao Caos power is too great for us to cope with Let us go over to the South Land and ask help from Sun QuanIf we can set north and south at grips we ought to be able to get some advantage from our intermediate position between them But will they be willing to have anything to do with us said Liu BeiThe South Land is a large and populous country and Sun Quan has ambitions of his own Zhuge Liang replied Cao Cao with his army of a million holds the Han River and the Great River The South Land will certainly send to find out all possible about the positionShould any messenger come I shall borrow a little boat and make a little trip over the river and trust to my little lithe tongue to set north and south at each others throatsIf the south wins we will assist in destroying Cao Cao in order to get Jingzhou if the north wins we shall profit by the victory to get the South Land So we shall get some advantage either way That is a very fine view to take said Liu BeiBut how are you going to get hold of any one from the South Land to talk to Liu Beis question was answered by the arrival of Lu Su and as the ship touched the bank and the envoy came ashore Zhuge Liang laughed saying It is done Turning to Liu Qi he asked When Sun Ce died did your country send any condolences It is impossible there would be any mourning courtesies between them and us we had caused the death of his father Sun Jian Then it is certain that this envoy does not come to present condolences but to spy out the land So he said to Liu Bei When Lu Su asks about the movements of Cao Cao you will know nothingIf he presses the matter say he can ask me Having thus prepared their scheme they sent to welcome the envoy who entered the city in mourning garbThe gifts having been accepted Liu Qi asked Lu Su to meet Liu BeiWhen the introductory ceremonies were over the three men went to one of the inner chambers to drink a cup of wine Presently Lu Su said to Liu Bei By reputation I have known you a long time Uncle Liu Bei but till today I have not met youI am very gratified at seeing youYou have been fighting Cao Cao though lately so I suppose you know all about him Has he really so great an armyHow many do you think he has My army was so small that we fled whenever we heard of his approach so I do not know how many he had You had the advice of Zhuge Liang and you used fire on Cao Cao twiceYou burned him almost to death so that you can hardly say you know nothing about his soldiers said Lu SuWithout asking my adviser I really do not know the details Where is Zhuge LiangI should like to see him said Lu SuSo they sent for him and he was introducedWhen the ceremonies were over Lu Su said I have long admired your genius but have never been fortunate enough to meet youNow that I have met you I hope I may speak of present politics Replied Zhuge Liang I know all Cao Caos infamies and wickednesses but to my regret we were not strong enough to withstand himThat is why we avoided him Is the Imperial Uncle going to stay here The Princely One is an old friend of Wu Ju Governor of Changwu and intends to go to him Wu Ju has few troops and insufficient supplies he cannot ensure safety for himself How can he receive the Uncle said Lu SuChangwu is not one to remain in long but it is good enough for the presentWe can make other plans for the future Lu Su said Sun Quan is strongly posted in the six southern territories and is exceedingly well supplied He treats able people and scholars with the greatest courtesy and so they gather round himNow if you are seeking a plan for your Prince you cannot do better than send some friend to confer with him There have never been any relations between my master and yours said Zhuge Liang I fear there would be nothing but a waste of wordsBesides we have no one to send Your elder brother Zhuge Jin is there as adviser and is longing to see youI am but a simple wight but I should be pleased to discuss affairs with my master and you But Zhuge Liang is my Directing Instructor said Liu Bei and I cannot do without himHe cannot go Lu Su pressed him Liu Bei pretended to refuse permissionIt is important I pray you give me leave to go said Zhuge Liang Then Liu Bei consentedAnd they soon took leave and the two set out by boat for Sun Quans headquarters A little boat sailed down the stream With Zhuge Liang well content For he could see his enemies To fiery perdition sentThe result of this journey will appear in the following chapter CHAPTER  Zhuge Liang Disputes With The Scholars Of The South Land Lu Su Denounces The Majority Opinion In the boat on the way to Chaisang the two travelers beguiled the time by discussing affairsLu Su impressed upon his companion saying When you see my master do not reveal the truth about the magnitude of Cao Caos army You do not have to remind me replied Zhuge Liang but I shall know how to reply When the boat arrived Zhuge Liang was lodged in the guests quarters and Lu Su went alone to see his masterLu Su found Sun Quan actually at a council assembled to consider the situation Lu Su was summoned thereto and questioned at once upon what he had discoveredI know the general outline but I want a little time to prepare my report replied Lu SuThen Sun Quan produced Cao Caos letter and gave it to Lu Su That came yesterday I have sent the bearer of it back and this gathering is to consider the reply said heLu Su read the letterWhen I the Prime Minister received the imperial command to punish a fault my banners went south and Liu Zong became my prisoner while the people of Jingzhou flocked to my side at the first rumor of my comingUnder my hand are one million strong and a thousand able leaders My desire is General that we go on a great hunting expedition into Jiangxia and together attack Liu Bei We will share his land between us and we will swear perpetual amityIf happily you would not be a mere lookeron I pray you reply quickly What have you decided upon my lord asked Lu Su as he finished the letterI have not yet decided Then Zhang Zhao said It would be imprudent to withstand Cao Caos hundred legions backed by the imperial authorityMoreover your most important defense against him is the Great River and since Cao Cao has gained possession of Jingzhou the river is his ally against usWe cannot withstand him and the only way to tranquillity in my opinion is submission The words of the speaker accord with the manifest decree of providence echoed all the assemblySun Quan remaining silent and thoughtfulZhang Zhao again took up the argument saying Do not hesitate my lordSubmission to Cao Cao means tranquillity to the people of the South Land and safety for the inhabitants of the six territories Sun Quan still remained silent his head bent in deep thoughtPresently he arose and paced slowly out at the door and Lu Su followed himOutside he took Lu Su by the hand saying What do you desire What they have all been saying is very derogatory to youA common person might submit you cannot WhyHow do you explain that If people like us servants submitted we would just return to our village and everything would go on as before If you submit whither will you goYou will be created a lord of some humble fief perhapsYou will have one carriage no more one saddle horse that is all Your retinue will be some ten Will you be able to sit facing the south and call yourself by the kingly title of the solitaryEach one in that crowd of hangerson is thinking for himself is purely selfish and you should not listen to them but take a line of your own and that quicklyDetermine to play a bold game Sun Quan sighed They all talk and talk they miss my point of viewNow you have just spoken of a bold game and your view is the same as mineSurely God has expressly sent you to meStill Cao Cao is now the stronger by all Yuan Shaos and Liu Biaos armies and he has possession of JingzhouI fear he is almost too powerful to contend with I have brought back with me Zhuge Liang the younger brother of our Zhuge JinIf you questioned him he would explain clearly Is Master SleepingDragon really here Really here in the guesthouse It is too late to see him todayBut tomorrow I will assemble my officials and you will introduce him to all my best After that we will debate the matter With these instructions Lu Su retiredNext day he went to the guesthouse and conveyed Sun Quans commands to the guest particularly saying When you see my master say nothing of the magnitude of Cao Caos army Zhuge Liang smiled saying I shall act as circumstances dictate you may be sure I shall make no mistakes Zhuge Liang was then conducted to where the high officers civil and military to the number of forty and more were assembledThey formed a dignified conclave as they sat in stately ranks with their tall headdresses and broad girdles Zhang Zhao sat at the head and Zhuge Liang first saluted him Then one by one he exchange the formal courtesies with them allThis done he took his seat in the guests chairThey on their part noted with interest Zhuge Liangs refined and elegant manner and his commanding figure thinking within themselves Here is a persuader fitted for discourse Zhang Zhao led the way in trying to bait the visitorHe said You will pardon the most insignificant of our official circle myself if I mention that people say you compare yourself with those two famous men of talent Guan Zhong and Yue YiIs there any truth in this To a trifling extent I have compared myself with them replied Zhuge LiangI have heard that Liu Bei made three journeys to visit you when you lived in retirement in your simple dwelling in the Sleeping Dragon Ridge and that when you consented to serve him he said he was as lucky as a fish in getting home to the ocean Then he desired to possess the region about JingzhouYet today all that country belongs to Cao CaoI should like to hear your account of all that Zhuge Liang thought This Zhang Zhao is Sun Quans first adviser and unless I can nonplus him I shall never have a chance with his master So he replied In my opinion the taking of the region around the Han River was as simple as turning over ones handBut my master Liu Bei is both righteous and humane and would not stoop to filching the possession of a member of his own house So he refused the offer of successionBut Liu Zong a stupid lad misled by specious words submitted to Cao Cao and fell victim to his ferocityMy master is in camp at Jiangxia but what his future plans may be cannot be divulged at present Zhang Zhao said Be it so but your words and your deeds are something discordant You say you are the equal of the two famous onesWell Guan Zhong as minister of Prince Huan put his master at the very head of the feudal nobles making his masters will supreme in all the landUnder the able statesmanship of Yue Yi the feeble state of Yan conquered Qi reducing nearly eighty of its cities These two were men of most commanding and conspicuous talentWhen you lived in retirement you smiled scornfully at ordinary people passed your days in idleness nursing your knees and posing in a superior manner implying that if you had control of affairs Liu Bei would be more than human he should bring good to everybody and remove all evil rebellion and robbery would be no morePoor Liu Bei before he obtained your help was an outcast and a vagabond stealing a city here and there where he couldWith you to help him he was to become the cynosure of every eye and every lisping school child was to say that he was a tiger who had grown wings the Hans were to be restored and Cao Cao and his faction exterminated the good old days would be restored and all the people who had been driven into retirement by the corruption of political life would wake up rub the sleep out of their eyes and be in readiness to lift the cloud of darkness that covered the sky and gaze up at the glorious brilliancy of the sun and moon to pull the people out of fire and water and put all the world to rest on a couch of comfort That was all supposed to happen forthwithWhy then when you went to Xinye did not Cao Caos army throw aside their arms and armors and flee like ratsWhy could you not have told Liu Biao how to give tranquillity to his people Why could you not aid his orphan son to protect his frontiersInstead you abandoned Xinye and fled to Fankou you were defeated at Dangyang and fled to Xiakou with no place to rest in Thus after you had joined Liu Bei he was worse off than beforeWas it thus with Guan Zhong and Yue YiI trust you do not mind my blunt speech Zhuge Liang waited till Zhang Zhao had closed his oration then laughed and said How can the common birds understand the long flight of the cranesLet me use an illustration A man has fallen into a terrible malady First the physician must administer hashish then soothing drugs until his viscera shall be calmed into harmonious actionWhen the sick mans body shall have been reduced to quietude then may he be given strong meats to strengthen him and powerful drugs to correct the disorder Thus the disease will be quite expelled and the man restored to healthIf the physician does not wait till the humors and pulse are in harmony but throws in his strong drugs too early it will be difficult to restore the patientMy master suffered defeat at Runan and went to Liu Biao He had then less than one thousand soldiers and only three generalsGuan Yu Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun That was indeed a time of extreme weakness Xinye was a secluded rustic town with few inhabitants and scanty supplies and my master only retired there as a temporary refugeHow could he even think of occupying and holding it Yet with insufficient force in a weak city with untrained men and inadequate supplies we burned Xiahou Dun at Bowang Slope drowned Cao Ren and Cao Hong and their army in the White River and set them in terror as they fled I doubt whether the two ancient heroes would have done any betterAs to the surrender of Liu Zong Liu Bei knew nothing of itAnd he was too noble and too righteous to take advantage of a kinsmans straits to seize his inheritance As for the defeat at Dangyang it must be remembered that Liu Bei was hampered with a huge voluntary following of common people with their aged relatives and their children whom he was too humane to abandon He never thought of taking Jiangling but willingly suffered with his people This is a striking instance of his magnanimitySmall forces are no match for large armies Victory and defeat are common episodes in every campaignThe great Founder of the Hans suffered many defeats at the hands of Xiang Yu but Liu Bang finally conquered at Gaixia and that battle was decisiveWas not this due to the strategy of Han Xin who though he had long served his master Liu Bang had never won a victoryIndeed real statesmanship and the restoration of stable government is a master plan far removed from the vapid discourses and debates of a lot of bragging babblers and specious and deceitful talkers who as they themselves say are immeasureably superior to the rest of humankind but who when it comes to deeds and decisions to meet the infinite and constant vicissitudes of affairs fail to throw up a single capable personTruly such people are the laughing stock of all the world Zhang Zhao found no reply to this diatribeBut another in the assembly lifted up his voice saying But what of Cao Caos present position There he is encamped with one hundred legions and a thousand leaders Whither he goes he is invincible as wriggling dragon and whither he looks he is as fearsome as roaring tigerHe seems to have taken Jiangxia already as we see The speaker was Yu Fan and Zhuge Liang replied Cao Cao has acquired the swarms of Yuan Shao and stolen the crowds of Liu BiaoYet I care not for all his mob legions Yu Fan smiled icily saying When you got thrashed at Dangyang and in desperation sent this way and that to ask help even then did you not careBut do you think big talk really takes people in Zhuge Liang replied Liu Bei had a few thousand of scrupulous soldiers to oppose to a million of fierce brutesHe retired to Xiakou for breathing spaceThe South Land have strong and good soldiers and there are ample supplies and the Great River is a defense Is now a time for you to convince your lord to bend the knee before a renegade to be careless of his honor and reputationAs a fact Liu Bei is not the sort of man to fear such a rebel as Cao Cao Yu Fan had nothing to replyNext Bu Zhi who was among those seated said Will you talk of our southern land with a tongue like the tongues of the persuaders Zhang Yi and Su Qin in the ancient time  Zhuge Liang replied You regard those two as mere speculative talkers you do not recognize them also as heroesSu Qin bore the Prime Ministers seals of six federated states Zhang Yi was twice Prime Minister of the state of Qin Both were men of conspicuous ability who brought about the reformation of their governments They are not to be compared with those who quail before the strong and overbear the weak who fear the dagger and run away from the swordYou Sir have listened to Cao Caos crafty and empty threat and it has frightened you into advising surrender Dare you ridicule Su Qin and Zhang Yi Bu Zhi was silencedThen suddenly another interjected the question What do you think of Cao Cao It was Xue Zong who had spoken and Zhuge Liang replied Cao Cao is one of the rebels against the dynasty why ask about him You are mistaken said Xue ZongThe Hans have outlasted their allotted time and the end is nearCao Cao already has twothirds of the empire and people are turning to himYour master has not recognized the fateful moment and to contend with a man so strong is to try to smash stones with eggsFailure is certain Zhuge Liang angrily replied Why do you speak so undutiful words as if you knew neither father nor princeLoyalty and filial duty are the essentials of a persons beingFor a minister of Han correct conduct demands that one is pledged to the destruction of any one who does not follow the canon of a ministers dutyCao Caos forbears enjoyed the bounty of Han but instead of showing gratitude he nourishes in his bosom thoughts of rebellion The whole world is incensed against him and yet you would claim for him the indication of destinyTruly you are a man who knows neither father nor prince a man unworthy of any words and I decline to argue with you farther The blush of shame overspread Xue Zongs face and he said no moreBut another Lu Ji took up the dispute and said Although Cao Cao overawes the Emperor and in his name coerces the nobles yet he is the descendant of the Supreme Ancestors Prime Minister Cao Shen while your master though he says he is descended from a prince has no proof thereofIn the eyes of the world Liu Bei is just a weaver of mats a seller of straw shoesWho is he to strive with Cao Cao Zhuge Liang laughed and replied Are you not that Lu Ji who pocketed the orange when you were sitting among Yuan Shus guests Listen to me I have a word to say to youInasmuch as Cao Cao is a descendant of a minister of state he is by heredity a servant of the HansBut now he has monopolized all state authority and knows only his own arbitrary will heaping every indignity upon his lord Not only does he forget his prince but he ignores his ancestors not only is he a rebellious servant of Han but the renegade of his familyLiu Bei of Yuzhou  is a noble scion of the imperial family upon whom the Emperor has conferred rank as is recorded in the annals How then can you say there is no evidence of his imperial originBeside the very founder of the dynasty was himself of lowly origin and yet he became emperorWhere is the shame in weaving mats and selling shoesYour mean immature views are unfit to be mentioned in the presence of scholars of standing This put a stop to Lu Jis flow of eloquenceBut another of those present said Zhuge Liangs words are overbearing and he distorts reason It is not proper argument and he had better say no moreBut I would ask him what classical canon he studied Zhuge Liang looked at his interlocutor who was Yan Jun and said The dryasdusts of every age select passages and choose phrases what else are they good for Do they ever initiate a policy or manage an affairYi Yin who was a farmer in the state of Shen and Lu Wang the fisherman of the River Wei Zhang Liang and Chen Ping Zheng Yu and Geng Yanall were men of transcendent ability but I have never inquired what classical canon they followed or on whose essays they formed their styleWould you liken them to your rusty students of books whose journeyings are comprised between their brush and their inkstone who spend their days in literary futilities wasting both time and ink No reply was forthcoming Yan Jun hung his head with shameBut another disputant Cheng Deshu by name suddenly shouted You are mightily fond of big words Sir but they do not give any proof of your scholarship after allI am inclined to think that a real scholar would just laugh at you Zhuge Liang replied There is the noble scholar loyal and patriotic of perfect rectitude and a hater of any crookednessThe concern of such a scholar is to act in full sympathy with his day and leave to future ages a fine reputationThere is the scholar of the mean type a pedant and nothing more He labors constantly with his pen in his callow youth composing odes and in hoary age still striving to understand the classical books completelyThousands of words flow from his pen but there is not a solid idea in his breastHe may as did Yang Xiong glorify the age with his writings and yet stoop to serve a tyrant such as Wang Mang No wonder Yang Xiong threw himself out of a window he had to That is the way of the scholar of mean typeThough he composes odes by the hundred what is the use of him Cheng Deshu could make no reply The other officers now began to hold this man of torrential speech in wholesome fearOnly two of them Zhang Wen and Luo Tong had failed to challenge him but when they would have tried to pose Zhuge Liang suddenly some one appeared from without and angrily shouted This is not paying fit respect to a guestYou have among you the most wonderful man of the day and you all sit there trying to entangle him in speech while our archenemy Cao Cao is nearing our bordersInstead of discussing how to oppose Cao Cao you are all wrangling and disputing All eyes turned toward the speaker it was Huang Gai of Lingling who was the Chief of the Commissariat of the South LandHe turned to address Zhuge Liang saying There is a saying that though something may be gained by talk there is more to be got by silenceWhy not give my lord the advantage of your valuable advice instead of wasting time in discussion with this crowd They did not understand replied Zhuge Liang and it was necessary to enlighten them so I had to speak As Huang Gai and Lu Su led the guest toward their masters apartments they met his brother Zhuge JinZhuge Liang saluted him with the deference due to an elder brother and Zhuge Jin said Why have you not been to see me Brother I am now in the service of Liu Bei of Yuzhou and it is right that public affairs precede private obligationsI cannot attend to any private matters till my work is doneYou must pardon me Brother After you have seen Marquis Sun Quan you will come and tell me your news said he as he leftAs they went along to the audience chamber Lu Su again cautioned Zhuge Liang against any rash speech saying Do not tell the magnitude of Cao Caos forces please remember The latter nodded but made no other replyWhen they reached the hall Sun Quan came down the steps to welcome his guests and was extraordinarily graciousAfter the mutual salutations the guest was given a chair while the Marquis officials were drawn up in two lines on one side the civil on the other the militaryLu Su stood beside Zhuge Liang and listened to his introductory speech As Zhuge Liang spoke of Liu Beis intentions he glanced up at his hostHe noted the green eyes and red beard and the dignified commanding air of the man and thought within himself Certainly in appearance this is no common man He is one to be incited perhaps but not to be persuadedIt will be better to see what he has to say first then I will try to stir him to action The serving of tea being now finished Sun Quan began with the usual gracious ceremonial expressions Lu Su has often spoken of your genius said the host it is a great pleasure to meet youI trust you will confer upon me the advantage of your instruction I am neither clever nor learned was the reply it humiliates me to hear such words You have been at Xinye lately and you helped your master to fight that decisive battle with Cao Cao so you must know exactly the measure of his military strength My masters army was small and his generals were few the city was paltry and lacked suppliesHence no stand could be made against such a force as Cao Cao had How many has he in all Horse and foot land and marine he has a million Is there not some doubt about that said Sun Quan surprisedNone whatever when Cao Cao went to Yanzhou he had the two hundred thousand soldiers of QingzhouHe gained five or six hundred thousand more when Yuan Shao fellHe has three or four hundred thousand troops newly recruited in the capitalLately he has acquired two or three hundred thousand troops in Jingzhou And if these be reckoned up the total is not less than a million and a halfHence I said a million for I was afraid of frightening your officers Lu Su was much disturbed and turned paleHe looked meaningfully at the bold speaker but Zhuge Liang would not see Sun Quan went on to ask if his archenemy had a corresponding number of leadersCao Cao has enough administrators and strategists to control such a host and his capable and veteran leaders are more than a thousand perhaps more than two thousand What will be Cao Caos next move now that he has overcome Jingzhou He is camped along the river and he has collected a fleetIf he does not intend to invade the South Land what can be his intentions Since that is his intention it is a case of fight or not fightI wish you would decide that for me I have something I could say but I fear Sir you would not care to hear it I am desirous of hearing your most valuable opinion Strife has prevailed for a long time and so you have raised your army in the South Land and Liu Bei collected his forces south of the Han River to act in contest for the empire against Cao CaoNow Cao Cao has overcome most of his difficulties and his recent conquest of Jingzhou has won him great and wide renownThough there might be one bold enough to tackle him yet there is no foothold for such That is how Liu Bei has been forced to come hereBut General I wish you to measure your forces and decide whether you can venture to meet Cao Cao and that without loss of timeIf you cannot then follow the advice of your councilors cease your military preparations and yield turn your face to the north and serve Sun Quan did not reply But his guest went on You have the reputation of being reasonable but I know also you are inclined to hesitateStill this matter is most important and evil will be quickly upon you if you do not decide Then replied Sun Quan If what you say represents the actual conditions why does not Liu Bei yield Well you know Tian Heng that hero of the state of Qi his character was too noble for him to submit to any shameIt is necessary to remember that Liu Bei also is an offshoot from the Dynastic Family beside being a man of great renown Every one looks up to himHis lack of success is simply the will of Heaven but manifestly he could not bow the knee to any one These last words touched Sun Quan to the quick and he could not control his anger He shook out his sleeves rose and left the audience chamber Those present smiled at each other as they dispersedBut Lu Su was annoyed and reproached Zhuge Liang for his maladroit way of talking to Sun Quan saying Luckily for you my lord is too largeminded to rebuke you to your face for you spoke to him most contemptuously Zhuge Liang threw back his head and laughed What a sensitive fellow it is cried heI know how Cao Cao could be destroyed but he never asked me so I said nothing If you really do know how that could be done I will certainly beg my lord to ask you Cao Caos hosts in my eyes are but as swarms of ants I have but to lift my hand and they will be crushed said Zhuge LiangLu Su at once went into his masters private room where he found Sun Quan still very irritable and angryZhuge Liang insulted me too deeply said Sun QuanI have already reproached him said Lu Su and he laughed and said you were too sensitive He would not give you any advice without being asked for itWhy did you not seek advice from him my lord At once Sun Quans anger changed to joyHe said So he had a plan ready and his words were meant to provoke meI did despise him for a moment and it has very nearly lost me So Sun Quan returned to the audience chamber where the guest was still seated and begged Zhuge Liang to continue his speechSun Quan spoke courteously saying I offended you just now I hope you are not implacable And I also was rude replied Zhuge LiangI entreat pardon Host and guest retired to the inner room where wine was servedAfter it had gone round several times Sun Quan said The enemies of Cao Cao were Lu Bu Liu Biao Yuan Shao Yuan Shu Liu Bei and my poor selfNow most of these are gone and only Liu Bei and I remainI will never allow the land of Wu to be dictated to by anotherThe only one who could have withstood Cao Cao was Liu Bei but he has been defeated lately and what can he do now against such force Zhuge Liang replied Although defeated Liu Bei still has Guan Yu with ten thousand veteransAnd Liu Qi still leads the troops of Jiangxia another ten thousandCao Caos army is far from home and the soldiers are worn outThey made a frantic effort to come up with my master and the light horse marched one hundred miles in a day and a night This was the final kick of the crossbow spring and the bolt was not swift enough to penetrate even the thin silken vesture of Lu The army can do no moreThey are northern people unskilled in water warfare and the people of Jingzhou are unwilling supporters They have no desire to help Cao Cao Now if you General will assist Liu Bei Cao Cao will certainly be broken and he must retire northwardsThen your country and Jingzhou will be strong and the tripod will be firmly establishedBut the scheme must be carried out without delay and only you can decide Sun Quan joyfully replied Your words Master open up the road clearlyI have decided and shall have no further doubts So the orders were issued forthwith to prepare for a joint attack on Cao CaoAnd Sun Quan bade Lu Su bear the news of his decision to all his officers He himself escorted Zhuge Liang to the guestquarters and saw to his comfortWhen Zhang Zhao heard of the decision he met his colleagues and said to them Our master has fallen into the trap set by this Zhuge Liang They went in a body to their lord and said We hear you are going to attack Cao Cao but how do you stand when compared with Yuan ShaoIn those days Cao Cao was comparatively weak and yet he overcameWhat is he like today with his countless legionsHe is not to be lightly attacked and to listen to Zhuge Liangs advice to engage in a conflict is like carrying fuel to a fire Sun Quan made no reply and Gu Yong took up the argumentGu Yong said Liu Bei has been defeated and he wants to borrow our help to beat his enemy Why must our lord lend himself to his schemesPray listen to our leaders words Doubts again surged up in the mind of Sun QuanWhen the troop of advisers had retired Lu Su came in saying They came to exhort you not to fight but to compel you to surrender simply because they wish to secure the safety of their familiesThey distort their sense of duty to serve their own ends and I hope you will not take their advice Sun Quan being sunk in thought and saying nothing Lu Su went on If you hesitate you will certainly be led astray by the majority and Retire for a time said his masterI must think it over carefully So Lu Su left the chamberAmong the soldiers some wished for war but of the civil officers all were in favor of surrender and so there were many discussions and much conflict of opinionSun Quan went to his private apartments greatly perplexed There his worry was easily discernible and he neither ate nor slept He was quite unable to decide finally upon a course of actionThen Lady Wu the sister of his late mother whom he also regarded as his own mother asked him what so troubled him and he told her of the threatened danger of Cao Cao and the different opinions his advisers held one and another and all his doubts and fearsIf I fight I might fail and if I offer to surrender perhaps Cao Cao will reject my proposal said heThen she replied Have you forgotten the last words of my sister As to one recovering from a fit of drunkenness or waking out of a dream so came to him the dying words of the mother who bore himHis mothers advice he called to mind In Zhou Yus counsels you safety find What happened will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER  Zhuge Liang Stirs Zhou Yu To Actions Sun Quan Decides To Attack Cao CaoThe dying message which Lady Wu recalled to Sun Quans memory was For internal matters consult Zhang Zhao for external policy Zhou Yu Wherefore Zhou Yu was summoned But Zhou Yu was already on the wayHe had been training his naval forces on Poyang Lake when he heard of the approach of Cao Caos hosts and had started for Chaisang without loss of timeSo before the messenger ordered to call him could start he had already arrivedAs he and Lu Su were close friends the latter went to welcome him and told him of all that had happenedHave no anxiety said Zhou Yu I shall be able to decide thisBut go quickly and beg Zhuge Liang to come to see me So Lu Su went to seek out Zhuge LiangZhou Yu had many other visitorsFirst came Zhang Zhao Zhang Hong Gu Yong and Bu Zhi to represent their faction to find out what might be afootThey were received and after the exchange of the usual commonplaces Zhang Zhao said Have you heard of our terrible danger I have heard nothing said Zhou YuCao Cao and his hordes are encamped up the Han River He has just sent letters asking our lord to hunt with him in JiangxiaHe may have a desire to absorb this country but if so the details of his designs are still secretWe prayed our master to give in his submission and so avoid the horrors of war but now Lu Su has returned bringing with him the Directing Instructor of Liu Beis army Zhuge Liang Zhuge Liang desiring to avenge himself for the recent defeat has talked our lord into a mind for war and Lu Su persists in supporting that policyThey only await your final decision Are you all unanimous in your opinions We are perfectly unanimous said Zhang ZhaoZhou Yu said The fact is I have also desired to submit for a long timeI beg you to leave me now and tomorrow we will see our master and I shall make up his mind for him So they took their leaveVery soon came the military party led by Cheng Pu Huang Gai and Han DangThey were admitted and duly inquired after their hosts healthThen the leader Cheng Pu said Have you heard that our country is about to pass under anothers government No I have heard nothing replied the hostWe helped General Sun Quan to establish his authority here and carve out this kingdom and to gain that end we fought many a battle before we conquered the countryNow our lord lends his ear to his civil officers and desires to submit himself to Cao CaoThis is a most shameful and pitiful course and we would rather die than follow it so we hope you will decide to fight and you may depend upon our struggling to the last person And are you unanimous Generals asked Zhou YuHuang Gai suddenly started up and smote his forehead saying They may take my head but I swear never to surrender Not one of us is willing to surrender cried all the othersMy desire also is to decide matters with Cao Cao on the battlefield How could we think of submissionNow I pray you retire Generals and when I see our lord I will settle his doubts So the war party leftThey were quickly succeeded by Zhuge Jin Lu Fan and their factionThey were brought in and after the usual courtesies Zhuge Jin said My brother has come down the river saying that Liu Bei desires to ally himself with our lord against Cao CaoThe civil and military hold different opinions as to the course to be pursued but as my brother is so deeply concerned I am unwilling to say much on either sideWe are awaiting your decision And what do you think about it asked Zhou YuSubmission is an easy road to tranquillity while the result of war is hard to foretell Zhou Yu smiled I shall have my mind made upCome tomorrow to the palace and the decision shall be announced The trimmers took their leaveBut soon after came Lu Meng Gan Ning and their supporters also desirous of discussing the same thing and they told him that opinions differed greatly some being for peace and others for war One party constantly disputed with the otherI must not say much now replied Zhou Yu but you will see tomorrow in the palace when the matter will be fully debated They went away leaving Zhou Yu smiling cynicallyAbout eventide Lu Su and Zhuge Liang came and Zhou Yu went out to the main gate to receive themWhen they had taken their proper seats Lu Su spoke first saying Cao Cao has come against the South Land with a huge army Our master cannot decide whether to submit or give battle and waits for your decisionWhat is your opinion Zhou Yu replied We may not oppose Cao Cao when he acts at the command of the EmperorMoreover he is very strong and to attack him is to take serious risksIn my opinion opposition would mean defeat and since submission means peace I have decided to advise our lord to write and offer surrender But you are wrong stammered Lu SuThis country has been under the same rule for three generations and cannot be suddenly abandoned to some otherOur late lord Sun Ce said that you were to be consulted on matters beyond the border and we depended upon you to keep the country as secure and solid as the Taishan Mountains Now you adopt the view of the weaklings and propose to yieldI cannot believe you mean it Replied Zhou Yu The six territories contain countless peopleIf I am the means of bringing upon them the misery of war they will hate meSo I have decided to advise submission But do you not realize our lords might and the strength of our countryIf Cao Cao does attack it is very uncertain that he will realize his desire The two wrangled for a long time while Zhuge Liang sat smiling with folded armsPresently Zhou Yu asked Why do you smile thus Master And Zhuge Liang replied I am smiling at no other than your opponent Lu Su who knows nothing of the affairs of the day Master said Lu Su what do you mean Why this intention to submit is perfectly reasonable it is the one proper thing There exclaimed Zhou YuZhuge Liang knows the times perfectly well and he agrees with me But both of you why do you say this said Lu SuSaid Zhuge Liang Cao Cao is an excellent commander so good that no one dares oppose him
