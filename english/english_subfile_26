While Nakulas father the householder was being exhorted by Nakulas mother with this exhortation his disease was immediately allayedAnd he recovered from his diseaseThat was how Nakulas fathers disease

early in the morning Upacala the nun put on her robes and taking her bowl  outer robe went into Savatthi for almsWhen she had gone for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the dayHaving gone deep into the Grove of the Blind she sat down at the foot of a tree for the days abidingThen Mara the Evil One wanting to arouse fear horripilation  terror in her wanting to make her fall from solitude approached her  said Where do you want to reappear nunI dont want to reappear anywhere my friendThen Mara the Evil One  sad  dejected at realizing Upacala the nun knows me  vanished right thereThen VenSariputta went to the residence of the householder Anathapindika with VenAnanda as his attendantOn arrival he sat down on a prepared seat and said to the householder Anathapindika I hope you are getting better householderI hope you are comfortableI hope that your pains are lessening and not increasingI hope that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasingI am not getting better venerable sirI am not comfortableMy extreme pains are increasing not lesseningThere are signs of their increasing and not of

turban made of tough leather straps around my head Extreme forces carve up my stomach cavity just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox There is an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embersI am not getting better venerable sirI am not comfortableMy extreme

train yourselfWhen this was said the householder Anathapindika wept and shed tearsVenAnanda said to him Are you sinking householderAre you founderingNo venerable sirIm not sinking nor am I founderingIts just that for a long time I have attended to the Teacher and to the monks who inspire my heart but never before have I heard this sort of talk on the DhammaThis sort of talk on the Dhamma householder is not given to lay people clad in whiteThis sort of talk on the Dhamma is given to those gone forthIn that case VenSariputta please let this sort of talk on the Dhamma be given to lay people clad in whiteThere are clansmen with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing DhammaThere will be those who will understand itThen VenSariputta and VenAnanda having given this instruction to the householder Anathapindika got up from their seats and leftThen not long after they left the householder Anathapindika died and reappeared in the Tusita heavenOnce the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen King Pasenadi the Kosalan went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideNow at that time Queen Mallika diedThen a certain man went to the king and whispered in his ear Your majesty Queen Mallika has died When this was said King Pasenadi the Kosalan sat there miserable sick at heart his shoulders drooping his face down brooding at a loss for wordsThen the Blessed One saw the king sitting there miserable sick at heart at a loss for words and so said to him There are these five things great king that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a Mara a Brahma or anyone at all in the worldWhich fiveMay what is subject to aging not age This is something that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a Mara a Brahma or anyone at all in the worldMay what is subject to illnes not grow ill This is something that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a Mara a Brahma or anyone at all in the worldMay what is subject to death not die This is something that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a Mara a Brahma or anyone at all in the worldMay what is subject to ending not end This is something that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a Mara a Brahma or anyone at all in the worldMay what is subject to destruction not be destroyed This is something that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a Mara a Brahma or anyone at all in the worldNow it happens to an uninstructed runofthemill person that something that is subject to aging agesWith the aging of what is subject to aging he does not reflect It doesnt happen only to me that what is subject to aging will ageTo the extent that there are beings  past  future passing away  rearising  it happens to all of them that what is subject to aging will ageAnd if with the aging of what is subject to aging I were to sorrow grieve lament beat my breast  become distraught food would not agree with me my body would become unattractive my affairs would go untended my enemies would be gratified and my friends unhappy So with the aging of what is subject to aging he sorrows grieves laments beats his breast  becomes distraughtThis is called an uninstructed runofthemill person pierced by the poisoned arrow of sorrow tormenting himselfFurthermore it happens to an uninstructed runofthemill person that something that is subject to illness grows ill that something subject to death dies that something subject to ending ends that something subject to destruction is destroyedWith the destruction of what is subject to destruction he does not reflect It doesnt happen only to me that what is subject to destruction will be destroyedTo the extent

and my friends unhappy So with the destruction of what is subject to destruction he sorrows grieves laments beats his breast  becomes distraughtThis is called an uninstructed runofthemill person pierced by the poisoned arrow of sorrow tormenting himselfNow it happens to a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones that something that is subject to aging agesWith the aging of what is subject to aging he reflects It doesnt happen only to me that what is subject to aging will ageTo the extent that there are beings  past  future passing away  rearising  it happens to all of them that what is subject to aging will ageAnd if with the aging of what is subject to aging I were to sorrow grieve lament beat my breast  become distraught food would not agree with me my body would become unattractive my affairs would go untended my enemies would be gratified and my friends unhappy So with the aging of what is subject to aging he does not sorrow grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraughtThis is called a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones who has pulled out the poisoned arrow of sorrow pierced with which the uninstructed runofthemill person torments himselfSorrowless arrowless the disciple of the noble ones is totally unbound right within himselfFurthermore it happens to a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones that something that is subject to illness grows ill that something subject to death dies that something subject to ending ends that something subject to destruction is destroyedWith the destruction of what is subject to destruction

grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraughtThis is called a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones who has pulled out the poisoned arrow of sorrow pierced with which the uninstructed runofthemill person torments himselfSorrowless arrowless the disciple of the noble ones is totally unbound right within himselfThese are the five things great king that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a Mara a Brahma or anyone at all in the worldNow at that time a dear and beloved grandson of Visakha Migaras mother had diedSo Visakha Migaras mother  her clothes wet her hair wet  went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her Why have you come here Visakha  your clothes wet your hair wet  in the middle of the dayWhen this was said she said to the Blessed One My dear and beloved grandson has diedThis is why I have come here  my clothes wet my hair wet  in the middle of the dayVisakha would you like to have as many children and grandchildren as there are people in SavatthiYes lord I would like to have as many children and grandchildren as there are people in SavatthiBut how many people in Savatthi die in the course of a daySometimes ten people die in Savatthi in the course of a day sometimes nine eight seven six five four three two Sometimes one person dies in Savatthi in the course of a daySavatthi is never free from people dyingSo what do you think Visakha Would you ever be free from wet clothes and wet hairNo lordEnough of my having as many children and grandchildren as there are people in SavatthiVisakha those who have a hundred dear ones have a hundred sufferingsThose who have ninety dear ones have ninety sufferingsThose who have eighty seventy sixty fifty forty thirty twenty ten nine eight seven six five four three two Those who have one dear one have one sufferingFor those with no dear ones there are no sufferingsThey are free from sorrow free from stain free from lamentation I tell youThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow at that time VenSariputta was staying among the Magadhans in Nalaka village  diseased in pain severely illCunda the novice was his attendantThen because of that illness VenSariputta attained total UnbindingSo Cunda the novice taking VenSariputtas bowl  robes went to VenAnanda in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery near Savatthi and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenAnanda Venerable sir VenSariputta has attained total UnbindingHere are his bowl  robesCunda my friend this news is reason for seeing the Blessed OneCome lets go to the Blessed One and report this matter to himYes venerable sir Cunda the novice repliedSo VenAnanda  Cunda the novice went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there VenAnanda said to him Lord just now Cunda the novice said to me Venerable sir VenSariputta has attained total UnbindingHere are his bowl  robes It was as if my body were drugged I lost my bearings things werent clear to me on hearing that VenSariputta had attained total UnbindingBut Ananda when he attained total Unbinding did Sariputta take the aggregate of virtue along with himDid he take the aggregate of concentration discernment release the aggregate of knowledge  vision of release along with himNo lord when he attained total Unbinding VenSariputta didnt take the aggregate of virtue concentration discernment release the aggregate of knowledge  vision of release along with himIts just that he was my instructor  counselor one who exhorted urged roused  encouraged meHe was tireless in teaching the Dhamma a help to his companions in the holy lifeWe miss the nourishment of his Dhamma the wealth of his Dhamma his help in the DhammaBut Ananda havent I already taught you the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwiseWhat else is there to expectIts impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegratingJust as if the largest limb were to fall off of a great tree composed of heartwood standing firm in the same way Sariputta has attained total Unbinding from this great community of monks composed of heartwood standing firmWhat else is there to expectIts impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegratingTherefore Ananda each of you should remain with your self as an island your self as your refuge without anything else as a refugeRemain with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as your refuge without anything else as a refugeAnd how does a monk remain with his self as an island his self as his refuge without anything else as a refugeHow does he remain with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as his refuge without anything else as a refugeThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how a monk remains with his self as an island his self as his refuge without anything else as a refuge with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as his refuge without anything else as a refugeFor those who  now or after I am gone  remain with their self as an island their self as their refuge without anything else as a refuge with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as their refuge without anything else as a refuge they will be the highest of the monks who desire trainingOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen Rohitassa the son of a deva in the far extreme of the night his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to the Blessed One Is it possible lord by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappearI tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappearIt is amazing lord and awesome how well that has been said by the Blessed One I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear Once I was a seer named Rohitassa a student of Bhoja a powerful skywalkerMy speed was as fast as that of a strong archer  welltrained a practiced hand a practiced sharpshooter  shooting a light arrow across the shadow of a palm treeMy stride stretched as far as the east sea is from the westTo me endowed with such speed such a stride there came the desire I will go traveling to the end of the cosmos I  with a onehundred year life a onehundred year span  spent one hundred years traveling  apart from the time spent on eating drinking chewing  tasting urinating  defecating and sleeping to fight off weariness  but without reaching the end of the cosmos I died along the waySo it is amazing lord and awesome how well that has been said by the Blessed One I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappearBut at the same time I tell you that there is no making an end of suffering  stress without reaching the end of the cosmosYet it is just within this fathomlong body with its perception  intellect that I declare that there is the cosmos the origination of the cosmos the cessation of the cosmos and the path of practice leading to the cessation of the cosmosI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at IsipatanaThere he addressed the group of five monksThere are these two extremes that are not to be indulged in by one who has gone forthWhich twoThat which is devoted to sensual pleasure with reference to sensual objects base vulgar common ignoble unprofitable and that which is devoted to selfaffliction painful ignoble unprofitableAvoiding both of these extremes the middle way realized by the Tathagata  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingAnd what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingPrecisely this Noble Eightfold Path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationThis is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingNow this monks is the noble truth of stress Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressfulIn short the five clingingaggregates are stressfulAnd this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecomingAnd this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very cravingAnd this monks is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress precisely this Noble Eightfold Path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationVision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before This is the noble truth of stress This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended This noble truth of stress has been comprehendedVision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard

arose within me with regard to things never heard before This is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress has been developedAnd monks as long as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are present  was not pure I did not claim to have directly awakened to the right selfawakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolkBut as soon as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are present  was truly pure then I did claim to have directly awakened to the right selfawakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolkKnowledge  vision arose in me Unprovoked is my releaseThis is the last birthThere is now no further becoming That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the group of five monks delighted at his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given there arose to VenKondañña the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationNow what is the noble truth of stressBirth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is

stressfulForm as a clingingaggregate feeling as a clingingaggregate perception as a clingingaggregate fabrications as a clingingaggregate consciousness as a clingingaggregate These are called the five clingingaggregates that in short are stressfulThis is called the noble truth of stressThe Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the five aggregates  the five clingingaggregatesListen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Now what monks are the five aggregatesWhatever form is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common

appropriate wayA virtuous monk Kotthita my friend should attend in an appropriate way to the five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notselfWhich fiveForm as a clingingaggregate feeling perception fabrications consciousness as a clingingaggregateA virtuous monk should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notselfFor it is possible that a virtuous monk attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of streamentryThen which things should a monk who has attained streamentry attend to in an appropriate

alien a dissolution an emptiness notselfFor it is possible that a monk who has attained nonreturning attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of arahantshipThen which things should an arahant attend to in an appropriate wayAn arahant should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notselfAlthough for an arahant there is nothing further to do and nothing to add to what has been done still these things  when developed  pursued  lead both to a pleasant abiding in the herenow and to mindfulness  alertnessSuppose there were a householder or householders son  rich wealthy with many possessions  who was thoroughly wellguardedThen there came along a certain man desiring what was not his benefit desiring what was not his welfare desiring his loss of security desiring to kill himThe thought would occur to this man It would not be easy to kill this person by forceWhat if I were to sneak in and then kill himSo he would go to the householder or householders son and say May you take me on as a servant lord With that the householder or householders son would take the man on as a servantHaving been taken on as a servant the man would rise in the morning before his master go to bed in the evening only after his master doing whatever his master ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to himThen the householder or householders son would come to regard him as a friend  companion and would fall into his trustWhen the man realizes This householder or householders son trusts me then encountering him in a solitary place he would kill him with a sharp knifeNow what do you think my friend YamakaWhen that man went to the householder or householders son and said May you take me on as a servant lord wasnt he even then a murdererAnd yet although he was a murderer the householder or householders son did not know him as my murderer And when taken on as a servant he would rise in the morning before his master go to bed in the evening only after his master doing whatever his master ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him wasnt he even then a murdererAnd yet although he was a murderer the householder or householders son did not know him as my murderer And when he encountered him in a solitary place and killed him with a sharp knife wasnt he even then a murdererAnd yet although he was a murderer the householder or householders son did

their fellows in the holy life teaching them admonishing them out of sympathy desiring their welfareFor now that I have heard this explanation of the Dhamma from you my mind  through lack of clingingsustenance  has been released from the effluentsMonks suppose there were a river flowing down from the mountains going far its current swift carrying everything with it and  holding on to both banks  kasa grasses kusa grasses reeds birana grasses  trees were growingThen a man swept away by the current would grab hold of the kasa grasses but they would tear away and so from that cause he would come to disasterHe would grab hold of the kusa grasses the reeds the birana grasses the trees but they would tear away and so from that cause he would come to disasterIn the same way there is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formThat form tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disasterHe assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feelingThat feeling tears away from him and so from that cause he would come

him and so from that cause he would come to disasterHe assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThat consciousness tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disasterWhat do you think monks  Is form constant or inconstantInconstant lordAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful lordAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lordIs feeling constant or inconstantInconstant lordIs perception constant or inconstantInconstant lordAre fabrications constant or inconstantInconstant lordWhat do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstantInconstant lordAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful lordAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lordThus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling whatsoeverAny perception whatsoeverAny fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThen early in the morning Cala the nun put on her robes and taking her bowl  outer robe went into Savatthi for almsWhen she had gone for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the dayHaving gone deep into the Grove of the Blind she sat down at the foot of a tree for the days abidingThen Mara the Evil One wanting to arouse fear horripilation  terror in her wanting to make her fall from solitude approached her  said What is it that you dont approve of nunI dont approve of birth my friendThen Mara the Evil One  sad  dejected at realizing Cala the nun knows me  vanished right thereI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migaras motherNow on that occasion the Blessed One on emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon sat warming his back in the western sunThen VenAnanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One massaged the Blessed Ones limbs with his hand and said Its amazing lordIts astounding how the Blessed Ones complexion is no longer so clear  bright his limbs are flabby  wrinkled his back bent forward theres a discernible change in his faculties  the faculty of the eye the faculty of the ear the faculty of the nose the faculty of the tongue the faculty of the bodyThats the way it is AnandaWhen young one is subject to aging when healthy subject to illness when alive subject to deathThe complexion is no longer so clear  bright the limbs are flabby  wrinkled the back bent forward theres a discernible change in the faculties  the faculty of the eye the faculty of the ear the faculty of the nose the faculty of the tongue the faculty of the bodyThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One Wellgone the Teacher said furtherJanussonin I hold that there is no one who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of deathThe Buddha There are those who subject to death are afraid and in terror of deathAnd there are those who subject to death are not afraid or in terror of deathAnd who is the person who subject to death is afraid and in terror of deathThere is the case of the person who has not abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for sensualityWhen he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him O those beloved sensual pleasures will be taken from me and I will be taken from them He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows deliriousFurthermore there is the case of the person who has not abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for the bodyWhen he is touched by a serious disease the thought occurs to him O my beloved body will be taken from me and I will be taken from my body He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows deliriousFurthermore there is the case of the person who has not done what is good has not done what is skillful has not given protection to those in fear and instead has done what is evil savage and cruelWhen he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him After death I am headed for the destination of those who have done what is evil savage and cruel He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows deliriousFurthermore there is the case of the person in doubt and perplexity who has not arrived at certainty with regard to the True DhammaWhen he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him How doubtful and perplexed I amI have not arrived at any certainty with regard to the True Dhamma He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows deliriousThis is another person who subject to death is afraid and in terror of deathAnd who is the person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of deathThere is the case of the person who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for sensuality who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for the body who has done what is good what is skillful has given protection to those in fear and has not done what is evil savage or cruel who has no doubt or perplexity who has arrived at certainty with regard to the True DhammaWhen he comes down with a serious disease he does not grieve is not tormented does not weep or beat his breast or grow deliriousThis is another person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of deathGain arises for an uninstructed runofthemill personHe does not reflect Gain has arisen for meIt is inconstant stressful  subject to

the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing factor between the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones and the uninstructed runofthemill personIts through adversity that a persons endurance may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning Thus was it saidAnd in reference to what was it saidThere is the case where a person suffering loss of relatives loss of wealth or loss through disease does not reflect Thats how it is when living together in the worldThats how it is when gaining a personal identityWhen there is living in the world when there is the gaining of a personal identity these eight worldly conditions spin after the world and the world spins after these eight worldly conditions gain loss status disgrace censure praise pleasure  pain Suffering loss of relatives loss of wealth or loss through disease he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraughtAnd then there is the case where a person suffering loss of relatives loss of wealth or loss through disease reflects Thats how it is when living together in the

who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning Thus was it saidAnd in reference to this was it saidNow at that time the dear and beloved only son of a certain lay follower had diedSo a large number of lay followers  their clothes wet their hair wet  went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them Why have you come here  your clothes wet your hair wet  in the middle of the dayWhen this was said the lay follower said to the Blessed One My dear and beloved only son has diedThis is why we have come here  our clothes wet our hair wet  in the middle of the dayThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow at that time a certain householders dear  beloved little son his only child had diedBecause of his death the father had no desire to work or to eatHe kept going to the cemetery and crying out Where have you gone my only little childWhere have you gone my only little childThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Householder your faculties are not those of one who is steady in his own mindThere is an aberration in your facultiesLord how could there not be an aberration in my facultiesMy dear  beloved little son my only child has diedBecause of his death I have no desire to work or to eatI keep going to the cemetery and crying out Where have you gone my only little childWhere have you gone my only little child Thats the way it is householderThats the way it is  for sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dearBut lord who would ever think that sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dearHappiness  joy are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear So the householder not delighting in the Blessed Ones words rejecting the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat and leftNow at that time a large number of gamblers were playing dice not far from the Blessed OneSo the householder went to them and on arrival said to them Just now venerable sirs I went to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs I was sitting there Gotama the contemplative said to me Householder your faculties are not those of one who is steady in his own mindThere is an aberration in your facultiesWhen this was said I said to him Lord how could there not be an aberration in my facultiesMy dear  beloved little son my only child has diedBecause of his death I have no desire to work or to eatI keep going to the cemetery and crying out Where have you gone my only little childWhere have you gone my only little childThats the way it is householderThats the way it is  for sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dearBut lord who would ever think that sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dearHappiness  joy are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear So not delighting in the words of Gotama the contemplative rejecting them I got up from my seat and leftThats the way it is householderThats the way it isHappiness  joy are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dearSo the householder left thinking I agree with the gamblersEventually word of this conversation made its way into the kings inner chambersThen King Pasenadi Kosala addressed Queen Mallika Mallika your contemplative Gotama has said this Sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear If that was said by the Blessed One great king then thats the way it isNo matter what Gotama the contemplative says Mallika endorses it If that was said by the Blessed One great king then thats the way it is Just as no matter what his teacher says a pupil endorses it Thats the way it is teacherThats the way is In the same way no matter what Gotama the contemplative says Mallika endorses it If that was said by the Blessed One great king then thats the way it is Go away MallikaOut of my sightThen Queen Mallika called for the brahman Nalijangha Come brahmanGo to the Blessed One and on arrival showing reverence

is dear come springing from one who is dear Whatever the Blessed One says remember it well and tell it to meFor Tathagatas do not speak what is untrueYes madam the brahman Nalijangha responded to Queen MallikaGoing to the Blessed One on arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed OneAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama Queen Mallika shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfortAnd she says further Lord did the Blessed One say that sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear Thats the way it is brahmanThats the way it

himself open thinking Dead we will be together Its through this sequence of events that it may be understood how sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dearThen the brahman Nalijangha delighting in  approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat and went to Queen MallikaOn arrival he told her all that had been said in his conversation with the Blessed OneThen Queen Mallika went to King Pasenadi Kosala and on arrival said to him What do you think great king Is Princess Vajiri dear to youYes Mallika Princess Vajiri is dear to meAnd what do you think would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in you from any change  aberration in Princess VajiriMallika any change  aberration in Princess Vajiri would mean an aberration of my very lifeHow could sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair not arise in meGreat king it was in connection with this that the Blessed One  the One who knows the One who sees

arahant so I have heard I am a brahman responsive to requests openhanded bearing my last body an unsurpassed doctor  surgeonYou are my children my sons born from my mouth born of the Dhamma created by the Dhamma heirs to the Dhamma not heirs in material thingsBoth formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stressOnce the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in the Simsapa forestThen picking up a few Simsapa leaves with his hand he asked the monks What do you think monks Which are more numerous the few Simsapa leaves in my hand or those overhead in the Simsapa forestThe leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number lordThose overhead in the forest are far more numerousIn the same way monks those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are far more numerousAnd why havent I taught themBecause they are not connected with the goal do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life and do not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThat is why I have not taught themAnd what have I taughtThis is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is what I have taughtAnd why have I taught these thingsBecause they are connected with the goal relate to the rudiments of

that the other sorts of sick persons are to be nursed as wellThese are the three types of sick people to be found existing in the worldIn the same way these three types of people like the three types of sick people are to be found existing in the worldWhich threeThere is the case of the person who  regardless of whether he does or doesnt get to see the Tathagata regardless of whether he does or doesnt get to hear the Dhamma  Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagatha  will not alight on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualitiesThere is the case of the person who  regardless of whether he does or doesnt get to see the Tathagata regardless of whether he does or doesnt get to hear the Dhamma  Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagatha  will alight on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualitiesThere is the case of the person who will alight on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities if he gets to see the Tathagata and gets to hear the Dhamma  Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagatha but not if he doesntNow it is because of the person who will alight on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities if he gets to see the Tathagata and gets to hear the Dhamma  Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata  but not if he doesnt  that the teaching of the Dhamma has been allowedAnd it is because there is this sort of person that the other sorts of persons are to be taught the Dhamma as wellThese are the three types of people like the three types of sick people to be found existing in the worldThen at that moment the Blessed One exclaimedWhen this was said Magandiya the wanderer said to the Blessed One Its amazing master GotamaIts astounding how this too is wellstated by master Gotama Freedom from disease the foremost good fortuneUnbinding the foremost ease We have also heard this said by earlier wanderers in the lineage of our teachers Freedom from disease the foremost good fortuneUnbinding the foremost ease This agrees with thatBut as for what you have heard said by earlier wanderers in the lineage of your teachers Magandiya  Freedom from disease the foremost good fortuneUnbinding the foremost ease  which freedom from disease is that which UnbindingWhen this was said Magandiya the wanderer rubbed his own limbs with his handThis is that freedom from disease master Gotama he saidThis is that UnbindingFor I am now free from disease happy and nothing afflicts meMagandiya its just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldnt see black objects white blue yellow red or pink objects who couldnt see even or uneven places the stars the sun or the moonHe would hear a man with good eyesight saying How wonderful good sirs is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean He would go in search of something whiteThen another man would fool him with a grimy oilstained rag Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean The blind man would take it and put it onHaving put it on gratified he would exclaim words of gratification How wonderful good sirs is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean Now what do you think MagandiyaWhen that man blind from birth took the grimy oilstained rag and put it on and having put it on gratified exclaimed words of gratification How wonderful good sirs is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean Did he do so knowing  seeing or out of faith in the man with good eyesightOf course he did it not knowing  not seeing master Gotama but out of faith in the man with good eyesightIn the same way Magandiya the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyelessWithout knowing freedom from disease without seeing Unbinding they still speak this verseThis verse was stated by earlier worthy ones fully selfawakenedBut now it has gradually become a verse of runofthemill peopleThis body Magandiya is a disease a cancer an arrow painful an afflictionAnd yet you say with reference to this body which is a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction This is that freedom from disease master GotamaThis is that Unbinding for you dont have the noble vision with which you would know freedom from disease and see UnbindingIm convinced master Gotama that you can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I would know freedom from disease that I would see UnbindingMagandiya its just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldnt see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moonHis friends companions  relatives would take him to a doctorThe doctor would concoct medicine for him but in spite of the medicine his eyesight would not appear or grow clearWhat do you think MagandiyaWould that doctor have nothing but his share of weariness  disappointmentYes master GotamaIn the same way Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma  This is that freedom from disease this is that Unbinding  and you on your part did not know freedom from disease or see Unbinding that would be wearisome for me that would be troublesome for meIm convinced master Gotama that you can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I would know freedom from disease that I would see UnbindingMagandiya its just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldnt see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moonNow suppose that a certain man were to take a grimy oilstained rag and fool him saying Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean The blind man would take it and put it onThen his friends companions  relatives would take him to a doctorThe doctor would concoct medicine for him purges from above  purges from below ointments  counterointments and treatments through the noseAnd thanks to the medicine his eyesight would appear  grow clearThen together with the arising of his eyesight he would abandon whatever passion  delight he felt for that grimy oilstained ragAnd he would regard that man as an enemy  no friend at all and think that he deserved to be killedMy gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by that man  his grimy oilstained rag Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  cleanIn the same way Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma  This is that freedom from Disease this is that Unbinding  and you on your part were to know that freedom from Disease and see that Unbinding then together with the arising of your eyesight you would abandon whatever passion  delight you felt with regard for the five clingingaggregatesAnd it would occur to you My gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by this mindFor in clinging it was just form that I was clinging to it was just feeling just perception just fabrications just consciousness that I was clinging toWith my clinging as a requisite condition there arises becoming birth aging  death sorrow lamentation pains distresses  despairsAnd thus is the origin of this entire mass of stress Im convinced master Gotama that you can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might rise up from this seat cured of my blindnessIn that case Magandiya associate with men of integrityWhen you associate with men of integrity you will hear the true DhammaWhen you hear the true Dhamma you will practice the Dhamma in accordance with the DhammaWhen you practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma you will know  see for yourself These things are diseases cancers arrowsAnd here is where diseases cancers  arrows cease without traceWith the cessation of my clinging comes the cessation of becomingWith the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birthWith the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all ceaseSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering  stressSuppose that a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poisonHis friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeonThe surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knife and then would probe for the arrow with a probeHe then would pull out the arrow and extract the poison leaving no residue behindKnowing that no residue was left behind he would say My good man your arrow has been pulled outThe poison has been extracted with no residue left behind so it is not enough to do you harmEat suitable foodDont eat unsuitable food or else the wound will festerWash the wound frequently smear it with an ointment frequently so that blood  pus dont fill the opening of the woundDont walk around in the wind  sun or else dust  dirt may contaminate the opening of the woundKeep looking after the wound my good man and work for its healingThe thought would occur to the man My arrow has been pulled outThe poison has been extracted with no residue left behind so it is not enough to do me harm He would eat suitable food so the wound wouldnt festerHe would wash the wound and smear it with an ointment frequently so blood  pus wouldnt fill the opening of the woundHe would not walk around in the wind  sun so dust  dirt wouldnt contaminate the opening of the woundHe would keep looking after the wound and would work for its healingNow both because of these suitable actions of his and because of there being no residue of the poison left behind the wound would healWith the healing of the wound and its being covered with skin he wouldnt incur death or deathlike sufferingIn the same way theres the possible case where a certain monk thinks Craving is said by the Contemplative to be an arrowThe poison of ignorance spreads its toxin through desire passion  ill willI have abandoned the arrowI have expelled the poison of ignoranceI am rightly intent on Unbinding Because he is rightly intent on Unbinding he wouldnt pursue those things that are unsuitable for a person rightly intent on UnbindingHe wouldnt pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eyeHe wouldnt pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear unsuitable aromas with the nose unsuitable flavors with the tongue unsuitable tactile sensations with the bodyHe wouldnt pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellectWhen he doesnt pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eye doesnt pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellect lust doesnt invade the mindWith his mind not invaded by lust he doesnt incur death or deathlike sufferingI have given this simile to convey a meaningThe meaning is this the wound stands for the six internal sense media the poison for ignorance the arrow for craving the probe for mindfulness the knife for noble discernment the surgeon for the Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakenedThen when it was evening VenMalunkyaputta arose from seclusion and went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord just now as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness These positions that are undeclared set aside discarded by the Blessed One  The cosmos is eternal The cosmos is not eternal The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul  the body are the same The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathagata exists After death a Tathagata does not exist After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist  I dont approve I dont accept that the Blessed One has not declared them to meIll go ask the Blessed One about this matterIf he declares to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then I will live the holy life under himIf he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then I will renounce the training and return to the lower lifeLord if the Blessed One knows that The cosmos is eternal then may he declare to me that The cosmos is eternal If he knows that The cosmos is not eternal then may he declare to me that The cosmos is not eternal But if he doesnt know or see whether the cosmos is eternal or not eternal then in one who is unknowing  unseeing the straightforward things is to admit I dont knowI dont see If he doesnt know or see whether after death a Tathagata exists does not exist both exists  does not exist neither exists nor does not exist then in one who is unknowing  unseeing the straightforward things is to admit I dont knowI dont see Malunkyaputta did I ever say to you Come Malunkyaputta live the holy life under me and I will declare to you that The cosmos is eternal or The cosmos is not eternal or The cosmos is finite or The cosmos is infinite or The soul  the body are the same or The soul is one thing and the body another or After death a Tathagata exists or After death a Tathagata does not exist or After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist or After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not existNo lordAnd did you ever say to me Lord I will live the holy life under the Blessed One and he will declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or The cosmos is not eternal or The cosmos is finite or The cosmos is infinite or The soul  the body are the same or The soul is one thing and the body another or After death a Tathagata exists or After death a Tathagata does not exist or After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist or After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not existNo lordThen that being the case foolish man who are you to be claiming grievancesmaking demands of anyoneMalunkyaputta if anyone were to say I wont live the holy life under the Blessed One as long as he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the TathagataIts just as if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poisonHis friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeon and the man would say I wont have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble warrior a brahman a merchant or a worker He would say I wont have this arrow removed until I know the given name  clan name of the man who wounded me until I know whether he was tall medium or short until I know whether he was dark ruddybrown or goldencolored until I know his home village town or city until I know whether the bow with which I was wounded was a long bow or a crossbow until I know whether the bowstring with which I was wounded was fiber bamboo threads sinew hemp or bark until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was wild or cultivated until I know whether the feathers of the shaft with which I was wounded were those of a vulture a stork a hawk a peacock or another bird until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was bound with the sinew of an ox a water buffalo a langur or a monkey He would say I wont have this arrow removed until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow a curved arrow a barbed a calftoothed or an oleander arrow The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to himIn the same way if anyone were to say I wont live the holy life under the Blessed One as long as he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the TathagataMalunkyaputta its not the case that when there is the view The cosmos is eternal there is the living of the holy lifeAnd its not the case that when there is the view The cosmos is not eternal there is the living of the holy lifeWhen there is the view The cosmos is eternal and when there is the view The cosmos is not eternal there is still the birth there is the aging there is the death

in the here  nowSo Malunkyaputta remember what is undeclared by me as undeclared and what is declared by me as declaredAnd what is undeclared by meThe cosmos is eternal is undeclared by meThe cosmos is not eternal is undeclared by meThe cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul  the body are the same The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathagata exists After death a Tathagata does not exist After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist is undeclared by meAnd why are they undeclared by meBecause they

over the next few daysPlease let me know if you run into any bad links along the wayThis booklet contains a collection of short passages excerpted from talks printed in a book distributed at Ajaan Khamdees funeral inI expect to release the next update sometime in JuneJust as the footprints of all legged animals are encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephants footprint is

thoroughbred horse is not stirred  agitated on seeing the shadow of the goadstick but when his hair is pricked he is stirred  agitated I wonder what task the trainer will have me do todayWhat should I

of great fruit  great benefitIt gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its final endAnd how is mindfulness of death developed  pursued so that it is of great fruit  great benefit gains a footing in the Deathless and has the Deathless as its final endThere is the case where a monk as day departs and night returns reflects Many are the causes of my deathA snake might bite me a

provoked my phlegm piercing wind forces might be provokedThat would be how my death would come aboutThat would be an obstruction for me Then the monk should investigate Are there any evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by me that would be an obstruction for me were I to die in the night If on reflecting he realizes that there are evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die in the night then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualitiesJust as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness to put out the fire on his turban or

the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAs if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground  one day two days three days dead  bloated livid  festering the monk applies it to this very body This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fateOr again as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures  hawks by dogs hyenas  various other creatures a skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions  here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a chest bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder He applies it to this very body This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fateIn this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itselfOr he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the bodyOr his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembranceAnd he remains independent unsustained by anything in the worldThis is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jetavana

dark with dark result kamma that is bright with bright result kamma that is dark  bright with dark  bright result and kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kammaAnd what is kamma that is dark with dark resultThere is the case where a certain person fabricates an injurious bodily fabrication an injurious verbal fabrication an injurious

occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Feeding GroundAt that time VenRahula was staying at the Mango StoneThen the Blessed One arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to where VenRahula was staying at the Mango StoneVenRahula saw him coming from afar and on seeing him set out a seat  water for washing the feetThe Blessed One sat down on the seat set out and having sat down washed his feetVenRahula bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one sideThen the Blessed One having left a little bit of water in the water dipper said to VenRahula Rahula do you see this little bit of leftover water remaining in the water dipperYes sirThats how little of a contemplative there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lieHaving tossed away the little bit of leftover water the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how this little bit of leftover water is tossed awayYes sirWhatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like thatHaving turned the water dipper upside down the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how this water dipper is turned upside downYes sirWhatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like thatHaving turned the water dipper rightside up the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how empty  hollow this water dipper isYes sirWhatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty  hollow just like thatRahula its like a royal elephant immense pedigreed accustomed to battles its tusks like chariot polesHaving gone into battle it uses its forefeet  hindfeet its forequarters  hindquarters its head  ears  tusks  tail but will simply hold back its trunkThe elephant trainer notices that and thinks This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king But when the royal elephant having gone into battle uses its forefeet  hindfeet its forequarters  hindquarters its head  ears  tusks  tail  his trunk the trainer notices that and thinks This royal elephant has given up its life to the kingThere is nothing it will not doThe same holds true with anyone who feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie There is no evil I tell you he will not doThus Rahula you should train yourself I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jestWhat do you think Rahula What is a mirror forFor reflection sirIn the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts are to be done with repeated reflectionWhenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily

reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy lifeHaving confessed it you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualitiesWhenever you want to perform a mental act you should reflect on it This mental act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful mental act with painful

attention and will continue mailing copies of the Handful of Leaves CDI hope the dearth of news in this Whats New page wont discourage you from exploring the website and reading from the rich collection already available hereThere are some real gems here I invite you to dig for themIf youre an oldtime Access to Insight visitor in search of something new you might enjoy looking once again

owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitratorWhatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heirThese are the five facts that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordainedTo make this move Ive temporarily disabled several features of the website including the search engine and the zip downloadsI hope to have these back in service within the next week or twoIn the meantime please be patient as I track down the myriad little bugs and glitches that inevitably result from a move such as thisIf you have any problems please let me knowThanksPlease note that I have a new email address john at access to insight dot oh are geeFinally please also note that a few months ago I changed my mailing addressYou can always find the most uptodate contact information on the Frequently Asked Questions pageNote The previous streamentry study guide has a new title Streamentry Part The Way to StreamentryStay tuned to this Whats New page in the coming months for more details about the CDIn the meantime please do not send me any requests for the CD just yetIll let you know when Im ready to handle themThanks for your patienceI am considering putting together another free CDROM edition of this websiteTo make it even more useful than earlier editions I would like to include a search engine right on the diskDo you have any experience designing search engine software that could work on a CDROMRequirements for the software includeIf you have any ideas as to where I might find such software or if you might be interested in writing it lets talkThe final section of the Theragatha of the Khuddaka Nikaya contains fifteen poems composed by Venerable Vangisa the monk whom the Buddha had designated as his foremost disciple in the composition of spontaneous verseThe subject of these poems ranges widely from expressions of Vangisas own inner struggles and setbacks in Dhamma practice to verses in praise of the Buddha and some of his great discciples to verses in celebration of Vangisas final attainment of arahantshipThis book contains a carefully annotated translation of these poems along with a helpful Introduction that places them in their historical and literary contextNote The suttas from this book have also been indexed and added to the websites sutta archiveWisdom Publications is pleased to announce its new paperback anthology in the awardwinning Teachings of the Buddha discourses seriesInitially conceived in response to requests from professors this collection organizes the wealth of the Pali Nikayas within a single inexpensive volume that is ideal for course adoptionThe ten thematic chapters each with a clear and thoughtful introduction by Bhikkhu Bodhi make the vast and ancient discourses accessible as never beforeIn the Buddhas Words is now in printIf you would like to receive a PDF file of the detailed table of contents prefaces and introduction simply email wisdomwisdompubsorg with the exact words send pdf in the subject headingThe file you will receive can be opened with Adobe Acrobat ReaderAccess to Insights home page has a new lookI hope you like itOther minor cosmetic changes to the website will be coming in the weeks aheadThe purpose of these changes is to unify the appearance of the websites many pages and to make it easier for those of you who wish to reprint or redistribute them elsewhere to reformat them to suit your own stylistic preferencesThere are bound to be some glitches during this transition  especially some inconsistencies of font style and other cosmeticsFor these I ask for your patienceIf you discover any other problems of course please let me knowIve reorganized the Other Theravada Sources page and expanded it to include websites that offer Tipitaka translations in languages other than English and audio recordings and streamsFor well over a year now a small group of longtime friends of ATI has quietly been plugging away at developing Vicaya a search engine that will accompany the forthcoming CDROM edition of Access to InsightVicaya versionis now ready for general testingYou can help by downloading Vicaya and trying it outIf you have any comments please post them to the Vicaya User ListThe more people we can get testing it now the less likely it is that there will be problems with it later onThe sutta translations on this website were provided by several translators not all of whom used the same edition of the Tipitaka as their Pali sourceSome editions enumerate the suttas slightly differently which can often lead to confusionIn May I decided to adopt the PTS as the common reference point for sutta numbers henceforth all suttas from the Anguttara Nikaya on Access to Insight will be numbered following the PTS systemTo implement this change I renumbered approximately thirty suttas as summarized in the table belowThis brandnew website offers a library of free audio recordings of English translations of Pali suttas selected and read aloud by respected Dhamma teachers within the Theravada Buddhist traditionThe suttas in this library were handpicked by the teachers themselves which means that although the collection may be small it contains of some of the most important suttas in the entire Pali canonWhenever you see the SuttaReadings icon on Access to Insight youve found a link to the SuttaReadings websiteClicking on that icon from a sutta page will take you to an audio recording of this sutta being read aloudIf the icon appears next to an authors name you can click on the icon to learn what sutta readings by that author are availableI hope you find this new service valuableListen wellOne of the most deeply rooted deceptions in the mind is its tendency to identify the body as self Recognizing that this seductive but distorted view of reality can be a stubborn impediment to progress in the Dhamma the Buddha taught his students some practices and reflections specifically designed to undercut this illusionThis book is a marvelous anthology of many of these teachings taken from the Pali canon and related texts plus many more from the authors own writingsCaution The readings in this book are very powerful and are probably not suitable for beginning meditatorsTo paraphrase the authors comments in the Introduction Meditation on the unattractiveness of the body should be practiced with moderation and care especially if one has no personal contact with a meditation teacherI hope you like the cleaner new designIve also added a few new features includingDuring the transition to the new design Ive had to temporarily disable a few familiar links and features including the wholesite downloadBut dont worry  theyll be backStay
