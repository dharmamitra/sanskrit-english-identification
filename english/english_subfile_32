attacked by wind and sunIt would be hauled up on dry land during the cold season and its rigging would be further attacked by wind and sunIt would cut through the outer skin then through the inner skin then through the flesh then through the sinews then through the boneIt would occur to that man This householder or householders son is a rich man with much wealth and property protected by a bodyguardIts body was like a huge boat made from a single tree trunk its hood like a large brewers sieve its eyes like the large bronze dishes of Kosala its tongue darting out from its mouth like flashes of lightning emitted when the sky thunders the sound of its breathing in and out like the sound of a smiths bellows filling with airits devas and humansIts occurrence there ties up with the present context a strained mind is far from concentrationIll go to the elder bhikkhus myselfIll soon find out whether he is an ascetic or a sham asceticIm consistent youre inconsistentIm consistent youre inconsistentIve seen something that doesnt exist in the worldIve seen something that doesnt exist in the worldIve uprooted sensual cravingJoyfully with a happy mind Just as a beryl gembeautiful of fine quality eightfaceted of excellent workmanshipwhen placed on a brocade cloth shines and beams and radiates so too the young devas in Susimas assembly  displayed diverse lustrous coloursJust as a brand from a funeral pyre burning at both ends and smeared with excrement in the middle cannot be used as timber either in the village or in the forest in just such a way do I speak about this person he has missed out on the enjoyments of a householder yet he does not fulfil the goal of asceticismJust as a fire burns with fuel but not without fuel so Vaccha I declare rebirth for one with fuel not for one without fuel Just as a man looking down an old well a precipice or a steep riverbank would draw back the body and mind so too bhikkhus should you approach familiesJust as a monkey roaming through a forest grabs hold of one branch lets that go and grabs another then lets that go and grabs still another so too that which is called mind and mentality and consciousness arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by nightJust as a mother nurtures her childJust as a mother nurtures her childJust as a mule becomes pregnant to its own downfall and destruction so Devadattas gain honour and praise arose to his own downfall and destructionJust as a person anoints a wound only for the purpose of enabling it to heal or just as one greases an axle only for the sake of transporting a load so a bhikkhu reflecting wisely takes food  for assisting the holy lifeJust as a plantain tree a bamboo or a reed yields fruit to its own downfall and destruction so Devadattas gain honour and praise arose to his own downfall and destructionJust as a ploughshare heated all day sizzles and hisses and gives off steam and smoke if placed in water so too that sacrificial cake when disposed of in the water sizzled and hissed and gave off steam and smokeJust as a stick thrown up into the air falls now on its bottom now on its side and now on its top so too as beings roam and wander on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving now they go from this world to the other world now they come from the other world to this worldJust as a strong conch blower can easily send his signal to the four quarters so too when the liberation of mind by equanimity is developed and cultivated in this way any limited kamma that was done does not remain there does not persist thereJust as a strong conch blower can easily send his signal to the four quarters so too when the liberation of mind by lovingkindness is developed and cultivated in this way any limited kamma that was done does not remain there does not persist thereJust as all the potters vessels whether unbaked or baked are subject to a breakup terminate in their breakup and cannot escape their breakup so all beings are subject to death terminate in death and cannot escape deathJust as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an oxs belly with a sharp butchers knife so too violent winds are carving up my bellyJust as if a strong man were to split my head open with a sharp sword so too violent winds cut through my headJust as if a strong man were to tighten a tough leather strap around my head as a headband so too there are violent pains in my headJust as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over a pit of hot coals so too there is a violent burning in my bodyJust as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses might be born in the water grow up in the water and thrive while submerged in the water without rising up from the water some lotuses might be born in the water grow up in the water and stand at an even level with the water some lotuses might be born in the water and grow up in the water but would rise up from the water and stand without being soiled by the waterso too surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha the Blessed One saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with dull faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach and a few who dwelt seeing blame and fear in the other worldJust as many diverse windsJust as one who has mounted a wooden plankJust as the eldest son of a wheelturning monarch properly keeps in motion the wheel set in motion by his father so do you Sariputta properly keep in motion the Wheel of Dhamma set in motion by me Just as the footprints of all living beings that walk fit into the footprint of the elephant and the elephants footprint is declared to be their chief by reason of its size so diligence is the one thing which secures both kinds of good the good pertaining to the present life and that pertaining to the future lifeJust as two sheaves of reeds might stand leaning against each other so too with nameandform as condition consciousness with consciousness as condition nameandformJust as when a young calf does not see its mother there may take place in it some alteration or change so too there are bhikkhus here who are newly ordained not long gone forth recently come to this Dhamma and DisciplineJust as when young seedlings do not get water there may take place in them some alteration or change so too there are bhikkhus here who are newly ordained not long gone forth recently come to this Dhamma and DisciplineJust as during the bright fortnight whether day or night comes the moon grows in colour circularity and luminosity in diameter and circumference so too venerable sir for one who has faith in wholesome states a sense of shame fear of wrongdoing energy and wisdom whether day or night comes only growth is to be expected in regard to wholesome states not declineJust as during the dark fortnight whether day or night comes the moon declines in colour circularity and luminosity in diameter and circumference so too venerable sir for one who has no faith in wholesome states no sense of shame no fear of wrongdoing no energy and no wisdom whether day or night comes only decline is to be expected in regard to wholesome states not growthJust as when a ball of string is thrown it runs away unwinding so too the foolish and the wise by unwinding flee from pleasure and pain Just like the crow that attacked the stone We leave Gotama disappointedJust like the wealth a man gains in a dream Just like you might come here I stir not a hair I feel no terrorJust mindful I breathe in mindful I breathe outJust now I was anointed by the Blessed One with the ambrosia of a Dhamma talkJust now Master Gotama I approached the ascetic Moggallana and asked him about this matterJust now Master Moggallana I approached the ascetic Gotama and asked him about this matterJust this is the end of suffering Just this Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to
