certain forest groveNow at that time that mendicant had previously been spending too much time in recitation But some time later they adhered to passivity and silenceNot hearing the teaching the deity haunting that forest approached that mendicant and addressed them in verseMendicant why dont you recite passages of the teachingliving together with other mendicantsWhen you hear the teaching

callthe laying to rest by completely understandingwhatever is seen heard and thoughtLinked DiscoursesIn the WoodsA VajjiAt one time a certain Vajjian mendicant was staying near Vesālī in a certain forest groveNow at that time the Vajjis were holding an allnight event in VesālīThen that mendicant groaning at the noise of musical instruments being beaten and played on that occasion recited this verseWe dwell alone in the wildernesslike a castoff log in the forestOn a night like thiswhos worse off than meThe deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant and wanted whats best for them So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up and addressed them in verseYou dwell alone in the wildernesslike a castoff log in the forestLots of people are jealous of youlike

for the sickBut the wanderers who followed other paths were not honored respected esteemed revered and venerated And they didnt receive robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sickNow at that time the wanderer Susīma was residing at Rājagaha together with a large community of wanderersThen his community said to SusīmaReverend Susīma please lead the spiritual life with the ascetic GotamaMemorize that teaching and have us recite it with youWhen weve memorized it well recite it to the laityIn this way we too will be honored respected esteemed revered and venerated And well receive robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sickYes reverends replied Susīma Then he went to Venerable nanda and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to nandaReverend nanda I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and trainingThen nanda took Susīma to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir this wanderer Susīma says thathe wishes to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and trainingWell then nanda give Susīma the going forthAnd the wanderer Susīma received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceNow at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddhas presenceWe understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceVenerable Susīma heard about thisHe went up to those mendicants and exchanged greetings with themWhen the

of extinguishmentSir I dont understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in briefPlease teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaningReverend Susīma whether you understand or

mistake sir It was foolish stupid and unskillful of me to go forth as a thief in such a wellexplained teaching and trainingPlease sir accept my mistake for what it is so I will restrain myself in futureIndeed Susīma you made a mistake It was foolish stupid and unskillful of you to go forth as a thief in such a wellexplained teaching and trainingSuppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to the king sayingYour Majesty this is a bandit a criminal Punish him as you willThe king would sayGo my men and tie this mans arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope Shave his head and march him from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum Then take him out the south gate and there to the south of the city chop off his headThe kings men would do as they were toldWhat do you think SusīmaWouldnt that man experience pain and distress because of thatYes sirAlthough that man would experience pain and distress because of thatgoing forth as a thief in such a wellexplained teaching and training has a more painful and bitter result And it even leads to the underworldBut since you have recognized your mistake for what it is and have dealt

define a mendicant who is making a full inquiry for the complete ending of sufferingOur teachings are rooted in the BuddhaHe is our guide and our refugeSir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember itWell then mendicants listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants take a mendicant who makes a full inquiryThe suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse formsWhat is the source origin birthplace and inception of this sufferingWhen what exists do old age and death come to be When what does not exist do old age and death not come to beWhile making a full inquiry they understandThe suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms The source of this suffering is rebirthWhen rebirth exists old age and death come to be When rebirth doesnt exist old age and death dont come to beThey understand old age and death their origin their cessation and the fitting practice for their cessation And they practice in line with that pathThis is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering for the cessation of old age and deathThen they inquire furtherBut what is the source of this rebirth When what exists does rebirth come to be And when what does not exist does rebirth not come to beWhile making a full inquiry they understandContinued existence is the source of rebirthWhen continued existence exists rebirth comes to be When continued existence does not exist rebirth doesnt come to beThey understand rebirth its origin its cessation and the fitting practice for its cessation And they practice in line with that pathThis is called a mendicant who is practicing for

source of this craving  But what is the source of these six sense fields  But what is the source of this name and form  But what is the source of this consciousness  But what is the source of these

choices come to be When ignorance does not exist choices dont come to beThey understand choices their origin their cessation and the fitting practice for their cessation And they practice in line with

realmIf they make a bad choice their consciousness enters a bad realmIf they make an imperturbable choice their consciousness enters an imperturbable realmWhen a mendicant has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge they dont make a good choice a bad choice or an imperturbable choiceNot choosing or intending they dont grasp at anything in the worldNot grasping theyre not anxious Not being anxious they personally become extinguishedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceIf

choices bad choices or imperturbable choicesNo sirAnd when there are no choices at all with the cessation of choices would consciousness still be foundNo sirAnd when theres no consciousness at all would name and form still be foundNo sirAnd when there are no name and form at all would the six sense fields still be foundNo sirAnd when there are no six sense fields at all would contact still be

made up of the four primary elements an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned dispassionate and freedWhy is thatThis body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse to be taken up and laid to restThats why when it comes to this body an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned dispassionate and freedBut when it comes to that which is called mind or sentience or consciousness an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned dispassionate or freedWhy is thatBecause for a long time theyve been attached to it thought of it as their own and mistaken itThis is mine I am this this is my selfThats why when it comes to this mind an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned dispassionate and freedBut an uneducated ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self rather than the mindWhy is thatThis body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year or for two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty or a hundred years or even longerBut that which is called mind or sentience or consciousness arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all nightIts like a monkey moving through the forest It grabs hold of one branch lets it go and grabs another then it lets that go and grabs yet anotherIn the same way that which is called mind or sentience or consciousness arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all nightIn this case a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itselfWhen this exists that is due to the arising of this that arisesWhen this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases That isIgnorance is a condition for choicesChoices are a condition for consciousness That is how this entire mass of suffering originatesWhen ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over choices ceaseWhen choices cease

Venerable Kaccānagotta went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir they speak of this thing called right viewHow is right view definedKaccāna this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and nonexistenceBut when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding you wont have the notion of nonexistence regarding the worldAnd when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding you wont have the notion of existence regarding the worldThe world is for the most part shackled by attraction grasping and insistingBut ifwhen it comes to this attraction grasping mental fixation insistence and underlying tendencyyou dont get attracted grasp and commit to the notion my selfyoull have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising and what ceases is just suffering ceasing Your knowledge about this is independent of othersThis is how right view is definedAll exists this is one extremeAll doesnt exist this is

down to one side and said to SāriputtaWell Reverend Sāriputta are old age and death made by oneself Or by another Or by both oneself and another Or do they arise by chance not made by oneself or anotherNo Reverend Koṭṭhita old age and death are not made by oneself nor by another nor by both oneself and another nor do they arise by chance not made by oneself or anotherRather rebirth is a

means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidSuppose there were two bundles of reeds leaning up against each otherIn the same way name and form are conditions for consciousnessConsciousness is a condition for name and formName and form are conditions for the six sense fieldsThe six sense fields are conditions for contact That is how this entire mass of

UneducatedAt SāvatthīMendicants when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned dispassionate and freedWhy is thatThis body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse to be taken up and laid to restThats why when it comes to this body an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned dispassionate and freedBut when it comes to that which is called mind or sentience or consciousness an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned dispassionate or freedWhy is thatBecause for a long time theyve been attached to it thought of it as their own and mistaken itThis is mine I am this this is my selfThats why when it comes to this mind an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned dispassionate and freedBut an uneducated ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self rather than the mindWhy is thatThis body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year or for two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty or a hundred years or even longerBut that which is called mind or sentience or consciousness arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all nightIn this case a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itselfWhen this exists that is due to the arising of this that arisesWhen this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases That isPleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasantWith the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stopsPainful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painfulWith the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stopsNeutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutralWith the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stopsWhen you rub two sticks together heat is generated and fire is producedBut when you part the sticks and lay them aside any corresponding heat ceases and stopsIn the same way pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasantWith the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stopsPainful feeling Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutralWith the
