they made an end of suffering
But now theyve made themselves hard to look after
like chiefs in a village
They eat and eat and then lie down
unconscious in the homes of others
Having raised my joined palms to the Saṅgha
I speak here only about certain people
Theyre rejects with no protector
just like those who have passed away
Im speaking about
those who live negligently
To those who live diligently
I pay homage
Impelled by that deity those mendicants were struck with a sense of urgency

Recitation
At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove
Now at that time that mendicant had previously been spending too much time in recitation But some time later they adhered to passivity and silence
Not hearing the teaching the deity haunting that forest approached that mendicant and addressed them in verse
Mendicant why dont you recite passages of the teaching
living together with other mendicants
When you hear the teaching confidence grows
and the reciter is praised in the present life
I used to be enthusiastic about passages of the teaching
so long as Id not realized dispassion
But then I realized dispassion which the good call
the laying to rest by completely understanding
whatever is seen heard and thought

A Vajji
At one time a certain Vajjian mendicant was staying near Vesālī in a certain forest grove
Now at that time the Vajjis were holding an allnight event in Vesālī
Then that mendicant groaning at the noise of musical instruments being beaten and played on that occasion recited this verse
We dwell alone in the wilderness
like a castoff log in the forest
On a night like this
whos worse off than me
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant and wanted whats best for them So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up and addressed them in verse
You dwell alone in the wilderness
like a castoff log in the forest
Lots of people are jealous of you
like beings in hell of those going to heaven
Impelled by that deity that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency

The Great Chapter
The Wanderer Susīma
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Now at that time the Buddha was honored respected revered venerated and esteemed And he received robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
And the mendicant Saṅgha was also honored respected revered venerated and esteemed And they received robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
But the wanderers who followed other paths were not honored respected esteemed revered and venerated And they didnt receive robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
Now at that time the wanderer Susīma was residing at Rājagaha together with a large community of wanderers
Then his community said to Susīma
Reverend Susīma please lead the spiritual life with the ascetic Gotama
Memorize that teaching and have us recite it with you
When weve memorized it well recite it to the laity
In this way we too will be honored respected esteemed revered and venerated And well receive robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
Yes reverends replied Susīma Then he went to Venerable nanda and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to nanda
Reverend nanda I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training
Then nanda took Susīma to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir this wanderer Susīma says that
he wishes to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training
Well then nanda give Susīma the going forth
And the wanderer Susīma received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddhas presence
We understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Venerable Susīma heard about this
He went up to those mendicants and exchanged greetings with them
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to those mendicants
Is it really true that the venerables have declared enlightenment in the Buddhas presence
Yes reverend

This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here Do you recollect your many kinds of past lives with features and details

No reverend
Well knowing and seeing thus do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless transcending form
No reverend
Well now venerables how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained
Reverend Susīma we are freed by wisdom
I dont understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning
Reverend Susīma whether you understand or not we are freed by wisdom
Then Susīma went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side
and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with those mendicants
Susīma first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment
Sir I dont understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning
Reverend Susīma whether you understand or not first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment
What do you think Susīma
Is form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
Is feeling permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
Is perception permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir 
Are choices permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if theyre impermanent are they suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if theyre impermanent suffering and perishable are they fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
Is consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
So Susīma you should truly see any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
You should truly see any kind of feeling at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all feelingwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
You should truly see any kind of perception at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all perceptionwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
You should truly see any kind of choices at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all choiceswith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
You should truly see any kind of consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Seeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form feeling perception choices and consciousness
Being disillusioned desire fades away When desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Susīma do you see that rebirth is a condition for old age and death
Yes sir
Do you see that continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Yes sir
Do you see that grasping is a condition for continued existence
Yes sir
Do you see that craving is a condition for grasping

No sir
Well knowing and seeing thus do you with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman hear both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or far
No sir
Well knowing and seeing thus do you understand the minds of other beings and individuals having comprehended them with your mind

No sir
Well knowing and seeing thus do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless transcending form
No sir
Well now Susīma how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained
Then Venerable Susīma bowed with his head at the Buddhas feet and said
I have made a mistake sir It was foolish stupid and unskillful of me to go forth as a thief in such a wellexplained teaching and training
Please sir accept my mistake for what it is so I will restrain myself in future
Indeed Susīma you made a mistake It was foolish stupid and unskillful of you to go forth as a thief in such a wellexplained teaching and training
Suppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to the king saying
Your Majesty this is a bandit a criminal Punish him as you will
The king would say
Go my men and tie this mans arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope Shave his head and march him from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum Then take him out the south gate and there to the south of the city chop off his head
The kings men would do as they were told
What do you think Susīma
Wouldnt that man experience pain and distress because of that
Yes sir
Although that man would experience pain and distress because of that
going forth as a thief in such a wellexplained teaching and training has a more painful and bitter result And it even leads to the underworld
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is and have dealt with it properly I accept it
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is deal with it properly and commit to restraint in the future

Suppose a person was walking through a forest Theyd see an ancient path an ancient route traveled by humans in the past
Following it along
theyd see an ancient city an ancient capital inhabited by humans in the past It was lovely complete with parks groves lotus ponds and embankments
Then that person would inform a king or their minister
Please sir you should know this While walking through a forest I saw an ancient path an ancient route traveled by humans in the past
Following it along I saw an ancient city an ancient capital inhabited by humans in the past It was lovely complete with parks groves lotus ponds and embankments
Sir you should rebuild that city
Then that king or their minister would have that city rebuilt
And after some time that city was successful and prosperous and full of people attained to growth and expansion
In the same way I saw an ancient path an ancient route traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past
And what is that ancient path the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past
It is simply this noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion

Mendicants you might say What are old age and death and who do they belong to Or you might say Old age and death are one thing who they belong to is another But both of these mean the same thing only the phrasing differs
If you have the view that the soul and the body are the same thing there is no living of the spiritual life
If you have the view that the soul and the body are different things there is no living of the spiritual life

You might say What are choices and who do they belong to Or you might say Choices are one thing who they belong to is another But both of these mean the same thing only the phrasing differs

If you have the view that the soul and the body are different things there is no living of the spiritual life

The Ten Powers
With Upavāṇa
At Sāvatthī
Then Venerable Upavāṇa went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir there are some ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is made by oneself
There are some who declare that suffering is made by another
There are some who declare that suffering is made by both oneself and another
There are some who declare that suffering arises by chance not made by oneself or another
What does the Buddha say about this How does he explain it How should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth How should we explain in line with his teaching with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Upavāṇa I have said that suffering is dependently originated
Dependent on what
Dependent on contact
Saying this you would repeat what I have said and not misrepresent me with an untruth You would explain in line with my teaching and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
In the case of those ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is made by oneself thats conditioned by contact 
In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance not made by oneself or another thats also conditioned by contact
In the case of those ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is made by oneself its impossible that they will experience that without contact

Such is feeling such is the origin of feeling such is the ending of feeling
Such is perception such is the origin of perception such is the ending of perception
Such are choices such is the origin of choices such is the ending of choices

Ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are a condition for consciousness 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over choices cease
When choices cease consciousness ceases 
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
So the teaching has been well explained by me made clear opened illuminated and stripped of patchwork
Just this much is quite enough for a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith to rouse up his energy
Gladly let only skin sinews and tendons remain Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength energy and vigor
A lazy person lives in suffering mixed up with bad unskillful qualities and ruins a great deal of their own good
An energetic person lives happily secluded from bad unskillful qualities and fulfills a great deal of their own good
The best isnt reached by the worst
The best is reached by the best
This spiritual life is the cream mendicants and the Teacher is before you
So you should rouse up energy for attaining the unattained achieving the unachieved and realizing the unrealized thinking
In this way our going forth will not be wasted but will be fruitful and fertile
And our use of robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick shall be of great fruit and benefit for those who offered them
Thats how you should train
Considering your own good mendicants is quite enough for you to persist with diligence
Considering the good of others is quite enough for you to persist with diligence
Considering the good of both is quite enough for you to persist with diligence

Selfexamination
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants do you perform inner selfexamination
When he said this one of the mendicants said to the Buddha
Sir I perform inner selfexamination
But mendicant how do you perform inner selfexamination
Then that mendicant answered
but the Buddha was not happy with the answer
When he had spoken Venerable nanda said to the Buddha
Now is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy One
Let the Buddha speak of the inner selfexamination
The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then nanda listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Take a mendicant who performs inner selfexamination
The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms
But what is the source of this suffering When what exists do old age and death come to be And when what does not exist do old age and death not come to be
While examining they know
The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms
The source of this suffering is attachment When attachments exist old age and death come to be And when attachments do not exist old age and death dont come to be
They understand old age and death their origin their cessation and the fitting practice for their cessation
And they practice in line with that path
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering for the cessation of old age and death
They perform further inner selfexamination
But what is the source of this attachment When what exists does attachment come to be And when what does not exist does attachment not come to be
While examining they know
The source of this attachment is craving When craving exists attachments come to be And when craving doesnt exist attachments dont come to be
They understand attachments their origin their cessation and the fitting practice for their cessation
And they practice in line with that path
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering for the cessation of attachments
They perform further inner selfexamination
But where does that craving arise and where does it settle
While examining they know
That craving arises and settles on whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant
And what in the world seems nice and pleasant
The eye in the world seems nice and pleasant and it is there that craving arises and settles
mind in the world seems nice and pleasant and it is there that craving arises and settles
There were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent as pleasurable as self as healthy and as safe
Their craving grew
As their craving grew their attachments grew
As their attachments grew their suffering grew
And as their suffering grew they were not freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress They were not freed from suffering I say
There will be ascetics and brahmins in the future who will see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent as pleasurable as self as healthy and as safe
Their craving will grow
As their craving grows their attachments will grow
As their attachments grow their suffering will grow
And as their suffering grows they will not be freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress They will not be freed from suffering I say
There are ascetics and brahmins in the present who see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent as pleasurable as self as healthy and as safe
Their craving grows
As their craving grows their attachments grow
As their attachments grow their suffering grows
And as their suffering grows they are not freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress They are not freed from suffering I say
Suppose there was a bronze cup of beverage that had a nice color aroma and flavor
But it was mixed with poison
Then along comes a man struggling in the oppressive heat weary thirsty and parched
Theyd say to him
Here mister this bronze cup of beverage has a nice color aroma and flavor
But its mixed with poison
Drink it if you like
If you drink it the color aroma and flavor will be appetizing but it will result in death or deadly pain
He wouldnt reject that beverage Hastily without reflection hed drink it
resulting in death or deadly pain
In the same way there are ascetics and brahmins of the past 
There are ascetics and brahmins in the present who see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent as pleasurable as self as healthy and as safe

There were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent as suffering as notself as diseased and as dangerous
They gave up craving
Giving up craving they gave up attachments
Giving up attachments they gave up suffering
Giving up suffering they were freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress They were freed from suffering I say
There will be ascetics and brahmins in the future who will see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent as suffering as notself as diseased and as dangerous
They will give up craving
Giving up craving 
they will be freed from suffering I say

Drink it if you like
If you drink it its nice color aroma and flavor will refresh you But drinking it will result in death or deadly pain
Then that man might think
I could quench my thirst with water whey or broth But I shouldnt drink that beverage for it would be for my lasting harm and suffering
Hed reject that beverage After appraisal he wouldnt drink it
and it wouldnt result in death or deadly pain
In the same way there were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent as suffering as notself as diseased and as dangerous

Vital Conditions
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees not for one who does not know or see
For one who knows and sees what
Such is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of form
Such is feeling 
Such is perception 
Such are choices 
Such is consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousness
The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this
I say that this knowledge of ending has a vital condition it doesnt lack a vital condition
And what is it
You should say Freedom

So ignorance is a vital condition for choices
Choices are a vital condition for consciousness
Consciousness is a vital condition for name and form
Name and form are vital conditions for the six sense fields
The six sense fields are vital conditions for contact
Contact is a vital condition for feeling
Feeling is a vital condition for craving

Disillusionment is a vital condition for dispassion
Dispassion is a vital condition for freedom
Freedom is a vital condition for the knowledge of ending
Its like when it rains heavily on a mountain top and the water flows downhill to fill the hollows crevices and creeks
As they become full they fill up the pools
The pools fill up the lakes the lakes fill up the streams and the streams fill up the rivers
And as the rivers become full they fill up the ocean
In the same way ignorance is a vital condition for choices  Freedom is a vital condition for the knowledge of ending

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma
Then Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Its incredible sir Its amazing
in that this dependent origination is deep and appears deep yet to me it seems as plain as can be
Not so nanda Not so nanda
This dependent origination is deep and appears deep
It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population has become tangled like string knotted like a ball of thread and matted like rushes and reeds and it doesnt escape the places of loss the bad places the underworld transmigration
There are things that are prone to being grasped When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things your craving grows
Craving is a condition for grasping
Grasping is a condition for continued existence
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to be
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
Suppose there was a great tree
And its roots going downwards and across all draw the sap upwards
Fueled and sustained by that the great tree would stand for a long time
In the same way there are things that are prone to being grasped When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things your craving grows
Craving is a condition for grasping
Grasping is a condition for continued existence 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
There are things that are prone to being grasped When you concentrate on the drawbacks of these things your craving ceases
When craving ceases grasping ceases
When grasping ceases continued existence ceases 
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
Suppose there was a great tree
Then a person comes along with a spade and basket
Theyd cut the tree down at the roots dig them up and pull them out down to the fibers and stems
Then theyd split the tree apart cut up the parts and chop it into little bits Theyd dry the bits in the wind and sun burn them with fire and reduce them to ashes Then theyd winnow the ashes in a strong wind or float them away down a swift stream
In this way the great tree is cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the future
In the same way there are things that are prone to being grasped When you concentrate on the drawbacks of these things your craving ceases
When craving ceases grasping ceases
When grasping ceases continued existence ceases

A Full Inquiry
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants how do you define a mendicant who is making a full inquiry for the complete ending of suffering
Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha
He is our guide and our refuge
Sir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then mendicants listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants take a mendicant who makes a full inquiry
The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms
What is the source origin birthplace and inception of this suffering
When what exists do old age and death come to be When what does not exist do old age and death not come to be
While making a full inquiry they understand
The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms The source of this suffering is rebirth
When rebirth exists old age and death come to be When rebirth doesnt exist old age and death dont come to be
They understand old age and death their origin their cessation and the fitting practice for their cessation And they practice in line with that path
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering for the cessation of old age and death
Then they inquire further
But what is the source of this rebirth When what exists does rebirth come to be And when what does not exist does rebirth not come to be
While making a full inquiry they understand
Continued existence is the source of rebirth
When continued existence exists rebirth comes to be When continued existence does not exist rebirth doesnt come to be
They understand rebirth its origin its cessation and the fitting practice for its cessation And they practice in line with that path
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering for the cessation of rebirth
Then they inquire further
But what is the source of this continued existence  
But what is the source of this grasping  
But what is the source of this craving  
But what is the source of these six sense fields  
But what is the source of this name and form  
But what is the source of this consciousness  
But what is the source of these choices
When what exists do choices come to be When what does not exist do choices not come to be
While making a full inquiry they understand
Ignorance is the source of choices
When ignorance exists choices come to be When ignorance does not exist choices dont come to be
They understand choices their origin their cessation and the fitting practice for their cessation And they practice in line with that path
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering for the cessation of choices
If an ignorant individual makes a good choice their consciousness enters a good realm
If they make a bad choice their consciousness enters a bad realm
If they make an imperturbable choice their consciousness enters an imperturbable realm
When a mendicant has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge they dont make a good choice a bad choice or an imperturbable choice
Not choosing or intending they dont grasp at anything in the world
Not grasping theyre not anxious Not being anxious they personally become extinguished
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
If they feel a pleasant feeling they understand that its impermanent that theyre not attached to it and that they dont take pleasure in it
If they feel a painful feeling they understand that its impermanent that theyre not attached to it and that they dont take pleasure in it
If they feel a neutral feeling they understand that its impermanent that theyre not attached to it and that they dont take pleasure in it
If they feel a pleasant feeling they feel it detached
If they feel a painful feeling they feel it detached
If they feel a neutral feeling they feel it detached
Feeling the end of the body approaching they understand I feel the end of the body approaching Feeling the end of life approaching they understand I feel the end of life approaching
They understand When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end everything thats felt since I no longer take pleasure in it will become cool right here Only bodily remains will be left
Suppose a person were to remove a hot clay pot from a potters kiln and place it down on level ground
Its heat would dissipate right there and the shards would be left behind
In the same way feeling the end of the body approaching they understand I feel the end of the body approaching Feeling the end of life approaching they understand I feel the end of life approaching
They understand When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end everything thats felt since I no longer take pleasure in it will become cool right here Only bodily remains will be left
What do you think mendicants
Would a mendicant who has ended the defilements still make good choices bad choices or imperturbable choices
No sir
And when there are no choices at all with the cessation of choices would consciousness still be found
No sir
And when theres no consciousness at all would name and form still be found
No sir
And when there are no name and form at all would the six sense fields still be found
No sir
And when there are no six sense fields at all would contact still be found
No sir
And when theres no contact at all would feeling still be found
No sir
And when theres no feeling at all would craving still be found
No sir
And when theres no craving at all would grasping still be found
No sir
And when theres no grasping at all would continued existence still be found
No sir
And when theres no continued existence at all would rebirth still be found
No sir
And when theres no rebirth at all would old age and death still be found
No sir
Good good mendicants Thats how it is not otherwise
Trust me on this mendicants be convinced Have no doubts or uncertainties in this matter
Just this is the end of suffering

Kaḷāra the Aristocrat
With Kaḷāra the Aristocrat
At Sāvatthī
Then the mendicant Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to him
Reverend Sāriputta the mendicant Phagguna of the TopKnot has resigned the training and returned to a lesser life
That venerable mustnt have got any satisfaction in this teaching and training
Well then has Venerable Sāriputta found satisfaction in this teaching and training
Reverend I have no uncertainty
But what of the future
I have no doubt
Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir Venerable Sāriputta has declared enlightenment
I understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk
Please monk in my name tell Sāriputta that
the teacher summons him
Yes sir that monk replied He went to Sāriputta and said to him
Reverend Sāriputta the teacher summons you
Yes reverend replied Sāriputta
He went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to him
Sāriputta is it really true that you have declared enlightenment
I understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Sir I did not state the meaning in these words and phrases
Sāriputta no matter how a gentleman declares enlightenment what he has declared should be regarded as such
Sir did I not also say that
I did not state the meaning in these words and phrases
Sāriputta suppose they were to ask you
But Reverend Sāriputta how have you known and seen so that youve declared enlightenment
I understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
How would you answer
Sir if they were to ask me this
I would answer
Reverends because of the ending of the source of rebirth when it ended I knew it is ended
Knowing this
I understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Thats how Id answer such a question
But Sāriputta suppose they were to ask you
But what is the source origin birthplace and inception of rebirth
How would you answer
Sir if they were to ask me this
I would answer
Continued existence is the source origin birthplace and inception of rebirth
Thats how Id answer such a question
But Sāriputta suppose they were to ask you
What is the source of continued existence
How would you answer
Sir if they were to ask me this
Id answer
Grasping is the source of continued existence
Thats how Id answer such a question
But Sāriputta suppose they were to ask you
What is the source of grasping 
But Sāriputta suppose they were to ask you
What is the source of craving
How would you answer
Sir if they were to ask me this
Id answer
Feeling is the source of craving
Thats how Id answer such a question
But Sāriputta suppose they were to ask you
But how have you known and seen so that the relishing of feelings is no longer present
How would you answer
Sir if they were to ask me this
Id answer
Reverends there are three feelings
What three
Pleasant painful and neutral feeling
These three feelings are impermanent
and whats impermanent is suffering
When I understood this the relishing of feelings was no longer present
Thats how Id answer such a question
Good good Sāriputta
The same point may also be briefly explained in this way
Suffering includes whatever is felt
But Sāriputta suppose they were to ask you
But Reverend how have you been released that you declare enlightenment
I understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
How would you answer
Sir if they were to ask me this
Id answer
Because of an inner release with the ending of all grasping I live mindfully so that defilements dont defile me and I dont look down on myself
Thats how Id answer such a question
Good good Sāriputta
The same point may also be briefly explained in this way
I have no uncertainty regarding the defilements spoken of by the ascetic I have no doubt that Ive given them up
That is what the Buddha said
When he had spoken the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling
Then soon after the Buddha left Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants
Reverends the first question that the Buddha asked me was something that Id not previously considered so I hesitated
But when the Buddha agreed with my answer I thought
If the Buddha were to question me all day on this matter in different words and ways I could answer all day with different words and ways
If he were to question me all night
all day and night
for two days and nights
for three
or seven days and nights I could answer in different words and ways for seven days and nights
Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir Venerable Sāriputta has roared his lions roar
And he told the Buddha all that Sāriputta had said
Mendicant Sāriputta has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings so that he could answer any questions I might ask him in different words and ways up to the seventh day and night

Second Intention

Mendicants what you intend or plan and what you have underlying tendencies for become a support for the continuation of consciousness
When this support exists consciousness becomes established
When consciousness is established name and form are conceived
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields
The six sense fields are conditions for contact
Contact is a condition for feeling

Craving is a condition for grasping

Suppose there was a sapling
And from time to time someone would clear around the roots supply soil and water it
Fueled and sustained in this way the sapling would grow increase and mature
In the same way there are things that are prone to being fettered When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things your craving grows

The Great Chapter
A Childs Flesh
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants there are these four fuels They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born
What four
Solid food whether coarse or fine contact is the second mental intention the third and consciousness the fourth
These are the four fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born
And how should you regard solid food
Suppose a couple who were husband and wife set out to cross a desert taking limited supplies
They had an only child dear and beloved
As the couple were crossing the desert their limited quantity of supplies would run out
and theyd still have the rest of the desert to cross
Then it would occur to that couple
Our limited quantity of supplies has run out
and we still have the rest of the desert to cross
Why dont we kill our only child so dear and beloved and prepare dried and spiced meat Then we can make it across the desert by eating our childs flesh Let not all three perish
Then that couple would kill their only child so dear and beloved and prepare dried and spiced meat Theyd make it across the desert by eating their childs flesh
And as theyd eat their childs flesh theyd beat their breasts and cry
Where are you our only child Where are you our only child
What do you think mendicants
Would they eat that food for fun indulgence adornment or decoration
No sir
Wouldnt they eat that food just so they could make it across the desert
Yes sir
I say that this is how you should regard solid food
When solid food is completely understood desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood
When desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood a noble disciple is bound by no fetter that might return them again to this world
And how should you regard contact as fuel
Suppose there was a flayed cow
If she stands by a wall the creatures on the wall bite her
If she stands under a tree the creatures in the tree bite her
If she stands in some water the creatures in the water bite her
If she stands in the open the creatures in the open bite her
Wherever that flayed cow stands the creatures there would bite her
I say that this is how you should regard contact as fuel
When contact as fuel is completely understood the three feelings are completely understood
When the three feelings are completely understood a noble disciple has nothing further to do I say
And how should you regard mental intention as fuel
Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a mans height filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from pain
Then two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals
Then that persons intention aim and wish would be to get far away
Why is that
Because that person would think
If I fall in that pit of glowing coals that will result in my death or deadly pain
I say that this is how you should regard mental intention as fuel
When mental intention as fuel is completely understood the three cravings are completely understood
When the three cravings are completely understood a noble disciple has nothing further to do I say
And how should you regard consciousness as fuel
Suppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to the king saying
Your Majesty this is a bandit a criminal Punish him as you will
The king would say
Go my men and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spears
The kings men did as they were told
Then at midday the king would say
My men how is that man
Hes still alive Your Majesty
The king would say
Go my men and strike this man in the middle of the day with a hundred spears
The kings men did as they were told
Then late in the afternoon the king would say
My men how is that man
Hes still alive Your Majesty
The king would say
Go my men and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spears
The kings men did as they were told
What do you think mendicants
Would that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spears a day
Sir that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear
let alone three hundred spears
I say that this is how you should regard consciousness as fuel
When consciousness as fuel is completely understood name and form is completely understood When name and form are completely understood a noble disciple has nothing further to do I say

Thats not a fitting question said the Buddha You might say What are old age and death and who do they belong to Or you might say Old age and death are one thing who they belong to is another But both of these mean the same thing only the phrasing differs

Mendicants I will teach you dependent origination and dependently originated phenomena
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
And what is dependent origination
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death
Whether Realized Ones arise or not this law of nature persists this regularity of natural principles this invariance of natural principles specific conditionality
A Realized One understands this and comprehends it
then he explains teaches asserts establishes clarifies analyzes and reveals it
Look he says
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth 
Grasping is a condition for continued existence 
Craving is a condition for grasping 
Feeling is a condition for craving 
Contact is a condition for feeling 
The six sense fields are a condition for contact 
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields 
Consciousness is a condition for name and form 
Choices are a condition for consciousness 
Ignorance is a condition for choices
Whether Realized Ones arise or not this law of nature persists this regularity of natural principles this invariance of natural principles specific conditionality
A Realized One understands this and comprehends it
then he explains teaches asserts establishes clarifies analyzes and reveals it
Look he says
Ignorance is a condition for choices
So the fact that this is real not unreal not otherwise the specific conditionality of it
this is called dependent origination
And what are the dependently originated phenomena
Old age and death are impermanent conditioned dependently originated liable to end vanish fade away and cease
Continued existence 
Grasping 
The six sense fields 
Name and form 
Consciousness 
Ignorance is impermanent conditioned dependently originated liable to end vanish fade away and cease
These are called the dependently originated phenomena
When a noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are its impossible for them to turn back to the past thinking
Did I exist in the past Did I not exist in the past What was I in the past How was I in the past After being what what did I become in the past
Or to turn forward to the future thinking
Will I exist in the future Will I not exist in the future What will I be in the future How will I be in the future After being what what will I become in the future
Or to be undecided about the present thinking
Am I Am I not What am I How am I This sentient beingwhere did it come from And where will it go
Why is that
Because that noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are

Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for alms

Its too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha
Why dont I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
The wanderers said to him
Reverend Sāriputta there are ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds Some of them declare that suffering is made by oneself
Some of them declare that suffering is made by another

At Nādika
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house
Then while the Buddha was in private retreat he spoke this exposition of the teaching
Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights
The meeting of the three is contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
Craving is a condition for grasping 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds 
Nose consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells 
Tongue consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes 
Body consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches 
Mind consciousness arises dependent on the mind and thoughts
The meeting of the three is contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
Craving is a condition for grasping 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights
The meeting of the three is contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
When that craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over grasping ceases
When grasping ceases continued existence ceases 
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds 
Mind consciousness arises dependent on the mind and thoughts
The meeting of the three is contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving

Now at that time a certain monk was standing listening in on the Buddha
The Buddha saw him
Monk did you hear that exposition of the teaching
Yes sir

Uneducated
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery 
Mendicants when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned dispassionate and freed
Why is that
This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse to be taken up and laid to rest
Thats why when it comes to this body an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned dispassionate and freed
But when it comes to that which is called mind or sentience or consciousness an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned dispassionate or freed
Why is that
Because for a long time theyve been attached to it thought of it as their own and mistaken it
This is mine I am this this is my self
Thats why when it comes to this mind an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed
But an uneducated ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self rather than the mind
Why is that
This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year or for two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty or a hundred years or even longer
But that which is called mind or sentience or consciousness arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night
Its like a monkey moving through the forest It grabs hold of one branch lets it go and grabs another then it lets that go and grabs yet another
In the same way that which is called mind or sentience or consciousness arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night
In this case a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself
When this exists that is due to the arising of this that arises
When this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases That is
Ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are a condition for consciousness 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over choices cease
When choices cease consciousness ceases 
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
Seeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form feeling perception choices and consciousness
Being disillusioned desire fades away When desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence

A Great Tree
At Sāvatthī
There are things that are prone to being grasped When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things your craving grows
Craving is a condition for grasping
Grasping is a condition for continued existence 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
Suppose there was a great tree
And its roots going downwards and across all draw the sap upwards
Fueled and sustained by that the great tree would stand for a long time
In the same way there are things that are prone to being grasped When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things your craving grows
Craving is a condition for grasping

There are things that are prone to being grasped When you concentrate on the drawbacks of these things your craving ceases
When craving ceases grasping ceases
When grasping ceases continued existence ceases 
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
Suppose there was a great tree
Then a person comes along with a spade and basket
Theyd cut the tree down at the roots dig it up and pull the roots out down to the fibers and stems
Theyd cut the tree apart cut up the parts and chop it into splinters Theyd dry the splinters in the wind and sun burn them with fire and reduce them to ashes Then theyd winnow the ashes in a strong wind or float them away down a swift stream
In this way the great tree is cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the future
In the same way there are things that are prone to being grasped When you concentrate on the drawbacks of these things your craving ceases
When craving ceases grasping ceases
When grasping ceases continued existence ceases

Analysis
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants I will teach and analyze for you dependent origination
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
And what is dependent origination
Ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are a condition for consciousness
Consciousness is a condition for name and form
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields
The six sense fields are conditions for contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
Craving is a condition for grasping
Grasping is a condition for continued existence
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to be
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
And what is old age and death
The old age decrepitude broken teeth grey hair wrinkly skin diminished vitality and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings
This is called old age
The passing away perishing disintegration demise mortality death decease breaking up of the aggregates and laying to rest of the corpse of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings
This is called death
Such is old age and such is death
This is called old age and death
And what is rebirth
The rebirth inception conception reincarnation manifestation of the aggregates and acquisition of the sense fields of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings
This is called rebirth
And what is continued existence
There are these three states of existence
Existence in the sensual realm the realm of luminous form and the formless realm
This is called continued existence
And what is grasping
There are these four kinds of grasping
Grasping at sensual pleasures views precepts and observances and theories of a self
This is called grasping
And what is craving
There are these six classes of craving
Craving for sights sounds smells tastes touches and thoughts
This is called craving
And what is feeling
There are these six classes of feeling
Feeling born of contact through the eye ear nose tongue body and mind
This is called feeling
And what is contact
There are these six classes of contact
Contact through the eye ear nose tongue body and mind
This is called contact
And what are the six sense fields
The sense fields of the eye ear nose tongue body and mind
These are called the six sense fields
And what are name and form
Feeling perception intention contact and attention
This is called name
The four primary elements and form derived from the four primary elements
This is called form
Such is name and such is form
These are called name and form
And what is consciousness
There are these six classes of consciousness
Eye ear nose tongue body and mind consciousness
This is called consciousness
And what are choices
There are three kinds of choices
Choices by way of body speech and mind
These are called choices
And what is ignorance
Not knowing about suffering the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
This is called ignorance
And so ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are a condition for consciousness 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over choices cease
When choices cease consciousness ceases

Kaccānagotta
At Sāvatthī
Then Venerable Kaccānagotta went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir they speak of this thing called right view
How is right view defined
Kaccāna this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and nonexistence
But when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding you wont have the notion of nonexistence regarding the world
And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding you wont have the notion of existence regarding the world
The world is for the most part shackled by attraction grasping and insisting
But ifwhen it comes to this attraction grasping mental fixation insistence and underlying tendencyyou dont get attracted grasp and commit to the notion my self
youll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising and what ceases is just suffering ceasing Your knowledge about this is independent of others
This is how right view is defined
All exists this is one extreme
All doesnt exist this is the second extreme
Avoiding these two extremes the Realized One teaches by the middle way
Ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are a condition for consciousness 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates

Then in the late afternoon Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat went to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta
Well Reverend Sāriputta are old age and death made by oneself Or by another Or by both oneself and another Or do they arise by chance not made by oneself or another
No Reverend Koṭṭhita old age and death are not made by oneself nor by another nor by both oneself and another nor do they arise by chance not made by oneself or another
Rather rebirth is a condition for old age and death
Well Reverend Sāriputta is rebirth made by oneself Or by another Or by both oneself and another Or does it arise by chance not made by oneself or another
No Reverend Koṭṭhita rebirth is not made by oneself nor by another nor by both oneself and another nor does it arise by chance not made by oneself or another
Rather continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Well Reverend Sāriputta is continued existence made by oneself  
Is grasping made by oneself  
Is craving made by oneself  
Is feeling made by oneself  
Is contact made by oneself  
Are the six sense fields made by oneself  
Well Reverend Sāriputta are name and form made by oneself Or by another Or by both oneself and another Or do they arise by chance not made by oneself or another
No Reverend Koṭṭhita name and form are not made by oneself nor by another nor by both oneself and another nor do they arise by chance not made by oneself or another
Rather consciousness is a condition for name and form
Well Reverend Sāriputta is consciousness made by oneself Or by another Or by both oneself and another Or does it arise by chance not made by oneself or another
No Reverend Koṭṭhita consciousness is not made by oneself nor by another nor by both oneself and another nor does it arise by chance not made by oneself or another
Rather name and form are conditions for consciousness
Just now I understood you to say
No Reverend Koṭṭhita name and form are not made by oneself nor by another nor by both oneself and another nor do they arise by chance not made by oneself or another
Rather consciousness is a condition for name and form
But I also understood you to say
No Reverend Koṭṭhita consciousness is not made by oneself nor by another nor by both oneself and another nor does it arise by chance not made by oneself or another
Rather name and form are conditions for consciousness
How then should we see the meaning of this statement
Well then reverend I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Suppose there were two bundles of reeds leaning up against each other
In the same way name and form are conditions for consciousness
Consciousness is a condition for name and form
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields
The six sense fields are conditions for contact 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
If the first of those bundles of reeds were to be pulled away the other would collapse
And if the other were to be pulled away the first would collapse
In the same way when name and form cease consciousness ceases
When consciousness ceases name and form cease
When name and form cease the six sense fields cease
When the six sense fields cease contact ceases 
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases

The Astute and the Foolish

So there is the duality of this body and external name and form Contact depends on this duality When contacted through one or other of the six sense fields the fool experiences pleasure and pain
For an astute person hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving this body has been produced
So there is the duality of this body and external name and form Contact depends on this duality When contacted through one or other of the six sense fields the astute person experiences pleasure and pain

Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha
He is our guide and our refuge
Sir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then mendicants listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
For a fool hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving this body has been produced But the fool has not given up that ignorance or finished that craving
Why is that
The fool has not completed the spiritual journey for the complete ending of suffering
Therefore when their body breaks up the fool is reborn in another body
When reborn in another body theyre not freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Theyre not freed from suffering I say
For an astute person hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving this body has been produced But the astute person has given up that ignorance and finished that craving
Why is that
The astute person has completed the spiritual journey for the complete ending of suffering
Therefore when their body breaks up the astute person is not reborn in another body
Not being reborn in another body theyre freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Theyre freed from suffering I say

With Kassapa the Naked Ascetic

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for alms
The naked ascetic Kassapa saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one side and said to the Buddha
Id like to ask Master Gotama about a certain point if youd take the time to answer
Kassapa its the wrong time for questions
Weve entered an inhabited area
A second time
and a third time Kassapa spoke to the Buddha and the Buddha replied
When this was said Kassapa said to the Buddha
I dont want to ask much
Ask what you wish Kassapa
Well Master Gotama is suffering made by oneself
Not so Kassapa said the Buddha
Then is suffering made by another
Not so Kassapa said the Buddha
Well is suffering made by both oneself and another
Not so Kassapa said the Buddha
Then does suffering arise by chance not made by oneself or another
Not so Kassapa said the Buddha
Well is there no such thing as suffering
Its not that theres no such thing as suffering
Suffering is real
Then Master Gotama doesnt know nor see suffering
Its not that I dont know or see suffering
I do know suffering
I do see suffering
Master Gotama when asked these questions you say not so
Yet you say that there is such a thing as suffering
And you say that you do know suffering
and you do see suffering
Sir explain suffering to me
Teach me about suffering
Suppose that the person who does the deed experiences the result Then for one who has existed since the beginning suffering is made by oneself This statement leans toward eternalism
Suppose that one person does the deed and another experiences the result Then for one stricken by feeling suffering is made by another This statement leans toward annihilationism
Avoiding these two extremes the Realized One teaches by the middle way
Ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are a condition for consciousness 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over choices cease
When choices cease consciousness ceases 
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
When this was said Kassapa said to the Buddha
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Kassapa if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth the ordination in this teaching and training they must spend four months on probation
When four months have passed if the mendicants are satisfied theyll give the going forth the ordination into monkhood
However I have recognized individual differences
Sir if four months probation are required in such a case Ill spend four years on probation
When four years have passed if the mendicants are satisfied let them give me the going forth the ordination into monkhood
And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Not long after his ordination Venerable Kassapa living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected

The Ten Powers
With Bhūmija
At Sāvatthī
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Bhūmija came out of retreat went to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to him
Reverend Sāriputta there are ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds Some of them declare that pleasure and pain are made by oneself
Some of them declare that pleasure and pain are made by another
Some of them declare that pleasure and pain are made by both oneself and another
Some of them declare that pleasure and pain arise by chance not made by oneself or another
What does the Buddha say about this How does he explain it
How should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth How should we explain in line with his teaching with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Reverend the Buddha said that pleasure and pain are dependently originated
Dependent on what
Dependent on contact
If you said this you would repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth You would explain in line with his teaching and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain are made by oneself thats conditioned by contact 
In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain arise by chance not made by oneself or another thats also conditioned by contact
Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain are made by oneself its impossible that they will experience that without contact 
In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain arise by chance not made by oneself or another its impossible that they will experience that without contact
Venerable nanda heard this discussion between Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Bhūmija
Then Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed
Good good nanda Its just as Sāriputta has so rightly explained
I have said that pleasure and pain are dependently originated
Dependent on what
Dependent on contact
Saying this you would repeat what I have said and not misrepresent me with an untruth You would explain in line with my teaching and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism

nanda as long as theres a body the intention that gives rise to bodily action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself
As long as theres a voice the intention that gives rise to verbal action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself
As long as theres a mind the intention that gives rise to mental action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself But these only apply when conditioned by ignorance
By oneself one instigates the choice that gives rise to bodily verbal and mental action conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself
Or else others instigate the choice 
One consciously instigates the choice 
Or else one unconsciously instigates the choice 
Ignorance is included in all these things
But when ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over there is no body and no voice and no mind conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself
There is no field no ground no scope no basis conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself

Dependent Origination
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants I will teach you dependent origination
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
And what is dependent origination
Ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are a condition for consciousness
Consciousness is a condition for name and form
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields
The six sense fields are conditions for contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
Craving is a condition for grasping
Grasping is a condition for continued existence
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to be

Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come and experiences mental pain and sadness That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures
Anyone who steals creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come and experiences mental pain and sadness That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from stealing

That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
They have experiential confidence in the teaching
The teaching is well explained by the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha
The Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples is practicing the way thats good direct methodical and proper It consists of the four pairs the eight individuals This is the Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the world
And a noble disciples ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones unbroken impeccable spotless and unmarred liberating praised by sensible people not mistaken and leading to immersion

Second Uneducated
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned dispassionate and freed
Why is that
This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse to be taken up and laid to rest
Thats why when it comes to this body an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned dispassionate and freed
But when it comes to that which is called mind or sentience or consciousness an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned dispassionate or freed
Why is that
Because for a long time theyve been attached to it thought of it as their own and mistaken it
This is mine I am this this is my self
Thats why when it comes to this mind an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed
But an uneducated ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self rather than the mind
Why is that
This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year or for two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty or a hundred years or even longer
But that which is called mind or sentience or consciousness arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night
In this case a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself
When this exists that is due to the arising of this that arises
When this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases That is
Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops
Painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stops
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops
When you rub two sticks together heat is generated and fire is produced
But when you part the sticks and lay them aside any corresponding heat ceases and stops
In the same way pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops
Painful feeling 
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops
Seeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form feeling perception choices and consciousness
Being disillusioned desire fades away When desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence

Mendicants when the ocean surges it makes the rivers surge When the rivers surge they make the streams surge When the streams surge they make the lakes surge When the lakes surge they make the ponds surge
In the same way when ignorance surges it makes choices surge When choices surge they make consciousness surge When consciousness surges it makes name and form surge When name and form surge they make the six sense fields surge When the six sense fields surge they make contact surge When contact surges it makes feeling surge When feeling surges it makes craving surge When craving surges it makes grasping surge When grasping surges it makes continued existence surge When continued existence surges it makes rebirth surge When rebirth surges it makes old age and death surge
When the ocean recedes it makes the rivers recede When the rivers recede they make the streams recede When the streams recede they make the lakes recede When the lakes recede they make the ponds recede
In the same way when ignorance recedes it makes choices recede When choices recede they make consciousness recede When consciousness recedes it makes name and form recede When name and form recede they make the six sense fields recede When the six sense fields recede they make contact recede When contact recedes it makes feeling recede When feeling recedes it makes craving recede When craving recedes it makes grasping recede When grasping recedes it makes continued existence recede When continued existence recedes it makes rebirth recede When rebirth recedes it makes old age and death recede

I have Mahāli
But surely sir you must have seen someone who looked like Sakka
For Sakka is hard to see
Mahāli I understand Sakka And I understand the things that he undertook and committed to which enabled him to achieve the status of Sakka
In a former life when Sakka was a human being he was a brahmanical student named Magha Thats why hes called Maghavā
In a former life when Sakka was a human being he gave gifts carefully Thats why hes called Sakka the careful
In a former life when Sakka was a human being he gave gifts in stronghold after stronghold Thats why hes called Purindada the strongholdgiver
In a former life when Sakka was a human being he gave the gift of a guest house Thats why hes called Vāsava the houser
Sakka thinks of a thousand things in a moment Thats why hes called Sahassakkha ThousandEye
Sakkas wife is the demon maiden named Sujā Thats why hes called Sujampati Sujās husband
Sakka rules as sovereign lord over the gods of the ThirtyThree Thats why hes called lord of gods
In a former life when Sakka was a human being he undertook seven vows And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of Sakka
What seven
As long as I live may I support my parents
As long as I live may I honor the elders in the family
As long as I live may I speak gently
As long as I live may I not speak divisively
As long as I live may I live at home rid of the stain of stinginess freely generous openhanded loving to let go committed to charity loving to give and to share

The Banners Crest
At Sāvatthī
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Once upon a time mendicants a battle was fought between the gods and the demons
Then Sakka lord of gods addressed the gods of the ThirtyThree
Good sirs when the gods are fighting if you get scared or terrified just look up at my banners crest
Then your fear and terror will go away
If you cant see my banners crest then look up at the banners crest of Pajāpati king of gods
Then your fear and terror will go away
If you cant see his banners crest then look up at the banners crest of Varuṇa king of gods
Then your fear and terror will go away
If you cant see his banners crest then look up at the banners crest of sāna king of gods
Then your fear and terror will go away
However when they look up at those banners crests their fear and terror might go away or it might not
Why is that
Because Sakka is not free of greed hate and delusion He is fearful scared nervous quick to flee
But mendicants I say this
If youve gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut and you get scared or terrified just recollect me
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
Then your fear and terror will go away
If you cant recollect me then recollect the teaching
The teaching is well explained by the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
Then your fear and terror will go away
If you cant recollect the teaching then recollect the Saṅgha
The Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples is practicing the way thats good direct methodical and proper It consists of the four pairs the eight individuals This is the Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the world
Then your fear and terror will go away
Why is that
Because the Realized One is free of greed hate and delusion He is fearless brave bold and stands his ground
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
In the wilderness at a trees root
or an empty hut O mendicants
recollect the Buddha
and no fear will come to you
If you cant recollect the Buddha
the eldest in the world the bull of a man
then recollect the teaching
emancipating well taught
If you cant recollect the teaching
emancipating well taught
then recollect the Saṅgha
the supreme field of merit
Thus recollecting the Buddha
the teaching and the Saṅgha mendicants
fear and terror

Sakka took off his boots gave his sword to others and putting down his sunshade entered the hermitage through a gate he happened upon He stood downwind of those hermits revering them with joined palms
Then those hermits addressed Sakka in verse
When hermits have been long ordained

This ugly and deformed spirit is sitting on the throne of Sakka the lord of gods
But the more the gods complained the more attractive goodlooking and lovely that spirit became
So the gods went up to Sakka and told him what had happened adding
Surely good sir that must be the angereating spirit
Then Sakka went up to that spirit arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt with his right knee on the ground raised his joined palms toward the angereating spirit and pronounced his name three times
Good sir I am Sakka lord of gods Good sir I am Sakka the lord of gods
But the more Sakka pronounced his name the uglier and more deformed the spirit became
until eventually it vanished right there
Then Sakka lord of gods guiding the gods of the ThirtyThree recited this verse
My mind isnt easily upset
Im not easily drawn into the maelstrom
I dont get angry for long
anger doesnt last in me
When I do get angry I dont speak harshly

Then Vepacitti lord of demons said to Sakka lord of gods
Lord of gods let there be victory by fine words
Vepacitti let there be victory by fine words
Then the gods and the demons appointed a panel of judges saying
These will understand our good and bad statements
Then Vepacitti lord of demons said to Sakka lord of gods
Lord of gods recite a verse
When he said this Sakka said to him
Vepacitti you are the elder god here
Recite a verse
So Vepacitti recited this verse
Fools would vent even more
if theres noone to put a stop to them
So an intelligent person should stop
a fool with forceful punishment
The demons applauded Vepacittis verse while the gods kept silent
Then Vepacitti said to Sakka
Lord of gods recite a verse
So Sakka recited this verse
I think that this is the only way
to put a stop to a fool
when you know that the other is upset
be mindful and stay calm
The gods applauded Sakkas verse while the demons kept silent
Then Sakka said to Vepacitti
Vepacitti recite a verse
So Vepacitti recited this verse
I see this fault Vāsava
in just being patient
When a fool thinks
He puts up with me out of fear
the idiot will go after you even harder
like a cow chasing someone who runs away
The demons applauded Vepacittis verse while the gods kept silent
Then Vepacitti said to Sakka
Lord of gods recite a verse
So Sakka recited this verse
Let him think this if he wishes or not
He puts up with me out of fear
Of goals culminating in ones own good
none better than patience is found
When a strong person
puts up with a weakling
they call that the ultimate patience
for a weakling must always be patient
The strength of folly
is really just weakness they say
But noone can challenge a person
whos strong guarded by the teaching
When you get angry at an angry person
you just make things worse for yourself
When you dont get angry at an angry person
you win a battle hard to win
When you know that the other is angry
you act for the good of both
yourself and the other
if youre mindful and stay calm
People unfamiliar with the teaching
consider one who heals both
oneself and the other
to be a fool
The gods applauded Sakkas verses while the demons kept silent
Then the panel of judges consisting of both gods and demons said this
The verses spoken by Vepacitti
evoke punishment and violence Thats how you get arguments quarrels and disputes
The verses spoken by Sakka
dont evoke punishment and violence Thats how you stay free of arguments quarrels and disputes
Sakka lord of gods wins victory by fine words
And thats how Sakka came to win victory by fine words

Incinerated
Near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove
And then Sakka lord of gods went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side

When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease
When what is incinerated is there no sorrow
What is the one thing
whose killing you approve
When angers incinerated you sleep at ease

Bird Nests

Once upon a time mendicants a battle was fought between the gods and the demons
In that battle the demons won and the gods lost
Defeated the gods fled north with the demons in pursuit
Then Sakka lord of gods addressed his charioteer Mātali in verse
Mātali dont ram the bird nests
in the red silkcotton woods with your chariot pole
Id rather give up our lives to the demons
than deprive these birds of their nests
Yes lord replied Mātali And he turned the chariot back around with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds
Then the demons thought
Now Sakkas chariot has turned back
The demons will have to fight the gods a second time Terrified they retreated right away to the castle of the demons
And thats how Sakka came to win victory by principle

With Vepacitti
At Sāvatthī
Once upon a time mendicants a battle was fought between the gods and the demons
Then Vepacitti lord of demons addressed the demons
My good sirs if the demons defeat the gods in this battle bind Sakka the lord of gods by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the castle of demons
Meanwhile Sakka lord of gods addressed the gods of the ThirtyThree
My good sirs if the gods defeat the demons in this battle bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods
In that battle the gods won and the demons lost
So the gods of the ThirtyThree bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakkas presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods
And as Sakka was entering and leaving the hall Vepacitti abused and insulted him with rude harsh words
So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse
O Maghavā O Sakka
is it from fear or from weakness
that you put up with such harsh words
in the presence of Vepacitti
Its not out of fear or weakness
that Im patient with Vepacitti
For how can a sensible person like me
get in a fight with a fool
Fools would vent even more
if theres noone to put a stop to them
So a wise one should stop
a fool with forceful punishment
I think that this is the only way
to put a stop to a fool
when you know that the other is upset
be mindful and stay calm
I see this fault Vāsava
in just being patient
When a fool thinks
He puts up with me out of fear
the idiot will go after you even harder
like a cow chasing someone who runs away
Let him think this if he wishes or not
He puts up with me out of fear
Of goals culminating in ones own good
none better than patience is found
When a strong person
puts up with a weakling
they call that the ultimate patience
for a weakling must always be patient
The strength of folly
is really just weakness they say

So mendicants even Sakka lord of godswhile living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the ThirtyThreewill speak in praise of patience and gentleness
But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training it would be truly beautiful for you to be patient and gentle

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Once upon a time mendicants there was a poor person destitute and pitiful
They took up faith ethics learning generosity and wisdom in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One
After undertaking these things when their body broke up after death they were reborn in a good place a heavenly realm in the company of the gods of the ThirtyThree
There they outshone the other gods in beauty and glory
But the gods of the ThirtyThree complained grumbled and objected
Its incredible its amazing
For when this god was a human being in their past life they were poor destitute and pitiful
And when their body broke up after death they were reborn in a good place a heavenly realm in the company of the gods of the ThirtyThree
Here they outshine the other gods in beauty and glory
Then Sakka lord of gods addressed the gods of the ThirtyThree
Good sirs dont complain about this god
When this god was a human being in their past life they took up faith ethics learning generosity and wisdom in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One
After undertaking these things when their body broke up after death theyve been reborn in a good place a heavenly realm in the company of the gods of the ThirtyThree
Here they outshine the other gods in beauty and glory
Then Sakka lord of gods guiding the gods of the ThirtyThree recited this verse
Whoever has faith in the Realized One
unwavering and well grounded
whose ethical conduct is good
praised and loved by the noble ones
who has confidence in the Saṅgha
and correct view
theyre said to be prosperous
their life is not in vain
So let the wise devote themselves
to faith ethical behaviour

Hermits by the Ocean
At Sāvatthī
Once upon a time mendicants several hermits who were ethical of good character settled in leaf huts on the ocean shore
Now at that time a battle was fought between the gods and the demons
Then the hermits thought
The gods are principled the demons are unprincipled
We may be at risk from the demons
Why dont we approach Sambara lord of demons and beg him for a pledge of safety
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm those hermits vanished from those leaf huts on the ocean shore and reappeared in Sambaras presence
Then those hermits addressed Sambara in verse
The hermits have come to Sambara
to beg for a pledge of safety
For you can give them what you wish
whether danger or safety
There is no safety for hermits
the hated associates of Sakka
Though you beg me for your safety
Ill only give you fear
Though we beg you for our safety
you give us only fear
This is what we get from you
may endless peril come to you
Whatever kind of seed you sow
that is the fruit you reap
A doer of good gets good
a doer of bad gets bad
You have sown your own seed friend
now youll experience the fruit
Then those hermits having cursed Sambara as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from Sambaras presence and reappeared in those leaf huts on the ocean shore
But after being cursed by the hermits Sambara woke in alarm three times that night

But someone who has gained a footing and stands on dry land

Standing to one side the god Asama recited this verse about Pūraṇa Kassapa in the Buddhas presence
In injuring and killing here
in beating and extortion
Kassapa saw no evil

What he taught should truly be trusted
hes worthy of esteem as Teacher

Through mortification in disgust of sin he became well restrained
He gave up arguing with people
Refraining from false speech he spoke the truth
Surely such a man does no wrong

Disgusted at sin an alert mendicant
well restrained in the four controls

surely he can be no sinner

as well as this Makkhali and Pūraṇa
Teachers of communities attained ascetics
surely they werent far from truly good men
Then the god Vetambarī replied to the god koṭaka in verse
Though the wretched jackal howls along
it never equals the lion
A naked liar with suspicious conduct
though they teach a community doesnt resemble the good
Then Māra the Wicked took possession of the god Vetambarī and recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
Those dedicated to mortification in disgust of sin
safeguarding their seclusion
attached to form
they rejoice in the heavenly realm
Indeed those mortals give correct instructions
regarding the next world

Whatever forms there are in this world or the world beyond
and those of shining beauty in the sky
all of these you praise Namuci

Standing to one side the god Rohitassa said to the Buddha
Sir is it possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn
Reverend I say its not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn
Its incredible sir its amazing
how well said this was by Master Gotama
Once upon a time I was a hermit called Rohitassa son of Bhoja I was a skywalker with psychic power
I was as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a welltrained expert archer with a strong bow
My stride was such that it could span from the eastern ocean to the western ocean
This wish came to me
I will reach the end of the world by traveling
Having such speed and stride I traveled for my whole lifespan of a hundred yearspausing only to eat and drink go to the toilet and sleep to dispel wearinessand I passed away along the way never reaching the end of the world
Its incredible sir its amazing
how well said this was by Master Gotama
Reverend I say its not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn
But Reverend I also say theres no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world
For it is in this fathomlong carcass with its perception and mind that I describe the world its origin its cessation and the practice that leads to its cessation
The end of the world can never
be reached by traveling
But without reaching the end of the world
theres no release from suffering
So a clever person understanding the world
has completed the spiritual journey and gone to the end of the world
A peaceful one knowing the end of the world
does not hope for this world or the next

For one who has entered the homeless life

Such contentment Blessed One is hard to find

But its hard Blessed One to immerse this mind in samādhi
They become immersed in samādhi even though its hard

those who love calming the faculties
Having cut through the net of Death

But this path Blessed One is rough and hard to travel
Though its rough hard to travel
the noble ones Kāmada go on their way
The ignoble fall headfirst
on a rough path
But the path of the noble ones is smooth

With Tāyana
At Sāvatthī
Then late at night the glorious god Tāyana formerly a religious founder lighting up the entire Jetas Grove went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side
and recited these verses in the Buddhas presence
Strive and cut the stream
Dispel sensual pleasures brahmin
A sage who doesnt give up sensual pleasures
is not reborn in a unified state
If one is to do what should be done
one should staunchly strive
For the life gone forth when laxly led
just stirs up dust all the more
A bad deed is better left undone
for it will plague you later on
A good deed is better done
one that does not plague you
When kusa grass is wrongly grasped
it only cuts the hand
So too the ascetic life when wrongly taken
drags you to hell
Any lax act
any corrupt observance
or suspicious spiritual life
is not very fruitful
Thats what the god Tāyana said
Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right side before vanishing right there
Then when the night had passed the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened
Mendicants tonight the glorious god Tāyana formerly a religious founder lighting up the entire Jetas Grove came to me bowed stood to one side

Thats what the god Tāyana said Then he bowed and respectfully circled me keeping me on his right side before vanishing right there

So great king where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Sir there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with authority and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures They have attained stability in the country occupying a vast conquered territory Today I have been busy fulfilling the duties of such kings
What do you think great king
Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the east
Hed approach you and say
Please sir you should know this I come from the east
There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds And it was coming this way crushing all creatures
So then great king do what you must
Then a second trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the west 
a third from the north 
and a fourth from the south
Hed approach you and say
Please sir you should know this I come from the south
There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds And it was coming this way crushing all creatures
So then great king do what you must
Should such a dire threat arisea terrible loss of human life when human birth is so rarewhat would you do
Sir what could I do but practice the teachings practice morality doing skillful and good actions
I tell you great king I announce to you old age and death are advancing upon you
Since old age and death are advancing upon you what would you do
Sir what can I do but practice the teachings practice morality doing skillful and good actions
Sir there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with authority and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures They have attained stability in the country occupying a vast conquered territory Such kings engage in battles of elephants
or infantry
But there is no place no scope for such battles when old age and death are advancing
In this royal court there are ministers of wise counsel who are capable of dividing an approaching enemy by wise counsel
But there is no place no scope for such diplomatic battles when old age and death are advancing
In this royal court there is abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers Using this wealth we can pay off an approaching enemy
But there is no place no scope for such monetary battles when old age and death are advancing
When old age and death are advancing what can I do but practice the teachings practice morality doing skillful and good actions
Thats so true great king Thats so true
When old age and death are advancing what can you do but practice the teachings practice morality doing skillful and good actions
That is what the Buddha said
Suppose there were vast mountains
of solid rock touching the sky
drawing in from all sides
and crushing the four quarters
So too old age and death
advance upon all living creatures
aristocrats brahmins merchants
workers outcastes and scavengers
They spare nothing
They crush all beneath them
Theres nowhere for elephants to take a stand

They cant be defeated
by diplomatic battles or by wealth

When a bad person has acquired exceptional wealth they dont make themselves happy and pleased Nor do they make their mother and father partners and children bondservants workers and staff and friends and colleagues happy and pleased And they dont establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins thats conducive to heaven ripens in happiness and leads to heaven
Because they havent made proper use of that wealth rulers or bandits take it or fire consumes it or flood sweeps it away or unloved heirs take it
Since that wealth is not properly utilized its wasted not used
Suppose there was a lotus pond in an uninhabited region with clear sweet cool water clean with smooth banks delightful
But people dont collect it or drink it or bathe in it or use it for any purpose
Since that water is not properly utilized its wasted not used

Now at that time five kings headed by Pasenadi were amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation and this discussion came up among them
Whats the best of sensual pleasures
Some of them said
Sights are the best of sensual pleasures
Others said
Sounds are best
Others said
Smells are best
Others said
Tastes are best
Others said
Touches are best
Since those kings were unable to persuade each other
King Pasenadi said to them
Come good sirs lets go to the Buddha and ask him about this
As he answers so well remember it
Yes dear sir replied those kings
Then those five kings headed by Pasenadi went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
King Pasenadi reported their conversation to the Buddha and said
Sir whats the best of sensual pleasures
Great king which kind of sensual stimulation is best is defined by which is most agreeable I say
The very same sights that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others
When youre happy with certain sights as youve got all you wished for you dont want any other sight thats better or finer
For you those sights are perfect
and supreme
The very same sounds 
touches that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others
When youre happy with certain touches as youve got all you wished for you dont want any other touch thats better or finer
For you those touches are perfect

Now at that time the lay follower Candanaṅgalika was sitting in that assembly
Then he got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
I feel inspired to speak Blessed One I feel inspired to speak Holy One
Then speak as you feel inspired said the Buddha
Then the lay follower Candanaṅgalika extolled the Buddha in his presence with an appropriate verse
Like a fragrant pink lotus
that blooms in the morning its fragrance unfaded
see Aṅgīrasa shine
bright as the sun in the sky
Then those five kings clothed Candanaṅgalika with five upper robes

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Does Master Gotama claim to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening
If anyone should rightly be said to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening its me
For great king I have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening
Well there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community and teach a community Theyre wellknown and famous religious founders regarded as holy by many people That is
Pūraṇa Kassapa Makkhali Gosāla Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta Pakudha Kaccāyana and Ajita Kesakambala
I also asked them whether they claimed to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening but they made no such claim
So why do you given that youre so young in age and newly gone forth
Great king these four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young
What four
An aristocrat
and a mendicant
These four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
A man should not despise
an aristocrat of impeccable lineage
highborn and famous
just because theyre young
For its possible that that lord of men
as aristocrat will gain the throne
And in his anger hell execute a royal punishment
and have you violently beaten
Hence you should avoid him
for the sake of your own life
Whether in village or wilderness
wherever a serpent is seen
a man should not look down on it
or despise it for its youth
With its rainbow of colors
the snake of fiery breath glides along
It lashes out and bites the fool
both men and women alike
Hence you should avoid it
for the sake of your own life
A fire devours a huge amount
a conflagration with a blackened trail
A man should not look down on it
just because its young
For once it gets fuel
itll become a huge conflagration
Itll lash out and burn the fool
both men and women alike
Hence you should avoid it
for the sake of your own life
When a forest is burned by fire
a conflagration with a blackened trail
the shoots will spring up there again
with the passing of the days and nights
But if a mendicant endowed with ethics
burns you with their power
youll have no sons or cattle
nor will your heirs find wealth
Childless and heirless you become
like a palmtree stump
Thats why an astute person
seeing whats good for themselves
would always treat these properly
a snake a conflagration
a famous aristocrat
and a mendicant endowed with ethics
When this was said King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Buddha
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways

Sir where should a gift be given
Wherever your heart feels inspired great king
But sir where is a gift very fruitful
Where a gift should be given is one thing great king but where a gift is very fruitful is another
A gift is very fruitful when its given to an ethical person not so much to an unethical person
Well then great king Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think great king
Suppose you were at war ready to fight a battle
Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is untrained inexpert unfit inexperienced And hes fearful scared nervous quick to flee
Would you employ such a man Would he be of any use to you
No sir I would have no use for such a man
What about a brahmin youth
a merchant youth
or a worker youth who was similar
No sir I would have no use for such a man

What about a brahmin youth
a merchant youth

In the same way a gift to anyone who has given up five factors and possesses five factors is very fruitful no matter what family theyve gone forth from
What are the five factors theyve given up
Sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse and doubt
These are the five factors theyve given up
What are the five factors they possess
The entire spectrum of an adepts ethics immersion wisdom freedom and knowledge and vision of freedom
These are the five factors they possess
I say that a gift to anyone who has given up these five factors and possesses these five factors is very fruitful
That is what the Buddha said
Any youth skilled at archery
powerful and vigorous
would be employed by a king going to war
one is not a coward because of ones birth
Just so whoever is settled
in the qualities of patience and gentleness
a clever person with noble conduct
should be venerated even if theyre low born
You should build lovely hermitages
and settle learned people in them
You should set up water supplies in barren regions
and passages in places hard to travel
Food drink edibles
clothes and lodgings
should be given to the upright ones
with a clear and confident heart
The thundering rain cloud
its hundred peaks wreathed in lightning
pours down over the rich earth
soaking the uplands and valleys
So too an astute person
faithful and learned
should prepare a meal to satisfy
renunciates with food and drink
Rejoicing they strew gifts about
crying Give give
For that is their thunder
like the gods when it rains

Seven MattedHair Ascetics
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and sat outside the gate
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
Now at that time seven mattedhair ascetics seven Jain ascetics seven naked ascetics seven onecloth ascetics and seven wanderers passed by not far from the Buddha Their armpits and bodies were hairy and their nails were long and they carried their stuff with shoulderpoles
Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt with his right knee on the ground raised his joined palms toward those various ascetics and pronounced his name three times
Sirs I am Pasenadi king of Kosala  I am Pasenadi king of Kosala
Then soon after those ascetics had left King Pasenadi went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir are they among those in the world who are perfected ones or who are on the path to perfection
Great king as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures living at home with your children using sandalwood imported from Kāsi wearing garlands perfumes and makeup and accepting gold and money its hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection
You can get to know a persons ethics by living with them
But only after a long time not casually only when paying attention not when inattentive and only by the wise not the witless
You can get to know a persons purity by dealing with them

You can get to know a persons resilience in times of trouble

You can get to know a persons wisdom by discussion
But only after a long time not casually only when paying attention not when inattentive and only by the wise not the witless
Its incredible sir its amazing
how well said this was by the Buddha 
Sir these are my spies my undercover agents returning after spying on the country
First they go undercover then I have them report to me
And nowwhen they have washed off the dust and dirt and are nicely bathed and anointed with hair and beard dressed and dressed in whitethey will amuse themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation
Then knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses
Its not easy to know a man by his appearance
You shouldnt trust them at first sight
For undisciplined men live in this world
disguised as the disciplined
Like a fake earring made of clay
like a copper penny coated with gold
they live hidden in the world

Second Battle
Then King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala
When King Pasenadi heard of this
he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu
Then the two kings met in battle
And in that battle Pasenadi defeated Ajātasattu and captured him alive
Then King Pasenadi thought
Even though Ive never betrayed this King Ajātasattu he betrayed me Still he is my nephew
Now that Ive vanquished all of Ajātasattus elephant troops cavalry chariots and infantry why dont I let him loose with just his life
And thats what he did
Then several mendicants 
told the Buddha what had happened
Then knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses
A man goes on plundering
as long as it serves his ends
But as soon as others plunder him
the plunderer is plundered
For the fool thinks theyve got away with it
so long as their wickedness has not ripened
But as soon as that wickedness ripens
they fall into suffering
A killer creates a killer
a conqueror creates a conqueror
an abuser creates abuse
and a bully creates a bully
And so as deeds unfold
the plunderer is plundered

Those who do bad things by way of body speech and mind

Sacrifice
At Sāvatthī
Now at that time a big sacrifice had been set up for King Pasenadi of Kosala Five hundred chief bulls five hundred bullocks five hundred heifers five hundred goats and five hundred rams had been led to the pillar for the sacrifice
His bondservants employees and workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger weeping with tearful faces
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes entered Sāvatthī for alms
Then after the meal when they returned from almsround they went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what was happening
Then knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses
Horse sacrifice human sacrifice
the sacrifices of the stickcasting

these huge violent sacrifices yield no great fruit
The great sages of good conduct
dont attend sacrifices
where goats sheep and cattle
and various creatures are killed

Second Childless
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha in the middle of the day  The Buddha said to him
So great king where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Sir here in Sāvatthī a financier householder has passed away
Since he died childless I have come after transferring his fortune to the royal compound
There was ten million in gold not to mention the silver
And yet that financier ate meals of
rough gruel with pickles
He wore clothes consisting of
three pieces of sunn hemp
He traveled around in a vehicle that was
a dilapidated little cart holding a leaf as sunshade
Thats so true great king Thats so true
Once upon a time great king that financier householder provided almsfood on behalf of a Buddha awakened for himself named Tagarasikhī
He instructed Give alms to that ascetic before getting up from his seat and leaving
But after giving he regretted it
It would have been better to feed the bondservants or workers with that almsfood
Whats more he murdered his brothers only child for the sake of his fortune
Because that financier provided Tagarasikhī with almsfood as a result of that deed he was reborn seven times in a good place a heavenly realm
And as a residual result of that same deed he held the position of financier seven times right here in Sāvatthī
But because that financier regretted giving alms
as a result of that deed his mind didnt tend to enjoy nice food clothes vehicles or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation
And because that financier murdered his brothers only child for the sake of his fortune as a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years for many hundreds many thousands many hundreds of thousands of years
And as a residual result of that same deed he is childless for the seventh time his fortune ending up in the royal treasury
Now the old merit of that financier has been used up and he hasnt accumulated new merit
Today great king that financier burns in the Great Hell of Screams
Really sir that financier has been reborn in the Great Hell of Screams
Yes he has great king
That is what the Buddha said 
Grain wealth silver and gold
or whatever other possessions there are
bondservants workers employees
and those dependent for their livelihood
you must go on without taking these
all of them are left behind
But the deeds you do
by body speech and mind
thats what you can call your own

Just now sir as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind
The teaching is well explained by the Buddha But its for someone with good friends companions and associates not for someone with bad friends companions and associates
Thats so true great king Thats so true said the Buddha And he repeated the kings statement adding
Great king this one time I was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Townsville
Then the mendicant nanda came to me bowed sat down to one side and said
Sir good friends companions and associates are half the spiritual life
When he had spoken I said to him
Not so nanda Not so nanda
Good friends companions and associates are the whole of the spiritual life
A mendicant with good friends companions and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path
And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path
Its when a mendicant develops right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion which rely on seclusion fading away and cessation and ripen as letting go
Thats how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path
And heres another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life
For by relying on me as a good friend sentient beings who are liable to rebirth old age and death to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress are freed from all these things
This is another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life
So great king you should train like this
I will have good friends companions and associates
Thats how you should train
When you have good friends companions and associates you should live supported by one thing
diligence in skillful qualities
When youre diligent supported by diligence your ladies of the harem
aristocrat vassals
and people of town and country will think
The king lives diligently supported by diligence
Wed better live diligently supported by diligence
When youre diligent supported by diligence then not only you yourself
but your ladies of the harem and your treasury and storehouses will be guarded and protected
That is what the Buddha said 
For one who desires a continuous flow
of exceptional wealth
the astute praise diligence
in making merit
Being diligent an astute person
secures both benefits
the benefit in this life
and in lives to come

Someone who pretends

We have made a mistake sir It was foolish stupid and unskillful of us to imagine we could attack the Buddha
Please sir accept our mistake for what it is so we will restrain ourselves in future

If you dont give your pardon

If no mistake is found

But he endured unperturbed with mindfulness and situational awareness
And then he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware
Then late at night several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group lighting up the entire Maddukucchi went up to the Buddha bowed and stood to one side

Then late at night several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group lighting up the entire Jetas Grove went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side
and recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
Associate only with the virtuous
Try to get close to the virtuous
Understanding the true teaching of the good
things get better not worse
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
Associate only with the virtuous

Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddhas presence

The Garden of Delight
With Samiddhi
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery
Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe
When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself
Then late at night a glorious deity lighting up the entire hot springs went up to Samiddhi and standing in the air addressed him in verse
Mendicant you seek alms before you eat
you wouldnt seek alms after eating
But you should eat first then seek alms
dont let the time pass you by
I actually dont know the time
its hidden and unseen
Thats why I seek alms before eating
so that the time may not pass me by
Then that deity landed on the ground and said to Samiddhi
Youve gone forth while young mendicant Youre blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of life and youve never flirted with sensual pleasures
Enjoy human sensual pleasures
Dont give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time
Im not good sir
Im giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present
For the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures take effect over time with much suffering and distress and theyre all the more full of drawbacks
But this teaching is visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
But in what way mendicant has the Buddha said that sensual pleasures take effect over time with much suffering and distress and theyre all the more full of drawbacks
And how is this teaching visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
Im junior good sir recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and training
Im not able to explain this in detail
But the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha is staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monatery
You should go to him and ask about this matter
And you should remember it in line with the Buddhas answer
Its not easy for us to approach the Buddha as he is surrounded by other illustrious deities
If you go to the Buddha and ask him about this matter well come along and listen to the teaching
Yes good sir Venerable Samiddhi replied
He went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened Then he added
Sir if that deity spoke the truth hell be close by
When he had spoken that deity said to Samiddhi
Ask mendicant ask For I have arrived
Then the Buddha addressed the deity in verse
Sentient beings who perceive the communicable
become established in the communicable
Not understanding the communicable
they fall under the yoke of Death
But having fully understood the communicable
they dont identify as a communicator
for they have nothing
by which they might be described
Tell me if you understand spirit
I dont understand the detailed meaning of the Buddhas brief statement
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning
If you think that Im equal
special or worse youll get into arguments
Unwavering in the face of the three discriminations
youll have no thought Im equal or special
Tell me if you understand spirit
I dont understand the detailed meaning of the Buddhas brief statement
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning
Judging is given up conceit rejected
craving for name and form is cut off right here
Theyve cut the ties untroubled and free of hope
Though gods and humans search for them
in this world and the world beyond they never find them
not in heaven nor in any abode
Tell me if you understand spirit
This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddhas brief statement
You should never do anything bad
by speech or mind or body in all the world
Having given up sensual pleasures mindful and aware
you shouldnt keep doing whats painful and pointless

The Satullapa Group
The Congregation
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants all of whom were perfected ones
And most of the deities from ten solar systems had gathered to see the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants
Then four deities of the Pure Abodes aware of what was happening thought
Why dont we go to the Buddha and each recite a verse in his presence
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm they vanished from the Pure Abodes and reappeared in front of the Buddha
They bowed to the Buddha and stood to one side
Standing to one side one deity recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
Theres a great congregation in the woods
a host of gods have assembled
Weve come to this righteous congregation
to see the invincible Saṅgha
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
The mendicants there have immersion
theyve straightened out their own minds
Like a charioteer who has taken the reins
the astute ones protect their senses
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
Having cut the stake and cut the bar
theyre unstirred with boundary post uprooted
They live pure and immaculate
the young dragons tamed by the seer
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
Anyone who has gone to the Buddha for refuge
wont go to a plane of loss
After giving up this human body
they swell the hosts of gods

Sentient Beings
At Sāvatthī
Seated to one side Venerable Rādha said to the Buddha
Sir they speak of this thing called a sentient being
How is a sentient being defined
Rādha when you cling strongly cling to desire greed relishing and craving for form then a being is spoken of
When you cling strongly cling to desire greed relishing and craving for feeling 
consciousness then a being is spoken of
Suppose some boys or girls were playing with sandcastles
As long as theyre not rid of greed desire fondness thirst passion and craving for those sandcastles they cherish them fancy them treasure them and treat them as their own
But when they are rid of greed desire fondness thirst passion and craving for those sandcastles they scatter destroy and demolish them with their hands and feet making them unplayable
In the same way you should scatter destroy and demolish form making it unplayable And you should practice for the ending of craving
You should scatter destroy and demolish feeling 
consciousness making it unplayable And you should practice for the ending of craving
For the ending of craving is extinguishment

Senior Mendicants

At Sāvatthī
Now at that time Venerable Tissa the Buddhas paternal cousin informed several mendicants
Reverends my body feels like its drugged Im disorientated the teachings dont inspire me and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied and have doubts about the teachings
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk
Please monk in my name tell the mendicant Tissa that the Teacher summons him
Yes sir that monk replied He went to Tissa and said to him
Reverend Tissa the teacher summons you
Yes reverend Tissa replied
He went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to him
Is it really true Tissa that you informed several mendicants that
your body feels like its drugged 
and you have doubts about the teachings
Yes sir
What do you think Tissa
If youre not rid of greed desire fondness thirst passion and craving for form when that form decays and perishes will it give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Yes sir
Good good Tissa
Thats how it is Tissa
when youre not rid of greed for form
If youre not rid of greed for feeling 
consciousness when that consciousness decays and perishes will it give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Yes sir

Suppose Tissa there were two people
One was not skilled in the path the other was
The one not skilled in the path would question the one skilled in the path
who would reply
Come good man this is the path
Go down it a little
and youll see a fork in the road Ignore the left and take the righthand path
Go a little further
and youll see a dark forest grove
Go a little further
and youll see an expanse of lowlying marshes
Go a little further
and youll see a large steep cliff
Go a little further
and youll see level cleared parkland
Ive made up this simile to make a point
And this is what it means
A person who is not skilled in the path is a term for an ordinary uneducated person
A person who is skilled in the path is a term for the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
A fork in the road is a term for doubt
The lefthand path is a term for the wrong eightfold path that is
wrong view  wrong immersion
The righthand path is a term for the noble eightfold path that is
right view  right immersion
A dark forest grove is a term for ignorance
An expanse of lowlying marshes is a term for sensual pleasures
A large steep cliff is a term for anger and distress
Level cleared parkland is a term for extinguishment

Nakulas Father
Nakulas Father
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill in the deer park at Bhesakaḷās Wood
Then the householder Nakulas father went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Sir Im an old man elderly and senior Im advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life My body is ailing and Im constantly unwell
I hardly ever get to see the esteemed mendicants
May the Buddha please advise me
and instruct me
It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness
Thats so true householder Thats so true householder
For this body is ailing trapped in its shell
If anyone dragging around this body claimed to be healthy even for a minute whats that but foolishness
So you should train like this
Though my body is ailing my mind will be healthy
Thats how you should train
And then the householder Nakulas father approved and agreed with what the Buddha said
He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right Then he went up to Venerable Sāriputta bowed and sat down to one side Sāriputta said to him
Householder your faculties are so very clear
and your complexion is pure and bright
Did you get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Buddhas presence today
What else sir could it possibly be
Just now the Buddha anointed me with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk
But what kind of ambrosial Dhamma talk has the Buddha anointed you with
So Nakulas father told Sāriputta all that had happened and said
Thats the ambrosial Dhamma talk that the Buddha anointed me with
But didnt you feel the need to ask the Buddha the further question
Sir how do you define someone ailing in body and ailing in mind and someone ailing in body and healthy in mind
Sir we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta
May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this
Well then householder listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Nakulas father
Sāriputta said this
And how is a person ailing in body and ailing in mind
Its when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the qualities of a noble one Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the qualities of a good person
They regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in form
Theyre obsessed with the thought I am form form is mine
But that form of theirs decays and perishes
which gives rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
They regard feeling as self self as having feeling feeling in self or self in feeling
Theyre obsessed with the thought I am feeling feeling is mine
But that feeling of theirs decays and perishes

Theyre obsessed with the thought I am consciousness consciousness is mine

And how is a person ailing in body and healthy in mind
Its when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons
They dont regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in form

it doesnt give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress

Involvement
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants if youre involved youre not free If youre not involved youre free
As long as consciousness remains it would remain involved with form supported by form founded on form And with a sprinkle of relishing it would grow increase and mature
Or consciousness would remain involved with feeling 
Or consciousness would remain involved with perception 
Or as long as consciousness remains it would remain involved with choices supported by choices grounded on choices And with a sprinkle of relishing it would grow increase and mature
Mendicants suppose you say
Apart from form feeling perception and choices I will describe the coming and going of consciousness its passing away and reappearing its growth increase and maturity That is not possible
If a mendicant has given up greed for the form element
the support is cut off and there is no foundation for consciousness
If a mendicant has given up greed for the feeling element 
perception element 
choices element 
consciousness element
the support is cut off and there is no foundation for consciousness
Since that consciousness does not become established and does not grow with no power to regenerate it is freed
Being free its stable
Being stable its content
Being content theyre not anxious
Not being anxious they personally become extinguished

The Perception of Impermanence
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants when the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it eliminates all desire for sensual pleasures for rebirth in the realm of luminous form and for rebirth in a future life It eliminates all ignorance and eradicates all conceit I am
In the autumn a farmer ploughing with a large plough shears through all the root networks
In the same way when the perception of impermanence is developed  it eradicates all conceit I am
A reedcutter having cut the reeds grabs them at the top and shakes them down shakes them about and shakes them off
In the same way when the perception of impermanence is developed  it eradicates all conceit I am
When the stalk of a bunch of mangoes is cut all the mangoes attached to the stalk will follow along
In the same way when the perception of impermanence is developed  it eradicates all conceit I am
The rafters of a bungalow all lean to the peak slope to the peak and meet at the peak so the peak is said to be the topmost of them all
In the same way when the perception of impermanence is developed  it eradicates all conceit I am

After the rainy season the sky is clear and cloudless And when the sun rises it dispels all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates
In the same way when the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it eliminates all desire for sensual pleasures for rebirth in the realm of luminous form and for rebirth in a future life It eliminates all ignorance and eradicates all conceit I am
And how is the perception of impermanence developed and cultivated so that  it eradicates all conceit I am
Such is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of form
Such is feeling

Senior Mendicants
With Yamaka
At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time a mendicant called Yamaka had the following harmful misconception
As I understand the Buddhas teaching a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up and doesnt exist after death
Several mendicants heard about this
They went to Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side and said to him
Is it really true Reverend Yamaka that you have such a harmful misconception
As I understand the Buddhas teaching a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up and doesnt exist after death
Yes reverends thats how I understand the Buddhas teaching
Dont say that Yamaka Dont misrepresent the Buddha for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good
And the Buddha would not say that
But even though admonished by those mendicants Yamaka obstinately stuck to that misconception and insisted on stating it
When those mendicants were unable to dissuade Yamaka from that misconception they got up from their seats and went to see Venerable Sāriputta They told him what had happened and said
May Venerable Sāriputta please go to the mendicant Yamaka out of compassion
Sāriputta consented in silence
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat went to Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him Seated to one side he said to Yamaka
Is it really true Reverend Yamaka that you have such a harmful misconception
As I understand the Buddhas teaching a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up and doesnt exist after death
Yes reverend thats how I understand the Buddhas teaching
What do you think Yamaka
Is form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent reverend
Is feeling 
consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent reverend
So you should truly see 
Seeing this 
They understand  there is no return to any state of existence
What do you think Reverend Yamaka
Do you regard the Realized One as form
No reverend
Do you regard the Realized One as feeling 
consciousness
No reverend
What do you think Reverend Yamaka
Do you regard the Realized One as in form
No reverend
Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form
No reverend
Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling 
or distinct from feeling 
or distinct from perception 
as in choices 
or distinct from choices 
as in consciousness
No reverend
Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from consciousness
No reverend
What do you think Yamaka
Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form feeling perception choices and consciousness
No reverend
What do you think Yamaka
Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form feeling perception choices and consciousness
No reverend
In that case Reverend Yamaka since you dont acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life is it appropriate to declare
As I understand the Buddhas teaching a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up and doesnt exist after death
Reverend Sāriputta in my ignorance I used to have that misconception
But now that Ive heard the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta Ive given up that misconception and Ive comprehended the teaching
Reverend Yamaka suppose they were to ask you
When their body breaks up after death what happens to a perfected one who has ended the defilements
How would you answer
Sir if they were to ask this
Id answer like this
Reverend form is impermanent
Whats impermanent is suffering
Whats suffering has ceased and ended
consciousness is impermanent
Whats impermanent is suffering
Whats suffering has ceased and ended
Thats how Id answer such a question
Good good Reverend Yamaka
Well then I shall give you a simile to make the meaning even clearer
Suppose there was a householder or householders son who was rich with a lot of money and great wealth
and a bodyguard for protection
Then along comes a person who wants to harm injure and threaten him and take his life
Theyd think
This householder or householders son is rich with a lot of money and great wealth
and a bodyguard for protection
It wont be easy to take his life by force
Why dont I get close to him then take his life
So he goes up to that householder or householders son and says
Sir I would serve you
Then they would serve that householder or householders son
Theyd get up before him and go to bed after him and be obliging behaving nicely and speaking politely
The householder or householders son would consider them as a friend
and companion
and come to trust them
But when that person realizes that
theyve gained the trust of the householder or householders son then when they know hes alone theyd take his life with a sharp knife
What do you think Yamaka
When that person went to the householder or householders son and offered to
serve him werent they a killer then
though he didnt know that
this was his killer
And when they got up before him and went to bed after him being obliging behaving nicely and speaking politely werent they a killer then
though he didnt know that
this was his killer
And when knowing he was alone they took his life with a sharp knife werent they a killer then
though he didnt know that
this was his killer
Yes reverend

At Devadaha
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Devadaha
Then several mendicants who were heading for the west went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there
But mendicants have you consulted with Sāriputta
No sir we havent
You should consult with Sāriputta
Hes astute and supports his spiritual companions the mendicants
Yes sir they replied
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was meditating not far from the Buddha in a clump of golden shower trees
And then those mendicants approved and agreed with what the Buddha said They got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right Then they went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side and said to him
Reverend Sāriputta we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there
We have consulted with the Teacher
Reverends there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad
astute aristocrats brahmins householders and ascetics
for astute people are inquisitive
But what does the venerables Teacher teach What does he explain I trust the venerables have properly heard learned attended and remembered the teachings and penetrated them with wisdom That way when answering you will repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth You will explain in line with the teaching with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Reverend we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta
May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this
Well then reverends listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes reverend they replied

If those who acquired and kept unskillful qualities were to live happily in the present life free of anguish distress and fever and if when their body breaks up after death they could expect to go to a good place the Buddha would not praise giving up unskillful qualities
But since those who acquire and keep unskillful qualities live unhappily in the present life full of anguish distress and fever and since when their body breaks up after death they can expect to go to a bad place the Buddha praises giving up unskillful qualities
If those who embraced and kept skillful qualities were to live unhappily in the present life full of anguish distress and fever and if when their body breaks up after death they could expect to go to a bad place the Buddha would not praise embracing skillful qualities
But since those who embrace and keep skillful qualities live happily in the present life free of anguish distress and fever and since when their body breaks up after death they can expect to go to a good place the Buddha praises embracing skillful qualities
This is what Venerable Sāriputta said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta said

Senior Mendicants
With Vakkali
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Now at that time Venerable Vakkali was staying in a potters shed and he was sick suffering gravely ill
Then he addressed his carers
Please reverends go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to him
Sir the mendicant Vakkali is sick suffering and gravely ill He bows with his head to your feet
And then say
Sir please go to the mendicant Vakkali out of compassion
Yes reverend those monks replied
They did as he asked
The Buddha consented in silence
Then the Buddha robed up and taking his bowl and robes went to Venerable Vakkali
Venerable Vakkali saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and tried to rise on his cot
But the Buddha said to him
Its all right Vakkali dont get up
There are some seats spread out I will sit there
He sat on the seat spread out and said to Vakkali
Vakkali I hope youre keeping well I hope youre alright And I hope the pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growing
Sir Im not all right Im not getting by My pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing is apparent not its fading
I hope you dont have any remorse or regret
Indeed sir I have no little remorse and regret
I hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct
No sir I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct
In that case Vakkali why do you have remorse and regret
For a long time Ive wanted to go and see the Buddha but I was physically too weak
Enough Vakkali Why would you want to see this rotten body
One who sees the teaching sees me
One who sees me sees the teaching
Seeing the teaching you see me
Seeing me you see the teaching
What do you think Vakkali
Is form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir 
So you should truly see 
Seeing this 
They understand  there is no return to any state of existence
And then after giving Venerable Vakkali this advice the Buddha got up from his seat and went to the Vultures Peak Mountain
Then Venerable Vakkali addressed his carers
Come on reverends lift my cot and take me to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili
Its unthinkable for one like me to die in an inhabited area
Yes reverend replied those mendicants and did as he asked
Meanwhile the Buddha spent the rest of that night and day on Vultures Peak Mountain
Then late at night two glorious deities lighting up the entire Vultures Peak went up to the Buddha bowed and stood to one side
One deity said to him
Sir the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation
And another deity said to him
Hell definitely be wellfreed
This is what those deities said
Then they bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right side before vanishing right there
Then when the night had passed the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Come mendicants go to the mendicant Vakkali and tell him
Vakkali hear the word of the Buddha and two deities
Late last night two glorious deities lighting up the entire Vultures Peak went up to the Buddha bowed and stood to one side
One deity said to him
Sir the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation
And another deity said to him
Hell definitely be wellfreed
And the Buddha said
Do not fear Vakkali
do not fear
Your death will not be a bad one your passing will not be a bad one
Yes sir those monks replied They went to Vakkali and said to him
Vakkali hear the word of the Buddha and two deities
Then Vakkali addressed his carers
Please reverends help me off my cot
Its unthinkable for one like me to listen to the Buddhas instructions sitting on a high seat
Yes reverend replied those mendicants and helped him off his cot
They repeated what the Buddha had said
Vakkali said Well then reverends in my name bow with your head to the Buddhas feet Say to him
Sir the mendicant Vakkali is sick suffering gravely ill
He bows with his head to your feet
And then say
Form is impermanent
I have no doubt of that
Im certain that what is impermanent is suffering
And Im certain that I have no desire or greed or fondness for what is impermanent suffering and perishable
Feeling is impermanent 
Choices are impermanent 
Consciousness is impermanent
I have no doubt of that
Im certain that what is impermanent is suffering
And Im certain that I have no desire or greed or fondness for what is impermanent suffering and perishable
Yes reverend those monks replied and left
And then not long after those mendicants had left Venerable Vakkali slit his wrists
Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha and told him Vakkalis message
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Come mendicants lets go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili
where Vakkali the gentleman slit his wrists
Yes sir they replied
Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili
The Buddha saw Vakkali off in the distance lying on his cot having cast off the aggregates
Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east west north south above below and inbetween
The Buddha said to the mendicants
Mendicants do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east west north south above below and inbetween
Yes sir
Thats Māra the Wicked searching for Vakkalis consciousness wondering
Where is Vakkalis consciousness established
But since his consciousness is not established Vakkali is extinguished

Anxiety Because of Grasping
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants I will teach you how grasping leads to anxiety and how not grasping leads to freedom from anxiety
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
And how does grasping lead to anxiety
Its when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons
They regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in form
But that form of theirs decays and perishes
and consciousness latches on to the perishing of form
Anxieties occupy their mind born of latching on to the perishing of form and originating in accordance with natural principles
So they become frightened worried concerned and anxious because of grasping
They regard feeling as self 
They regard perception as self 
They regard choices as self 
They regard consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousness
But that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes
and consciousness latches on to the perishing of consciousness
Anxieties occupy their mind born of latching on to the perishing of consciousness and originating in accordance with natural principles
So they become frightened worried concerned and anxious because of grasping
Thats how grasping leads to anxiety
And how does not grasping lead to freedom from anxiety
Its when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons
They dont regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in form
When that form of theirs decays and perishes
consciousness doesnt latch on to the perishing of form
Anxietiesborn of latching on to the perishing of form and originating in accordance with natural principlesdont occupy their mind
So they dont become frightened worried concerned or anxious because of grasping
They dont regard feeling as self 
They dont regard perception as self 
They dont regard choices as self 
They dont regard consciousness as self 
When that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes
consciousness doesnt latch on to the perishing of consciousness
