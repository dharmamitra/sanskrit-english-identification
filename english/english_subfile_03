Janussonin the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama you know that we brahmans give gifts make offerings May this gift accrue to our dead relativesMay our dead relatives partake of this gift Now Master Gotama does that gift accrue to our dead relativesDo our dead relatives partake of that giftIn possible places brahman it accrues to them but not in impossible placesAnd which Master Gotama are the possible placesWhich are the impossible placesThere is the case brahman where a certain person takes life takes what is not given engages in sensual misconduct engages in false speech engages in divisive speech engages in abusive speech engages in idle chatter is covetous bears ill will and has wrong viewsWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in hellHe lives there he remains there by means of whatever is the food of hellbeingsThis is an impossible place for that gift to accrue to one staying thereThen there is the case where a certain person takes life takes what is not given

death he reappears in the realms of the hungry shadesHe lives there he remains there by means of whatever is the food of hungry shadesHe lives there he remains that by means of whatever his friends or relatives give in dedication to himThis is the possible place for that gift to accrue to one staying thereBut Master Gotama if that dead relative does not reappear in that possible place who partakes of that giftOther dead relatives brahman who have reappeared in that possible placeBut Master Gotama if that dead relative does not reappear in that possible place and other dead relatives have not reappeared in that possible place then who partakes of that giftIts impossible brahman it cannot be that over this long time that possible place is devoid of ones dead relativesBut at any rate the donor does not go without rewardDoes Master Gotama describe any preparation for the impossible placesBrahman I do describe a preparation for the impossible placesThere is the case where a certain person takes life takes what is not given engages in sensual misconduct engages in false speech engages in divisive speech engages in abusive speech engages in idle chatter is covetous bears ill will

Master Gotama its astounding how its enough to make one want to give a gift enough to make one want to make an offering where the donor does not go without rewardThats the way it is brahmanThats the way it isThe donor does not go without rewardMagnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeTranslators note According to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta Cunda the silversmith at a later date presented the Buddha with the final meal before his total liberationI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Pava in Cunda the silversmiths mango groveThen Cunda the silversmith went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Cunda of whose rites of purification do you approveThe brahmans of the Western lands lord  those who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants worship fire  purify with water they have declared purification rites of which I approveAnd what kind of purification rites have they declared those brahmans of the Western lands who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants worship fire  purify with waterThere is the case where the brahmans of the Western lands get their disciples to undertake their practice thus Come now my good man Get up at the proper time from your bed and touch the earthIf you dont touch the earth touch wet cow dungIf you dont touch wet cow dung touch green grassIf you dont touch green grass worship a fireIf you dont worship a fire pay homage to the sun with clasped handsIf you dont pay homage to the sun with clasped hands go down into the water three times by nightfall These are the purification rites declared by the brahmans of the Western lands of which I approveCunda the purification rites declared by the brahmans of the Western lands are one thing the purification in the discipline of the noble ones is something else entirelyBut how is there purification in the discipline of the noble ones lordIt would be good if the Blessed One would teach me how there is purification in the discipline of the noble onesThen in that case Cunda listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord Cunda the silversmith respondedThe Blessed One said There are three ways in which one is made impure by bodily action four ways in which one is made impure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made impure by mental actionAnd how is one made impure in three ways by bodily actionThere is the case where a certain person takes life is a hunter bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe takes what is not givenHe takes in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by themHe engages in sensual misconductHe gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manThis is how one is made impure in three ways by bodily actionAnd how is one made impure in four ways by verbal actionThere is the case where a certain person engages in false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I know If he does know he says I dont know If he hasnt seen he says I have seen If he has seen he says I havent seen Thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of a certain rewardHe engages in divisive speechWhat he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from those people thereThus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between those who have broken apart he loves factionalism delights in factionalism enjoys factionalism speaks things that create factionalismHe engages in abusive speechHe speaks words that are harsh cutting bitter to others abusive of others provoking anger and destroying concentrationHe engages in idle chatterHe speaks out of season speaks what isnt factual what isnt in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya words that are not worth treasuringThis is how one is made impure in four ways by verbal actionAnd how is one made impure in three ways by mental actionThere is the case where a certain person is covetousHe covets the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mine He bears ill will corrupt in the resolves of his heart May these beings be killed or cut apart or crushed or destroyed or may they not exist at all He has wrong view is warped in the way he sees things There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificedThere is no fruit or result of good or bad actionsThere is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is how one is made impure in three ways by mental actionThese Cunda are the ten courses of unskillful actionWhen a person is endowed with these ten courses of unskillful action then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth he is still impureIf he doesnt touch the earth he is still impureIf he touches wet cow dung he is still impureIf he doesnt touch wet cow dung he is still impureIf he touches green grass If he doesnt touch green grass If he worships a fire If he doesnt worship a fire If he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands If he doesnt pay homage to the sun with clasped hands If he goes down into the water three times by nightfall If he doesnt go down into the water three times by nightfall he is still impureWhy is thatBecause these ten courses of unskillful action are impure and cause impurityFurthermore as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of unskillful action hell is declared an animal womb is declared the realm of hungry shades is declared  that or any other bad destinationNow Cunda there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily action four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made pure by mental actionAnd how is one made pure in three ways by bodily actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of lifeHe dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenHe does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by themAbandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconductHe does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manThis is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily actionAnd how is one made pure in four ways by verbal actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I dont know If he does know he says I know If he hasnt seen he says I havent seen If he has seen he says I have seen Thus he doesnt consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any rewardAbandoning false speech he abstains from false speechHe speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the worldAbandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speechWhat he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people thereThus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concordAbandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speechHe speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at largeAbandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatterHe speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the VinayaHe speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goalThis is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal actionAnd how is one made pure in three ways by mental actionThere is the case where a certain person is not covetousHe does not covet the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mine He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heartMay these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental actionThese Cunda are the ten courses of skillful actionWhen a person is endowed with these ten courses of skillful action then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth he is still pureIf he doesnt touch the earth he is still pureIf he touches wet cow dung he is still pureIf he doesnt touch wet cow dung he is still pureIf he touches green grass If he doesnt touch green grass If he worships a fire If he doesnt worship a fire If he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands If he doesnt pay homage to the sun with clasped hands If he goes down into the water three times by nightfall If he doesnt go down into the water three times by nightfall he is still pureWhy is thatBecause these ten courses of skillful action are pure and cause purityFurthermore as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of skillful action the devas is declared human beings is declared  that or any other good destinationWhen this was said Cunda the silversmith said to the Blessed One Magnificent lordMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many

having directly known it you teach the Dhamma to your disciples for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding will all the cosmos be led or a half of it or a thirdWhen this was said the Blessed One was silentThen the thought occurred to VenAnanda Dont let Uttiya the wanderer acquire the evil viewpoint that When I asked him an allencompassing question Gotama the contemplative faltered and didnt replyPerhaps he was unable to That would be for his longterm harm  suffering So he said to Uttiya In that case my friend I will give you an analogy for there are cases where it is through the use of analogy that intelligent people can understand the meaning of what is being saidUttiya suppose that there were a royal frontier fortress with strong ramparts strong walls  arches and a single gateIn it would be a wise competent  knowledgeable gatekeeper to keep out those he didnt know and to let in those he didPatrolling the path around the city he wouldnt see a crack or an opening in the walls big enough for even a cat to slip throughAlthough he wouldnt know that Soandso many creatures enter or leave the city he would know this Whatever large creatures enter or leave the city all enter or leave it through this gateIn the same way the Tathagata isnt concerned with whether all the cosmos or half of it or a third of it will be led to release by means of thatBut he does know this All those who have been led are being led or will be led from the cosmos have done so are doing so or will do so after having abandoned the five hindrances  those defilements of awareness that weaken discernment  having wellestablished their minds in the four frames of reference and having developed as they have come to be the seven factors for AwakeningWhen you asked the Blessed One this question you had already asked it in another wayThats why he didnt respondSee also ANI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Campa on the shore of Gaggara LakeThen Vajjiya Mahita the householder left Campa in the

friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the wanderers said to him Is it true householder that Gotama the contemplative criticizes all asceticism that he categorically denounces  disparages all ascetics who live the rough lifeNo venerable sirs the Blessed One does not criticize all asceticism nor does he categorically denounce or disparage all ascetics who live the rough lifeThe Blessed One criticizes what should be criticized and praises what should be praisedCriticizing what should be criticized praising what should be praised the Blessed One is one who speaks making distinctions not one who speaks categorically on this matterWhen this was said one of the wanderers said to Vajjiya Mahita the householder Now wait a minute householderThis contemplative Gotama whom you praise is a nihilist one who doesnt declare anythingI tell you venerable sirs that the Blessed One righteously declares that This is skillful He declares that This is unskillful Declaring that This is skillful and This is unskillful he is one who has declaredHe is not a nihilist one who doesnt declare anythingWhen this was said the wanderers fell silent abashed sitting with their shoulders drooping their heads down brooding at a loss for wordsVajjiya Mahita the householder perceiving that the wanderers were silent abashed at a loss for words got up  went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the entirety of his conversation with the wanderersWell done householderWell doneThat is how you should periodically  righteously refute those foolish menI dont say that all asceticism is to be pursued nor do I say that all asceticism is not to be pursuedI dont say that all observances should be observed nor do I day that all observances should not be observedI dont say that all exertions are to be pursued nor do I say that all exertions are not to be pursuedI dont say that all forfeiture should be forfeited nor do I say that all forfeiture should not be forfeitedI dont say that all release is to be used for release nor do I say that all release is not to be used for releaseIf when an asceticism is pursued unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities wane then I tell you that that sort of asceticism is not to be pursuedBut if when an asceticism is pursued unskillful qualities wane and skillful qualities grow then I tell you that that sort of asceticism is to be pursuedIf when an observance is observed unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities wane then I tell you that that sort of observance is not to be observedBut if when an observance is observed unskillful qualities wane and skillful qualities grow then I tell you that that sort of

One left keeping the Blessed One on his right sideNot long afterward the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks even a monk who has long penetrated the Dhamma in this Doctrine  Discipline would do well periodically  righteously to refute the wanderers of other persuasions in just the way Vajjiya Mahita the householder has doneSee also ANI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen Anathapindika the householder left Savatthi in the middle of the day to see the Blessed One but the thought then occurred to him Now is not the right time to see the Blessed One for he is in seclusionAnd it is not the right time to see the monks who are developing their minds for they are in seclusionWhat if I were to visit the park of the wanderers of other persuasions So he headed to the park of the wanderers of other persuasionsNow on that occasion the wanderers of other persuasions had come together in a gathering and were sitting discussing many kinds of bestial topics making a great noise and racketThey saw Anathapindika the householder coming from afar and on seeing him hushed one another Be quiet good sirsDont make any noiseHere comes Anathapindika the householder a disciple of Gotama the contemplativeHe is one of those disciples of Gotama the contemplative clad in white who lives in SavatthiThese people are fond of quietude and speak in praise of quietudeMaybe if he perceives our group as quiet he will consider it worth his while to come our way So the wanderers fell silentThen Anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers of other persuasions were stayingOn arrival he greeted them courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the wanderers said to him Tell us householder what views Gotama the contemplative hasVenerable sirs I dont know entirely what views the Blessed One hasWell wellSo you dont know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative hasThen tell us what views the monks haveI dont even know entirely what views the monks haveSo you dont know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has or even that the monks haveThen tell us what views you haveIt wouldnt be difficult for me to expound to you what views I haveBut please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position and then it wont be difficult for me to expound to you what views I haveWhen this had been said one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveAnother wanderer said to Anathapindika The cosmos is not eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveAnother wanderer said The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul  the body are the same The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathagata exists After death a Tathagata does not exist After death a Tathagata both does  does not exist After death a Tathagata neither does nor does not existOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveWhen this had been said Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers As for the venerable one who says The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I have his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of anotherNow this view has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originatedWhatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressThis venerable one thus adheres to that very stress submits himself to that very stress When this had been said the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder We have each  every one expounded to you in line with our own positionsNow tell us what views you haveWhatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressWhatever is stress is not me is not what I am is not my selfThis is the sort of view I haveSo householder whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressYou thus adhere to that very stress submit yourself to that very stressVenerable sirs whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressWhatever is stress is not me is not what I am is not my selfHaving seen this well with right discernment as it actually is present I also discern the higher escape from it as it actually is

to him these ten contemplations then that monk Girimananda having heard them will be immediately cured of his afflictionThereupon the Venerable Ananda having learned these ten contemplations from the Blessed One visited the Venerable Girimananda and recited to him the ten contemplationsWhen the Venerable Girimananda had heard them his affliction was immediately curedHe recovered from that affliction and thus disappeared the affliction of the Venerable GirimanandaMonks if those who have gone forth in other sects ask you In what are all phenomena rootedWhat is their coming into playWhat is their originationWhat is their meeting placeWhat is their presiding stateWhat is their governing principleWhat is their surpassing stateWhat is their heartwoodWhere do they gain a footingWhat is their final end On being asked this by those who have gone forth in other sects how would you answerFor us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitratorIt would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember itIn that case monks listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Monks if those who have gone forth in other sects ask you In what are all phenomena rootedWhat is their coming into playWhat is their originationWhat is their meeting placeWhat is their presiding stateWhat is their governing principleWhat is their surpassing stateWhat is their heartwoodWhere do they gain a footingWhat is their final end On being asked this by those who have gone forth in other sects this is how you should answer themAll phenomena are rooted in desireAll phenomena come into play through attentionAll phenomena have contact as their originationAll phenomena have feeling as their meeting placeAll phenomena have concentration as their presiding stateAll phenomena have mindfulness as their governing principleAll phenomena have discernment as their surpassing stateAll phenomena have release as their heartwoodAll phenomena gain their footing in the deathlessAll phenomena have Unbinding as their final endOn being asked this by those who have gone forth in other sects this is how you should answerThe Commentary goes on to say that the statement All phenomena are rooted in desire deals exclusively with worldly phenomena whereas the remaining statements about all phenomena cover both worldly and transcendent phenomenaThere seems less reason to follow the Commentarys first assertion here in that the noble eightfold path when brought to maturity counts as transcendent and it is obviously rooted in a skillful form of desireAs for the transcendent in its ultimate form the phrase all phenomena as used in this sutta does not cover Unbinding as Unbinding is not rooted in anything and as the final statement indicates it constitutes the final end of all phenomenaThus this sutta would seem to belong to the group of suttas that would not classify Unbinding as a phenomenonEven if a monk is not skilled in the ways of the minds of others he should train himself I will be skilled in reading my own mindAnd how is a monk skilled in reading his own mindImagine a young woman  or man  fond of adornment examining the image of her own face in a bright clean mirror or bowl of clear water If she saw any dirt or blemish there she would try to remove itIf she saw no dirt or blemish there she would be pleased her resolves fulfilled How fortunate I amHow clean I am In the same way a monks selfexamination is very productive in terms of skillful qualities Am I one who achieves internal tranquility of awareness or am I one who does not achieve internal tranquility of awarenessAm I one who achieves insight into phenomena through heightened discernment or am I one who does not achieve insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentIf on examination he knows I am one who achieves internal tranquility of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment then his duty is to make an effort for the maintenance of internal tranquility of awareness and for insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentAt a later time he will then be one who achieves both internal tranquility of awareness and insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentBut if on examination the monk knows I am one who achieves insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquility of awareness then his duty is to make an effort for the maintenance of insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and for internal tranquility of awarenessAt a later time he will then be one who achieves both insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and internal tranquility of awarenessBut if on examination the monk knows I am one who achieves neither internal tranquility of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor relentlessness mindfulness  alertness for gaining those very same skillful qualitiesJust as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor relentlessness mindfulness  alertness to put out the fire on his turban or head in the same way the monk should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor relentlessness mindfulness  alertness for gaining those very same skillful qualitiesBut if on examination the monk knows I am one who achieves both

gone forth should often reflect on thisMy life is dependent on othersMy behavior should be different Can I fault myself with regard to my virtueCan my knowledgeable fellows in the holy life on close examination fault me with regard to my virtueI will grow different separate from all that is dear  appealing to meI am the owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitratorWhatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heirWhat am I becoming as the days  nights fly pastDo I delight in an empty dwellingHave I attained a superior human attainment a truly noble distinction of knowledge  vision such that  when my fellows in the holy life question me in the last days of my life  I wont feel abashed a person gone forth should often reflect on thisThese are the ten things that a person goneforth should reflect on oftenThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at the monastery of AnathapindikaThen the Blessed One addressed the monks saying Monks  Venerable Sir they said by way of replyThe Blessed One then spoke as followsThese ten essentials must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthWhat are these tenI am now changed into a different mode of life This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthMy life depends on others This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthI must now behave in a different manner This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthDoes my mind upbraid me regarding the state of my virtue This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthDo my discerning fellowmonks having tested me reproach me regarding the state of my virtue This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthThere will be a parting from all those who are dear and loving to meDeath brings this separation to me This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthOf kamma I am constitutedKamma is my inheritance kamma is the matrix kamma is my kinsman kamma is my refugeWhatever kamma I perform be it good or bad to that I shall be heir This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthHow do I spend my nights and days This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthDo I take delight in solitude This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthHave I gained superhuman facultiesHave I gained that higher wisdom so that when I am questioned by fellowmonks at the last moment I will have no occasion to be depressed and downcast This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forthThese monks are the essentials that should be reflected again and again by one who has gone forthSo spoke the Blessed OneThose monks rejoiced at the words of the Blessed OneOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kapilavatthu at the Banyan ParkThen many Sakyan lay followers it being the Uposatha day went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them Sakyans do you observe

kahapanas a day saving up his gains living for one hundred years would a man arrive at a great mass of wealthYes lordNow what do you think would that man because of that wealth on account of that wealth with that wealth as the cause live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a day a night half a day or half a nightNo lordAnd why is thatSensual pleasures are inconstant hollow false deceptive by

to do with the devas And the devas also thought Having gone to this shelter for the fearful the asuras will now keep here to themselves having nothing to do with usIn the same way monks on whatever occasion a monk  secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enters the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation on that occasion the thought occurs to him Having come to this shelter for the fearful I will now keep here to myself having nothing to do with Māra And the thought occurs to Māra the Evil One Having gone to this shelter for the fearful the monk will now keep here to himself having nothing to do with meOn whatever occasion a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space enters the dimension of the infinitude of space He is said to be a monk who has put Māra in the darkHaving bound Māras eyes and leaving no opening he has become invisible to the Evil OneOn whatever occasion with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception he enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feeling and having seen with discernment his effluents are completely ended He is said to be a monk who has put Māra in the darkHaving bound Māras eyes and leaving no opening he has become invisible to the Evil One having crossed over attachment in the cosmosThen two brahman cosmologists went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One Master Gotama Purana Kassapa  allknowing allseeing  claims exhaustive knowledge  vision Whether I am standing or walking awake or asleep continual unflagging knowledge  vision is established within me He says I dwell with infinite knowledge knowing  seeing the finite cosmos Yet Nigantha Nataputta  allknowing allseeing  also claims exhaustive knowledge  vision Whether I am standing or walking awake or asleep continual unflagging knowledge  vision is established within me He says I dwell with infinite knowledge knowing  seeing the infinite cosmos Of these two speakers of knowledge these two who contradict each other which is telling the truth and which is lyingEnough brahmansPut this question asideI will teach you the DhammaListen and pay close attentionI will speakYes sir the brahmans responded to the Blessed One and the Blessed One said Suppose that there were four men standing at the four directions endowed with supreme speed  strideLike that of a strong archer  welltrained a practiced hand a practiced sharpshooter  shooting a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree Such would be the speed with which they were endowedAs far as the east sea is from the west Such would be the stride with which they were endowedThen the man standing at the eastern direction would say I by walking will reach the end of the cosmos He  with a onehundred year life a onehundred year span  would spend one hundred years traveling  apart from the time spent on eating drinking chewing  tasting urinating  defecating and sleeping to fight off weariness  but without reaching the end of the cosmos he would die along the wayWhy is thatI tell you it isnt through that sort of traveling that the end of the cosmos is known seen or reachedBut at the same time I tell you that there is no making an end of suffering  stress without reaching the end of the cosmosThese five strings of sensuality are in the discipline of the noble ones called the cosmosWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing

end of the cosmosOthers say of him He is encompassed in the cosmos he has not escaped from the cosmos And I too say of him He is encompassed in the cosmos he has not escaped from the cosmosFurthermore

chariots spread with lion skins tiger skins leopard skins saffroncolored blankets with gold ornaments gold banners covered with nets of gold threadHe gave milk cows with tethers of fine jute and copper milk pailsHe gave maidens adorned with jeweled earringsHe gave couches spread with longfleeced coverlets white wool coverlets embroidered coverlets rugs of kadalideer hide each with a canopy above  red cushions on either sideHe gave lengths of cloth  of finest linen of finest cotton of finest silkTo say nothing of the food  drink staple  nonstaple food lotions  beddings They flowed as it

principlesI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he said to the monks Monks if wanderers who are members of other sects should ask you What friend are the prerequisites for the development of the wings to selfawakening how would you answer themFor us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitratorIt would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember itIn that case monks listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said If wanderers who are members of other sects should ask you What friend are the prerequisites for the development of the wings to selfawakening you should answer There is the case where a monk has admirable friends admirable companions admirable comradesThis is the first prerequisite for the development of the wings to selfawakeningFurthermore the monk is virtuousHe dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activityHe trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultsThis is the second prerequisite for the development of the wings to selfawakeningFurthermore he gets to hear at will easily  without difficulty talk that is truly sobering  conducive to the opening of awareness ie talk on modesty on contentment on seclusion on nonentanglement on arousing persistence on virtue on concentration on discernment on release and on the knowledge  vision of releaseThis is the third prerequisite for the development of the wings to selfawakeningFurthermore he keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and for taking on skillful mental qualitiesHe is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualitiesThis is the fourth prerequisite for the development of the wings to selfawakeningFurthermore he is discerning endowed with the discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressThis is the fifth prerequisite for the development of the wings to selfawakeningMonks when a monk has admirable friends admirable companions admirable comrades it is to be expected that he will be virtuous will dwell

to be expected that he will be discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressAnd furthermore monks when the monk is established in these five qualities there are four additional qualities he should develop He should develop the unattractive so as to abandon lustHe should develop good will so as to abandon ill willHe should develop mindfulness of inout breathing so as to cut off distractive thinkingHe should develop the perception of inconstancy so as to uproot the conceit I am For a monk perceiving inconstancy the

children using Kasi fabrics  sandalwood wearing garlands scents  creams handling gold  silverMay the Blessed One teach the Dhamma for those like us for our happiness  wellbeing in this life for our happiness  wellbeing in lives to comeThere are these four qualities TigerPaw that lead to a lay persons happiness and wellbeing in this lifeWhich fourBeing consummate in initiative being consummate in vigilance admirable friendship and maintaining ones livelihood in tuneAnd what does it mean to be consummate in initiativeThere is the case where a lay person by whatever occupation he makes his living  whether by farming or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a kings man or by any other craft  is clever and untiring at it endowed with discrimination in its techniques enough to arrange and carry it outThis is called being consummate in initiativeAnd what does it mean to be consummate in vigilanceThere is the case when a lay person has righteous wealth  righteously gained coming from his initiative his striving his making an effort gathered by the strength of his arm earned by his sweat  he manages to protect it through vigilance How shall neither kings nor thieves make off with this property of mine nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it This is called being consummate in vigilanceAnd what is meant by admirable friendshipThere is the case where a lay person in whatever town or village he may dwell spends time with householders or householders sons young or old who are advanced in virtueHe talks with them engages them in discussionsHe emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernmentThis is called admirable friendshipAnd what does it mean to maintain ones livelihood in tuneThere is the case where a lay person knowing the income and outflow of his wealth maintains a livelihood in tune neither a spendthrift nor a pennypincher Thus will my income exceed my outflow and my outflow will not exceed my income Just as when a weigher or his apprentice when holding the scales knows It has tipped down so much or has tipped up so much in the same way the lay person knowing the income and outflow of his wealth maintains a livelihood in tune neither a spendthrift nor a pennypincher Thus will my income exceed my outflow and my outflow will not exceed my income If a lay person has a small income but maintains a grand livelihood it will be rumored of him This clansman devours his wealth like a fruittree eater If a lay person has a large income but maintains a miserable livelihood it will be rumored of him This clansman will die of starvation But when a lay person knowing the income and outflow of his wealth maintains a livelihood in tune neither a spendthrift nor a pennypincher Thus will my income exceed my outflow and my outflow will not exceed my income this is called maintaining ones livelihood in tuneThese are the four drains on ones store of wealth debauchery in sex debauchery in drink

welfare  to happinessTranslators note In this sutta the Buddha instructs rich householders how to preserve and increase their prosperity and how to avoid loss of wealthWealth alone however does not make a complete man nor a harmonious societyPossession of wealth all too often multiplies mans desires and he is ever in the pursuit of amassing more wealth and powerThis unrestrained craving however leaves him dissatisfied and stifles his inner growthIt creates conflict and disharmony in society through the resentment of the underprivileged who feel themselves exploited by the effects of unrestrained cravingTherefore the Buddha follows up on his advice on material welfare with four essential conditions for spiritual welfare confidence virtue liberality and wisdomThese four will instill in man a sense of higher valuesHe will then not only pursue his own material concern but also be aware of his duty toward societyTo mention only one of the implications a wisely and generously employed liberality will reduce tensions and conflicts in societyThus the observing of these conditions of material and spiritual welfare will make for an ideal citizen in an ideal societyThus have I heardOnce the Exalted One was dwelling amongst the Koliyans in their market town named KakkarapattaThen Dighajanu a Koliyan approached the Exalted One respectfully saluted Him and sat on one sideThus seated he addressed the Exalted One as followsWe Lord are laymen who enjoy worldly pleasureWe lead a life encumbered by wife and childrenWe use sandalwood of KasiWe deck ourselves with garlands perfume and unguentsWe use gold and silverTo those like us O Lord let the Exalted One preach the Dhamma teach those things that lead to weal and happiness in this life and to weal and happiness in future lifeFour conditions Vyagghapajja conduce to a householders weal and happiness in this very lifeWhich fourThe accomplishment of persistent effort the accomplishment of watchfulness good friendship and balanced livelihoodWhat is the accomplishment of persistent effortHerein Vyagghapajja by whatsoever activity a householder earns his living whether by farming by trading by rearing cattle by archery by service under the king or by any other kind of craft  at that he becomes skillful and is not lazyHe is endowed with the power of discernment as to the proper ways and means he is able to carry out and allocateThis is called the accomplishment of persistent effortWhat is the accomplishment of watchfulnessHerein Vyagghapajja whatsoever wealth a householder is in possession of obtained by dint of effort collected by strength of arm by the sweat of his brow justly acquired by right means  such he husbands well by guarding and watching so that kings would not seize it thieves would not steal it fire would not burn it water would not carry it away nor illdisposed heirs remove itThis is the accomplishment of watchfulnessWhat is good friendshipHerein Vyagghapajja in whatsoever village or market town a householder dwells he associates converses engages in discussions with householders or householders sons whether young and highly cultured or old and highly cultured full of faith full of virtue full of charity full of wisdomHe acts in accordance with the faith of the faithful with the virtue of the virtuous with the charity of the charitable with the wisdom of the wiseThis is called good friendshipWhat is balanced livelihoodHerein Vyagghapajja a householder knowing his income and expenses leads a balanced life neither extravagant nor miserly knowing that thus his income will stand in excess of his expenses but not his expenses in excess of his incomeJust as the goldsmith or an apprentice of his knows on holding up a balance that by so much it has dipped down by so much it has tilted up even so a householder knowing his income and expenses leads a balanced life neither extravagant nor miserly knowing that thus his income will stand in excess of his expenses but not his expenses in excess of his incomeIf Vyagghapajja a householder with little income were to lead an extravagant life there would be those who say  This person enjoys his property like one who eats woodapple If Vyagghapajja a householder with a large income were to lead a wretched life there would be those who say  This person will die like a starvelingThe wealth thus amassed Vyagghapajja has four sources of destruction Debauchery drunkenness gambling friendship companionship and intimacy with evildoersJust as in the case of a great tank with four inlets and outlets if a man should close the inlets and open the outlets and there should be no adequate rainfall decrease of water is to be expected in that tank and not an increase even so there are four sources for the destruction of amassed wealth  debauchery drunkenness gambling and friendship companionship and intimacy with evildoersThere are four sources for the increase of amassed wealth abstinence from debauchery abstinence from drunkenness nonindulgence in gambling friendship companionship and intimacy with the goodJust as in the case of a great tank with four inlets and four outlets if a person were to open the inlets and close the outlets and there should also be adequate rainfall an increase in water is certainly to be expected in that tank and not a decrease even so these four conditions are the sources of increase of amassed wealthThese four conditions Vyagghapajja are conducive to a householders weal and happiness in this very lifeFour conditions Vyagghapajja conduce to a householders weal and happiness in his future lifeWhich fourThe accomplishment of faith the accomplishment of virtue the accomplishment of charity and the accomplishment of wisdomWhat is the accomplishment of faithHerein a householder is possessed of faith he believes in the Enlightenment of the Perfect One Thus indeed is that Blessed One he is the pure one fully enlightened endowed with knowledge and conduct wellgone the knower of worlds the incomparable leader of men to be tamed the teacher of gods and men allknowing and blessedThis is called the accomplishment of faithWhat is the accomplishment of virtueHerein a householder abstains from killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and from intoxicants that cause infatuation and heedlessnessThis is called the accomplishment of virtueWhat is the accomplishment of charityHerein a householder dwells at home with heart free from the stain of avarice devoted to charity openhanded delighting in generosity attending to the needy delighting in the distribution of almsThis is called the accomplishment of charityWhat is the accomplishment of wisdomHerein a householder is wise he is endowed with wisdom that understands the arising and cessation he is possessed of the noble penetrating insight that leads to the destruction of sufferingThis is called the accomplishment of wisdomThese four conditions Vyagghapajja conduce to a householders weal and happiness in his future lifeThen VenSariputta went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him

secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenAnuruddha became another one of the arahantsThen on attaining arahantship he uttered this verseI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Rajagaha at Jivakas Mango GroveThen Jivaka Komarabhacca went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord to what extent is one a lay followerJivaka when one has gone to the Buddha for refuge has gone to the Dhamma for refuge and has gone to the Sangha for refuge then to that extent is one a lay followerAnd to what extent lord is one a virtuous lay followerJivaka when one abstains from taking life from stealing from sexual misconduct from lying and from fermented  distilled drinks that lead to heedlessness then to that extent is one a virtuous lay followerAnd to what extent lord is one a lay follower who practices for his own benefit but not that of othersJivaka when a lay follower himself is consummate in conviction but does not encourage others in the consummation of conviction when he himself is consummate in virtue but does not encourage others in the consummation of virtue when he himself is consummate in generosity but does not encourage others in the consummation of generosity when he himself desires to see the monks but does not encourage others to see the monks when he himself wants to hear the true Dhamma but does not encourage others to hear the true Dhamma when he himself habitually remembers the Dhamma he has heard but does not encourage others to remember the Dhamma they have heard when he himself explores the meaning of the Dhamma he has heard but does not encourage others to explore the meaning of the Dhamma they have heard when he himself knowing both the Dhamma  its meaning practices the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma but does not encourage others to practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma then to that extent he is a lay follower who practices for his own benefit but not for the benefit of othersAnd to what extent lord is one a lay follower who practices both for his own benefit  the benefit of othersJivaka when a lay follower himself is consummate in conviction and encourages others in the consummation of conviction when he himself is consummate in virtue and encourages others in the consummation of virtue when he himself is consummate in generosity and encourages others in the consummation of generosity when he himself desires to see the monks and encourages others to see the monks when he himself wants to hear the true Dhamma and encourages others to hear the true Dhamma when he himself habitually remembers the Dhamma he has

heard when he himself knowing both the Dhamma  its meaning practices the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma and encourages others to practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma then to that extent he is a lay follower who practices both for his own benefit and for the benefit of othersOnce the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyas in Nigrodha Park at KapilavatthuThere Mahanama the Sakyan approached the Blessed OneHaving approached and paid respect to the Blessed One he sat asideThen seated aside Mahanama the Sakyan said thus to the Blessed OneVenerable sir in what way is one a lay followerMahanama inasmuch as one has gone to the Buddha for refuge has gone to the Dhamma for refuge has gone to the Sangha for refuge in that way Mahanama one is a lay followerThen venerable sir in what way is a lay follower virtuousMahanama inasmuch as a lay follower abstains from destroying living beings abstains from taking what is not given abstains from sexual misconduct abstains from lying and abstains from wine liquor and intoxicants that are causes for heedlessness in that way Mahanama a lay follower is virtuousThen venerable sir in what way is a lay follower engaged in his own welfare but not in others welfareMahanama inasmuch as a lay follower is possessed of faith himself but rouses not others to possess faith is possessed of virtue himself but rouses not others to possess virtue is possessed of liberality himself but rouses not others to possess liberality is himself desirous of meeting with monks but rouses not others to meet with monks is himself desirous of

and in others welfareTranslators note The four grounds for the bonds of fellowship appear in the early Mahayana sutras as guidelines for every aspiring bodhisattva  one of the few teachings that even the more radical Mahayana sutras adopt from the early canonsThe following sutta which maintains that these four qualities are required for developing any large following may account for this factOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Alavi at the Aggalava ShrineThen Hatthaka of Alavi surrounded by approximately lay followers went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Large is your following HatthakaHow have you won over this large followingLord I have won over this large following through the four grounds for the bonds of fellowship taught by the Blessed OneWhen I know that This person is to be won over by giving then I win himher over by givingWhen I know that This person is to be won over by kind words then I win himher over by kind wordsWhen I know that This person is to be won over by beneficial help then I win himher over by beneficial helpWhen I know that This person is to be won over by consistency then I win himher over by consistencyAwed by the wealth of my family they regard me as worth listening to which would not be the case if I were poorIts good Hatthaka its very good that this is the means by which you have won over a large followingAll those in the past who have won over a large following have done so by means of these four same grounds for the bonds of fellowshipAll those in the future who will win over a large following will do so by means of these four same grounds for the bonds of fellowshipAll those at present who are winning over a large following do so by means of these four same grounds for the bonds of fellowshipThen having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on Dhamma Hatthaka of Alavi got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circled him  keeping him on his right  and leftNot long after he had left the Blessed One said to the monks Monks remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with eight amazing astounding qualitiesWhich eightHatthaka of Alavi is endowed with convictionHe is virtuousHe has a sense of conscienceHe has a sense of concernHe is learnedHe is generousHe is discerningHe is modestRemember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with these eight amazing astounding qualitiesTranslators note On the surface the qualities the Buddha attributes to Hatthaka in this sutta do not seem especially amazing or astounding Keep in mind however that the Canon depicts Hatthaka as very wealthy and the Commentary adds that he is a princeTo find such qualities in a person of power and wealth is fairly amazingOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Alavi at the Aggalava ShrineThere he addressed the monks Monks remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with seven amazing astounding qualitiesWhich sevenMonks Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with convictionHe is virtuousHe has a sense of conscienceHe has a sense of concernHe is learnedHe is generousHe is discerningRemember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with these seven amazing astounding qualitiesThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said it the One Wellgone getting up from his seat went into his dwellingThen early in the morning a certain monk having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe went to Hatthaka of Alavis homeOn arrival he sat down on a seat made readyThen Hatthaka of Alavi approached the monk and having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the monk said to him Friend the Blessed One has described you as being endowed with seven amazing astounding qualitiesWhich sevenHatthaka of Alavi is endowed with convictionHe is virtuousHe has a sense of conscienceHe has a sense of concernHe is learnedHe is generousHe is discerning Friend the Blessed One has described you as being endowed with these seven amazing astounding qualitiesI hope sir that there were no whiteclad householders thereNo friend there were no whiteclad householders thereIts good sir that there were no whiteclad householders thereThen the monk having received alms at Hatthaka of Alavis home departedAfter his meal returning from his alms round he went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there Its good monk its very good that the clansman is modest and does not want others to know of the skillful qualities present in himIn that case monk remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with this eighth amazing astounding quality modestyMonks I will teach you the eight unruly horses and

can understand the meaning of what is being saidSuppose that not far from a village or town there was a great pile of grain from which a great crowd of people were carrying away grain on their bodies on their heads in their laps or in their cupped handsIf someone were to approach that great crowd of people and ask them From where are you carrying away grain answering in what way would that great crowd of people answer so as to be answering rightlyVenerable sir they would answer We are carrying it from that great pile of grain so as to be answering rightlyIn the same way devaking whatever is

wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones and the uninstructed runofthemill personFor us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitratorIt would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember itIn that case monks listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say

teach me the Dhamma in brief such that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resoluteUpali the qualities of which you may know These qualities do not lead to utter disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening nor to Unbinding You may categorically hold This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this

Unbinding You may categorically hold This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instructionOnce monks there was a teacher named Araka a sectarian leader who was free of passion for sensual pleasuresHe had many hundreds of students and he taught them the Dhamma in this way Next to nothing brahmans is the life of human beings  limited trifling of much stress  many despairsOne should touch this like a sage do what is skillful follow the holy lifeFor one who is born there is no freedom from deathJust as a dewdrop on the tip of a blade of grass quickly vanishes with the rising of the sun and does not stay long in the same way brahmans the life of human beings is like a dewdrop  limited trifling of much stress  many despairsOne should touch this like a sage do what is skillful follow the holy lifeFor one who is born there is no freedom from deathJust as when the raindevas send rain in fat drops and a bubble on the water quickly vanishes and does not stay long in

deathJust as a river flowing down from the mountains going far its current swift carrying everything with it so that there is not a moment an instant a second where it stands still but instead it goes  rushes  flows in the same way brahmans the life of human beings is like a river flowing down from the mountains  limited trifling of much stress  many despairsOne should touch this like a sage do what is skillful follow the holy lifeFor one who is born there is no freedom from deathJust as a strong man forming a drop of spit on the tip of his tongue would spit it out with little effort in the same way brahmans the life of human beings is like a drop of spit  limited trifling of much stress  many despairsOne should touch this like a sage do what is skillful follow the holy lifeFor one who

monks the human life span was years with girls marriageable atAnd at that time there were six afflictions cold heat hunger thirst defecation  urinationYet even though people were so longlived longlasting with so few afflictions that teacher Araka taught the Dhamma to his disciples in this way Next to nothing brahmans is the life of human beings  limited trifling of much stress  many despairsOne should touch this like a sage do what is skillful follow the holy lifeFor one who is born there is no freedom from deathAt present monks one speaking rightly would say Next to nothing is the life of human beings  limited trifling of much stress  many despairsOne should touch this like a sage do what is skillful follow the holy lifeFor one who is born there is no freedom from death At present monks one who lives a long time is years old or a little bit moreLiving years one lives for seasons seasons of cold seasons of heat seasons of rainLiving for seasons one lives for months months of cold months of heat months of rainLiving for months one lives for fortnights fortnights of cold fortnights of heat fortnights of rainLiving for fortnights one lives for days days of cold days of heat days of rainLiving for days one eats meals meals in the cold meals in the heat meals in the rain  counting the taking of mothers milk and obstacles to eatingThese are the obstacles to eating when one doesnt eat while angered when one doesnt eat while suffering or stressed when one doesnt eat while sick when one doesnt eat on the observance day when one doesnt eat while poorThus monks I have reckoned the life of a person living for years I have reckoned the life span reckoned the seasons reckoned the years reckoned the months reckoned the fortnights reckoned the nights reckoned the days reckoned the meals reckoned the obstacles to eatingWhatever a teacher should do  seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them  that have I done for youOver there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellingsPractice jhana monksDont be heedlessDont later fall into regretThis is our message to you allSee also MN AN SnTranslators note In this sutta from the Anguttara Nikayas Book of the Sevens the Buddha compares seven pairs of situations a monk might hypothetically face and asks the monks to choose which of each pair is the betterWhile listening to the Buddhas explanations of the correct choice in each case sixty monks become enlightened  another instance of enlightenment directly from hearing a talk by the BuddhaThus have I heardOnce the Blessed One was wandering among the Kosala people together with a large company of monksEntering a major path the Blessed One saw in a certain spot a great mass of fire burning blazing glowingAfter seeing it and stepping down from the path he sat on the appointed seat at the root of a treeAfter sitting down the Blessed One said to the monks Do you see monks that great mass of fire burning blazing glowing   Yes venerable SirWhat do you think monksWhich would in fact be the betterEmbracing that great mass of fire burning blazing glowing and sitting or lying down close to itOr embracing a kshatriya or brahman or householder woman with young and tender hands and feet and sitting or lying down close to her  This venerable Sir would surely be the better Embracing a kshatriya or brahman or householder woman with young and tender hands and feet and sitting or lying down close to herFor it would be painful venerable Sir to embrace that great burning blazing glowing mass of fire and sit or lie down close to itLet me tell you monks let me explain to you monks that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an evilminded one a filthy doer of complete wickedness who acts in an underhand manner who pretends to be a recluse yet is not a recluse who pretends to lead the holy life yet does not lead the holy life an inwardlyputrid impurenatured one Embracing that great mass of fire burning blazing glowing and sitting or lying down close to itWhat is the reason for thisBecause on account of that monks he would go to death or to a pain like that of death but he would not on account of that on the breakup of the body after death be reborn into a place of woe a realm of misery a place of suffering a purgatoryBut monks if one who is of poor conduct an evilminded one a filthy doer of complete wickedness who acts in an underhand manner who pretends to be a recluse yet is not a recluse who pretends to lead the holy life yet does not lead the holy life an inwardlyputrid impurenatured one were to embrace a kshatriya or brahman or householder woman with young and tender hands and feet and sit or lie down close to her  for him monks there would be a long period of harm and suffering and on the breakup of the body after death he would be reborn into a place of woe a realm of misery a place of suffering a purgatoryWhat do you think monksWhich would in fact be the betterIf a strong man having twisted a firm horsehair rope around both calves were to rub so that the rope cut the skin and having cut the skin it cut the underskin and having cut the underskin it cut the flesh and having cut the flesh it cut the sinew and having cut the sinew it cut the bone and having cut the bone it left the marrow exposedOr to derive enjoyment from the homage of rich kshatriyas or rich brahmans or rich householders  This venerable Sir is surely the better To derive enjoyment from the homage of rich kshatriyas or rich brahmans or rich householdersFor it would be painful venerable Sir if a strong man having twisted a firm hairrope around both calves were to rub so that the rope cut the skin and so on until it left the marrow exposedLet me tell you monks let me explain to you monks that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an impurenatured one If a strong man having twisted a firm horsehair rope around both calves were

a long period of harm and suffering and on the breakup of the body after death he would be reborn into a place of woe a realm of misery a place of suffering a purgatoryWhat do you think monksWhich would in fact be the betterIf a strong man were to strike the netherquarters with a sharp oilcleaned swordOr to derive enjoyment when rich kshatriyas brahmans or householders press the palms together

the mouth a redhot iron ball burning blazing glowing so that ones lips would burn then the mouth would burn then the tongue would burn then the throat would burn then the chest would burn and when it was received by the lower intestine it would be expelled from the lower part of the bodyOr to derive enjoyment from the food received on almsround and given in faith by rich kshatriyas brahmans or

iron spike were to hurl into the mouth a redhot iron ballWhat do you think monksWhich would in fact be the betterIf a strong man having gripped the head or shoulder were to force one sit or lie on a redhot iron bed or chairOr to derive enjoyment from a chair given in faith by rich kshatriyas or brahmans or householdersLet me tell you monks let me explain to you that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an impurenatured one If a strong man having gripped the head or shoulder were to force one sit or lie on a redhot iron bed or chairWhat do you think monksWhich would in fact be the betterIf a strong man having gripped one heels up head down were to force one down into a redhot iron cauldron burning blazing glowing and where there is boiling scum on top he were to go once up once down and then once sidewaysOr to derive enjoyment from an abode given in faith by rich kshatriyas or brahmans or householdersLet me tell you monks let me explain to you that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an impurenatured one If a strong man having gripped one heels up head down were to force one down into a redhot iron cauldronBecause of what I have said here monks you should train yourselves such that the gifts of those whose requisites we use  the robes almsbowl chair bed and medicine as a support when sick  will have great fruits great merits and our going forth will not be in vain will be fruitful will have a resultThus should you train yourselves thoroughly seeing that for your own benefit monks it is right to strive with heedfulness thoroughly seeing that for the benefit of others monks it is right to strive with heedfulness and thoroughly seeing that for the benefit of both monks it is right to strive with heedfulnessThus spoke the Blessed OneAnd while this explanation was being delivered hot blood rose out of the mouths of sixty monks another sixty monks abandoned the training and returned to the lower life saying It is too difficult to do Blessed One it is too difficult to do while the minds of another sixty monks abandoned clinging and were liberated from the aasavasMonks when a royal frontier

near the village of Kallavalaputta in MagadhaThe Blessed One with his purified divine eye surpassing the human saw VenMaha Moggallana as he sat nodding near the village of Kallavalaputta in MagadhaAs soon as he saw this  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  he disappeared from among the Bhaggas in the Deer Park at Bhesakala Grove near Crocodile Haunt and reappeared near the village of Kallavalaputta in Magadha right in front of VenMaha MoggallanaThere he sat down on a prepared seatAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to VenMaha Moggallana Are you nodding MoggallanaAre you noddingYes lordWell then Moggallana whatever perception you have in mind when drowsiness descends on you dont attend to that perception dont pursue itIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then recall to your awareness the Dhamma as you have heard  memorized it reexamine it  ponder it over in your mindIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then repeat aloud in detail the Dhamma as you have heard  memorized itIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then pull both your earlobes and rub your limbs with your handsIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then get up from your seat and after washing your eyes out with water look around in all directions and upward to the major stars  constellationsIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then attend to the perception of light resolve on the perception of daytime by night as by day and by day as by nightBy means of an awareness thus open  unhampered develop a brightened mindIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then  percipient of what lies in front  behind  set a distance to meditate walking back  forth your senses inwardly immersed your mind not straying outwardsIts possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsinessBut if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then  reclining on your right side  take up the lions posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with your mind set on getting upAs soon as you wake up get up quickly with the thought I wont stay indulging in the pleasure of lying down the pleasure of reclining the pleasure of drowsiness That is how you should train yourselfFurthermore Moggallana should you train yourself I will not visit families with my pride lifted high That is how you should train yourselfAmong families there are many jobs that have to be done so that people dont pay attention to a visiting monkIf a monk visits them with his trunk lifted high the thought will occur to him Now who I wonder has caused a split between me and this familyThe people seem to have no liking for me Getting nothing he becomes abashedAbashed he becomes restlessRestless he becomes unrestrainedUnrestrained his mind is far from concentrationFurthermore Moggallana should you train yourself I will speak no confrontational speech

unrestrainedUnrestrained his mind is far from concentrationIts not the case Moggallana that I praise association of every sortBut its not the case that I dispraise association of every sortI dont praise association with householders and renunciatesBut as for dwelling places that are free from noise free from sound their atmosphere devoid of people appropriately secluded for resting undisturbed by human beings I praise association with dwelling places of this sortWhen this was said VenMoggallana said to the Blessed One Briefly lord in what respect is a monk released through the ending of

to that feelingAs he remains focused on inconstancy focused on dispassion focused on cessation focused on relinquishing with regard to that feeling he is unsustained by anything in the worldUnsustained he is not agitatedUnagitated he is unbound right withinHe discerns Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldIt is in this respect

is capable of realizing the unexcelled cooled stateI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha on Vulture Peak MountainAnd on that occasion VenSona was staying near Rajagaha in the Cool WoodThen as VenSona was meditating in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Of the Blessed Ones disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one but my mind is not released from the fermentations through lack of clingingsustenanceNow my family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth  make meritWhat if I were to disavow the training return to the lower life enjoy wealth  make meritThen the Blessed One as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in VenSonas awareness  as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend his outstretched arm  disappeared from Vulture Peak Mountain appeared in the Cool Wood right in front of VenSona and sat down on a prepared seatVenSona after bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Just now as you were meditating in seclusion didnt this train of thought appear to your awareness Of the Blessed Ones disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one but my mind is not released from the fermentations What if I were to disavow the training return to the lower life enjoy wealth  make merit Yes lordNow what do you think SonaBefore when you were a housedweller were you skilled at playing the vinaYes lordAnd what do you think when the strings of your vina were too taut was your vina in tune  playableNo lordAnd what do you think when the strings of your vina were too loose was your vina in tune  playableNo lordAnd what do you think when the strings of your vina were neither too taut nor too loose but tuned to be right on pitch was your vina in tune  playableYes lordIn the same way Sona overaroused persistence leads to restlessness overly slack persistence leads to lazinessThus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence attunethe pitch of the faculties and there pick up your themeYes lord VenSona answered the Blessed OneThen having given this exhortation to VenSona the Blessed One  as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend his outstretched arm  disappeared from the Cool Wood and appeared on Vulture Peak MountainSo after that VenSona determined the right pitch for his persistence attuned the pitch of the faculties and there picked up his themeDwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenSona became another one of the arahantsThen on the attainment of arahantship this thought occurred to VenSona What if I were to go to the Blessed One and on arrival to declare gnosis in his presence So he then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One When a monk is an arahant his fermentations ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis

not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has doneIt is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to renunciationIt is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to renunciationIt is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to renunciationNow it may occur to a certain venerable one to think Perhaps it is because he desires gain honor  fame that this venerable one is dedicated to seclusion Perhaps it is because he falls back on attachment to precepts  practices as being essential that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness but it should not be seen in that wayThe monk whose fermentations are ended having fulfilled does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has doneIt is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that

a Dhamma explanationOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryAnd at that time VenKhema and VenSumana were staying near Savatthi in the Blind Mans GroveThen VenKhema and VenSumana went to the Blessed One and on arrival have bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there VenKhema said to the Blessed One When a monk is an arahant with his fermentations ended  one who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis  the thought doesnt occur to him that There is someone better than me or There is someone equal to me or There is someone worse than me That is what VenKhema said and the Teacher approvedSensing that The Teacher approves of me VenKhema got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circled him  keeping him on his right  and leftThen VenSumana not long after VenKhema had left said to the Blessed One When a monk is an arahant with his fermentations ended  one who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis  the thought doesnt occur to him that There is no one better than me or There is no one equal to me or There is no one worse than me That is what VenSumana said and the Teacher approvedSensing that The Teacher approves of me VenSumana got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circled him  keeping him on his right  and leftThen the Blessed One not long after VenKhema  VenSumana had left said to the monks Monks this is how clansmen declare gnosisThe meaning is stated but without mention of selfYet there are some worthless people who declare gnosis as if in jestThey will fall into trouble afterwardThen VenAnanda went to VenSariputta and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenSariputta Friend Sariputta to what extent does a monk hear Dhamma that he has not heard do the Dhammas he has heard not get confused do the Dhammas he has touched with his awareness stay current and does he understand what was not understoodFriend Ananda is learnedLet the answer occur to himIn that case friend Sariputta listen to the DhammaPay careful attentionI will speakAs you say friend VenSariputta respondedVenAnanda said There is the case friend where a monk masters the Dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose  verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question  answer sessionsHe teaches the Dhamma in detail  as he has heard it as he has remembered it  to othersHe gets others to

open make plain what wasnt plain dispel doubt on various doubtful pointsIts to this extent friend Sariputta that a monk hears Dhamma he has not heard that the Dhammas he has heard do not get confused that the Dhammas he has touched with his awareness stay current and that he understands what was not understoodIts amazing my friendIts astounding my friend how wellsaid that was by friend AnandaAnd we will remember friend Ananda as endowed with these six qualities Friend Ananda has mastered the Dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations

make open for friend Ananda what wasnt open make plain what wasnt plain dispel doubt on various doubtful pointsThen Moliyasivaka the wanderer went to the Blessed One and exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The Dhamma is visible herenow the Dhamma is visible herenow it is saidTo what extent is the Dhamma visible herenow timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselvesVery well then Sivaka I will ask you a question in returnAnswer as

One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeOn one occasion VenMaha Cunda was staying among the Cetis in SanjatiyaThere he addressed the monks Friend monksYes friend the monks responded to himVenMaha Cunda said Friends there is the case where Dhammadevotee monks disparage jhana monks saying These people are absorbed and besorbed in jhana saying We are absorbed we are absorbed But why indeed are they absorbedFor what purpose are they absorbedHow are they absorbed In that the Dhammadevotee monks do not shine brightly and the jhana monks do not shine brightlyThat is not practicing for the welfare of the masses for the happiness of the masses for the good of the masses nor for the welfare  happiness of human  divine beingsThen there is the case where jhana monks disparage Dhammadevotee monks saying These people say We are Dhammadevotees we are Dhammadevotees but they are excitable boisterous unsteady mouthy loose in their talk muddled in their mindfulness unalert unconcentrated their minds wandering their senses uncontrolledWhy indeed are they Dhamma devoteesFor what purpose are they Dhamma devoteesHow are they Dhamma devotees In that the jhana monks do not shine brightly and the Dhammadevotee monks do not shine brightlyThat is not practicing for the welfare of the masses for the happiness of the masses for the good of the masses nor for the welfare  happiness of human  divine beingsThen there is the case where Dhammadevotee monks praise only Dhammadevotee monks and not jhana monksIn that the Dhammadevotee monks do not shine brightly and the jhana monks do not shine brightlyThat is not practicing for the welfare of the masses for the happiness of the masses for the good of the masses nor for the welfare  happiness of human  divine beingsThen

practicing for the welfare of the masses for the happiness of the masses for the good of the masses nor for the welfare  happiness of human  divine beingsThus friends you should train yourselves Being Dhammadevotee monks we will speak in praise of jhana monks Thats how you should train yourselvesWhy is thatBecause these are amazing people hard to find in the world ie those who dwell touching the deathless element with the bodyAnd thus friends you should train yourselves Being jhana monks we will speak in praise of Dhammadevotee monks Thats how you should train yourselvesWhy is thatBecause these are amazing people hard to find in the world ie those who penetrate with discernment statements of deep meaningMonks for one who partakes of sensuality poverty is suffering in the worldYes lordAnd a poor destitute penniless person gets into debtFor one who partakes of sensuality getting into debt is suffering in the worldYes lordAnd a poor destitute penniless person having gotten into debt owes interest paymentsFor one who partakes of sensuality interest payment is suffering in the worldYes lordAnd when a poor destitute penniless person owing interest payments does not pay interest

mental qualities no sense of conscience with regard to skillful mental qualities no sense of concern with regard to skillful mental qualities no persistence with regard to skillful mental qualities no discernment with regard to skillful mental qualities is in the discipline of a noble one said to be poor destitute  pennilessHe  poor destitute  penniless having no conviction with regard to skillful mental qualities no sense of conscience no sense of concern no persistence no discernment with regard to skillful mental qualities  engages in misconduct by way of the body misconduct by way of speech misconduct by way of the mindFor him I tell you this is getting into debtFor the purpose of concealing his bodily misconduct he formulates evil desires He desires May they not know about me He resolves May they not know about me He speaks May they not know about me He makes an effort with his body May they not know about me For the purpose of concealing his verbal misconduct For the purpose of concealing his mental misconduct he formulates evil desires He desires May they not know about me He resolves May they not know about me He speaks May they not know about me He makes an effort with his body May they not know about me For him I tell you this is interest paymentAnd then his wellbehaved companions in the holy life say about him This venerable one acts in this way behaves in this way For him I tell you this is being served noticeAnd then when he has gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling he is beset with evil unskillful thoughts accompanied by remorseFor him I tell you this is being houndedHe  poor destitute  penniless having engaged in misconduct by way of the body misconduct by way of speech  misconduct by way of the mind  on the breakup of the body after death is bound by the bond of hell or the bond of the animal wombAnd I can imagine no one other bond so tormenting so painful so obstructive to the unexcelled rest from bondage as the bond of hell or the bond of the animal wombTranslators note The frame story here is common to three suttas AN AN and ANAlthough the conversation takes a different turn in each case in all three

when urinating  defecatingIn ancient times when seafaring merchants put to sea in ships they took with them a bird to sight landWhen the ship was out of sight of land they released the bird and it flew eastward and westward northward and southward upward and all aroundAnd if the bird saw no land it returned to the ship but if the bird sighted land nearby it was truly goneOnce upon a time there was a royal fig tree called Steadfast belonging to king Koravya whose five outstretched branches provided a cool and pleasing shadeIts girth extended a hundred miles and its roots spread out for forty milesAnd the fruits of that tree were indeed great As large as harvest baskets  such were its succulent fruits  and as clear as the honey of beesOne portion was enjoyed by the king along with his household of women one portion was enjoyed by the army one portion was enjoyed by the people of the town and village one portion was enjoyed by brahmans and ascetics and one portion was enjoyed by the beasts and birdsNobody guarded the fruits of that royal tree and neither did anyone harm one another for the sake of its fruitsBut then a certain man came along who fed upon as much of Steadfasts fruits as he wanted broke off a branch and wandered on his wayAnd the deva who dwelled in Steadfast thought to herself It is astonishing it is truly amazing that such an evil man would dare to feed upon as much of Steadfasts fruits as he wants break off a branch and then wander on his wayNow what if Steadfast were in the future to bear no more fruit And so the royal fig tree Steadfast bore no more fruitSo then king Koravya went up to where Sakka chief among the gods was dwelling and having approached said this Surely you must know sire that Steadfast the royal fig tree no longer bears fruit And then Sakka created a magical creation of such a form that a mighty wind and rain came down and toppled the royal fig tree Steadfast uprooting it entirelyAnd then the deva who dwelled in Steadfast grieved lamented and stood weeping on one side with a face full of tearsAnd then Sakka chief among the gods went up to where the deva was standing and having approached said this Why is it deva that you grieve and lament and stand on one side with a face full of tears It is because sire a mighty wind and rain has come and toppled my abode uprooting it entirelyAnd were you deva upholding the dhamma of trees when this happened But how is it sire that a tree upholds the dhamma of treesLike this deva Rootcutters take the root of the tree barkstrippers take the bark leafpickers take the leaves flowerpickers take the flowers fruitpickers take the fruits  and none of this is reason enough for a deva to think only of herself or become moroseThus it is deva that a tree upholds the dhamma of treesThen indeed sire I was not upholding the dhamma of trees when the mighty wind and rain came and toppled my abode uprooting it entirely If it were the case deva that you were to uphold the dhamma of trees it may be that your abode might be as it was before I will indeed sire uphold the dhamma of treesMay my abode be as it was beforeAnd then Sakka chief among the gods created a magical creation of such a form that a mighty wind and rain came down and raised up the royal fig tree Steadfast and its roots were entirely healedHis given name was Siddhattha as a wandering ascetic he went by his mothers clan name Gotama he was known throughout his world as the sage of his fathers family or Sakyamuni and when enlightened he became known as Buddha the Awakened OneHis followers most often referred to him as Bhagavant or Blessed One but the name he almost always used for himself was TathagataTathagata has always been an awkward word to translateTatha on its own means something like so thus or in this way and gata is the past participle of the verb to go and simply means gone We therefore often find the phrase translated in the texts as Thusgone or the ThusGone one The commentator Buddhaghosa lists eight different ways the word can be construed and in the process engages in some characteristically creative etymologyI admit to having never really understood the import of the term Tathagata  until I came across this storyWith the image of the bird released by the sailors searching for land upon which to alight a number of things began to fall into placeTo begin with we should recognize two ways the expression is used one referring to the Buddha as a being who will no longer be reborn and the other describing how the consciousness of an awakened person still in this world relates to the object of experienceSometimes when one of the arahants passes away Mara like a dark cloud can be seen searching for where their consciousness has become reestablishedIn such cases the Buddha says of the arahant that their consciousness is not stationed anew anywhereIn this sense the Buddha is clearly using the epithet Tathagata to mean that he will not be reborn again  like the bird leaving the ship without returning his consciousness does not alight again in any of the worlds to become rebound with another bodyBut there is also a sense in which the phrase aptly describes the nature of the awakened mind here in this lifeWhen his questioners try to pin the Buddha down about whether his consciousness survives after death he rebukes them by saying that even here and now the consciousness of a Tathagata is untraceable since there is no means of measuring or knowing itThe awakened mind is said to be unattached to anything in the world  like a bird that does not alight upon and thus get bound to any object of experienceIn fact learning to unattach the mind from its fetters is a good deal of what insight meditation training is all aboutThe Satipatthana Sutta for example states that when practicing mindfulness properly a person abides independent not clinging to anything in the worldThe householder Anathapindika just before his death received instructions from Sariputta urging him to train himself thus I will not cling to what is seen heard sensed cognized encountered sought after and examined by the mind my consciousness will not be dependent on any of thatAll this combines to suggest that a crucial aspect of the Buddhas teaching is the notion of consciousness being unattached to mental or physical objectsIn momenttomoment practice this means letting go of attachments and letting experience be simply what it isPerhaps with proper practice we can live as a bird freely circling the ship of our body and our world rather than as one imprisoned in a cage on its deckLike every Buddhist story this one works on many levels simultaneouslyIt is no accident that the great tree has five branches or that the word used for each portion is khandha  the term designating the five aggregates of form feeling perception formations and consciousnessThe man eating his fill of fruit is manifesting greed craving or desire and his breaking of the branch represents hatred anger or aversionThese are two of the three poisonous roots out of which all unwholesome action arisesThus the entire image is representative of a person being wronged by another or facing the eruption of their own latent tendencies for harmful actionNotice that the story does not teach the evil man the folly of his ways since there is often nothing one can do to avoid such people or such inclinations in oneselfThe teaching is more about our response to transgressionSakkas point is that it is selfcentered to react petulantly to such an affront and that the only suitable response is with kindness and generosity  to oneself as well as to othersAs the Dhammapada so aptly says Never at any time in this world are hostilities resolved by hostility but by kindness they are resolved  this is an eternal truthThis teaching is given to Dhammika a monk who complains of his treatment by certain laypeopleThe Buddha reflects the situation back upon Dhammika who as it turns out does not treat his fellow monks very wellIt is an occasion to teach Dhammika with the help of this story the dhamma of a recluse which boils down to not returning the insult of the insulter the anger of the angry or the abuse of the abuserThen a certain brahman approached the Blessed One having approached the Blessed One he exchanged friendly greetingsAfter pleasant conversation had passed between them he sat to one sideHaving sat to one side the brahman spoke to the Blessed One thusVenerable Gotama I am one of such a doctrine of such a view There is no selfdoer there is no otherdoerI have not

been concealed showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark Those who have eyes see forms Just so the Venerable Gotama has illuminated the Dhamma in various waysI go to Venerable Gotama as refuge and to the Dhamma and to the assembly of monksFrom this day for as long as I am endowed with breath let Venerable Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refugeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha on Vultures Peak MountainThen early in the morning VenSariputta put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe was coming down from Vultures Peak Mountain with a large group of monks when he saw a large wood pile off to one sideSeeing it he said to the monks Friends do you see that large wood pile over thereYes friend the monks repliedFriends if he wanted to a monk with psychic power having attained mastery of his mind could will that wood pile to be nothing but earthWhy is thatThere is earthproperty in that wood pile in dependence on which he could will that wood pile to be nothing but earthIf he wanted to a monk with psychic power having attained mastery of his mind could will that wood pile to be nothing but water fire wind beautiful unattractiveWhy is thatThere is the property of the unattractive in that wood pile in dependence on which he could will that wood pile to be nothing but unattractiveOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryAnd on that occasion the lay woman Velukandaki Nandas mother had established a donation endowed with six factors for the community of monks headed by Sariputta  MoggallanaThe Blessed One saw with his divine eye surpassing the human that the laywoman Velukandaki Nandas mother had established a donation endowed with six factors for the community of monks headed by Sariputta  MoggallanaOn seeing this he addressed the monks Monks the lay woman Velukandaki Nandas mother has established a donation endowed with six factors for the community of monks headed by Sariputta  MoggallanaAnd how is a donation endowed with six factorsThere is the case where there are the three factors of the donor the three factors of the recipientsAnd which are the three factors of the donorThere is the case where the donor before giving is glad while giving hisher mind is bright  clear and after giving is gratifiedThese are the three factors of the donorAnd which are the three factors of the recipientsThere is the case where the recipients are free of passion or are practicing for the subduing of passion free of aversion or practicing for the subduing of aversion and free of delusion or practicing for the subduing of delusionThese are the three factors of the recipientsSuch are the three factors of the donor the three factors of the recipientsAnd this is how a donation is endowed with six factorsAnd it is not easy to take the measure of the merit of a donation thus endowed with six factors as just this much a bonanza of merit a bonanza of what is skillful  a nutriment of bliss heavenly resulting in bliss leading to heaven  that leads to what is desirable pleasing charming beneficial pleasant It is simply reckoned as a great mass of merit incalculable immeasurableJust as it is not easy to take the measure of the great ocean as just this many buckets of water just this many hundreds of buckets of water just this many thousands of buckets of water or just this many hundreds of thousands of buckets of water It is simply reckoned as a great mass of water incalculable immeasurableIn the same way it is not easy to take the measure of the merit of a donation thus endowed with six factors as just this much a bonanza of merit a bonanza of what is skillful

great benefitIt gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its final endAnd how is mindfulness of death developed  pursued so that it is of great fruit  great benefit gains a footing in the

a centipede might bite meThat would be how my death would come aboutThat would be an obstruction for meStumbling I might fall my food digested might trouble me my bile might be provoked my phlegm piercing wind forces might be provokedThat would be how my death would come aboutThat would be an obstruction for me Then the monk should investigate Are there any evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by me that would be an obstruction for me were I to die in the night If on reflecting he realizes that there are evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die in the night then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful

noble attainments in this lifetimePeople who commit them fall  immediately at the moment of death  into hellNo help from outside is able to mitigate the sufferings they will endure in hell and thus they are said to be incurableOnly when the results of these deeds have worked themselves out will they be released from hellEven if they return to the human plane they will continue to suffer the consequences of their deedsFor example VenMoggallana one of the Buddhas foremost disciples killed his parents many aeons ago and the results of that deed pursued him even through his final lifetime when he was beaten to deathThere are these five inhabitants of the states of deprivation inhabitants of hell who are in agony  incurableWhich fiveOne who has killed hisher mother one who has killed hisher father one who has killed an arahant one who  with a corrupted mind  has caused the blood of a Tathagata to flow and one who has caused a split in the SanghaThese are the five inhabitants of the states of deprivation inhabitants of hell who are in agony  incurableI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Forest at the Gabled PavilionThen in the late afternoon he left his seclusion and went to the sick ward where he saw a monk who was weak  sicklySeeing him he sat down on a prepared seatAs he was sitting there he addressed the monks When these five things dont leave a monk who is weak  sickly it can be expected of him that before long  with the ending of the fermentations  he will enter  remain in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having realized  directly known them for himself in the here  nowWhich fiveThere is the case where a monk remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to the body is percipient of foulness with regard to food is percipient of distaste with regard to every world is percipient of the undesirability of all fabrications and has the perception of death well established within himselfWhen these five things dont leave a monk who is weak  sickly it can be expected of him that before long  with the ending of the fermentations  he will enter  remain in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having realized  directly known them for himself in the here  nowOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Magadhans at AndhakavindaThen VenAnanda went to him and having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Ananda the new monks  those who have not long gone forth who are newcomers in this Dhamma

fifth type of warriorlike individual who can be found existing among the monksThese are the five warriorlike individuals who can be found existing among the monks Translators note This discourse is addressed to monks and deals with their battle to maintain their celibacy and to come out victorious in the practiceThe Buddha compares the victorious monk to a victorious warrior an analogy that was probably intended to appeal to the monks masculine prideIn this analogy a celibate is not a wimp but is instead a warrior to the highest degreeBecause the first confrontation for a man trying to maintain his celibacy involves his attraction to women women play the role of firstline enemy in this discourseUnfortunately we dont have any record of how the Buddha advised his nun followers on how to maintain their celibacy so we dont know if he would have used a womanwarrior analogy when teaching them to resist their attraction to men or if he would have replaced it with another analogy to appeal more specifically to their feminine prideHowever there are discourses in the Pali canon that depict nuns as successfully maintaining their celibacy when confronted by men in the forestA prime example is Therigatha XIV there are other examples of nuns resisting temptation in the Bhikkhuni SamyuttaUltimately of course the true enemy lies not without but withinThis is shown by the fact that the monk in this discourse has to go off alone and put an end to the fermentation of sensual passion in his own mind before he can be considered truly victoriousMonks there are these five types of warriors who can be found existing in the worldWhich fiveThere is the case of a warrior who on seeing a cloud of dust falters faints doesnt steel himself cant engage in the battleSome warriors are

the five warriorlike individuals who can be found existing among the monks Paṭisambhidā formed from paṭi  saṃ  bhid where paṭi  saṃ should probably be understood as back together and the verbal root bhid means to break split severRhys Davids and Stede propose that a literal rendering would be resolving continuous breaking up and gloss this as analysis analytic insight discriminating knowledge moreover they associate it with the idea of logical analysisBhikkhu Nyanatiloka similarly renders the term as analytical knowledge but also as discriminationBhikkhu āṇamoli voices a divergent view in a note to his translation of in Buddhaghosas Visuddhimagga XIV where he renders paṭisambhidā as discriminationIn this translation I have decided to follow āṇamolis rendering of the termEven so discrimination does not so clearly capture the double sense of both taking apart and combining together that seems to be suggested by paṭisambhidāOne kind of epistemological process which involves both of these activities is classification in which various things even within a given class or group are divided and grouped according to their peculiar differences and similarities with respect to one anotherSo while each of the paṭisambhidā is itself a classification of a kind of knowledge it is also possible that each one is also understood to be a kind of ability to classify correctly the elements belonging to the kind of knowledge that falls into its scopeIn Visuddhimagga Buddhaghosa presents a list of what he considers to be twelve different kinds of paññā the set of catasso paṭisambhidā four discriminations is the twelfth of theseHe goes on to give an extensive discussion of them which although of interest is very much influenced by the Abhidhamma interpretation of the term Buddhaghosa begins by citing the definition of the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga and then proceeds to follow the subsequent Vibhaṅga discussionIf Buddhaghosa was indeed the author of the Sumaṅgalavilāsinī then his Abhidhammabased account of the four paṭisambhidā may well diverge from the original meaning of the term in the period in which the Suttas evolved and were committed to memoryFor the same reasons this is very probably also the case for many commentarial interpretations of earlier Sutta conceptsPaṭibhāna understanding illumination intelligence readiness or confidence of speech promptitude witCfthe Sanskrit pratibhāna from prati  bhā pratibhāti to shine upon to appear to the mind to become clear or manifest thus pratibhāna becoming clear or visible obviousness intelligence eloquence brilliancy boldness audacityWe might also cite here the definition from Vibhaṅga with which Buddhaghosa opens his discussion of the four paṭisambhidāKnowledge with respect to meaning is discrimination of meaning knowledge with respect to dhamma is discrimination of dhamma knowledge with respect to the linguistic expression of dhamma is discrimination of language and knowledge with respect to kinds of knowledge is discrimination of paṭibhānaatthe ñāṇaṃ atthapaṭisambhidā dhamme ñāṇaṃ dhammapaṭisambhidā tatra dhammaniruttābhilāpe ñāṇaṃ niruttipaṭisambhidā ñāṇesu ñāṇaṃ paṭibhānapaṭisambhidāāṇamoli in his translation of this passage as cited within Buddhaghosas text renders paṭibhāna as perspicuityYathā vimuttaṃ cittaṃ paccavekkhatiIn the Introduction to the commentary to Dīgha Nikāya known as the Sumaṅgalavilāsinī and traditionally attributed to Buddhaghosa there is the following interesting reference to the four discriminationsMoreover a bhikkhu wellpractised in Vinaya depending on the attainment of virtue arrives at the three knowledges wellpractised in Sutta depending on the attainment of concentration he arrives at the six higher knowledges wellpractised in Abhidhamma depending on the attainment of wisdom he arrives at the four discriminationsvinaye pana suppaṭipanno bhikkhu sīlasampadaṃ nissāya tisso vijjā pāpuṇāti sutte suppaṭipanno samādhisampadaṃ nissāya cha abhiññā pāpuṇāti abhidhamme suppaṭipanno paññāsampadaṃ nissāya catasso paṭisambhidā pāpuṇāti From this we see that the commentator believed that the four discriminations were the result of mastery of the Abhidhamma and that the Abhidhamma is associated with the development of wisdomHowever given that the attainment of the four paṭisambidhā is mentioned here in this sutta it follows that the paṭisambidhā cannot be a result of a mastery of the Abhidhamma because the Abhidhamma did not even exist at the time of the compilation of the suttasWe know this even according to the traditional evidence from the reports of the First and Second Councils contained in the last two sections of the Cullavagga the second part of the Khandhaka in the Vinaya PiṭakaIn the report of the First Council therein only the Vinaya and the Dhamma are mentioned Come friends let us chant the Dhamma and the VinayaVenerable Mahākassapa questions Venerable Upāli concerning the contexts of the Vinaya and then he questions the Venerable nanda concerning the contexts of the Suttas starting with the Brahmajāla then the SāmaññaphalaIn this way he asked about the five Nikāyas questioned consecutively Venerable nanda answeredAgain in the report of the Second Council said in the text itself to have taken place one hundred years after the Buddhas Parinibbāna the resolution of the dispute between the two groups of monks depends upon a sound knowledge of the Vinaya and the DhammaThus for example The Venerable Elder has learned much Dhamma and Vinaya at the feet of his spiritual teacherWhen the Venerable Elder is reflecting upon the Dhamma and Vinaya how is it The Venerable Revata to whom this passage refers is earlier described as very learned one to whom the āgama has been handed down a bearer of the Dhamma the Vinaya the mātikā intelligent accomplished wise modest meticulous anxious to observe the discipline Here the word mātikā matrices codes most probably refers to the rules of the Pātimokkhasutta rules for monks and rules for nunsOn this matter see Ovon Hinber A Handbook of Pāli Literature  and See also Bhikkhus Bodhi and āṇamoli The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha p n The Codes are probably the rules of the Pātimokkha abstracted from their explanatory matrix as well as lists of the primary doctrinal categories used for expounding the Dhamma Again see also FWatanabe Philosophy and its Development in the Nikāyas and Abhidhamma pThis is clearly the earliest usage and meaning of the word mātikā as it is found in the Vinaya and SuttasFrom such indications we may conclude that it was fundamentally anachronistic of the commentator to suppose that the paṭisambhidā were attainments resulting from a mastery of the much later Abhidhamma literature for the latter simply did not exist at the time of the learning compilation and original transmission of the SuttasNow in this present sutta we find very specific reference made to five qualities that is the four paṭisambidhā in conjunction with what we must evidently take to be the fifth quality in question yathāvimuttaṃ cittaṃ paccavekkhati he reflects upon mind as liberatedIt is probable that this fifth quality is the crucial one and that without it the four other qualities would by no means produce the result which is the theme of the sutta ie nacirasseva

place by the fabrications of forceful restraintThe realization arises right within oneself that I enter into this concentration mindfully and mindfully I emerge from itWise  mindful you should develop immeasurable concentrationWhen wise  mindful one has developed immeasurable concentration these five realizations arise right within oneselfI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks Monks I will teach you the fivefactored noble right concentrationListen and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One said Now what monks is fivefactored noble right concentrationThere is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluationHe permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalJust as if a skilled bathman or bathmans apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again and again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within and without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawalThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalThis is the first development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationFurthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assuranceHe permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composureJust like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from east west north or south and with the skies periodically supplying abundant showers so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composureThis is the second development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationAnd furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a blue white or redlotus pond there may be some of the blue white or red lotuses which born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those blue white or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureThis is the third development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationAnd furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting wrapped from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating his body with a pure bright awarenessThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessThis is the fourth development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationAnd furthermore the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to wellconsidered welltuned by means of discernmentJust as if one person were to reflect on another or a standing person were to reflect on a sitting person or a sitting person were to reflect on a person lying down even so monks the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to wellpondered welltuned by means of discernmentThis is the fifth development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationWhen a monk has developed and pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingSuppose that there were a water jar set on a stand brimful of water so that a crow could drink from itIf a strong man were to tip it in any way at all would water spill outYes lordIn the same way when a monk has developed and pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingSuppose there were a rectangular water tank  set on level ground bounded by dikes  brimful of water so that a crow could drink from itIf a strong man were to loosen the dikes anywhere at all would water spill outYes lordIn the same way when a monk has developed and pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingSuppose there were a chariot on level ground at four crossroads harnessed to thoroughbreds waiting with whips lying ready so that a skilled driver a trainer of tamable horses might mount and  taking the reins with his left hand and the whip with his right  drive out and back to whatever place and by whichever road he liked in the same way when a monk has developed and pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants he wields manifold supranormal powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through spaceHe dives in and out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants he hears  by means of the divine earelement purified and surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine and human whether near or farHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants he knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awarenessHe discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passionHe discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversionHe discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusionHe discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mindHe discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mindHe discerns an excelled mind as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mindHe discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mindHe discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mindHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants he recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes and detailsHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants he sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kammaHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants then through the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and nowHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsMonks when right view is supported by five factors it has awarenessrelease as its fruit awarenessrelease as its reward it has discernmentrelease as its fruit discernmentrelease as its rewardWhich fiveThere is the case where right view is supported by virtue supported by learning

strength of discernmentThere is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressThis is called the strength of discernmentThese monks are the five strengths of one in trainingThus you should train yourselves We will be endowed with the strength of conviction that is the strength of one in training with the strength of conscience the strength of concern the strength of persistence the strength of discernment that is the strength of one in training Thats how you should train yourselvesEndowed with four qualities a monk isnt fit to stay in isolated forest  wilderness dwellingsWhich fourwith thoughts of sensuality with thoughts of ill will with thoughts of harmfulness

illnessBeing subject himself to death he seeks what is subject to deathBeing subject himself to defilement he seeks what is subject to defilementThese are four ignoble searchesNow these four are noble

dark with dark resultThere is kamma that is bright with bright resultThere is kamma that is dark  bright with dark  bright resultThere is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kammaAnd what is kamma that is dark with dark resultThere is the case where a certain person fabricates an injurious bodily fabrication fabricates an injurious verbal fabrication fabricates an injurious mental fabricationHaving fabricated an injurious bodily fabrication having fabricated an injurious verbal fabrication having fabricated an injurious mental fabrication he rearises in an injurious worldOn rearising in an injurious world he is there touched by injurious contactsTouched by injurious contacts he experiences feelings that are exclusively painful like those of the beings in hellThis is called kamma that is dark with dark resultAnd what is kamma that is bright with bright resultThere is the case where a certain person fabricates a noninjurious bodily fabrication a noninjurious verbal fabrication a noninjurious mental fabrication He rearises in a noninjurious world There he is touched by noninjurious contacts He experiences feelings that are exclusively pleasant like those of the Beautiful Black DevasThis is called kamma that is bright with bright resultAnd what is kamma that is dark  bright with dark  bright resultThere

dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kammaRight view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationThis is called kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kammaThese monks are the four types of kamma directly realized verified  made known by meMonks these four things are bornWhich fourAffection is born of affectionAversion is born of affectionAffection is born of aversionAversion is born of aversionAnd how is affection born of affectionThere is the case where an individual is pleasing appealing  charming to individualOthers treat that individual as pleasing appealing  charming and the other one thinks This individual is pleasing appealing  charming to meOthers treat this individual as pleasing appealing  charming He gives rise to affection for themThis is how affection is born of affectionAnd how is aversion born of affectionThere is the case where an individual is pleasing appealing  charming to individualOthers treat that individual as displeasing unappealing  not charming and the other one thinks This individual is pleasing appealing

the other one thinks This individual is displeasing unappealing  not charming to meOthers treat this individual as pleasing appealing  charming He gives rise to aversion for themThis is how aversion is born of aversionMonks these are the four things that are bornNow on the occasion when a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhana  rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation  then any affection of his that is born of affection does not come aboutAny aversion of his that is born of affection any affection of his that is born of aversion any aversion of his that is born of aversion does not come aboutOn the occasion when a monk enters  remains in the second jhana enters  remains in the third jhana enters  remains in the fourth jhana then any affection of his that is born of affection does not come aboutAny aversion of his that is born of affection any affection of his that is born of aversion any aversion of his that is born of aversion does not come aboutOn the occasion when a monk through the ending of the mental fermentations enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having known  verified them for himself right in the here  now then any affection of his that is born of affection is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingAny aversion of his that is born of affection any affection of his that is born of aversion any aversion of his that is born of aversion is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThis is said to be a monk who doesnt pull in

strength of conviction strength of conscience strength of concern strength of persistence  strength of discernment  and these five faculties of his  the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of discernment  appear intenselyBecause of their intensity he attains quickly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the effluentsThis is called painful practice with quick intuitionAnd which is pleasant practice with quick intuitionThere is the case where a monk  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joy  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painHe dwells in dependence on these five strengths of a learner  strength of conviction strength of conscience strength of concern strength of persistence  strength of discernment  and these five faculties of his  the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of discernment  appear intenselyBecause of their intensity he attains quickly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the effluentsThis is called pleasant practice with quick intuitionThese are the four modes of practiceAccording to the Commentary this means the concentration forming the PathThis is apparently a reference to this passage in SnBecause the description of pleasant practice here contains the standard jhana formula while the description of painful practice contains no mention of jhana some writers have taken this as proof that there is an alternative path to awakening that does not involve the jhanasHowever this reading ignores the description of how painful practice and pleasant practice can yield either slow or quick intuitionIntuition comes slowly when the five faculties are present in a weak form and quickly when they are present in an intense formNow in both cases the faculty of concentration  which is defined with the standard formula for the jhanas  has to be present for the ending of the effluentsBecause this is true both for painful practice and for pleasant practice both sorts of practice need jhana in order to succeedMonks there are these four modes of practiceWhich fourPainful practice with slow intuition painful practice with quick intuition pleasant

lord Ananda please accept this confession of my transgression as such so that I may restrain myself in the futureYes sister a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddleheaded and

thinking arose in the Blessed Ones awareness The mental qualities that ripen in release have ripened in RahulaWhat if I were to lead Rahula further to the ending of the mental fermentationsThen the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe went into Savatthi for almsHaving gone for alms in Savatthi after the meal returning from his alms round he said to VenRahula Fetch your sitting cloth RahulaWe will go to the Grove of the Blind to spend the dayResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One VenRahula carrying his sitting cloth followed behind the

arises in dependence on contact at the eye as a mode of feeling a mode of perception a mode of fabrication or a mode of consciousness With that too he grows disenchantedHe grows disenchanted with the earHe grows disenchanted with the noseHe grows disenchanted with the tongueHe grows disenchanted with the bodyHe grows disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted with ideas disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect disenchanted with contact at the intellectAnd whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect as a mode of feeling a mode of perception a mode of fabrication or a mode of consciousness With that too he grows disenchantedDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is depleted the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world That is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenRahula delighted in the Blessed

forms disenchanted with consciousness at the eye disenchanted with contact at the eye disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with cravingHe grows disenchanted with the earHe grows disenchanted with the noseHe grows disenchanted with the tongueHe grows disenchanted with the bodyHe grows disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted with ideas disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect disenchanted with contact at the intellect disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with cravingDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted at his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the hearts of monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentationeffluentsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen Mahapajapati Gotami together with about other nuns went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one sideAs she was standing there she said to him Exhort the nuns lordInstruct the nuns lordGive the nuns a talk on DhammaNow at that time the elder monks were taking turns in exhorting the nuns but VenNandaka didnt want to exhort the nuns when his turn cameSo the Blessed One addressed VenAnanda Ananda whose turn is it to exhort the nuns todayLord everyone has taken his turn in exhorting the nuns except for VenNandaka here who doesnt want to exhort the nuns when his turn comesThen the Blessed One addressed VenNandaka Exhort the nuns NandakaInstruct the nuns NandakaGive the nuns a talk on Dhamma brahmanAs you say lord VenNandaka repliedThen early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe he went into Rajagaha for almsAfter his meal on returning from his alms round he went with a companion to Rajaka ParkThe nuns saw him coming from afar and on seeing him arranged a seat and set out water for his feetVenNandaka sat down on the arranged seat and washed his feetThe nuns bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs they were sitting there VenNandaka said to them This will be a questionresponse talk sistersWhere you understand you should say We understand Where you dont you should say We dont understand Where you are doubtful or perplexed you should question me in response How is this venerable sirWhat is the meaning of this Venerable sir we are gratified  delighted that you invite us in this waySo then sisters what do you think Is the eye constant or inconstant Inconstant venerable sir And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful venerable sir And

thatBecause we have already seen it well as it actually is with right discernment that these six consciousnessgroups too are inconstantGood good sistersThats how it is for a disciple of the noble ones who has seen it as it actually is with right discernmentJust as when the oil in a burning oil lamp is inconstant  subject to change its wick is inconstant  subject to change its flame is inconstant  subject to change its light is inconstant  subject to changeIf someone were to say The oil in that burning oil lamp is inconstant  subject to change its wick is inconstant  subject to change its flame is inconstant  subject to change but as for its light that is constant everlasting eternal  not subject to change would he be speaking rightlyNo venerable sirWhy is thatBecause the oil in that burning oil lamp is inconstant  subject to change its wick is inconstant  subject to change its flame is inconstant  subject to change so how much more should its light be inconstant  subject to changeIn the same way sisters if someone were to say My six internal media are inconstant but what I experience based on the six internal media  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  that is constant everlasting eternal  not subject to change would he be speaking rightlyNo venerable sirWhy is thatBecause each feeling arises dependent on its corresponding conditionWith the cessation of its corresponding condition it ceasesGood good sistersThats how it is for a disciple of the noble ones who has seen it as it actually is with right discernmentJust as when the root of a great standing tree  possessed of heartwood  is inconstant  subject to change its trunk is inconstant  subject to change its branches  foliage are inconstant  subject to change its shadow is inconstant  subject to changeIf someone were to say The root of that great standing tree  possessed of heartwood  is inconstant  subject to change its trunk is inconstant  subject to change its branches  foliage are inconstant  subject to change but as for its shadow that is constant everlasting eternal  not subject to change would he be speaking rightlyNo venerable sirWhy is thatBecause the root of that great

conditionWith the cessation of its corresponding condition it ceasesGood good sistersThats how it is for a disciple of the noble ones who has seen it as it actually is with right discernmentJust as if a skilled butcher or butchers apprentice having killed a cow were to carve it up with a sharp carving knife so that  without damaging the substance of the inner flesh without damaging the substance of the outer hide  he would cut sever  detach only the skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in betweenHaving cut severed  detached the outer skin and then covering the cow again with that very skin if he were to say that the cow was joined to the skin just as it had been would he be speaking rightlyNo venerable sirWhy is thatBecause if the skilled butcher or butchers apprentice having killed a cow were to cut sever  detach only the skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between and having covered the cow again with that very skin then no matter how much he might say that the cow was joined to the skin just as it had been the cow would still be disjoined from the skinThis simile sisters I have given to convey a messageThe message is this The substance of the inner flesh stands for the six internal media the substance of the outer hide for the six external mediaThe skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between stand for passion  delightAnd the sharp knife stands for noble discernment  the noble discernment that cuts severs  detaches the defilements fetters  bonds in betweenSisters there are these seven factors for awakening through whose development  pursuit a monk enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  nowWhich sevenThere is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishmentHe develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening serenity as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishmentThese are the seven factors for awakening through whose development  pursuit a monk enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  nowThen having exhorted the nuns with this exhortation VenNandaka dismissed them saying Go sistersThe time has come The nuns delighting in and approving of VenNandakas exhortation got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him  keeping him to the right  and went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One they stood to one sideAs they were standing there the Blessed One said to them Go nunsThe time has come So the nuns having bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him  keeping him to the right  and departedThen not long after the nuns departure the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks just as on the uposatha day of the fourteenth people at large are not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is lacking or full for it is clearly lacking in the same way even though the nuns are gratified with Nandakas Dhammateaching their resolves have not yet been fulfilled So he addressed VenNandaka In that case Nandaka exhort the nuns again tomorrow with the exact same exhortationAs you say lord VenNandaka repliedThen after the night had passed early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe he went into Rajagaha for alms Then not long after the nuns departure the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks just as on the uposatha day of the fifteenth people at large are not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is lacking or full for it is clearly full in the same way the nuns are gratified with Nandakas Dhammateaching and their resolves have been fulfilledOf these nuns the most backward is a streamwinner not destined for the planes of deprivation headed to selfawakening for sureThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsTranslators note This systematic exploration of the phenomenal field of human experience is a powerful exercise in nonattachmentNo need to wait until lying on your death bed to undertake itPut aside an hour find a quiet place and try working through this map of the inner landscape step by stepOn one occasion the householder Anathapindika was afflicted suffering and gravely illThe venerable Sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went to the residence of Anathapindika with Ananda as his attendantHaving gone there he sat down on a seat made ready and said to Anathapindika I hope you are getting well I hope you are comfortableI hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasingVenerable Sariputta I am not getting well I am not comfortableMy painful feelings are increasing not subsidingJust as if a strong man were splitting my head open with a sharp sword so too violent winds cut through my headJust as if a strong man were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband so too there are violent pains in my headJust as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an oxs belly with a sharp butchers knife so too violent winds are carving up my bellyJust as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over a pit of hot coals so too there is a violent burning in my bodyI am not getting well I am not comfortableMy painful feelings are increasing not subsidingThen householder you should train thusWhen this was said Anathapindika wept and shed tearsThen Ananda asked him Are you foundering householder are you sinkingI am not foundering Ananda I am not sinkingBut although I have long waited upon the Teacher and bhikkhus worthy of esteem never before have I heard such a talk on the DhammaSuch talk on the Dhamma is not given to lay people clothed in white but only to those who have gone forthWell then Sariputta let such talk on the Dhamma be given to lay people clothed in whiteThere are people with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing such talk on the DhammaThere will be those who will understandThen after giving Anathapindika this advice Sariputta and Ananda rose from their seats and departedSoon after they had left the householder Anathapindika died and reappeared in the Tushita heavenI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Varanasi in the Game Refuge at IsipatanaThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Monks at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana the Tathagatha  the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one  set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma

acquiesced through silenceThen VenSariputta having put on his robes and taking his bowl  outer robe went to the home of Anathapindika the householder with VenAnanda as his attendantOn arrival he sat down on a prepared seat and said to Anathapindika the householder I trust you are getting better householderI trust you are comfortableI trust that your pains are lessening and not increasingI trust that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasingI am not getting better venerable sirI am not comfortableMy severe pains are increasing not lesseningThere are signs of their

with a sharp butchers knife There is an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men seizing a weaker man with their arms were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embersI am not getting

founderingNo venerable sirIm not sinking nor am I founderingIts just that for a long time I have attended to the Teacher and to the monks who inspire my heart but never before have I heard a talk on the Dhamma like thisThis sort of talk on the Dhamma householder is not given to lay people clad in whiteThis sort of talk on the Dhamma is given to those gone forthIn that case VenSariputta please let this sort of talk on the Dhamma be given to lay people clad in whiteThere are clansmen with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing DhammaThere will be those who will understand itThen VenSariputta and VenAnanda having given this instruction to Anathapindika the householder got up from their seats and leftThen not long after they left Anathapindika the householder died and reappeared in the Tusita heavenThen Anathapindika the devas son in the far extreme of the night his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed One and on

reverence the matchless Wheel of Dhamma set in motion by the Tathagata the Consumate One the supremely Enlightened One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi cannot be set in motion by a recluse or brahmana or deva or Brahma or by anyone in the worldThat is to say it was a proclamation of the Four Noble Truths by way of teaching laying down establishing opening up analyzing and elucidating themThis the Venerable Sariputta saidThose monks glad at heart rejoiced at the words of the Venerable SariputtaI have heard that on one occasion as the Blessed One was wandering among the Magadhans he entered Rajagaha went to the potter Bhaggava and on arrival said to him If it is no inconvenience for you Bhaggava I will stay for one night in your shedIts no inconvenience for me lord but there is a wanderer who has already taken up residence thereIf he gives his permission you may stay there as you likeNow at that time a clansman named Pukkusati had left home and gone forth into homelessness through faith out of dedication to the Blessed OneHe was the one who had already taken up residence in the potters shedSo the Blessed One approached VenPukkusati and said to him If it is no inconvenience for you monk I will stay one night in the shedThe shed is roomy my friendStay as you likeSo the Blessed One entering the potters shed and setting out a spread of grass to one side sat down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreHe spent most of the night sittingVenPukkusati also spent most of the night sittingThe thought occurred to the Blessed One How inspiring is the way this clansman behavesWhat if I were to question him So he said to VenPukkusati Out of dedication to whom monk have you gone forthWho is your teacherOf whose Dhamma do you approveThere is my friend Gotama the contemplative a son of the Sakyans gone forth from a Sakyan clanNow this excellent report about the honorable Gotama has been spread about Indeed the Blessed One is worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the worlds unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed I have gone forth out of dedication to that Blessed OneThat Blessed One is my teacherIt is of that Blessed Ones Dhamma that I approveBut where monk is that Blessed One  worthy  rightly selfawakened  staying nowThere is my friend a city in the northern lands named SavatthiThat is where the Blessed One  worthy  rightly selfawakened  is staying nowHave you ever seen that Blessed One beforeOn seeing him would you recognize himNo my friend I have never seen the Blessed One before nor on seeing him would I recognize himThen the thought occurred to the Blessed One It is out of dedication to me that this clansman has gone forthWhat if I were to teach him the Dhamma So he said to VenPukkusati I will teach you the Dhamma monkListen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say friend replied VenPukkusatiThe Blessed One said A person has six properties six media of sensory contact eighteen considerations  four determinationsHe has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flowAnd when the currents of construing do not flow he is said to be a sage at peaceOne should not be negligent of discernment should guard the truth be devoted to relinquishment and train only for calmThis is the summary of the analysis of the six propertiesA person has six properties Thus was it saidIn reference to what was it saidThese are the six properties the earth property

intellect as a medium of sensory contactA person has six media of sensory contact Thus was it said and in reference to this was it saidA person has eighteen considerations Thus was it saidIn reference to what was it saidThese are the eighteen considerations On seeing a form with the eye one considers a form that can act as a basis for joy a form that can act as a basis for distress or a form that can act as a basis for equanimityOn hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an aroma with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On feeling a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect one considers an idea that can act as a basis for joy an idea that can act as a basis for distress or an idea that can act as a basis for equanimityThus there are six considerations conducive to joy six conducive to distress  six conducive to equanimityA person has eighteen considerations Thus was it said and in reference to this was it saidA person has four determinations Thus was it saidIn reference to what was it saidThese are the four determinations the determination for discernment the determination for truth the determination for relinquishment the determination for calmA person has four determinations Thus was it said and in reference to this was it saidOne should not be negligent of discernment should guard the truth be devoted to

propertyAnything internal within oneself thats hard solid  sustained head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver membranes spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces or anything else internal within oneself thats hard solid and sustained This is called the internal earth propertyNow both the internal earth property  the external earth property are simply earth propertyAnd that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment This is not mine this is not me this is not my self When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the earth property and makes the earth property fade from the mindAnd what is the liquid propertyThe liquid property may be either internal or externalWhat is the internal liquid propertyAnything internal belonging to oneself thats liquid watery  sustained bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears oil saliva mucus

is not me this is not my self When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the space property and makes the space property fade from the mindThere remains only consciousness pure  brightWhat does one cognize with that consciousnessOne cognizes pleasure One cognizes pain One cognizes neither pleasure nor pain In dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as pleasure there arises a feeling of pleasureWhen sensing a feeling of pleasure one discerns that I am sensing a feeling of pleasure One discerns that With the cessation of that very sensory contact that is to be felt as pleasure the concomitant feeling  the feeling of pleasure that has arisen in dependence on the sensory contact that is to be felt as pleasure  ceases is stilled In dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as pain In dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain there arises a feeling of neither pleasure nor painWhen sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one discerns that I am sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain One discerns that With the cessation of that very sensory contact that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain the concomitant feeling  the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain that has arisen in dependence on the sensory contact that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain  ceases is stilledJust as when from the friction  conjunction of two fire sticks heat is born and fire appears and from the separation  disjunction of those very same fire sticks the concomitant heat ceases is stilled in the same way in dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as pleasure there arises a feeling of pleasure In dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as pain In dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain there arises a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain One discerns that With the cessation of that very sensory contact that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain the concomitant feeling ceases is stilledThere remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminousJust as if a skilled goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up a crucible and taking gold with a pair of tongs place it in the crucible He would blow on it time  again sprinkle water on it time  again examine it time  again so that the gold would become refined wellrefined thoroughly refined flawless free from dross pliant malleable  luminousThen whatever sort of ornament he had in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  it would serve his purposeIn the same way there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminousOne discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space I would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine  thus supported thus sustained  would last for a long timeOne discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure and bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception I would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine  thus supported thus sustained  would last for a long timeOne discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this towards the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricatedOne discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure and bright as this towards the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated One neither fabricates nor mentally fashions for the sake of becoming or unbecomingThis being the case one is not sustained by anything in the worldUnsustained one is not agitatedUnagitated one is totally unbound right withinOne discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldSensing a feeling of pleasure one discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relishedSensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relishedSensing a feeling of pleasure one senses it disjoined from itSensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one senses it disjoined from itWhen sensing a feeling limited to the body one discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to the body When sensing a feeling limited to life one discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life One discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life all that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right hereJust as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil  wick and from the termination of the oil  wick  and from not being provided any other sustenance  it goes out unnourished even so when sensing a feeling limited to the body one discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to the body When sensing a feeling limited to life one discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life One discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life all that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right hereThus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for discernment for this  the knowledge of the passing away of all suffering  stress  is the highest noble discernmentHis release being founded on truth does not fluctuate for whatever is deceptive is false Unbinding  the undeceptive  is trueThus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for truth for this  Unbinding the undeceptive  is the highest noble truthWhereas formerly he foolishly had taken on mental acquisitions and brought them to completion he has now abandoned them their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for relinquishment for this  the renunciation of all mental acquisitions  is the highest noble relinquishmentWhereas formerly he foolishly had greed  as well as desire  infatuation  he has now abandoned them their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingWhereas formerly he foolishly had malice  as well as illwill  hatred  he has now abandoned them Whereas formerly he foolishly had ignorance  as well as delusion  confusion  he has now abandoned them their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for calm for this  the calming of passions aversions  delusions  is the highest noble calmOne should not be negligent of discernment should guard the truth be devoted to relinquishment and train only for calm Thus was it said and in reference to this was it saidHe has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flowAnd when the currents of construing do not flow he is said to be a sage at peace Thus was it saidWith reference to what was it saidI am is a construingI am this is a construingI shall be is a construingI shall not be I shall be possessed of form I shall not be possessed of form I shall be percipient I shall not be percipient I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient is a construingConstruing is a disease construing is a cancer construing is an arrowBy going beyond all construing he is said to be a sage at peaceFurthermore a sage at peace is not born does not age does not die is unagitated and is free from longingHe has nothing whereby he would be bornNot being born will he ageNot aging will he dieNot dying will he be agitatedNot being agitated for what will he longIt was in reference to this that it was said He has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flowAnd when the currents of construing do not flow he is said to be a sage at peace Now monk you should remember this my brief analysis of the six propertiesThen the thought occurred to VenPukkusati Surely the Teacher has come to meSurely the One Wellgone has come to meSurely the Rightly Selfawakened One has come to me Getting up from his seat arranging his upper robe over one shoulder and bowing down with his head at the Blessed Ones feet he said A transgression has overcome me lord in that I was so foolish so muddleheaded and so unskilled as to assume that it was proper to address the Blessed One as friend May the Blessed One please accept this confession of my transgression as such so that I may achieve restraint in the futureYes monk a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddleheaded and so unskilled as to assume that it was proper to address me as friend But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we accept your confessionFor it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma  Discipline of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and achieves restraint in the futureLord may I receive full acceptance from the Blessed OneAnd are your robes  bowl completeNo lord my robes  bowl are not completeTathagatas do not give full acceptance to one whose robes  bowl are not completeThen VenPukkusati delighting  rejoicing in the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and keeping him on his right left in search of robes and a bowlAnd while he was searching for robes  a bowl a runaway cow killed himThen a large number of monks approached the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One Lord the clansman Pukkusati whom the Blessed One instructed with a brief instruction has diedWhat is his destinationWhat is his future stateMonks the clansman Pukkusati was wiseHe practiced the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the DhammaWith the destruction of the first five fetters he has arisen spontaneously there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsDespite the abstract format of this discourse it deals with an emotional topic the source of emotions the use of the emotions in the course of the practice and the ideal emotional state of a person who has completed the path and is fit to teach othersIn particular this discourse counters a common misperception that the distress that comes from having an unachieved goal is an obstacle in the practice and that the antidote for that distress is to renounce any sense of goalsIn actuality that distress  termed renunciation distress  has an important role in the practice to overcome the distress that comes with a sense of loss over sensual pleasures that have not been attained or those that have been attained in the past but now no longer existRenunciation distress serves as a reminder that the loss of sensual pleasures is not a serious matterAs for renunciation distress it is overcome not by abandoning any sense of goal but by following the path and realizing the joy that comes when the goal is reachedThis discourse counters another misperception as well that equanimity is the goal of the practiceIn actuality renunciation equanimity serves a function as part of the path of practice  as a tool for letting go of renunciation joy  and then it too is transcended by the state called nonfashioning in which there is no act of intention not even the intention underlying equanimity at allI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the analysis of the six sense mediaListen and pay close attentionI will speakYes lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One said The six internal sensemedia should be knownThe six external sensemedia should be knownThe six classes of consciousness should be knownThe six classes of contact should be knownThe eighteen explorations for the intellect should be knownThe thirtysix states to which beings are attached should be knownWith regard to them depending on this

forms cognizable by the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing connected with worldly baits  or when one recalls the previous acquisition of such forms after they have passed ceased  changed That is called household joyAnd what are the six kinds of renunciation joyThe joy that arises when  experiencing the inconstancy of those very forms their change fading  cessation  one sees with right

arises when one regards as a nonacquisition the nonacquisition of forms cognizable by the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing connected with worldly baits  or when one recalls the previous nonacquisition of such forms after they have passed ceased  changed That is called household distressAnd what are the six kinds of renunciation distressThe distress coming from the longing that arises in one who is filled with longing for the unexcelled liberations when  experiencing the inconstancy of those very forms their change fading  cessation  he sees with right discernment as it actually is that all forms past or present are inconstant stressful subject to change and he is filled with this longing O when will I enter  remain in the dimension that the noble ones now enter  remain in This is called renunciation distressAnd what are the six kinds of household equanimityThe equanimity that arises when a foolish deluded person  a runofthemill untaught person who has not conquered his limitations or the results of action  who is blind to danger  sees a form with the eyeSuch equanimity does not go beyond the form which is why it is called household equanimityAnd what are the six kinds of renunciation equanimityThe equanimity that arises when  experiencing the inconstancy of those very forms their change fading  cessation  one sees with right discernment as it actually is that all forms past or present are inconstant stressful subject to change This equanimity goes beyond form which is why it is called renunciation equanimityThe thirtysix states to which beings are attached

it saidAnd in reference to this was it saidThere are three frames of reference that a noble one cultivates cultivating which he is a teacher fit to instruct a group thus was it saidAnd in reference to what was it saidThere is the case where the Teacher  out of sympathy seeking their wellbeing  teaches the Dhamma to his disciples This is for your wellbeing this is for your happiness His disciples do not listen or lend ear or apply their minds to gnosisTurning aside they stray from the Teachers messageIn this case the Tathagata is not satisfied nor is he sensitive to satisfaction yet he remains untroubled mindful  alertThis is the first frame of reference that a noble one cultivates cultivating which he is a teacher fit to instruct a groupFurthermore there is the case where the Teacher  out of sympathy seeking their wellbeing  teaches the Dhamma to his disciples This is for your wellbeing this is for your happiness Some of his disciples do not listen or lend ear or apply their minds to gnosisTurning aside they stray from the Teachers messageBut some of his disciples listen lend ear  apply their minds to gnosisThey do not turn aside or stray from the Teachers messageIn this case the Tathagata is not satisfied nor is he sensitive to satisfaction at the same time he is not dissatisfied nor is he sensitive to dissatisfactionFree from both satisfaction  dissatisfaction he remains equanimous mindful  alertThis is the second frame of referenceFurthermore there is the case where the Teacher  out of sympathy seeking their wellbeing  teaches the Dhamma to his disciples This is for your wellbeing this is for your happiness His disciples listen lend ear  apply their minds to gnosisThey do not turn aside or stray from the Teachers messageIn this case the Tathagata is satisfied and is sensitive to satisfaction yet he remains untroubled mindful  alertThis is the third frame of reference that a noble one cultivates cultivating which he is a teacher fit to instruct a groupThere are three frames of reference that a noble one cultivates cultivating which he is a teacher fit to instruct a group thus was it saidAnd in reference to this was it saidAmong master trainers he is said to be the unexcelled trainer of those people fit to be tamed thus was it saidAnd in reference to what was it saidSteered by the elephant trainer the elephant to be tamed runs in only one direction east west north or southSteered by the horse trainer the horse to be tamed runs in only one direction east west north or southSteered by the ox trainer the ox to be tamed runs in only one direction east west north or southBut steered by the Tathagata  worthy and rightly selfawakened  the person to be tamed fans out in eight directionsPossessed of form heshe sees formsThis is the first directionNot percipient of form internally heshe sees forms externallyThis is the second directionHeshe is intent only on the beautifulThis is the third directionWith the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space heshe enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of spaceThis is the fourth directionWith the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness heshe enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessThis is the fifth directionWith the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing heshe enters and remains in the dimension of nothingnessThis is the sixth directionWith the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness heshe enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThis is the seventh directionWith the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception heshe enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feelingThis is the eighth directionSteered by the Tathagata  worthy and rightly selfawakened  the person to be tamed fans out in eight directionsAmong master trainers he is said to be the unexcelled trainer of those people fit to be tamed thus was it saidAnd in reference to this was it saidThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThis celebrated sutta shows some of the complexities of kamma and its resultsBeginning with a strange view expressed by a confused wanderer and a confused answer given by a bhikkhu the Buddha then gives his Great Exposition of Kamma which is based upon four types of peopleThe Buddha then shows how wrong views can arise from only partial understanding of truthOne can see the stages of this a mystic sees in vision an evildoer suffering in hell this confirms what he had heard about moral causality so he says evildoers always go to hell and dogma hardens and becomes rigid when he says Only this is true anything else is wrong The stages of this process are repeated for each of the four persons after which the Buddha proceeds to analyze these views grounded in partial experience and points out which portions are true and which are dogmatic superstructure which is unjustifiedFinally the Buddha explains his Great Exposition of Kamma in which he shows that notions of invariability like the evildoer goes to hell are much too simpleThe minds of people are complex and they make many different kinds of kamma even in one lifetime some of which may influence the last moment when kamma is made before death which in turn is the basis for the next lifeThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Feeding PlaceNow on that occasion the venerable Samiddhi was living in a forest hutThen the wanderer Potaliputta walking and wandering for exercise came to the venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings with him and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideWhen he had done so he said to the venerable SamiddhiI heard and learned this friend Samiddhi from the monk Gotamas lips Bodily kammas are vain verbal kammas are vain only mental kammas are true But there is actually that attainment having entered upon which nothing is felt at allNot so friend Potaliputta do not say thus do not misrepresent the Blessed One it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One the Blessed One would not say so Bodily kammas are vain verbal kammas are vain only mental kammas are true And there is actually that attainment having entered upon which nothing is felt at allHow long is it since you went forth friend SamiddhiNot long friend three yearsThere now what shall we say to the elder bhikkhus when the young bhikkhu fancies the Master is to be defended thusAfter doing intentional kamma friend Samiddhi by way of body speech or mind what does one feelAfter doing an intentional kamma friend Potaliputta by way of body speech or mind one feels sufferingThen neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the words of the venerable Samiddhi the wanderer Potaliputta got up from his seat and went awaySoon after the wanderer Potaliputta had gone the venerable Samiddhi went to the venerable Ananda and exchanged greetings with him and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideWhen he had done so he told the venerable Ananda all his conversation with the wanderer PotaliputtaWhen this was said the venerable Ananda told him Friend Samiddhi this conversation should be told to the Blessed OneCome let us go to the Blessed One and having done so let us tell him about thisAs he answers so we shall bear it in mindEven so friend the venerable Samiddhi repliedThen they went together to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one sideWhen they had done so the venerable Ananda told the Blessed One all the venerable Samiddhis conversation with the wanderer PotaliputtaWhen this was said the Blessed One told the venerable AnandaI do not even know the wanderer by sight AnandaHow could there have been such a conversationThe wanderer Potaliputtas question ought to have been answered after analyzing it but this misguided man Samiddhi answered it without qualificationWhen this was said the venerable Udayin said to the Blessed One But venerable sir supposing when the venerable Samiddhi spoke he was referring to this namely Whatever is felt is suffering Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda See Ananda how this misguided man Udayin interferesI knew Ananda that this misguided man Udayin would unreasonably interfere nowTo begin with it was the three kinds of feeling that were asked about by the wanderer PotaliputtaIf when this misguided man Samiddhi was asked he had answered the wanderer Potaliputta thus After doing an intentional kamma by way of body speech and mind to be felt as pleasure he feels pleasure after doing an intentional kamma by way of body speech and mind to be felt as pain he feels pain after doing an intentional kamma by way of body speech and mind to be felt as neitherpainnorpleasure he feels neitherpainnorpleasure  by answering him thus Ananda the misguided man Samiddhi would have given the wanderer Potaliputta the right answerBesides Ananda who are the foolish thoughtless wanderers of other sects that they will understand the Tathagatas Great Exposition of Kammaif you Ananda would listen to the Tathagata expounding the Great Exposition of KammaThis is the time Blessed One this is the time Sublime One for the Blessed One to expound the Great Exposition of KammaHaving heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will bear it in mindThen listen Ananda and heed well what I shall sayEven so venerable sir the venerable Ananda repliedThe Blessed One said thisAnanda there are four kinds of persons existing in the worldWhat fourHere some person kills living beings takes what is not given misconducts himself in sexual desires speaks falsehood speaks maliciously speaks harshly gossips is covetous is illwilled and has wrong viewOn the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellBut here some person kills living beings and has wrong viewOn the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly worldHere some person abstains from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sexual desires from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech from gossip he is not covetous is not illwilled and has right viewOn the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly worldBut here some person abstains from killing living beings and has right viewOn the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellHere Ananda in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person kills living beings here takes what is not given misconducts himself in sexual desires speaks falsehood speaks maliciously speaks harshly gossips is covetous is illwilled has wrong viewHe sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellHe says It seems that there are evil kammas and that there is the result of misconduct for I have seen that a person killed living beings here had wrong viewI have seen that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell He says It seems that one who kills living beings has wrong view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellThose who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge So he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says Only this is true anything else is wrongBut here in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person kills living beings here has wrong viewHe sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly worldHe says It seems there are no evil kammas there is no result of misconductFor I have seen that a

heavenly worldHe says It seems that there are good kammas there is result of good conductFor I have seen that a person abstained from killing living beings here had right viewI saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world He says It seems that one who abstains from killing living beings has right view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly worldThose who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge So he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says Only this is true anything else is wrongBut here in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person abstains from killing living beings here has right viewHe sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellHe says It seems that there are no good kammas there is no result of good conductFor I have seen that a person abstained from killing here had right viewI saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell He says It seems that one who abstains from killing living beings has right view will always

their knowledge So he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says Only this is true anything else is wrongNow Ananda when a monk or brahman says thus It seems that there are evil kammas there is the result of misconduct I concede that to himWhen he says thus For I have seen that some person killed living beings had wrong viewI saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell I concede that to himWhen he says thus It seems that one who kills living beings has wrong view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell I do not concede that to himWhen he

felt and insisting on that alone he says Only this is true anything else is wrong I do not concede that to himWhy is thatThe Tathagatas knowledge of the Great Exposition of Kamma is differentNow when a monk or brahman says thus It seems that there are no evil kammas there is no result of misconduct I do not concede that to himWhen he says thus For I have seen that a person killed living beings had wrong viewI saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world I concede that to himWhen he says thus It seems that one who kills living

Kamma is differentNow Ananda there is the person who has killed living beings here has had wrong viewAnd on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellBut the evil kamma producing his suffering was done by him earlier or the evil kamma producing his suffering was done by him later or wrong view was undertaken and completed by him at the time of his deathAnd that was why on the dissolution of the body after death he reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellBut since he has killed living beings here has had wrong view he will feel the result of that here and now or in his next rebirth or in some subsequent existenceNow there is the person who has killed living beings here has had wrong viewAnd on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly worldBut the good kamma producing his happiness was done by him

result of that here and now or in his next rebirth or in some subsequent existenceSo Ananda there is kamma that is incapable and appears incapable there is kamma that is incapable and appears capable there is kamma that is capable and appears capable there is kamma that is capable and appears incapableThis is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Ananda was satisfied and he rejoiced in the Blessed Ones wordsiA strong unwholesome kamma the result of which will come before the results of weaker unwholesome kammasiiWholesome kamma is followed by unwholesome deathproximate kamma which makes the former incapable of good result immediatelyiiiA strong wholesome kamma will mature even before much accumulated unwholesome kammaivUnwholesome kamma is followed by wholesome deathproximate kamma which will mature first and is capable of good resultsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove in the Squirrels sanctuaryAnd on that occasion VenSamiddhi was staying in a wilderness hutThen Potaliputta the wanderer while walking  wandering around to exercise his legs went to VenSamiddhi and exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenSamiddhi Face to face with Gotama the contemplative have I heard this face to face have I learned this Bodily action is barren verbal action is barren only mental action is trueAnd there is an attainment in which on being attained nothing is felt Dont say that friendDont slander the Blessed OneFor its not good to slander the Blessed One the Blessed One would not say that Bodily action is barren verbal action is barren only mental action is true But there is friend an attainment in which on being attained nothing is felt How long has it been friend Samiddhi since you went forthNot long friendThree yearsThen what now should I say about the elder monks when a junior monk would suppose that his Teacher is to be defended in this wayHaving intentionally done an action with body with speech or with mind what does one experienceHaving intentionally done an action with body with speech or with mind one experiences stressThen Potaliputta the wanderer neither delighted in nor scorned VenSamiddhis wordsNeither delighting nor scorning he got up from his seat and leftThen not long after Potaliputta the wanderer had left VenSamiddhi went to Vennanda and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he reported to Vennanda the Elder the entirety of his discussion with Potaliputta the wandererWhen this was said Vennanda said to him Friend Samiddhi there is warrant here for seeing the Blessed OneLets go to the Blessed One and on arrival report this matter to himHowever he explains it to us thats how we should bear it in mindAs you say friend VenSamiddhi responded to VennandaSo VenSamiddhi and Vennanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs they were sitting there Vennanda reported to the Blessed One the entirety of the discussion between VenSamiddhi and Potaliputta the wandererWhen this was said the Blessed One said I do not recall even having seen Potaliputta the wanderer much less having that sort of discussionAnd his question which deserved an analytical answer has been given a categorical answer by this worthless man SamiddhiWhen this was said VenUdāyin said to the Blessed One But what if VenSamiddhi was speaking in reference to this Whatever is felt comes under stressWhen this was said the Blessed One said to Vennanda Look nanda at how this worthless Udāyin interruptsI knew just now that he would interrupt in an inappropriate wayFrom the very beginning Potaliputta the wanderer was asking about the three kinds of feelingWhen this worthless Samiddhi was asked by him in this way he should have answered Having intentionally done  with body with speech or with mind  an action that is to be felt as pleasure one experiences pleasureHaving intentionally done  with body with speech or with mind  an action that is to be felt as pain one experiences painHaving intentionally done  with body with speech or with mind  an action that is to be felt as neitherpleasurenorpain one experiences neitherpleasurenorpainAnswering this way this worthless Samiddhi would have rightly answered Potaliputta the wandererBut then who are these wanderers of other sects foolish  inexperiencedAnd who would understand the Tathāgatas greater analysis of action  if you were to listen nanda to the Tathāgata analyzing the greater analysis of actionThis is the time O Blessed OneThis is the time O One Wellgone for the Blessed One to analyze the greater analysis of actionHaving heard the Blessed One the monks will bear it in mindIn that case nanda listen and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord Vennanda responded to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said nanda there are four kinds of person to be found in the worldWhich fourThere is the case where a certain person is one who takes life takes what is not given engages in illicit sex lies speaks divisively speaks abusively engages in idle chatter is covetous malevolent  holds wrong viewWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hellBut there is also the case where a certain person is one who takes life takes what is not given engages in illicit sex lies speaks divisively speaks abusively engages in idle chatter is covetous malevolent  holds wrong view with the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a good destination a heavenly worldAnd there is

awareness that when his mind is thus concentrated he sees with the divine eye pure and surpassing the human that person  the case where one who takes life takes what is not given engages in illicit sex lies speaks divisively speaks abusively engages in idle chatter is covetous malevolent  holds wrong view with the breakup of the body after death has reappeared in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hellHe says So there really are evil actions there really is the result of misconductFor I saw the case where a person who took life  held wrong view with the breakup of the body after death has reappeared in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell He says Anyone who takes life  hold wrong view They all on the breakup of the body after death reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hellWhoever knows this knows rightlyWhoever knows otherwise their knowledge is wrong Insisting through obstinacy  grasping right there on what was seen by himself known by himself understood by himself he states Only this is trueEverything otherwise is worthlessThen there is the case nanda where a certain contemplative or brahman  through

apparently effectualThere is action that is both effectual and apparently effectualThere is action that is effectual but apparently ineffectualThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified Vennanda delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsFor a discussion of this discourse as an example of an analytical answer to a question see Skill in Questions chapter fourI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One said Monks I will teach you a statement  its analysisListen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said this A monk should investigate in such a way that his consciousness neither externally scattered  diffused nor internally positioned he would from lack of clingingsustenance be unagitatedWhen  his consciousness neither externally scattered  diffused nor internally positioned  from lack of clingingsustenance he would be unagitated there is no seed for the conditions of future birth aging death or stressThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said it the One Wellgone got up from his seat and went into his dwellingThen not long after the Blessed One had left this thought occurred to the monks This brief statement the Blessed One has made after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie A monk should investigate in such a way that his consciousness neither externally scattered  diffused nor internally positioned he would from lack of clingingsustenance be unagitatedWhen  his consciousness neither externally scattered  diffused nor internally positioned  from lack of clingingsustenance he would be unagitated there is no seed for the conditions of future birth aging death or stress now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement Then the thought occurred to them VenMaha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his knowledgeable companions in the holy lifeHe is capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statementSuppose we were to go to him and on arrival question him about this matterSo the monks went to VenMaha Kaccana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one sideAs they were standing there they Analyze the meaning VenMaha KaccanaFriends its as if a man needing heartwood looking for heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  passing over the root  trunk of a standing tree possessing heartwood  were to imagine that heartwood should be looked for among its branches  leavesSo it is with you who  having bypassed the Blessed One when you were face to face with him the Teacher  imagine that I should be asked about this matterFor knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he seesHe is the Eye he is Knowledge he is Dhamma he is BrahmaHe is the speaker the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the TathagataThat was the time when you should have questioned him about this matterHowever he answered that was how you should have remembered itYes friend Kaccana knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he seesHe is the Eye he is Knowledge he is Dhamma he is BrahmaHe is the speaker the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the TathagataThat was the time when we should have questioned him about this matterHowever he answered that was how we should have remembered itBut you are praised by the Teacher and esteemed by your knowledgeable companions in the holy lifeYou are capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statementAnalyze the meaning VenMaha Kaccana without making it difficultIn that case my friends listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say friend the monks respondedVenMaha Kaccana said this Friends concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie A monk should investigate in such a way that his consciousness neither externally scattered  diffused nor internally positioned he would from lack of clingingsustenance be unagitatedWhen  his consciousness neither externally scattered  diffused nor internally positioned  from lack of clingingsustenance he would be unagitated there is no seed for the conditions of future birth aging death or stress  I understand the detailed meaning to be thisHow is consciousness said to be scattered  diffusedThere is the case where a form is seen with the eye and consciousness follows the drift of the theme of the form is tied to the attraction of the theme of the form is chained to the attraction of the theme of the form is fettered  joined to the attraction of the theme of the form Consciousness is said to be externally scattered  diffusedThere is the case where a sound is heard with the ear an aroma is smelled with the nose a flavor is tasted with the tongue a tactile sensation is felt with the body an idea is cognized with the intellect and consciousness follows the drift of the theme of the idea is tied to the attraction of the theme of the idea is chained to the attraction of the theme of the idea is fettered  joined to the attraction of the theme of the idea Consciousness is said to be externally scattered  diffusedAnd how is consciousness said not to be externally scattered  diffusedThere is the case where a form is seen with the eye and consciousness does not follow the drift of the theme of the form is not tied to chained to fettered or joined to the attraction of the theme of the form Consciousness is said not to be externally scattered

the intellect and consciousness does not follow the drift of the theme of the idea is not tied to chained to fettered or joined to the attraction of the theme of the idea Consciousness is said not to be externally scattered  diffusedAnd how is the mind said to be internally positionedThere is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHis consciousness follows the drift of the rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal is tied to chained fettered  joined to the attraction of the rapture  pleasure born of withdrawalOr further with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceHis consciousness follows the drift of the rapture  pleasure born of composure is tied to chained fettered  joined to the attraction of the rapture  pleasure born of composureOr further with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding His consciousness follows the drift of the equanimity  pleasure is tied to chained fettered  joined to the attraction of the equanimity  pleasureOr further with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painHis consciousness follows the drift of the neither pleasure nor pain is tied to chained to fettered  joined to the attraction of the neither pleasure nor pain The mind is said to be internally positionedAnd how is the mind said not to be internally positionedThere is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn

drift of the neither pleasure nor pain is not tied to chained to fettered or joined to the attraction of the neither pleasure nor pain The mind is said to be not internally positionedAnd how is agitation caused by clingingsustenanceThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHis form changes  is unstableBecause of the change  instability of form his consciousness alters in accordance with the change in formWith the agitations born from the alteration in accordance with the change in form and coming from the coarising of qualities his mind stays consumedAnd because of the consumption of awareness he feels fearful threatened  solicitousHe assumes feeling to be the selfHe assumes perception to be the selfHe assumes fabrications to be the selfHe assumes consciousness to be the self of the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessHis consciousness changes  is unstableBecause of the change  instability of consciousness his consciousness alters in accordance with the change in consciousnessWith the agitations born from the alteration in accordance with the change in consciousness and coming from the coarising of qualities his mind stays consumedAnd because of the consumption of awareness he feels fearful threatened  solicitousThis friends is how agitation is caused by clingingsustenanceAnd how is nonagitation caused by lack of clinging sustenanceThere is the case where an instructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  doesnt assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHis form changes  is unstable but his consciousness doesnt  because of the change  instability of form  alter in accordance with the change in formHis mind is not consumed with any agitations born from an alteration in accordance with the change in form or coming from the coarising of qualitiesAnd because his awareness is not consumed he feels neither fearful threatened nor solicitousHe doesnt assume feeling to be the selfHe doesnt assume perception to be the selfHe doesnt assume fabrications to be the selfHe doesnt assume

change in consciousness or coming from the coarising of qualitiesAnd because his awareness is not consumed he feels neither fearful threatened nor solicitousThis friends is how nonagitation is caused by lack of clingingsustenanceSo concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie A monk should investigate in such a way that his consciousness neither externally scattered  diffused nor internally positioned he would from lack of clingingsustenance be unagitatedWhen  his consciousness neither externally scattered  diffused nor internally positioned  from lack of clinging sustenance he would be unagitated there is no seed for the conditions of future birth aging death or stress  this is how I understand the detailed meaningNow friends if you wish having gone to the Blessed One question him about this matterHowever he answers is how you should remember itThen the monks delighting in  approving of VenMaha Kaccayanas words got up from their seats and went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they Then VenMaha Kaccayana analyzed the meaning using these words these statements these phrasesMaha Kaccayana is wise monksHe is a person of great discernmentIf you had asked me about this matter I too would have answered in the same way he didThat is its meaning and that is how you should remember itThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen Subha the student Todeyyas son went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama what is the reason what is the cause why baseness  excellence are seen among human beings among the human raceFor shortlived  longlived people are to be seen sickly  healthy ugly  beautiful uninfluential  influential poor  rich lowborn  highborn stupid  discerning people are to be seenSo what is the reason what is the cause why baseness  excellence are seen among human beings among the human raceStudent beings are owners of kamma heir to kamma born of kamma related through kamma and have kamma as their arbitratorKamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness  refinementI dont understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas statement spoken in brief without explaining the detailed meaningIt would be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I might understand the detailed meaning of his brief statementIn that case student listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say Master Gotama Subha the student respondedThe Blessed One said There is the case student where a woman or man is a killer of living beings brutal bloodyhanded

the other hand they drive a redhot iron stake through one foot they drive a redhot iron stake through the other foot they drive a redhot iron stake through the middle of his chestThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhaustedThen the hellwardens lay him down and slice him with axesThen they hold him feet up  head down and slice him with adzesThen they harness him to a chariot and drive him back  forth over ground that is burning blazing  glowingThen they make him climb up  down a vast mountain of embers that is burning blazing  glowingThen they hold him feet up  head down and plunge him into a redhot copper cauldron that is burning blazing  glowingThere he boils with bubbles foamingAnd as he is boiling there with bubbles foaming he goes now up he goes now down he goes now aroundThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhaustedThen the hellwardens throw him into the Great HellAnd as to the Great Hell monksThe flame that leaps from the eastern wall of the Great Hell strikes the western wallThe flame that leaps from the western wall strikes the eastern wallThe flame that leaps from the northern wall strikes the southern wallThe flame that leaps from the southern wall strikes the northern wallThe flame that leaps from the bottom strikes the topThe flame that leaps from the top strikes the bottomThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhaustedThere comes a time when ultimately with the passing of a long stretch of time the eastern gate of the Great Hell opensHe runs there rushing quicklyAs he runs there rushing quickly his outer skin burns his inner skin burns his flesh burns his tendons burn even his bones turn to smokeWhen is lifted he is the just sameBut when he finally arrives the door slams shutThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhaustedThere comes a time when ultimately with the passing of a long stretch of time the western gate of the Great Hell opens the northern gate the southern gate of

his flesh burns his tendons burn even his bones turn to smokeWhen is lifted he is the just sameHe gets out through the gateBut right next to the Great Hell is a vast Excrement HellHe falls into thatAnd in that Excrement Hell needlemouth beings bore into his outer skinHaving bored into his outer skin they bore into his inner skin his flesh his tendons the boneHaving bored into the bone they feed on the marrowThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhaustedRight next to the Excrement Hell is the vast Hot Ashes HellHe falls into thatThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhaustedRight next to the Hot Ashes Hell is the vast Simbali Forest reaching up a league

stomach and comes out the lower side carrying along his bowels  intestinesThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhaustedThen the hellwardens say to him Well good man what do you want He replies Im thirsty venerable sirs So the hellwardens pry open his mouth with redhot iron tongs  burning blazing  glowing  and pour into it molten copper burning blazing  glowingIt burns his lips it burns his mouth it burns his stomach and comes out the lower side carrying along his bowels  intestinesThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhaustedThen the hellwardens throw him back into the Great Hell once moreOnce monks the thought occurred to King Yama Those who did evil actions in the world are tortured in these many waysO that I might gain the human stateAnd that a Tathāgata  worthy  rightly selfawakened  might arise in the worldAnd that I might attend to that TathāgataAnd that he might teach me the DhammaAnd that I might understand his DhammaI tell you this monks not from having heard it from another contemplative or brahmanOn the contrary I tell you this just as I have known for myself seen for myself understood for myselfThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One Wellgone the Teacher said furtherYou want long life health beauty power riches high birth wisdomOr even some of these thingsThey do not appear by chanceIt is not someones luck that they are healthy or anothers lack of it that he is stupidThough it may not be clear to us now all such inequalities among human beings come about because of the kamma they have made individuallyEach person reaps his own fruitsSo if one is touched by short life sickliness ugliness insignificance poverty low birth or stupidity and one does not like these things no need to just accept that that is the way it isThe future need not be like that provided that one makes the right kind of kamma nowKnowing what kamma to make and what not to make is the mark of a wise manIt is also the mark of one who is no longer drifting aimlessly but has some direction in life and some control over the sort of events that will occurThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThen Subha the student Todeyyas son went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideWhen he had done so Subha the student said to the Blessed OneMaster Gotama what is the reason what is the condition why inferiority and superiority are met with among human beings among mankindFor one meets with shortlived and longlived people sick and healthy people ugly and beautiful people insignificant and influential people poor and rich people lowborn and highborn people stupid and wise peopleWhat is the reason what is the condition why superiority and inferiority are met with among human beings among mankindStudent beings are owners of kammas heirs of kammas they have kammas as their progenitor kammas as their kin kammas as their homingplaceIt is kammas that differentiate beings according to inferiority and superiorityI do not understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaningIt would be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I might understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaningThen listen student and heed well what I shall sayEven so Master Gotama Subha the student repliedThe Blessed One said thisHere student some woman or man is a killer of living beings murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence

differentiate beings according to inferiority and superiorityWhen this was said Subha the student Todeyyas son said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificent Master GotamaThe Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who is lost holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see formsI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusFrom today let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeEditors note An extensive discussion of this sutta may be found in Ideal Solitude An Exposition on the Bhaddekaratta Sutta by the translatorThus have I heard At one time the Exalted one was living at Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove Anaathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks thus Monks Revered one the monks answered the Exalted One in assentThe Exalted one spoke thus Monks I shall preach to you the summary and the exposition of the Ideal Lover of SolitudeListen and give attentionI shall speak Even so revered sir the monks answered the Exalted One in assentThe Exalted One said thisAnd how monks does one trace back the pastHe thinks I was of such form in the past and brings delight to bear on itHe thinks I was of such feeling in the past and brings delight to bear on itHe thinks I was of such perception in the past and brings delight to bear on itHe thinks I was of such formations in the past and brings delight to bear on themHe thinks I was of such consciousness in the past and brings delight to bear on itThat is how monks one traces back the pastAnd how monks does one not trace back the pastHe thinks I was of such form in the past but brings no delight to bear on itHe thinks I was of such feeling of such perception of such formations He thinks I was of such consciousness in the past but brings no delight to bear on itThat is how monks one does not trace back the pastAnd how monks does one yearn for the futureHe thinks I may have such form in the future and brings delight to bear on itHe thinks I may have such feeling such perception such formations He thinks I may have such consciousness in the future and brings delight to bear on itThat is how monks one yearns for the futureAnd how monks does one not yearn for the futureHe thinks I may have such form in the future but brings no delight to bear on itHe thinks I may have such feeling such perception such formations He thinks I may have such consciousness in the future but brings no delight to bear on itThat is how monks one does not yearn for the futureAnd how is one drawn into present thingsHerein monks an uninstructed ordinary man who takes no account of the Noble Ones is unskilled in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones untrained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones taking no account of the good men unskilled in the Dhamma of the good men untrained in the Dhamma of the good men looks upon form as self or self as possessed of form or form as in self or self as in formHe looks upon feeling as self or self as possessed of feeling or feeling as in self or self as in feelingHe looks upon perception as self or self as possessed of perception or perception as in self or self as in perceptionHe looks upon formations as self or self as possessed of formations or formations as in self or self as in formationsHe looks upon consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousnessThat is how monks one is drawn into present thingsAnd how monks is one not drawn into present thingsHerein monks an instructed Noble disciple who takes into account the Noble Ones skilled in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones trained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones taking into account the good men skilled in the Dhamma of the good men trained in the Dhamma of the good men does not look upon form as self or self as possessed of form or form as in self or self as in formHe does not look upon feeling as self He does not look upon perception as self He does not look upon formations as self He does not look upon consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousnessThat is how monks one is not drawn into present thingsSo it was with reference to this that it was said Monks I shall preach to you the summary and the exposition of the Ideal Lover of SolitudeThus spoke the Exalted One Delighted those monks rejoiced in what the Exalted One had saidThe title of this discourse has sparked some controversy centered on the word ratta Modern translators in Asian vernaculars are unanimous in rendering it as night a reading seconded by Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of the discourseTranslators working in English have balked at this reading however on the grounds that the title it yields  Auspicious OneNight  makes no senseThus IBHorner drops the word ratta for her translation entirely Ven anamoli renders it as attachment yielding One Fortunate Attachment and Venanananda taking his cue from Venanamoli renders it as lover yielding Ideal Lover of SolitudeIf we look at idiomatic Pali usage though we find that there is good reason to stick with the traditional reading of night There is a tendency in the Pali canon to speak of a hour period of day and night as a night This would be natural for a society that used a lunar calendar  marking the passage of time by the phases of the moon  just as it is natural for us using a solar calendar to call the same period of time a day As the verse that forms the summary of this discourse explicitly mentions one practicing relentlessly both day and night the night in the title of the discourse would seem to be a hour rather than a hour night  and so I have chosen to render the Pali idiom into its English equivalent An Auspicious DayVenanamoli is probably right in assuming that bhaddekaratta was a preBuddhist term that the Buddha adopted and reinterpreted in light of his own teachingThe point of the discourse would thus be that  instead of the play of cosmic forces the stars or the lucky omens  ones own development of the minds attitude to time is what makes a day auspiciousYes lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the summary  exposition of one who has had an auspicious dayListen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One saidAnd how monks does one chase after the pastOne gets carried away with the delight of In the past I had such a form  In the past I had such a feeling In the past I had such a perception In the past I had such a thoughtfabrication In the past I had such a consciousness This is called chasing after the pastAnd how does one not chase after the pastOne does not get carried away with the delight of In the past I had such a form  In the past I had such a feeling In the past I had such a perception In the past I had such a thoughtfabrication In the past I had such a consciousness This is called not chasing after the pastAnd how does one place expectations on the futureOne gets carried away with the delight of In the future I might have such a form  In the future I might have such a feeling In the future I might have such a perception In the future I might have such a thoughtfabrication In the future I might have such a consciousness This is called placing expectations on the futureAnd how does one not place expectations on the futureOne does not get carried away with the delight of In the future I might have such a form  In the future I might have such a feeling In the future I might have such a perception In the future I might have such a thoughtfabrication In the future I might have such a consciousness This is called not placing expectations on the futureAnd how is one taken in with regard to present qualitiesThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person who has not seen the noble ones is not versed in the teachings of the noble ones is not trained in the teachings of the noble ones sees form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in formHeshe sees feeling

taken in with regard to present qualitiesMonks I will teach you the summary  exposition of one who has had an auspicious day Thus was it said and in reference to this was it saidThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen early in the morning VenBhumija put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe went to Prince Jayasenas residenceOn arrival he sat down on a seat made readyPrince Jayasena went to VenBhumija and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenBhumija Master Bhumija there are some brahmans

havent heard this face to face with the Blessed One prince I havent received this face to face with the Blessed One but there is the possibility that the Blessed One would answer in this way If one follows the holy life inappropriately even when having made a wish one is incapable of obtaining resultsIf one follows the holy life inappropriately even when having made no wish both having made a

would answer in this wayIf that is what Master Bhumijas teacher says if that is his view if that is what he declares then yes Master Bhumijas teacher stands as it were having struck all of those many brahmans  contemplatives down by the headPrince Jayasena then served VenBhumija from his own dish of milk riceThen VenBhumija after his meal returning from his almsround went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord early in the morning I put on my robes and carrying my bowl  outer robe went to Prince Jayasenas residenceOn arrival I sat down on a seat made readyThen Prince Jayasena went to me and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with meAfter an exchange of friendly greetings

Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing meCertainly Bhumija in answering in this way when thus asked you are speaking in line with what I have

thoroughbred steed which at the very sight of the shadow of the goadstick is stirred feels agitation What task I wonder will the trainer set me todayWhat return can I make him Here monks we may have such a steed and this is the first sort of goodly thoroughbred steed found existing in the worldThen again monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed which is not stirred at the mere sight of the goadsticks shadow feels no agitation but when his coat is pricked with the goad he is stirred feels agitation What task I wonder This is the second sortThen again monks we may have a certain

he is stirred he feels agitationThus agitated he strictly applied himselfThus applied he both realized in his own person the supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdomJust as monks that

monks is the goodly thoroughbred man in this caseThis is the fourth sortThese monks are the four sorts of thoroughbreds among men found existing in the worldMonks there are these four courses of actionWhich fourThere is the course of action that is unpleasant to do and that when done leads to what is unprofitableThere is the course of action that is unpleasant to do but that when done leads to what is profitableThere is the course of action that is pleasant to do but that when done leads to what is unprofitableThere is the course of action that is pleasant to do and that when done leads to what is profitableNow as for the course of action that is unpleasant to do and that when done leads to what is unprofitable one considers it as not worth doing for both reasons because the course of action is unpleasant to do one considers it as not worth doing and because the course of action when done leads to what is unprofitable one considers it as not worth doingThus one considers it as not worth doing for both reasonsAs for the course of action that is unpleasant to do but that when done leads to what is profitable it is in light of this course of action that one may be known  in terms of manly stamina manly persistence manly effort  as a fool or a wise personFor a fool doesnt reflect Even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable So he doesnt do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for himBut a wise person reflects Even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for himAs for the course of action that is pleasant to do but that when done leads to what is unprofitable it is in light of this course of action that one may be known  in terms of manly stamina manly persistence manly effort  as a fool or a wise personFor a fool doesnt reflect Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for himBut a wise person reflects Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable So he doesnt do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for himAs for the course of action that is pleasant to do and that when done leads to what is profitable one considers it as worth doing for both reasons because the course of action is pleasant to do one considers it as worth doing and because the course of action when done leads to what is profitable one considers it as worth doingThus one considers it as worth doing for both reasonsThese are the four courses of action There are these four types of excellent thoroughbred horses to be found existing in the worldWhich fourThere is the

thoroughbred person to be found existing in the worldThese are the four types of excellent thoroughbred persons to be found existing in the world Thus have I heard At one time the Lord was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels feeding placeNow at that time the novice Aciravata was staying in the Forest HutThen prince Jayasena who was always pacing up and down always roaming about on foot approached the novice Aciravata having approached he exchanged greetings with the novice Aciravata having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy he sat down at a respectful distanceWhile he was sitting down at a respectful distance Prince Jayasena spoke thus to the novice AciravataI have heard good Aggivessana that if a monk is abiding here diligent ardent selfresolute he may attain onepointedness of mindThat is so prince that is so princeA monk abiding here diligent ardent selfresolute may attain onepointedness of mindIt were good if the reverend Aggivessana were to teach me dhamma as he has heard it as he has mastered itI prince am not able to teach you dhamma as I have heard it as I have mastered itNow if I were to teach you dhamma as I have heard it as I have mastered it and if you could not understand the meaning of what I said that would be weariness to me that would be a vexation to meLet the reverend Aggivessana teach me dhamma as he has heard it as he has mastered itPerhaps I could understand the meaning of what the good Aggivessana saysIf I were to teach you dhamma prince as I have heard it as I have mastered it and if you were to understand the meaning of what I say that would be good if you should not understand the meaning of what I say you must remain as you are you must not question me further on the matterLet the reverend Aggivessana teach me dhamma as he has heard it as he has mastered itIf I understand the meaning of what the good Aggivessana says that will be good if I do not understand the meaning of what the good Aggivessana says I will remain as I am I will not question the reverend Aggivessana further on this matterThen the novice Aciravata taught dhamma to Prince Jayasena as he had heard it as he had mastered itWhen this had been said Prince Jayasena spoke thus to the novice AciravataThis is impossible good Aggivessana it cannot come to pass that a monk abiding diligent ardent selfresolute should attain onepointedness of mind Then Prince Jayasena having declared to the novice Aciravata that this was impossible and could not come to pass rising from his seat departedAnd soon after Prince Jayasena had departed the novice Aciravata approached the Lord having approached and greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distanceAs he was sitting down at a respectful distance the novice Aciravata told the Lord the whole of the conversation he had with Prince Jayasena as far as it had goneWhen this had been said the Lord spoke thus to the novice AciravataWhat is the good of that AggivessanaThat Prince Jayasena living as he does in the midst of sensepleasures enjoying sensepleasures being consumed by thoughts of sensepleasures burning with the fever of sensepleasures eager in the search for sensepleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known by renunciation seen by renunciation attained by renunciation realized by renunciation  such a situation does not existIt is as if Aggivessana among elephants or horses or oxen to be tamed two elephants two horses or two oxen are well tamed well trained and two are not tamed not trainedWhat do you think about this AggivessanaWould these two elephants or horses or oxen that were to be tamed and that were well tamed well trained  would these on being tamed reach tamed capacity would they being tamed attain a tamed stageYes revered sirBut those two elephants or horses or oxen that were to be tamed but that were neither tamed nor trained  would these not being tamed attain a tamed stage as do the two elephants or horses or oxen to be tamed that were well tamed well trainedNo revered sirEven so Aggivessana that Prince Jayasena living as he does in the midst of sensepleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known and realized by renunciation  such a situation does not existIt is as if Aggivessana there were a great mountain slope near a village or a markettown which two friends coming hand in hand from that village or markettown might approach having approached the mountain slope one friend might remain at the foot while the other might climb to the topThen the friend standing at the foot of the mountain slope might speak thus to the one standing on the top My dear what do you see as you stand on the top of the mountain slope He might reply As I stand on the top of the mountain slope I my dear see delightful parks delightful woods delightful stretches of level ground delightful ponds But the other might speak thus This is impossible it cannot come to pass my dear that as you stand on the top of the mountain slope you should see delightful ponds Then the friend who had been standing on top of the mountain slope having come down to the foot and taken his friend by the arm making him climb to the top of the mountain slope and giving him a moment in which to regain his breath might speak to him thus Now my dear what is it that you see as you stand on the top of the mountain slope He might speak thus I my dear as I stand on the top of the mountain slope see delightful parks delightful ponds He might speak thus Just now my dear we understood you to say This is impossible it cannot come to pass that as you stand on the top of the mountain slope you should see delightful pondsBut now we understand you to say I my dear as I stand on the top of the mountain slope see delightful parks delightful ponds He might speak thus That was because I my dear hemmed in by this great mountain slope could not see what was to be seenEven so but to a still greater degree Aggivessana is Prince Jayasena hemmed in blocked obstructed enveloped by this mass of ignoranceIndeed that Prince Jayasena living as he does in the midst of sensepleasures enjoying sensepleasures being consumed by thoughts of sensepleasures eager in the search for sensepleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known seen attained realized by renunciation  such a situation does not existHad these two similes occurred to you Aggivessana for Prince Jayasena Prince Jayasena naturally would have acted in the manner of one having trust in youBut how could these two similes for Prince Jayasena have occurred to me revered sir seeing that they are spontaneous that is to say to the Lord and have never been heard beforeAs Aggivessana a noble anointed king addresses an elephant hunter saying You good elephant hunter mount the kings elephant and go into an elephant forestWhen you see a forest elephant tie him to the neck of the kings elephant And Aggivessana the elephant hunter having answered Yes sire in assent to the noble anointed king mounts the kings elephant and goes into an elephant forestSeeing a forest elephant he ties him to the neck of the kings elephantSo the kings elephant brings him out into the openBut Aggivessana the forest elephant has this longing that is to say for the elephant forestBut in regard to him the elephant hunter tells the noble anointed king that the forest elephant has got out into the openThe noble anointed king then addresses an elephant tamer saying Come you good elephant tamer tame the forest elephant by subduing his forest ways by subduing his forest memories and aspirations and by subduing his distress his fretting and fever for the forest by making him pleased with the villages and by accustoming him to human waysAnd Aggivessana the elephant tamer having answered Yes sire in assent to the noble anointed king driving a great post into the ground ties the forest elephant to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways and accustom him to human waysThen the elephant tamer addresses him with such words as are gentle pleasing to the ear affectionate going to the heart urbane pleasant to the manyfolk liked by the manyfolkAnd Aggivessana the forest elephant on being addressed with words that are gentle liked by the manyfolk listens lends ear and bends his mind to learningNext the elephant tamer supplies him with grassfodder and waterWhen Aggivessana the forest elephant has accepted the grassfodder and water from the elephant tamer it occurs to the elephant tamer The kings elephant will now live Then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task saying Take up put down When Aggivessana the kings elephant is obedient to the elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to take up and put down then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task saying Get up sit down When Aggivessana the kings elephant is obedient to the elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to get up and sit down then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task known as standing your ground he ties a shield to the great beasts trunk a man holding a lance is sitting on his neck and men holding lances are standing surrounding him on all sides and the elephant tamer holding a lance with a long shaft is standing in frontWhile he is doing the task of standing your ground he does not move a foreleg nor does he move a hindleg nor does he move the forepart of his body nor does he move the hindpart of his body nor does he move his head nor does he move an ear nor does he move a tusk nor does he move his tail nor does he move his trunkA kings elephant is one who endures blows of sword axe arrow hatchet and the resounding din of drum and kettledrum conch and tamtam he is purified gold purged of all its dross and impurities fit for a king a royal possession and reckoned as a kingly attributeEven so Aggivessana does a Tathagata arise here in the world a perfected one fully SelfAwakened One endowed with right knowledge and conduct wellfarer knower of the worlds the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed the Awakened One the LordHe makes known this world with the devas with Mara with Brahma the creation with its recluses and brahmans its devas and men having realized them by his own superknowledgeHe teaches dhamma which is lovely at the beginning lovely in the middle lovely at the ending with the spirit and the letters he proclaims the Brahmafaring wholly fulfilled quite purifiedA householder or a householders son or one born in another family hears that dhammaHaving heard that dhamma he gains faith in the TathagataEndowed with this faith that he has acquired he reflects in this way The household life is confined and dusty going forth is in the open it is not easy for one who lives in a house to fare the Brahmafaring wholly fulfilled wholly pure polished like a conchshellSuppose now that I having cut off hair and beard having put on saffron robes should go forth from home into homelessness After a time getting rid of his wealth be it small or great getting rid of his circle of relations be it small or great having cut off his hair and beard having put on saffron robes he goes forth from home into homelessnessTo this extent Aggivessana the ariyan disciple gets out into the openBut Aggivessana devas and mankind have this longing that is to say for the five strands of sensepleasuresThe Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be moral live controlled by the control of the Obligations possessed of behavior and posture seeing danger in the slightest faults undertaking them train yourself in the rules of trainingAnd when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is moral lives controlled by the control undertaking them trains himself in the rules of training then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be guarded as to the doors of the senseorgansHaving seen a having seen a material shape with the eye do not be entranced with the general appearance do not be entranced with the detail for if one dwells with the organ of sight uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow inSo fare along controlling it guard the organ of sight achieve control over the organ of sightHaving heard a sound with the ear Having smelt a smell with the nose Having savored a taste with the tongue Having felt a touch with the body Having cognized a mental state with the mind be not entranced by the general appearance be not entranced by the detailFor if you dwell with the organ of mind uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind might flow inSo fare along with its control guard the organ of mind achieve control over the organ of the mindAnd when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be moderate in eating you should take food reflecting carefully not for fun or indulgence or personal charm or beautification but taking just enough for maintaining this body and keeping it going for keeping it unharmed for furthering the Brahmafaring with the thought Thus will I crush out an old feeling and I will not allow a new feeling to arise and then there will be for me subsistence and blamelessness and abiding in comfortWhen Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is moderate in eating the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk abide intent on vigilance during the day while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states during the middle watch of the night lie down on the right side in the lion posture foot resting on foot mindful clearly conscious reflecting on the thought of getting up again during the last watch of the night when you have arisen while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental statesAnd when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is intent on vigilance then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness acting with clear consciousness whether you are approaching or departing acting with clear consciousness whether you are looking ahead or looking round acting with clear consciousness whether you are bending in or stretching out acting with clear consciousness whether you are carrying the outer cloak the bowl or robe acting with clear consciousness whether you are eating drinking munching savoring acting with clear consciousness whether you are obeying the calls of nature acting with clear consciousness whether you are walking standing sitting asleep awake talking or being silentAnd when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk choose a remote lodging in a forest at the root of a tree on a mountain slope in a wilderness in a hillcave a cemetery a forest haunt in the open or on a heap of straw He chooses a remote lodging in the forest or on a heap of strawReturning from almsgathering after the meal he sits down crosslegged holding the back erect having made mindfulness rise up in front of him he by getting rid of coveting for the world dwells with a mind devoid of coveting he purifies the mind of covetingBy getting rid of the taint of illwill he dwells benevolent in mind compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings he purifies the mind of the taint of illwillBy getting rid of sloth and torpor he dwells devoid of sloth and torpor perceiving the light mindful clearly conscious he purifies the mind of sloth and torporBy getting rid of restlessness and worry he dwells calmly the mind subjectively tranquilized he purifies the mind of restlessness and worryBy getting rid of doubt he dwells doubtcrossed unperplexed as to the states that are skillful he purifies the mind of doubtHe by getting rid of these five hindrances which are defilements of the mind and weakening to intuitive wisdom dwells contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly conscious mindful so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the worldHe fares along contemplating the feelings the mind the mental states in mental states ardent clearly conscious mindful so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the worldAs Aggivessana an elephant tamer driving a great post into the ground ties a forest elephant to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways so as to subdue his forest aspirations and so as to subdue his distress his fretting and fever for the forest so as to make him pleased with villages and accustom him to human ways  even so Aggivessana these four applications of mindfulness are ties of the mind so as to subdue the ways of householders and to subdue the aspirations of householders and to subdue the distress the fretting and fever of householders they are for leading to the right path for realizing nibbanaThe Tathagata then disciplines him further saying Come you monk fare along contemplating the body in the body but do not apply yourself to a train of thought connected with the body fare along contemplating the feelings in the feelings the mind in the mind mental states in mental states but do not apply yourself to a train of thought connected with mental statesHe by allaying initial thought and discursive thought with the mind subjectively tranquilized and fixed on one point enters on and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial and discursive thought is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyfulBy the fading out of rapture he dwells with equanimity attentive and clearly conscious and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful and he enters and abides in the third meditationBy getting rid of joy by getting rid of anguish by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows he enters and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulnessThen with the mind composed thus quite purified quite clarified without blemish without defilement grown pliant and workable fixed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge and recollection of former habitation he remembers a variety of former habitations thus one birth two births three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand births and many an eon of integration and many an eon of disintegration and many an eon of integrationdisintegration Such a one was I by name having such a clan such and such a color so was I nourished such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine so did the span of life endPassing from this I came to be in another state where such a one was I by name having such and such a clan such and such a color so was I nourished such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine so did the span of life endPassing from this I arose here Thus he remembers divers former habitations in all their modes and detailsThen with the mind composed quite purified quite clarified without blemish without defilement grown pliant and workable fixed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge of the passing hence and the arising of beingsWith the purified devavision surpassing that of men he sees beings as they pass hence or come to be he comprehends that beings are mean excellent comely ugly wellgoing illgoing according to the consequence of their deeds the he thinks Indeed these worthy beings who were possessed of wrong conduct in body who were possessed of wrong conduct in speech who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought scoffers at the ariyans holding a wrong view incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these at the breaking up of the body after dying have arisen in a sorrowful state a bad bourn the abyss Niraya hellBut these worthy beings who were possessed of good conduct in body who were possessed of good conduct in speech who were possessed of good conduct in thought who did not scoff at the ariyans holding a right view incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these at the breaking up of the body after dying have arisen in a good bourn a heaven worldThen with the mind composed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankersHe understands as it really is This is anguish this is the arising of anguish this is the stopping of anguish this is the course leading to the stopping of anguishHe understands as it really is These are the cankers this is the arising of the cankers this is the stopping of the cankers this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankersKnowing thus seeing thus his mind is freed from the canker of sense pleasures is freed from the canker of becoming freed from the canker of ignoranceIn freedom the knowledge came to be I am freed and he comprehends Destroyed is birth brought to a close is the Brahmafaring done is what was to be done there is no more of being such or suchThat monk is able to endure heat cold hunger thirst the touch of mosquitoes gadflies wind sun and creeping things abusive language and unwelcome modes of speech he has grown to bear bodily feelings which as they arise are painful acute sharp severe wretched miserable deadlyPurged of all the dross and impurities of attachment aversion and confusion he is worthy of oblations offerings respect and homage an unsurpassed field of merit in the worldIf Aggivessana a kings elephant dies in old age untamed untrained the kings old elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamed And so Aggivessana of a kings elephant

lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the community of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life This sutta gives many valuable lessons on practical issues surrounding the attempt to develop an internal meditative dwelling of emptiness to maintain it and to see it through to AwakeningSome of these issues include the need for seclusion as a conducive setting for the practice types of conversation and thinking that are beneficial and harmful for the practice the dangers of being distracted by visitors and the proper attitude to have toward ones teacherHowever for an explanation of emptiness in and of itself its necessary to look elsewhere in the CanonThere you find emptiness approached from three perspectives treating it as a meditative dwelling as an attribute of objects and as a type of awarenessreleaseThe first approach is obviously the most immediately relevant to the discussion in this sutta but in fact all three approaches play a role hereEmptiness as a meditative dwelling is most fully discussed in MNEssentially it boils down to the ability to center the mind in a particular mode of perception to maintain it there and then to notice the absence and presence of disturbance within that modeThe process starts with perceptions of ones external surroundings  village wilderness the earth property  and then moves internally to the four formless states the themeless concentration of awareness and finally to release from all mental fermentationEach step is compared to the one preceding it to see how its more refined perception engenders less disturbanceFor instance if you move from a perception of the wilderness to a perception of earth the first step is to settle and indulge in that perceptionThen you notice what types of disturbance have been abandoned in the move from the perception of wilderness to the perception of earth  for example all thought of the dangers of wilderness are gone  and then to see what disturbances remain based on the latter perceptionThen you abandon the perception causing those disturbances and move on to a more refined level of perceptionThis process is pursued until it arrives at the themeless concentration of awareness When noting that even this refined level of concentration is fabricated inconstant and subject to cessation one gains total release from all mental fermentations and the disturbances that would arise based on themThis is the level of emptiness that is superior and unsurpassed and is apparently what the Buddha is referring to in this sutta when he says that by not attending to any themes he enters  remains in internal emptinessNotice that in every step along the way of this process the emptiness is the lack of disturbance experienced in a particular mind stateThis means that the mind state is to be perceived simply as an example of the presence and absence of stressIn other words emptiness in this sense relates directly to the second of the three characteristics  stress or sufferingThe pursuit of this emptiness relates to the four noble truths as it looks for the causes of stress and uses tranquility together with insight to abandon those causes in a quest to put a total end to sufferingEmptiness in its second meaning as an attribute of objects is most fully discussed in SNThat sutta describes emptiness as meaning the lack of self or anything pertaining to a self in the internal and external sense mediaWhatever sense of self that may surround these objects is not inherent in them and is instead simply the result of ones own penchant for Imaking and mymaking Seeing the artificiality of Imaking and mymaking in this way helps lead to a sense of disenchantment with these makings thus helping to abandon any clinging associated with themThus emptiness in this sense relates directly to the third of the three characteristics notselfHowever just as the three characteristics are not radically separate from one another  everything stressful is for that reason notself  the practical application of this sense of emptiness is not radically different from the firstAs SNpoints out when one no longer latches onto any idea of my self one sees phenomena within and without simply as examples of stress arising and passing awayTo practice meditation from this perspective  seeing each state of concentration as an example of stress arising and passing away  is to develop emptiness as a meditative dwellingEmptiness in its third meaning as a type of awarenessrelease is an application of emptiness in its secondMN describes this state of concentration as follows There is the case where a monk  having gone into the wilderness to the root of a tree or into an empty dwelling  considers this This is empty of self or of anything pertaining to self It adds that this awarenessrelease is different from the awarenessrelease that results when one doesnt attend to any themesThus this state of concentration cannot be entirely equated with the emptiness as a meditative dwelling mentioned in this suttaMN further adds that if one frequently abides in the emptiness awarenessrelease one may either attain the dimension of nothingness  one of the formless states  or be committed to the discernment that will lead to AwakeningThe first of these two alternatives is another way in which emptiness as an awarenessrelease differs from emptiness as a meditative dwelling as defined in MNHowever because the standard definition of discernment is seeing phenomena in terms of the four noble truths the second alternative  being committed to discernment  would apparently follow the same pattern suggested by SN aboveIn other words as one no longer perceives phenomena in terms of self one tends to view them simply as examples of stress arising and passing awaySo again this third meaning of emptiness like the second eventually leads in practice back to the firstAs MN notes when one attains full awakening the themeless awarenessrelease and the emptiness awarenessrelease come to differ only in name and not in actualityIn reading the following sutta you will notice that the various meanings of emptiness will fit some contexts better than othersStill it is important to remember that in the course of practice all three meanings are related and all will inevitably play a role in AwakeningI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan ParkThen in the early morning the Blessed One having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went into Kapilavatthu for almsHaving gone for alms in Kapilavatthu after the meal returning from his alms round he went to the dwelling of Kalakhemaka the Sakyan for the days abidingNow at that time many resting places had been prepared in Kalakhemaka the Sakyans dwellingThe Blessed One saw the many resting places prepared there and on seeing them the thought occurred to him There are many resting places prepared hereDo many monks live hereNow at that time VenAnanda together with many other monks was making robes at the dwelling of Ghata the SakyanThen when it was evening the Blessed One rose from seclusion and went to the dwelling of Ghata the SakyanOn arrival he sat down on a seat made readyHaving sat down he asked VenAnanda There are many resting places prepared in Kalakhemaka the Sakyans dwellingDo many monks live thereYes lord there are many resting places prepared in Kalakhemaka the Sakyans dwellingMany monks live thereOur time for making robes has come aroundAnanda a monk does not shine if he delights in company enjoys company is committed to delighting in company if he delights in a group enjoys a group rejoices in a groupIndeed Ananda it is impossible that a monk who delights in company enjoys company is committed to delighting in company who delights in a group enjoys a group rejoices in a group will obtain at will  without difficulty without trouble  the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of selfawakeningBut it is possible that a monk who lives alone withdrawn from the group can expect to obtain at will  without difficulty without trouble  the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of selfawakeningIndeed Ananda it is impossible that a monk who delights in company enjoys company is committed to delighting in company who delights in a group enjoys a group rejoices in a group will enter  remain in the awarenessrelease that is temporary and pleasing or in the awarenessrelease that is nottemporary and beyond provocationBut it is possible that a monk who lives alone withdrawn from the group can expect to enter  remain in the awarenessrelease that is temporary and pleasing or in the awarenessrelease that is nottemporary and beyond provocationAnanda I do not envision even a single form whose change  alteration would not give rise to sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair in one who is passionate for it and takes delight in itBut there is this dwelling discovered by the Tathagata where not attending to any themes he enters  remains in internal emptinessIf while he is dwelling there by means of this dwelling he is visited by monks nuns lay men lay women kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples then  with his mind bent on seclusion tending toward seclusion inclined toward seclusion aiming at seclusion relishing renunciation having destroyed those qualities that are the basis for mental fermentation  he converses with them only as much as is necessary for them to take their leaveSo Ananda if a monk should wish May I enter  remain in internal emptiness then he should get the mind steadied right within settled unified  concentratedAnd how does the monk get the mind steadied right within settled unified  concentratedThere is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainThat is how a monk gets the mind steadied right within settled unified  concentratedHe attends to internal emptinessWhile he is attending to internal emptiness his mind does not take pleasure find satisfaction grow steady or indulge in internal emptinessWhen this is the case he discerns While I am attending to internal emptiness my mind does not take pleasure find satisfaction grow steady or indulge in internal emptiness In this way he is alert thereHe attends to external emptinessHe attends to internal  external emptiness He attends to the imperturbableWhile he is attending to the imperturbable his mind does not take pleasure find satisfaction grow steady or indulge in the imperturbableWhen this is the case he discerns While I am attending to the imperturbable my mind does not take pleasure find satisfaction grow steady or indulge in the imperturbable In this way he is alert thereWhen that is the case he should get the mind steadied right within settled unified  concentrated in his first theme of concentrationHe then attends to internal emptinessWhile he is attending to internal emptiness his mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction grows steady  indulges in internal emptinessWhen this is the case he discerns While I am attending to internal emptiness my mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction grows steady  indulges in internal emptiness In this way he is alert thereHe attends to external emptinessHe attends to internal  external emptiness He attends to the imperturbableWhile he is attending to the imperturbable his mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction grows steady  indulges in the imperturbableWhen this is the case he discerns While I am attending to the imperturbable my mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction grows steady  indulges in the imperturbable In this way he is alert thereIf while the monk is dwelling by means of this dwelling his mind inclines to walking back  forth he walks back  forth While I am walking thus no covetousness or sadness no evil unskillful qualities will take possession of me In this way he is alert thereIf while he is dwelling by means of this dwelling his mind inclines to standing to sitting to lying down he lies down While I am lying down thus no covetousness or sadness no evil unskillful qualities will take possession of me In this way he is alert thereIf while he is dwelling by means of this dwelling his mind inclines to speaking he resolves that I will not engage in talk that is base vulgar common ignoble unbeneficial that does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calm direct knowledge selfawakening or Unbinding  ie talk about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or not In this way he is alert thereBut I will engage in talk that is scrupulous conducive to release of awareness and leads exclusively to disenchantment dispassion cessation calm direct knowledge selfawakening  Unbinding  ie talk on modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of release In this way he is alert thereIf while he is dwelling by means of this dwelling his mind inclines to thinking he resolves that I will not think thoughts that are base vulgar common ignoble unbeneficial that do not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calm direct knowledge selfawakening or Unbinding  ie thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will thoughts of harmfulness In this way he is alert thereBut I will think thoughts that are noble onwardleading that lead to the right ending of stress for the person who acts on them  ie thoughts of renunciation thoughts of no ill will thoughts of harmlessness In this way he is alert thereAnanda there are these five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingSounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingThese are the five strings of sensuality where a monk should reflect on his mind repeatedly Is there within me in any circumstance or another any engagement of awareness that arises with regard to these five strings of sensuality If on reflection the monk discerns There is within me in one circumstance or another an engagement of awareness that arises with regard to these five strings of sensuality then  this being the case  he discerns that Desirepassion for the five strings of sensuality has not been abandoned by me But if on reflection he discerns There is not within me in any circumstance or another any engagement of awareness that arises with regard to these five strings of sensuality then  this being the case  he discerns that Desirepassion for the five strings of sensuality has been abandoned by me In this way he is alert thereThere are these five clingingaggregates where a monk should stay keeping track of arising  passing away Such is form such its origination such its disappearanceSuch is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance As he stays keeping track of arising  passing away with regard to these five clingingaggregates he abandons any conceit that I am with regard to these five clingingaggregatesThis being the case he discerns I have abandoned any conceit that I am with regard to these five clingingaggregates In this way he is alert thereThese qualities Ananda are exclusively skillful in their grounding noble transcendent inaccessible to the Evil OneWhat do you think Ananda When envisioning what aim is it proper for a disciple to follow after the Teacher even when being rebukedFor us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitratorIt would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember itAnanda its not proper for a disciple to follow after the Teacher to hear discourses verses or catechismsWhy is thatFor a long time Ananda have you listened to the teachings retained them discussed them accumulated them examined them with your mind and penetrated them well in terms of your viewsBut as for talk that is scrupulous conducive to release of awareness and leads exclusively to disenchantment dispassion cessation calm direct knowledge selfawakening  Unbinding  ie talk on modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of release Its for the sake of hearing talk of this sort that it is proper for a disciple to follow after the Teacher as if yoked to himThis being the case there is the teachers undoing there is the students undoing there is the undoing of one who leads the holy lifeAnd how is there the teachers undoingThere is the case where a certain teacher resorts to a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of strawWhile he is living thus secluded brahmans  householders from town  countryside visit himWhen they visit him he gets smitten with things that infatuate falls into greed and reverts to luxuryThis is called a teacher undone with a teachers undoingHe has been struck down by evil unskillful qualities that defile that lead to further becoming are troublesome ripen in pain and lead to future birth aging  deathSuch is the teachers undoingAnd how is there the students undoingA student of that teacher imitating his teachers seclusion resorts to a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a heap of strawWhile he is living thus secluded brahmans  householders from town  countryside visit himWhen they visit him he gets smitten with things that infatuate falls into greed and reverts to luxuryThis is called a student undone with a students undoingHe has been struck down by evil unskillful qualities that defile that lead to further becoming are troublesome ripen in pain and lead to future birth aging  deathSuch is the students undoingAnd how is there the undoing of one who leads the holy lifeThere is the case where a Tathagata arises in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessedHe resorts to a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of strawWhile he is living thus secluded brahmans  householders from town  countryside visit himWhen they visit him he doesnt get smitten with things that infatuate doesnt fall into greed doesnt revert to luxuryA student of that teacher imitating his teachers seclusion resorts to a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a heap of strawWhile he is living thus secluded brahmans  householders from town  countryside visit himWhen they visit him he gets smitten with things that infatuate falls into greed and reverts to luxuryThis is called one following the holy life who is undone with the undoing of one who leads the holy lifeHe has been struck down by evil unskillful qualities that defile that lead to further becoming are troublesome ripen in pain and lead to future birth aging  deathSuch is the undoing of one who leads the holy lifeAnd in this regard Ananda the undoing of one who leads the holy life ripens in more pain more bitterness than the teachers undoing or the students undoingIt leads even to the states of deprivationTherefore Ananda engage with me in friendliness and not in oppositionThat will be for your longterm wellbeing  happinessAnd how do students engage with the teacher in opposition and not in friendlinessThere is the case where a teacher teaches the Dhamma to his students sympathetically seeking their wellbeing out of sympathy This is for your wellbeing this is for your happiness His disciples do not listen or lend ear or apply their minds to gnosisTurning aside they stray from the Teachers messageThis is how students engage with the teacher as opponents and not as friendsAnd how do students engage with the teacher in friendliness and not in oppositionThere is the case where a teacher teaches the Dhamma to his students sympathetically seeking their wellbeing out of sympathy This is for your wellbeing this is for your happiness His disciples listen lend ear  apply their minds to gnosisNot turning aside they dont stray from the Teachers messageThis is how students engage with the teacher as friends and not as opponentsTherefore Ananda engage with me in friendliness and not in oppositionThat will be for your longterm wellbeing  happinessI wont hover over you like a potter over damp unbaked clay goodsScolding again  again I will speakUrging you on again  again I will speakWhatever is of essential worth will remainThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenAnanda delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThere are these four types of

leading to the cessation of stress This is the type of person who neither thunders nor rainsThis type of person I tell you is like the thunderhead that neither thunders nor rainsAnd how is one the type of person who both thunders and rainsThere is the case where a person has mastered the Dhamma dialogues question  answer sessionsHe discerns as it actually is present that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is the type of person who both thunders and rainsThis type of person I tell you is like the thunderhead that both thunders and rainsThere are these four types of people to be found existing in the worldI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow at that time a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round had gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose Isnt it amazing friendsIsnt it astounding the extent to which mindfulness immersed in the body when developed  pursued is said by the Blessed One who knows who sees  the worthy one rightly selfawakened  to be of great fruit  great benefit And this discussion came to no conclusionThen the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the meeting hall and on arrival sat down on a seat made readyAs he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what topic are you gathered together hereAnd what was the discussion that came to no conclusionJust now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose Isnt it amazing friendsIsnt it astounding the extent to which mindfulness immersed in the body when developed  pursued is said by the Blessed One who knows who sees  the worthy one rightly selfawakened  to be of great fruit  great benefit This was the discussion that had come to no conclusion when the Blessed One arrivedAnd how is mindfulness immersed in the body developed how is it pursued so as to be of great fruit  great benefitThere is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outBreathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore when walking the monk discerns I am walking When standing he discerns I am standing When sitting he discerns I am sitting When lying down he discerns I am lying down Or however his body is disposed that is how he discerns itAnd as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore when going forward  returning he makes himself fully alert when looking toward  looking away when bending  extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe  his bowl when eating drinking chewing  savoring when urinating  defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking  remaining silent he makes himself fully alertAnd as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore the monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine Just as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain  wheat rice mung beans kidney beans sesame seeds husked rice  and a man with good eyesight pouring it out were to reflect This is wheatThis is riceThese are mung beansThese are kidney beansThese are sesame seedsThis is husked rice in the same way the monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore the monk contemplates this very body  however it stands however it is disposed  in terms of properties In this body there is the earth property the liquid property the fire property  the wind property Just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice having killed a cow would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces the monk contemplates this very body  however it stands however it is disposed  in terms of properties In this body there is the earth property the liquid property the fire property  the wind property And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground  one day two days three days dead  bloated livid  festering he applies it to this very body This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fateOr again as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures  hawks by dogs hyenas  various other creatures a skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions  here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a breast bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder He applies it to this very body This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fateAnd as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born from withdrawalJust as if a skilled bathman or bathmans apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of withdrawalThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from withdrawalAnd as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyAnd furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceHe permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composureJust like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time  again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of composureAnd as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyAnd furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureAnd as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyAnd furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessAnd as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyMonks whoever develops  pursues mindfulness immersed in the

turns out not as intendedWhat is the reason what is the cause why the same sort of trade when engaged in by other people turns out as intendedWhat is the reason what is the cause why the same sort of trade when engaged in by other people turns out better than intendedThere is the case Sariputta where a certain person having gone to a brahman or contemplative makes him an offer Tell me sir what you need in terms of the requisites But he doesnt give what he offeredIf he passes away from there and comes here then whatever trade he engages in it turns out a failureThen there is the case where a

qualities can be known as a person of integrityThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monasteryAt that time at Savatthi a certain monk had died bitten by a snakeThereupon many monks approached the Buddha and having saluted him sat beside himSo seated those monks spoke thus to the Blessed OneBhante a certain monk at Savatthi had died bitten by a snakeAssuredly monks said the BuddhaThat monk has not suffused with thoughts of lovingkindness the four royal tribes of snakesHad he done so that monk would not have died of snakebiteWhat are the four royal tribes of snakesThe royal tribe of snakes called Virupakkha Erapatha Chabyaputta and KanhagotamakaMonks that monk did not suffuse with thoughts of lovingkindness these four royal

Buddhas Translators note This is one of the few protective charms mentioned in the Pali canon and specifically allowed by the Buddha for monks to useNote that the power of the charm is said to come not from the words but from the mind of good will with which they are saidIt thus differs from charms taught in later forms of Buddhism where the words themselves are said to contain powerOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow at that time in Savatthi a certain monk had died after having been bitten by a snakeThen a large number of
