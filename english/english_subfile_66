said to be foremostAt the time of the Buddha Padumuttara it seemsshe was reborn in a good family home in Hasavatīand when she was mature while listening to the Teacher talk about Dhammaseeing the Teacher place a certain nun as being foremost amongst those who have the divine eyeshe did a great deed and aspired for that position herselfIn this auspicious aeon a very famous brāhmaṇaarose in the noble and wellknown Kassapa clanI was a female wanderer at that time solitaryand after wandering for alms I received a little oilHaving lighted a lamp with that oil I attended all nightwith a confident mind at the Foremost Humans shrineThrough performing that good deed with excellent intentionsafter throwing off the human body I went to the Realm of the Thirty ThreeOn account of that deed I shone forth in whatever place I waslike a great light blazing wherever I wentBeyond the walls beyond the rocks rising above the mountainwhatever I wanted to see I saw as the result of that gift of lightI had a purified eye I shone forth with fameI was endowed with faith and wisdom as the result of that gift of lightShe was reborn amongst gods and humans only for one hundred thousand aeonsand when this Gotama Buddha arose she was reborn in a good family home in Sāvatthīand later while listening to the Teacher teach the Dhammashe gained faith and went forth and in no long time she attained LiberationFrom then on she became wellpracticed in the divine eyeLater while the Teacher was sitting in Jetas Woodas he was assigning the places of the nuns in orderhe placed this Elder Nun in the foremost position amongst those who had the divine eyeTranslationIn the third story about Uppalavaṇṇāas she was endowed with a colour similar to a blue lilys heartAt the time of the Buddha Padumuttara it seemsshe was conceived in a good family home in Hasavatīand later after going with the populace into the presence of the Teacher while listening to the Dhammaseeing the Teacher place a certain nun as being foremost in spiritual powersand giving a great donation to the Community of monastics with the Buddha at their head for seven daysshe aspired for that position herselfShe did good deeds for the rest of her life and being reborn amongst gods and humans onlyin the city of Bārāṇasī at the time of the Buddha Kassapashe was conceived in the home of Kiki the King of Kāsiand became one amongst seven sisterslived as a celibate for twentythousand yearshad a residence made for the Community of monks and was reborn in the world of the godsPassing away from thereshe was reborn in a certain little village and made a living in that place by doingOne day while going to the hut in the fieldon the highway near a lake in the morning timeshe saw a blossoming lotus flower and descended into the lakeand took that flower in a lotus leaf used to wrap puffed ricecut the tips of rice in the field and while sitting in the field she roasted the riceand counted fivehundred pieces of puffed riceAt that time having arisen from the attainment of cessation on Mount Gandhamādanaa certain Independent Buddha came and stood not far away from herHaving seen the Independent Buddhashe took a lotus flower together with the puffed rice descended from her hutplaced the puffed rice in the Independent Buddhas bowland covered the bowl over with the lotus flowerWhen the Independent Buddha had departed a short way she thoughtOne who has gone forth surely has no use for a flowerI will take the flower and adorn myselfShe went to the Independent Buddha and took the flower from his hand but thought againIf this Noble One had no use for a flowerhe wouldnt have allowed me to place it on the top of the bowlindeed there will be a use for the Noble One and she went back againplaced it back on the top of the bowl and begged the Independent Buddha for forgivenesssaying Reverend Sir may the result of my puffed rice be as many sons as there were pieces of riceand the result of giving the lotus flower be that wherever I am rebornlotus flowers arise under my feet She made this aspirationAs she was watching him that Independent Buddhawent through the air to Mount Gandhamādana and washing his feet near to the Independent Buddhas rope ladderhe placed the lotus on Mount NandamūlakaAs a result of that deed she gained conception in the world of the godsand from the time of her rebirth great lotus flowers appeared under her feetShe passed away from there and was reborn on a lotus heart in one lotus lake at the foot of a mountainA certain ascetic lived near there and in the morning timehe went to the lake in order to wash his face saw the flower and thoughtThis flowers head is the largest of all the heads of flowersthrough what reason did the bud come to be hereAfter descending into the water he took the flowerAs soon as he had taken it it floweredand the ascetic saw a young girl lying in the heart of the lotusFrom the time of first seeing her paternal loveand he carried her with the lotus to his leafhut and lay her down on his couchThrough the power of her merit milk sprung from his thumbWhen that flower had faded he brought a new flower and lay her in thatThen from the time she began to play by running around here and thereat every step there arose a lotus flowerand the colour of her body was like rays of saffronWithout having attained the radiance of a god she nevertheless surpassed the radiance of a humanWhen her Father had gone to gather various kinds of fruit she remained behind in the leafhutThen one day when she had reached maturityher Father having gone to gather various kinds of fruit a certain forester saw her and thoughtAmongst mankind there is none as beautiful as this I will enquire about herand he sat down looking for the coming of the asceticAs her Father was coming she went out to meet himtook the carrying pole and water pot from his handand after he had come while sitting she showed him the duties she had doneThen the forester understood she was humanworshipped the ascetic and sat downThe ascetic invited the forester with forest roots and various kinds of fruits and waterand asked Good sir Will you stay in this place or will you goI will go reverend Sir what will I do hereAfter going from here will you be able to keep quietIf the Noble One does not wish it for what reason will I speakAnd after worshipping the ascetic so as to recognise the path again when he returnedhe went away making marks on the branches and on the treesAfter going to Bārāṇasī he saw the King and the King asked Why have you comeGodKing your foresterhaving seen a wonderful treasure of a woman at the foot of a mountain has returnedand he told him all that had happenedThe King heard his report and quickly went to the foot of the mountainset up camp not far from that placetogether with the forester and the other menand after the ascetic had finished his meal dutiesat a time when he was sitting he went and worshipped him therewas received in a friendly manner and sat down on one sideThe King after placing the requisite goods for one gone forth at the feet of the asceticsaid Reverend Sir what will we do in this place shall we goPlease go Great KingYes I will go reverend Sirbut we have heard The Noble One has the company of the opposite sex nearbyand this is unsuitable for those gone forth please let her go with me reverend SirPeoples minds are surely hard to pleasehow will she live in the midst of so many peopleBeginning from any time we pleaseI will place her in a position senior to the rest and look after her reverend SirHaving heard the Kings speech because of the name she had taken in her youthhe called his daughter saying Dear PadumavatīShe emerged from the leaf hut at that single word worshipped her Father and stood thereThen her Father said Dear you have reached maturity in this placebut from the time you were seen by the King it has been inappropriate to live hereyou should go with the King DearShe replied to this word of her Father saying Very well Fatherworshipped him and stood there cryingThe King thinking I will win over her Fathers heartplaced a heap of money in that place and anointed herThen after taking her and leading her to the cityfrom the time they returned without even looking at the rest of the women he took delight with her aloneThose women being jealous by natureand desiring to break her close connection with the King said thisThis is not one born of humans Great King Where in the past did you see amongst humansthat lotuses would arise in the place they were walkingSurely this is a demoness you must drive her away Great KingThe King listened to their speech but was silentThen at another time there was a border disturbanceThinking Padumavatī is advanced in pregnancyhe left her in the city and went to the border areaThen those women having given a bribe to her nursesaid Remove her child as soon as it is bornand having smeared a log of wood with blood place it near herNot long after Padumavatī was delivered of her childThe prince Mahāpaduma alone dwelt in her wombanother fourhundred and ninetynine sonsafter the boy Mahāpaduma exited his Mothers womb and was laying therewere reborn from moistureThen understanding I must act before she recovers her mindfulnessthe nurse smeared a log of wood with bloodplaced it near her and signalled to those womenThose five hundred women each took a childemployed nearby weavershad them bring baskets and each took her own childlay him down there made a seal on the outside and placed them asideWhen Padumavatī had recovered her sensesshe asked her nurse What have I delivered LadyMenacing her she said Where will your son be foundSaying This is the child that exited from your wombshe placed the bloodsmeared log of wood in front of herSeeing that she became depressedand said Having chopped it up quickly remove it if someone should see it it would be a cause of shameShe listened to her speech as though wishing her wellchopped it up and threw it on the fireplaceReturning from the border areas the King waited outside the city for the auspicious timemade camp and sat downThen the fivehundred women went out to meet the King as he was coming and saidYou do not have faith in us Great King as though we speak without reasonAfter calling your Consorts nurseask whether your Queen delivered a log of woodThe King without properly investigating the reasonthinking She must be a nonhuman being drove her from the houseWith her departure from the Palace all the lotus flowersand her skin lost its radianceShe went by herself along the middle of the streetThen a certain old and aged woman saw her and maternaland she said Where are you going LadyI am a stranger roaming around looking for somewhere to liveShe said Come here Ladyand she gave her a place to live and served her foodAs she was residing like this in that placethose fivehundred women having one thought said to the KingGreat King when you had gone to the campwe said to the goddess of the Ganges When our GodKing returns victorious from battlewe will make an oblation and hold water sportsThis was our aspiration and this matter GodKing we now make knownThe King being satisfied with their statement went to the Ganges to sport in the waterAll of them took their basketscovered them over went to the streamwrapped up the baskets in order to disguise themdropped them in the water and sent the baskets offAll those baskets went off together and got caught in nets that had been fastened under the streamThen after playing at water sports at the time the King was emergingseeing the baskets suspended in the net they were brought to the KingThe King seeing the baskets said What is in the baskets DearsWe do not know GodKingThe baskets were opened while he was watchingand they first opened the boy Mahāpadumas basketFor all of them as they were laying in the baskets during the daymilk had sprung from their thumbs through the power of their meritSakka the King of the Gods in order to dispel the Kings doubtshad had these wordsThese boys were reborn in Padumavatīs womb and are the King of Bārāṇasīs sonsthen the fivehundred women who are Padumavatīs rivalsplaced them in baskets and threw them in the waterLet the King understand the reasonAs soon as the baskets were opened the King had the wordsand seeing his sons he raised up the boy Mahāpaduma and saidQuickly prepare the chariot harness the horses I will enter the city todayand endear some of those womenHe ascended the palace placed a bag with a thousand coins on an elephants neckand had the drum beat announcing He who finds Padumavatī can take this thousand coinsHearing that announcement Padumavatī informed her adopted Mothersaying Take the thousand coins from the elephants neck LadyI do not dare to take such a thingHaving said it a second and a third timeshe said After saying what Lady shall I take it My daughter has found Queen Padumavatī after saying that take itShe thinking What will be will be went and took the box with a thousand coinsThen the men questioned her Did you find Queen Padumavatī LadyShe said I did not find her but it seems my daughter found herThey said But where is she Ladyand going with her and recognising Padumavatī they fell at her feetAt that time understanding This is Queen Padumavatīshe said Indeed a really serious thing was done to the womanshe being a Consort to such a King and she dwelt in such a place without protectionThe Kings men set up white curtains around Padumavatīs residenceplaced a guard at the door and went and informed the KingThe King send a golden palanquinShe said I will not go in this wayFrom my dwelling place all along the way until the Palacespread noble and beautiful carpets made of clothhave canopies set up adorned with golden stars aboveand when all ornaments are sent for my adornment I will go by footThus the cityfolk will see my good fortuneThe King said Do it according to Padumavatīs pleasureThen Padumavatī was adorned with all ornamentsand saying I will go to the Palace proceeded along the pathThen at each place she steppedafter breaking through the noble and beautiful carpets made of cloth lotus flowers aroseAfter she had shown off to the populace her good fortune she ascended the Palaceand by way of giving an allowance to the old lady for her expenses had all those beautiful carpets given to herThe King had the fivehundred women summonedand said After making these slaves I give them to the QueenVery good Great King please make known to the whole city your gift to me of these womenThe King had the drum beat in the city announcingAfter making these fivehundred treacherous women slaves I have given them to PadumavatīUnderstanding Their slavery has been seen by the whole cityshe made a request of the King saying I desire to give freedom to my slaves GodKingAs you wish QueenThis being so he summoned the drummer and said  After these women were made slaves to Padumavatīshe has given freedom to all fivehundred of thembeat the drum and announce thisWhen they were given their freedomshe gave the fourhundred and ninetynine sons into their hands for bringing upand took the boy Mahāpaduma herselfThen later when those boys had reached playing agethe King had various types of playgrounds made in the gardenWhen they were sixteen years of age they all came togetherand while playing in the royal bathing pool covered with lotuses in the gardenhaving seen new lotuses blossoming and old lotuses falling from their stalksthey thought When even a thing such as this which is not produced by previous deedshow much more then will our bodies be subject to the same destinyGrasping this meditation object they all produced the knowledge characterising the Independent Awakeningand after rising from there sat down crosslegged in the heart of the lotusesThen the Kings men who had come with them understanding that most of the day had passedsaid Noble Children do you know the timeThey remained silentThose men went to the King and informed him The princes GodKing are sitting in the hearts of the lotusesand when we speak they make no replyAllow them to sit as they wishThe whole night a guard was setand they sat in this way in the hearts of the lotuses until dawn aroseThe men approached on the following day and said Princes do you know the timeWe are not Princes we are now Independent BuddhasNoble Sirs you are saying something very graveIndependent Buddhas are surely not like you arethey have hair and beard only up to two inches long and on their bodies are fastened the eight requisitesThey stroked their heads with their right hands and at that moment the signs of home life vanishedand the eight requisites appeared on their bodiesAs the populace was watching they went through the air to Mount NandamūlakaQueen Padumavatī thought After having so many children I have become childlessHer heart having been overcome by grief she died from this illnessand in a small village near the gate of the city of Rājagahashe was reborn and made a living in that place by doing manual labourLater she went to a good family homeand while carrying riceporridge one day to her husbands fieldin the midst of her childrenshe saw eight Independent Buddhas going through the air at the time they went for almsand going quickly she informed her husbandsaying Look Noble Sir let us invite these Independent Buddhas and feed themHe said These are birds who look like ascetics who are flying somewherethey are not Independent BuddhasAs they were talking they descended to a spot not far awayThat woman on that day gave her own rice and other solid food to them herselfand said Tomorrow eight people can take my alms foodWell said lay woman such is your hospitality let there be just eight seats thenbut seeing a great many Independent Buddhas your heart would be upliftedOn the following day she prepared eight seatsarranged them with great respect for the eight of them and sat downThe Independent Buddhas who were invited informed the restsaying Sirs without going anywhere else todayall of you show your regard for your MotherHearing their words they all came through the air togetherand appeared at the gate of their Mothers houseshe ushered them all into the house and made them sit down on the seatsAs they were sitting down in ordera further eight seats appeared through supernatural power and the ninth sat himself down on the nearest seatAs the seats increased so did the house increase in sizeWhen they were all thus seated the woman respectfully offered what was prepared for the eight Independent Buddhasto the five hundredand bringing eight handfuls of blue lilies in her handshe placed them at the feet of the Independent Buddhas she had invited and saidReverend Sirs in whatever place I am rebornmay the colour of my body be like the colour of the inside of this blue lilys heartShe made this aspirationThe Independent Buddhas rejoiced with their Mother and returned to GandhamādanaShe did good deeds for the rest of her life and after passing away from there and being reborn in the world of the godswhen this Gotama Buddha arose she was conceived in a merchants family in Sāvatthīand as she was the same colour as the heart of a blue lily she was given the name UppalavaṇṇāWhen she had reached maturityall the Kings in the RoseApple IslePlease give us your daughterThere were none known to be not sending this messageThen the merchant thoughtI will not be able to satisfyand after summoning his daughter he said Will you be able to go forth DaughterBecause of being in her last rebirth that word was like medicated oil sprinkled on her headtherefore she said to her Father Father I will go forthHe paid respects to her led her to the nunnery and had her go forthNot long after she had gone forthShe lit the lamp swept the observance halland grasping the sign of the crest of the lampwhile looking at it again and againand producing absorption on the fire meditation subjectand making that a basis she attained LiberationTogether with the fruit of Liberation she also mastered the spiritual power of transformationLater on the day the Teacher performed the double miracleshe roared a lions roar saying I will perform a miracle reverend SirBeing asked What miracle will you performshe said Reverend Sir after showing myself before an assembly for twelve leagues on all sidessurrounded by an assembly that is thirtysix leagues from front to backafter taking the form of a Universal Monarch and approaching I will worship youThe Teacher said I know your powerFor this reason the Teacher as the occasion had arisenwhile sitting in Jetas Wood in placing the nuns successively in their different positionsplaced this Elder Nun in the foremost position of those possessing spiritual powerTranslationIn the sixth story Amongst those who meditate that is to say Nandāit shows why the Elder Nun Nandā amongst those who delighted in meditation was said to be foremostAt the time of the Buddha Padumuttara it seemsshe was conceived in a good family home in Hasavatīand later while listening to the Teacher teach the Dhammaseeing the Teacher place a certain nun as being foremost amongst those who meditateshe did a great deed and aspired for that position herselfShe was reborn amongst gods and humans only for one hundred thousand aeonsand was reborn at a time before our Teacherbeing conceived in the womb of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamīand was given the name Nandā also Beautiful Nandā was saidand later because of her supreme beauty the name JanapadakalyāṇīAfter our One of Ten Powers had attained omniscienceand gradually come to Kapilavatthugiven the going forth to Rāhula and Nandaand was leaving after the time of the Great King Suddhodanas Final Nibbāna she understood After Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and Rāhulas Mother had renouncedthey received the going forth in the presence of the Teacherand she thought After their going forth what work is there for me hereAnd she went into the presence of Mahāpajāpatī and also went forthFrom the day of her going forth thinking The Teacher finds fault with beautyshe didnt go to attend on the Teacherand when an occasion for instruction arrivedThe Teacher understanding that she was intoxicated with her own beauty said Let each one receive the instruction herself after comingshe should not send another from amongst the nunsThen Beautiful Nandā not seeing another way went unwillingly for her instructionThe Teacher because of her conduct created a beautiful woman with his spiritual powerwho held a palmyra fan and seemed to be fanning himSeeing that Beautiful Nandā thoughtWithout reason I was heedless and I did not comeyet such beautiful women go about confidently in the presence of the TeacherMy beauty is not worth even a sixteenth part of the beauty of their beautynot knowing this for such a long time I did not comeShe stood there gazing at the womans formThe Teacher knowing she was endowed with all the former conditionsrecited the verse found in the DhammapadaThis citadel is made of bones smeared over with flesh and bloodwhere old age and death conceit and anger are lying hiddenand he spoke the DiscourseWhether going or standing whether sitting or lyingit moves it stretches this is the movement of the bodyBones and sinews conjoined smeared with skin and fleshthe body is covered with skin the reality is not seenFull of intestines full of undigested food having a lumpy liver a bladderheart lungs kidney and spleenmucus spit sweat and fatblood synovial fluid bile and greaseAlways there are impurities flowing from its nine orificeseyedefecation from the eyes eardefecation from the earsmucus from the nose from the mouth vomit isvomited also bile and phlegm perspiration and dirt from the bodyand its hollow head is filled with the brainA fool honouring ignorance thinks of it as beautifulbut when it lies dead bloated and discolouredcast aside in the charnel ground even his relatives have no further expectation of itDogs hyenas wolves and worms eat itcrows vultures also eat and whatever other breathing beings there areHaving heard the Word of the Buddha the monastic endowed with wisdom herethe one who understands it sees as it really isThinking As is this so is that as is that so is thisinside and outside he should remove delight for the bodyHaving removed passion and delight the monastic endowed with wisdom herehas passed over to the deathless peace the immovable state of NibbānaHe cares for this stinking impure two legged bodybut it is full of various corpses flowing out from here and thereHe who would think to be proud of such a bodyor would despise another because of theirs what is this except a lack of insightWith that she was established in knowledge about the dissolution and destruction of beauty and attained LiberationIn this place the story belowis the same as the Elder Nun Khemās story and is not elaborated furtherFrom thence onwards Beautiful Nandā was chief amongst those delighting in meditationLater as the Teacher was sitting in Jetas Woodas he was assigning the places of the nuns in orderhe placed the Elder Nun Nandā in the foremost position amongst those who meditateTranslationIn the second story Khemā is the name of this nunFrom here on without saying This is the exposition concerning the enquiry into her previous deedsplacing the resolution at the beginning each time we will say what should be saidIn the past at the time of the Buddha Padumuttara it seemsshe was reborn in the city of Hasavatī and was owned by another Then one day she saw that Fortunate Ones chief disciplethe Elder named Sujātagave him three sweetmeats had her hair shorn on that very daygave a donation to the Elderand made this aspiration When a Buddha has arisen in the future may I like you have great wisdomshe did good deeds for the rest of her lifeand being reborn amongst gods and humans only for one hundred thousand aeonsshe was conceived in the home of Kiki the King of Kāsi in the time of the Buddha Kassapaand became one amongst seven sisterslived as a celibate in the house for twentythousand yearstogether with her sisters had a dwelling place made for the One of Ten Powersand being reborn amongst gods and humans only during one period when there was no Buddhawhen this Gotama Buddha aroseshe was conceived in a Royal family in the city of Sāgala in the country of Maddaand given the name KhemāThe radiance of her body glowed as it were with a golden hueWhen she had reached maturity she was taken to King Bimbisāras houseWhen the Realised One was living near to Rājagaha in the Bamboo Woodshe being intoxicated with her own beauty and thinking The Teacher it appears sees fault in beautyand He will see fault in my beautythrough fear didnt go to see the One of Ten PowersThe King thought I am the Teachers foremost attendantand for one like me who is known as a Noble Disciplethat my Chief Consort does not go to see the One of Ten Powers is not pleasing to meAfter having the praises of the Bamboo Grove composed by the poetshe said Recite the poems within the hearing of Queen KhemāHe who has not seen the delightful Bamboo Woodhas also not seen Nandana in Tāvatisa Heaven such was my thinkingHe who has seen the Bamboo Wood rejoicing in the rejoicer of menhas also seen Nandana greatly rejoiced in by the Lord of the Gods SakkaThe gods having abandoned Nandana and descended to the surface of the Earthafter seeing the delightful Veḷuvana astonished are not satiated with itThrough the Kings merit it appeared it is decorated with the Buddhas meritwho could describe the great quantity of virtues of that WoodAfter hearing the praise of the Grove and gaining a desire to go she put the question to the KingThe King said Go to the Grovebut without having seen the Teacher you will not receive permission to returnWithout having given a reply to the King she took the path to the GroveThe King said to the men who were going with herIf the Queen returning from the garden sees the One of Ten Powers that is goodbut if she does not see him the Royal command is you must point him outThen the Queen after walking in the Grove in the daytimeand returning without seeing the One of Ten Powers was ready to goThen the Kings men against her liking led the Queen into the presence of the TeacherThe Teacher saw her coming and with his spiritual power made an image of a heavenly angelwhich took up a palmfan and he made it look like she was fanning himHaving seen her Queen Khemā thoughtMy conceit has perished such beautiful women like unto heavenly angelsare standing not far from the One of Ten Powers I am not fit to be their servantmy wicked mind supported by mad conceit has perishedGrasping the image she stood there looking at the womanThen as she was watching through the power of the Realised Ones resolvethat angel passed beyond her youthand from being in middleage she passed beyond middleageand was like one in oldage having wrinkled skin grey hair and broken and loose teethThen as she was watching the angel stumbled about together with her fan and fell downThen Khemā being endowed with the former conditionsas that senseobject came within range reflected thusEven such a beautiful body comes to misfortunemy body will also come to the very same misfortuneAt the instant that she had that thought the Teacher spoke this verse found in the DhammapadaThose impassioned with passion run along with the streamjust as a spider runs along the web she has made herselfafter cutting that off the wise journey onwithout expectation having abandoned all sufferingAt the conclusion of the verse while standing on that very spotshe attained Liberation together with the analytic knowledgesFor one who attains Liberation while dwelling in the midst of the home lifeshe should either that very day attain Final Nibbāna or go forthThe Buddha understanding the life span of her existencesaid I will cause her to receive permission to go forthAfter worshipping the Teacher and going to the Kings residenceshe stood there without having worshipped the KingThrough that sign the King understood She must have attained Nobilitythen he said to her Queen have you been to see the TeacherGreat King only a little insight has been gained by youbut I have gained the One of Ten Powers true insightyou must allow me to go forthThe King answered Very well Queenand had her carried in a golden palanquin to the nunnery and had her go forthThen it was said of her The Elder Nun called Khemā while still a householder attained Liberationand she became famous for her great wisdomWearied of all processes skilled in the modes of conditionshaving overcome the four floods I attained LiberationI have mastery over spiritual power the divine earelementI have mastery in knowledge of mindreadingI know my previous lives have clarified the divine eyedestroyed all the pollutantsRight there in meanings conditions language and improvisationmy knowledge was purified it arose within the Buddhas TeachingI was proficient in purification mature in subjects for discussiona knower of the Abstract Teaching method attained to mastery in the TeachingLater on the grounds in Toraṇa by the Lord King of KosalaI was questioned with deep questions and I answered just as it isThen the King approached the Happy One and questioned himright there the Awakened One answered just as I had answeredThis is the story hereThen later when the Teacher was sitting in Jetas Woodin placing the nuns successively in their different positionshe placed the Elder Nun Khemā at the foremost of those having great wisdomTranslationIn the ninth story Amongst those who are quick in deep knowledgeit shows why the Elder Nun Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesā amongst those who were quick in deep knowledge was said to be foremostAt the time of the Buddha Padumuttara being reborn in a good family home in Hasavatīshe listened to the Teacher talk about Dhammaand saw the Teacher place a certain nun as being foremost amongst those who are quick in deep knowledgeand did a great deed and aspired for that position herselfShe was reborn amongst gods and humans only for one hundred thousand aeonsand in the time of the Buddha Kassapa in the home of Kiki the King of Kāsishe became one amongst seven sistersestablished the ten precepts for twentythousand yearsliving as a celibatemade a dwelling place for the Communitywas reborn amongst gods and humans only during one period when there was no Buddhaand when this Gotama Buddha aroseshe was conceived in a merchants family in the city of Rājagahaand they gave her the name Bhaddā AuspiciousThat very day in the city the Kings chaplains son was bornFrom the moment of his birth beginning with King Bimbisāras residenceand throughout the whole city weapons blazed forthIn the morning the chaplain went to the Kings family and asked if the King had slept comfortablyThe King said How can I sleep comfortably today Teacher when all nightwe saw the weapons in the Kings residence blazing forth and we have become fearfulGreat King do not worry for this reasonnot only in your home did weapons blaze forth it was so throughout the whole cityWhat is the reason TeacherIn our home was born a child under the thieves starhe will become an enemy to the whole citythis is the portent concerning himthere is no danger for you but if you wish let us bear him offThere being no intention to harm us there is no need to bear him offThe chaplain thinking My son has come bearing his own namenamed him Sattuka Little EnemyBhaddā grew up in the merchants home and Sattuka grew up in the chaplains homeFrom the time he was able to play by running around here and therewhatever he saw in any place he had wandered tohe took all of it away and filled up his Mother and Fathers home with itHis Father although giving him a thousand reasons was not able to restrain himLater as he reached maturityunderstanding it was an impossibility to restrain him in any wayhe gave him a pair of blue robesand put into his hands all the requisites for housebreaking and a grappleand sent him off saying You can make a living through doing this workFrom that day forward after throwing his grappleascending residences of good families making a breachand taking the goods that other families had stored there as if he had put them there himself he departedThere was not a home in the whole city that was not plundered by himOne day as the King was travelling about the city in his chariot he asked his charioteerWhy is it that there appears to be a breach in every house in this cityGodKing in this city there is a thief named Sattuka whohaving broken through the wall carries off the property of the good familiesThe King summoned the Mayorand said It seems that in this city there is such and such a thiefwhy have you not grabbed himWe GodKing are not able to find the thief together with the stolen propertyIf today you capture the thief you can livebut if you do not capture him I will issue a Royal commandYes GodKing and the Mayor sent men all over the cityand after Sattuka had broken through a wall and was making off with others goodsthey captured him together with the stolen property and brought him to the KingThe King said Take this thief out through the south gate and execute himThe Mayor gave his assent to the Kingand having that thief flogged with a thousand strokes at each of the crossroadshe went outAt that time the merchants daughter Bhaddāafter opening the window because of the uproar of the populacewhile looking around saw the thief Sattuka being brought outand holding her two hands over her heartwent and lay down on the couch with her head held lowShe was the familys only daughterand her relatives were not able to endure even a trifling contortion of her faceThen her Mother seeing her lying on the couch asked What are you doing DearDo you see this thief they have prepared and brought out to be executedYes Lady we do see himIf I get him I will live but if I dont get him there is surely death for meThey being unable to convince her in any wayconsidered Life is better than deathThen her Father went into the Mayors presence and gave him a thousand in a bribe saying My daughter is infatuated with this thiefplease free him through some means or otherHe saying Very well assenting to the merchant grabbed the thiefand delayed at the funeral bier until the sun was settingas the sun set he drove a certain man from the prisonand loosening Sattukas bonds he sent Sattuka to the merchants homeand having the other man bound with Sattukas bondshe drove him through the southern door and had him executedThe merchants servants grabbed Sattuka and took him to the merchants residenceSeeing him the merchant thinking I will fulfil my daughters desirehad Sattuka bathed in scented wateradorned with all decorations and sent him to the mansionBhaddā thinking My desire is fulfilleddecorated herself with innumerable decorations and amused herself with himSattuka after a few days had passed thoughtHer decorative articles will be minebut by what means is it fitting to grab her ornamentsAt a time they were sitting comfortably together he said to BhaddāThere is a word of mine I would like to speakThe merchants daughter like one who had received a thousand coins with a satisfied mindsaid Speak freely Noble SirYou thought His life was saved because of mebut when they grabbed me on the mountain from where they throw down thieves I prayed to the god living thereimploring If I receive my life I will make an offering to youBecause of that my life was saved quickly get an offering readyBhaddā thinking I will fulfil his desire prepared the offeringdecorated herself with all decorationsmounted a vehicle with her husband and went to the mountain from where they throw down thievesbegan to ascend thinking I will make an offering to the god of the mountainSattuka thought With all of us ascendingI will not be able to grab her ornamentsso after having her take the offeringvessel he ascended the mountainBut while speaking with Bhaddā he spoke no endearing wordsand from his gestures she understood his intentionThen he said to her Bhaddā cast off your robeand make a bundle here of all the ornaments heaped up on youHusband what is my faultWhy fool do you think I have come to make offerings he said making a signHaving torn the liver out of that god I could give an offering in this placebut I have come desiring your ornamentsNoble Sir but whose are the ornaments and whose am IWe do not know of such a thingas your property is one thing and my property is anotherVery well Noble Sir but let me fulfil one wishlet me give you in all your finery a hug from in front and from behindSaying Very well he acceptedUnderstanding his acceptance she hugged him from the frontmade like she was hugging him from behind and threw him from the mountain from where they throw down thievesHe fell through the air and was crushed to piecesSeeing the wondrous nature of her deedthe goddess who dwelt on the mountain spoke this verse expounding her virtueNot on every occasion is it a man that is wisea women is wise also she is wise now and thenNot on every occasion is it a man that is wisea women is wise also if she but think for a momentThen Bhaddā thought Because of this I am not able to return again to my homeI will go from here and go forth in some going forth or otherand she went to the Nigaṇṭhas monastery and requested to go forth amongst the NigaṇṭhasThen they said this to her What manner of going forthSaying Please give your supreme going forthSaying Very well they pulled out her hair with the shell of a palm nut and gave her the going forthBut her hair grew back in ringlets and wavy curlsand because of that the name Kuṇḍalakesā Curly Hair aroseShe learned all the skills in the place of her going forthand knowing There is no further distinction beyond thiswandering from village to town to capital citywherever there were learned men she went thereand learned all the arts they knewAnd in many places because she was so learned no one was able to give a reply to herThen not seeing anyone who was able to dispute with herin whatever village or town she entered she piled up sand at the gateand set up a branch of a roseapple tree right theresaying Whoever is able to refute my word he should trample down this branchand she informed the children standing nearbyNo one trampled it down even after seven daysThen taking it she departedAt that time our Fortunate One had been reborn in the worldand was living in Jetas Wood at SāvatthīThen Kuṇḍalakesā after gradually reaching Sāvatthīand entering the city in the same way as beforeset her branch in the sand informed the children and leftAt that time Ven Sāriputta the General of the Dhamma after the Community of monks had already entered the citysaw the RoseApple branch in the sand heap while entering the town aloneand asked Why is this placed hereThe children without omitting anything told him the reasonThat being so take it and trample on it childrenThey listened to the Elders word but some didnt dare to trample on itsome others after trampling on it in an instant crushed it to powderKuṇḍalakesā while leaving after taking her mealsaw the branch trampled down and asked Who did this deedThen they told her the General of the Dhamma had caused it to be doneShe thought He must be knowing his own strengthelse he wouldnt dare to have had the branch trampled downhe must surely be a great manBut I am insignificant in comparison and I will not shine and yet thinking After entering the village it is right to inform the peoplethat is what she didAll eighty thousand families residing in that city in their various neighbourhoodswere informed so it should be understoodThe Elder after the meal duties sat down at the root of a certain treeThen Kuṇḍalakesā surrounded by the populace went into the presence of the Elderexchanged greetings and stood on one sideShe asked Reverend Sir did you have the branch trampled downYes I had it trampled downThat being so reverend Sir let there be a discussion on our doctrine together with yoursLet it be so BhaddāBut who should ask and who should answerOur questions are ready you can ask according to your understandingConsent having been given by the Eldershe asked everything according to the doctrine she understood and the Elder answered it alland having asked everything she fell silentThen the Elder said to herYou asked many things but we will ask only one questionAsk away reverend SirWhat is said to be oneKuṇḍalakesā said I dont know reverend SirIf you dont know even that much how will you know anything elseShe fell at the Elders feet right thereand said I go to you for refuge reverend SirThere is no coming to me for refugethe Greatest Person in the world with its gods dwells in a monastery nearby go to Him for refugeShe said I will do so reverend SirIn the evening time at the time

nunnery and went forthLater this discussion arose in the midst of the four assembliesGreat is this Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesāin that she attained Liberation at the end of just four lines of verseFor this

that which has been spat aside or vomited upI could not live with my head held highplease allow my going forthVisākha said Very good Dhammadinnā and after announcing it to the Kinghe sent Dhammadinnā in a golden palanquin to the nunnery for the going forthAfter the going forth she thoughtThis merchant while still in the midst of his house has made an end to sufferingbut from the time I received the going forthtill now I have yet to make an end to sufferingShe went to her teacher and preceptor and said Noble Ladies my mind does not delight in this crowded placeI would go to a village dwellingThe Elders because she had renounced a great family through her going forthfelt unable to find fault with her thought and they took her and went to a village dwellingAs she had prepared the right conditions in the pastnot long after she attained Liberation together with the analytic knowledgesThen it occurred to herI have attained the summit of what was to be done living here what will I doI shall go to Rājagahaand there on account of me a large company of my relatives will make meritand with the Elders she returned to the cityVisākha hearing that she had come thoughtQuickly she came is it because she is dissatisfiedIn the evening time he went into her presence and worshipped and sat down at one sidethinking It is inappropriate to ask about her dissatisfactionand instead he asked a question about the five constituent parts and so forthand Dhammadinnā like one who cuts through a lily stalk with a swordanswered each of the questionsThe devotee understanding how sharp was the Elder Nun Dhammadinnās knowledgeafter asking questions in order about all the conditions for the three paths of his own attainmentasked about learning the Path to LiberationThe Elder Nun Dhammadinnā understanding that the devotee had only reached the state up to the Fruit of NonReturnerthinking Now he is going beyond his own state and running on stopping him said You are not able to grasp friend Visākha answers to questions that are beyond your limitslike immersion in Nibbāna friend Visākhathe spiritual life that ends in Nibbāna that has a conclusion in NibbānaDesiring this friend Visākhaapproach the Fortunate One and you can ask him about this matterand just as the Fortunate One explains so you should bear it in mindVisākha went into the presence of the Teacher and told him the questions and answers that had been givenThe Teacher listened to his wordsand saying My daughter has no craving for past future or present constituentsspoke this verse found in the DhammapadaThen having given approval to Dhammadinnā he said this to the devotee VisākhaWise Visākha is the nun Dhammadinnāhaving great wisdom Visākha is the nun Dhammadinnāif you were to ask me Visākha the same matterI would answer it in the same wayin the same way as the nun Dhammadinnā has answeredfor this is indeed the meaning and so should you bear it in mindThus did the story unfoldLater as the Teacher was sitting in Jetas Woodas he was assigning the places of the nuns in orderregarding this Small Discourse giving an Elaborationhe placed this Elder Nun in the foremost position in the Dispensation amongst those who talked about DhammaTranslationIn the tenth story Amongst those who have knowledge of their former livesit shows why amongst those who could recollect the succession of the great mass of former livesthe Elder Nun Bhaddā Kāpilānī was said to be foremostAt the time of the Buddha Padumuttara it seemsshe was reborn in a good family home in Hasavatīand while listening to the Teacher teach the Dhamma seeing the Teacher place a certain nunas being foremost amongst those who recollect their former livesshe did a great deed and aspired for that position herselfAfter being reborn amongst gods and humans only for one hundred thousand aeonswhen there was no Buddha arisen after being conceived in a good family home in Sāvatthīduring a quarrel with her brothers wifewhen the sister gave alms food to an Independent Buddhathinking After giving alms food to him she has him under her controlshe grabbed the bowl from the Independent Buddhas handthrew away the food filled it with mud and gave it backThe people said She is a fool and blamed her saying You had a quarrel with her but did nothing to herwhat offence has the Independent Buddha done to youFeeling shame at these words she took the bowl againemptied the mud washed and scrubbed it with fragrant soap powderfilled it with the four sweet thingsand sprinkling it with ghee shining the colour of a lotus calyxplaced it in the hand of the Independent Buddhasaying Just as this alms food shines forth so may my body shine forthShe established this aspirationAnd everything should be understood as it has been related in the Elder Mahā Kassapas storyafter our Teacher had arisen in the worldand had Set Rolling the Noble Wheel of the Dhamma he gradually entered RājagahaWhile the Teacher was dwelling there this young brāhmaṇa Pippaliin the Magadha country in the brāhmaṇa village called Great Fordwas reborn in the brāhmaṇa Kapilas Queens wombAnd Bhaddā Kāpilānī in the Madda country in the Sāgala townwas reborn in the brāhmaṇa Kosiyas Queens wombGradually they both grew upand when the young brāhmaṇa Pippali was twenty years old and Bhaddā had come to sixteenhis Mother and Father after examining their sonsaid Dear you are now matureyou should keep up the family lineageThe young brāhmaṇa said It is not suitable to talk such talk in my earas long as you last I will look after youbut after you have departed I will go forthAfter a few days had passed they spoke again and again he refusedAgain they spoke again he refusedFrom then on his Mother spoke incessantly about itThe young brāhmaṇa thinking I must convince my Mothergave a thousand coins of red goldhad a womans form made by the goldsmithsand at the end of the work he rubbed and polished it and so ondressed it in red clotheshad it adorned with various ornaments and colourful flowerssummoned his Mother and saidMother finding someone of such a form I will live in a householdbut not finding her I will not live thereThe wise brāhmaṇī thoughtMy meritorious son must have formed a resolution and given giftshe wasnt making merit by himself alonesurely there will be a woman whom he made merit with who is like this golden statueShe summoned eight brāhmaṇas and satisfied them with all they wished forand mounted the golden statue on a chariotsaying Go Dears and wherever there is a family similar to ours in birth lineage and wealthlook for a girl who is like this golden statueand after making a present give it to her and she sent them offThey thought This is our work and departedthey went to the Madda country and to the Sāgala townThey set up the golden statue there at the bathing ghat and sat down on one sideThen Bhaddās nurse washed and decorated Bhaddā and made her sit in the royal bed chamberand while going to bathe she saw the statueand thinking The Noble Lady has come here she made a threatening gesturesaying Why are you so obstinate as to come here and lifting up her hand threateninglyshe said Go back quickly and slapped it on the sideHer hand trembled like she had struck a rockStepping back she said It is so hardSeeing her stiff neck thinking My Noble Lady she made a gestureand said This is inappropriate for a Noble Lady who is dressed by meThen those men surrounded her and asked Is your Masters daughter like thisWhy this is as lovely as my Noble Lady who has a hundred even a thousand virtuesthere is nothing that can hold a candle to her when she is sat in her twelvecubit chamberthe radiance of her body destroys the darknessThen come and they took the offering mounted the golden statue on a chariotand stopped at the gate of the house of the brāhmaṇa of the Kosiya clan and announced their comingThe brāhmaṇa received them well and asked From where did you comeFrom the house of the brāhmaṇa Kapila in the Great Ford village in the Magadha countryFor what reason have you comeFor this reason and they explainedIt is good Dears this brāhmaṇa has the same birth lineage and wealth as uswe will give him the girl and he received the bridegiftThey sent a message to the brāhmaṇa Kapilasaying Having found the girl please do what should be doneAfter hearing the message they informed the young brāhmaṇa Pippalisaying It seems the girl has been foundThe young brāhmaṇa reflecting I thought they will not find her and now they say she is foundMisfortune has arisen I will send her a letterand having gone into seclusion he wrote a letterBhaddā should gain a household life suitable to her birth lineage and wealthbut having renounced I will go forth do not regret it laterBhaddā also having heard It seems they desire to give me to such and suchwent into seclusion and wrote a letterThe Noble Sir should gain a household life suitable to his birth lineage and wealthbut having renounced I will go forth do not regret it laterThe two letter bearers met on the highwayWhose letter is thisThe young brāhmaṇa Pippali send it to BhaddāThis is whose letterBhaddā sent it to the young brāhmaṇa Pippali and after saying that and reading the letterssaying Look at the childrens deedsthey tore them up and threw them away in the wildernesswrote similar letters and sent them from here and thereThus neither Pippali nor Bhaddā wished there to be a meetingThe day they married the young brāhmaṇa took a garland of flowers and set it upBhaddā also set one up in the middle of the bedHaving enjoyed supper they both thought We will go up and lie down and having met in the bedroomthe young brāhmaṇa went up and lay down on his right sideand Bhaddā after laying down on her left side saidOn whichever side the flowers fade we will know that a lustful thought arose to the one on that sideyou should not come near this garland of flowersThrough fear of their bodies coming into contact with each otherthey passed the time without falling asleep during the three watches of the nightand during the day there was no laughterFor as long as their Mothers and Fathers continued they were unaffected by material life in this worldand they did not manage the family estates but with their passing they had to manage themThe young brāhmaṇa Pippali was very wealthy having eight hundred and seventy millionThe golden powder that was thrown away after bathing his body for one daywas enough for twelve measures by the Magadha measureThere were at least sixty reservoirs with irrigation machineshis workplace was twelve leagues there were fourteen Anurādhapurasized villagesfourteen elephant armies fourteen horse armies and fourteen chariot armiesOne day after mounting a decorated horseand going to work surrounded by the populacestanding at the top of ten million fields that were being broken by the ploughand having seen the birds beginning with the crows digging up and eating the earth worms and insects and so onhe asked Dear what are they eatingEarth worms Noble SirWho pays for the wickedness done by these birdsYou do Noble SirHe thought If mine is the result for the wickedness done by thesewhat will I do with eight hundred and seventy millionwhat use is a workplace of twelve leagueswhat use sixty reservoirs with irrigation machineswhat use fourteen villagesHaving given everything over to Bhaddā Kāpilānī I will renounce and go forthBhaddā Kāpilānī at that timethree pots of sesame seeds having being sown over the inner fieldswas sitting surrounded by her helpers and saw crows eating the worms that dwelt in the sesameand asked Lady what are they eatingWorms Noble LadyWhose is the unwholesome resultYours Noble LadyShe thoughtFour cubit of clothes and a mere measure of milkrice is enough for mebut if the unwholesome deeds done by this many people is mineit is certainly not possible to lift my head from the round of births and deaths through a thousand rebirthshaving given everything over to the Noble Sir as soon as he returnsI will renounce and go forthThe young brāhmaṇa returned after bathing ascended the mansion and sat down on an expensive couchThey prepared a meal for him suitable for a Universal MonarchAfter they both had eaten and with the departure of the attendants they sat down on a comfortable spot in seclusionThen the young brāhmaṇa said this to BhaddāBhaddā when coming to this house how much wealth did you bringFiftyfive thousand carts Noble Sir There is all this wealth plus eight hundred and seventy millionand sixty reservoirs with irrigation machines and so onI give all of this over to youBut where will you go Noble SirI will go forthNoble Sir I also have been sitting here waiting for your comingI also will go forthThe three states of continuationThey had their clothes died yellow with astringents and clay bowls brought from the marketshaved off each others hairsaying Our going forth is on account of those who are Liberated in the worldand depositing their bowls in their bags and slinging them over the shoulder they descended from the palaceNo one from the home whether servants or workers recognised themThen having departed from the brāhmaṇa village while going through the entrance to the servants villagethey were recognised by those living in the servants village by their gait and deportmentThrowing themselves at their feet crying they said Noble Ones why do you leave us helpless After saying We friends having seen that the three states of continuation are like three leafhuts that are burning are going forthif we were to make you freemen one by one it would not be possible with one hundred years you are so manyafter washing each others headsand leaving them crying they went awayThe Elder as he was going along in front after stopping and lookingthought This Bhaddā Kāpilānī who is worth more than all the women in the RoseApple Isleis coming along behind meBut there may be a reason for someone to think thusHaving gone forth they are not able to live apart but that is unsuitable for themIf someone defiled their minds in this way they might risk filling up the lower worldsafter abandoning her it is right to go off by myself this thought aroseWhile going forward he saw a junction in the path and stood at its headBhaddā came and worshipped and also stood thereThen he said to her Bhaddā having seen such a woman as you following meand thinking Having gone forth they are not able to live apartthrough us the people may defile their minds and might fill up the lower worldstherefore at this junction you take one road and I will go by anotherYes Noble Sir for those gone forth women are known as a stainthinking Having gone forth these are not living apart they will make the fault oursyou take one path I will take another and we will live apartAfter reverentially circumambulating him three timesworshipping with the fivefold prostration on all four sidesextending a reverential salutation with the ten fingernails joined together saying Our friendship and fellowship that ran over a measure of one hundred thousand aeonsis broken todayand You are known as one belonging to the right the right path is suitable for youI am a woman belonging to the left the left path is suitable for meafter worshipping she entered the left pathAt the time of this juncture the great earth as though saying This universe with its mountains and Mount Sineru I am able to bearbut your virtue I am unable to bear quaked with a roarwhich spread like thunderstorms in the sky and the mountain at the centre of the universe resoundedBut the Elder Mahā Kassapa after taking the right hand roadwent into the One of Ten Powers presence at the root of the Many Sons Banyan Tree shrinewhile Bhaddā Kāpilānī after taking the left hand roadbecause there wasnt yet permission for women to go forth went to the Wandering Nuns monasteryBut when Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī received the going forththen that Elderlater while working at insight meditationattained Liberation and became one who had mastered the knowledge of former livesThen after the Teacher had sat down in Jetas Wood as he was assigning the places of the nuns in orderhe placed this Elder Nun in the foremost position amongst those who recollect their former livesTranslationAnd how monks are the Four Ways of Attending to Mindfulness developedHow when made much

a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggsAnd she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubatedNow the chick that is first to break out of the eggshell with its claws and beak and hatch safelyshould that be called the eldest or the youngestMaster Gotama that should be called the eldestFor it is the eldest among themIn the same way in this population lost in ignorance trapped in their shells I alone have broken open the egg of ignorance and realized the supreme perfect awakeningSo brahmin I am the eldest and the first in the worldMy energy was roused up and unflagging my mindfulness was established and lucid my body was tranquil and undisturbed and my mind was immersed in samādhiQuite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I entered and remained in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedAnd with the fading away of rapture I entered and remained in the third absorption where I meditated with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissWith the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness I entered and remained in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward recollection of past livesI recollected many kinds of past lives That isone two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expandingI remembered There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my foodThis was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life endedWhen I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThis was the first knowledge which I achieved in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteThis was my first breaking out like a chick breaking out of the eggshellWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThese dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mindThey spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they acted out of that wrong viewWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellThese dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mindThey never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they acted out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThis was the second knowledge which I achieved in the middle watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteThis was my second breaking out like a chick breaking out of the eggshellWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsI truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingI truly understood These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen it was freed I knew it was freedI understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis was the third knowledge which I achieved in the last watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteThis was my third breaking out like a chick breaking out of the eggshellWhen he said this the brahmin Verañja said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama is the eldest Master Gotama is the bestExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path

BuddhaThen General Sīha went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said to himSir Id like to go to see the ascetic GotamaBut Sīha you believe in the doctrine of action Why should you go to see the ascetic Gotama who teaches a doctrine of inactionFor the ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction he teaches inaction and he guides his disciples in that wayThen Sīhas determination to go and see the Buddha

is wise They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble penetrative and leads to the complete ending of sufferingThis is the fifth thing that when the hearts release is not ripe helps
