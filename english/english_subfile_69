Sensual Pleasures
“Mendicants, sentient beings are mostly charmed by sensual pleasures.
When a gentleman has abandoned the scythe and flail and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, they’re qualified to be called ‘a faithful renunciate from a good family’.
Why is that?
Because a youth can get sensual pleasures of this kind or that.
Now, all sensual pleasures are just reckoned as ‘sensual pleasures’, regardless of whether they’re inferior, average, or superior.
Suppose there was a little baby boy who, because of his nurse’s negligence, puts a stick or stone in his mouth.
The nurse would very quickly notice
and try to take it out.
If that didn’t work, she’d cradle his head with her left hand, and take it out using a hooked finger of her right hand, even if it drew blood.
Why is that?
I admit she’d know, ‘This will distress the child,
there’s no denying.’
Still, it should be done by a nurse who wants what’s best for him, out of kindness and compassion.
And when the boy has grown up and has enough sense, his nurse would not worry about him, thinking:
‘The boy can look after himself. He won’t be negligent.’
In the same way, I still need to look after a mendicant who hasn’t finished developing faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities.
But when a mendicant has finished developing faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities, I need not be concerned, thinking:
‘They can look after themselves. They won’t be negligent.’”

An Exquisite Ascetic of Ascetics
“Mendicants, a mendicant with five qualities is an exquisite ascetic of ascetics.
What five?
It’s when a mendicant usually uses only what they’ve been invited to accept—robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—rarely using them without invitation.
When living with other spiritual practitioners, they usually treat them agreeably by way of body, speech, and mind, and rarely disagreeably.
And they usually present them with agreeable things, rarely with disagreeable ones.
They’re healthy, so the various unpleasant feelings—stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their conjunction; or caused by change in weather, by not taking care of themselves, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds—usually don’t come up.
They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
A mendicant with these five qualities is an exquisite ascetic of ascetics.
And if anyone should be rightly called an exquisite ascetic of ascetics, it’s me.
For I usually use only what I’ve been invited to accept.
When living with other spiritual practitioners, I usually treat them agreeably.
And I usually present them with agreeable things.
I’m healthy.
I get the four absorptions when I want, without trouble or difficulty.
And I’ve realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life.
So if anyone should be rightly called an exquisite ascetic of ascetics, it’s me.”

A Listener
“Mendicants, a royal bull elephant with five factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship.
What five?
A royal bull elephant listens, destroys, protects, endures, and goes fast.
And how does a royal bull elephant listen?
It’s when a royal bull elephant pays heed, pays attention, engages wholeheartedly, and lends an ear to whatever task the elephant trainer has it do,
whether or not it has done it before.
That’s how a royal bull elephant listens.
And how does a royal bull elephant destroy?
It’s when a royal bull elephant in battle destroys elephants with their riders, horses with their riders, chariots and charioteers, and foot soldiers.
That’s how a royal bull elephant destroys.
And how does a royal bull elephant protect?
It’s when a royal bull elephant in battle protects its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its fore-feet and hind-feet, and its head, ears, tusks, trunk, tail, and rider.
That’s how a royal bull elephant protects.
And how does a royal bull elephant endure?
It’s when a royal bull elephant in battle endures being struck by spears, swords, arrows, and axes; it endures the thunder of the drums, kettledrums, horns, and cymbals.
That’s how a royal bull elephant endures.
And how does a royal bull elephant go fast?
It’s when a royal bull elephant swiftly goes in whatever direction the elephant trainer sends it,
whether or not it has been there before.
That’s how a royal bull elephant goes fast.
A royal bull elephant with these five factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship.
In the same way, a mendicant with five qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
What five?
A mendicant listens, destroys, protects, endures, and goes fast.
And how does a mendicant listen?
It’s when a mendicant pays heed, pays attention, engages wholeheartedly, and lends an ear when the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One is being taught.
That’s how a mendicant listens.
And how does a mendicant destroy?
It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, calm them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
That’s how a mendicant destroys.
And how does a mendicant protect?
When a mendicant sees a sight with the eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it.
Hearing a sound with the ears …
Smelling an odor with the nose …
Tasting a flavor with the tongue …
Feeling a touch with the body …
Knowing a thought with the mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it.
That’s how a mendicant protects.
And how does a mendicant endure?
It’s when a mendicant endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; rude and unwelcome criticism; and puts up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.
That’s how a mendicant endures.
And how does a mendicant go fast?
It’s when a mendicant swiftly goes in the direction they’ve never gone before in all this long time; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.
That’s how a mendicant goes fast.
A mendicant with these five qualities … is the supreme field of merit for the world.”

Threats
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him:
“Householder, unless these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be unethical, and is reborn in hell.
What five?
Killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
Unless these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be unethical, and is reborn in hell.
Once these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be ethical, and is reborn in heaven.
What five?
Killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
Once these five dangers and threats are given up, one is said to be ethical, and is reborn in heaven.
Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from killing living creatures creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness.
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures.
Anyone who steals …
Anyone who commits sexual misconduct …
Anyone who lies …
Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness.
So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
Take anyone in this world
who kills living creatures,
speaks falsely, steals,
commits adultery,
and indulges in drinking
alcohol and liquor.
Unless they give up these five threats,
they’re said to be unethical.
When their body breaks up, that witless person
is reborn in hell.
A person in the world doesn’t kill living creatures,

At Tikaṇḍakī
At Tikaṇḍakī
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa, in Tikaṇḍakī Wood.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, a mendicant would do well to meditate from time to time perceiving the following: the repulsive in the unrepulsive,
the unrepulsive in the repulsive,
the repulsive in both the unrepulsive and the repulsive, and
the unrepulsive in both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.
A mendicant would do well to meditate from time to time staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.
For what reason should a mendicant meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive?
‘May greed not arise in me for things that arouse greed.’
A mendicant should meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive for this reason.
For what reason should a mendicant meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive?
‘May hate not arise in me for things that provoke hate.’ …

‘May hate not arise in me for things that provoke hate. May greed not arise in me for things that arouse greed.’ …
For what reason should a mendicant meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive?
‘May no greed for things that arouse greed, hate for things that provoke hate, or delusion for things that promote delusion arise in me in any way at all.’
For this reason a mendicant should meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.”

Things That Cannot Be Had
“Mendicants, there are five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
What five?
That someone liable to old age should not grow old.
That someone liable to sickness should not get sick. … That someone liable to death should not die. … That someone liable to ending should not end. … That someone liable to perishing should not perish. …
An uneducated ordinary person has someone liable to old age who grows old.
But they don’t reflect on old age:
‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to old age who grows old. For as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to old age who grows old.
If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to old age grows old, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
This is called
an uneducated ordinary person struck by sorrow’s poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves.
Furthermore, an uneducated ordinary person has someone liable to sickness … death … ending … perishing.
But they don’t reflect on perishing:
‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn, they all have someone liable to perishing who perishes.
If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to perishing perishes, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
And so, when someone liable to perishing perishes, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
This is called
an uneducated ordinary person struck by sorrow’s poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves.
An educated noble disciple has someone liable to old age who grows old.

And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
This is called
an educated noble disciple who has drawn out sorrow’s poisoned arrow, struck by which uneducated ordinary people only mortify themselves.
Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only extinguishes themselves.
Furthermore, an educated noble disciple has someone liable to sickness … death … ending … perishing.

These are the five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
Sorrowing and lamenting
doesn’t do even a little bit of good.
When they know that you’re sad,
your enemies are encouraged.
When an astute person doesn’t waver in the face of adversity,
as they’re able to assess what’s beneficial,
their enemies suffer,
seeing that their normal expression doesn’t change.
Chants, recitations, fine sayings,
charity or traditions:
if by means of any such things you benefit,
then by all means keep doing them.
But if you understand that ‘this good thing
can’t be had by me or by anyone else’,
you should accept it without sorrowing, thinking:
‘The karma is strong. What can I do now?’”

I say that this person is like the warrior who can prevail over a cloud of dust and a banner’s crest and turmoil, but is killed or injured when blows are struck.
Some people are like that.
This is the fourth person similar to a warrior found among the monks.
Furthermore, one monk can prevail over a cloud of dust and a banner’s crest and turmoil, and being struck. He wins victory in battle, establishing himself as foremost in battle.
What is his ‘victory in battle’?
It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, when a female comes up to him. She sits right by him, lies down, or embraces him.
But he disentangles and frees himself, and goes wherever he wants.
He frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.
Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down cross-legged, with his body straight, and establishes his mindfulness right there.
Giving up desire for the world, he meditates with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire.
Giving up ill will and malevolence, he meditates with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.
Giving up dullness and drowsiness, he meditates with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.
Giving up restlessness and remorse, he meditates without restlessness, his mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.
Giving up doubt, he meditates having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.
He gives up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption …
second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
When his mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.
He truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
He truly understands: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.
Knowing and seeing like this, his mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
When it is freed, he knows it is freed.
He understands: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
This is his ‘victory in battle’.
I say that this person is like the warrior who can prevail over a cloud of dust and a banner’s crest and turmoil and being struck. He wins victory in battle, establishing himself as foremost in battle.
Some people are like that.
This is the fifth person similar to a warrior found among the monks.

With King Muṇḍa
With Nārada
At one time Venerable Nārada was staying near Pāṭaliputta, in the Chicken Monastery.
Now at that time King Muṇḍa’s dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā had just passed away.
And since that time, the king did not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or apply himself to his work.
Day and night he brooded over Queen Bhaddā’s corpse.
Then King Muṇḍa addressed his treasurer, Piyaka,
“So, my good Piyaka, please place Queen Bhaddā’s corpse in an iron case filled with oil. Then close it up with another case, so that we can view Queen Bhaddā’s body even longer.”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Piyaka the treasurer, and he did as the king instructed.
Then it occurred to Piyaka,
“King Muṇḍa’s dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā has passed away.
Since then the king does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or apply himself to his work.
Day and night he broods over Queen Bhaddā’s corpse.
Now, what ascetic or brahmin might the king pay homage to, whose teaching could help the king give up sorrow’s arrow?”
Then it occurred to Piyaka,
“This Venerable Nārada is staying in the Chicken Monastery at Pāṭaliputta.
He has this good reputation:
‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’
What if King Muṇḍa was to pay homage to Venerable Nārada? Hopefully when he hears Nārada’s teaching, the king could give up sorrow’s arrow.”
Then Piyaka went to the king and said to him,
“Sire, this Venerable Nārada is staying in the Chicken Monastery at Pāṭaliputta.
He has this good reputation:
‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’
What if Your Majesty was to pay homage to Venerable Nārada? Hopefully when you hear Nārada’s teaching, you could give up sorrow’s arrow.”
“Well then, my good Piyaka, let Nārada know.
For how could one such as I presume to visit an ascetic or brahmin in my realm without first letting them know?”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Piyaka the treasurer.
He went to Nārada, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, King Muṇḍa’s dear and beloved Queen Bhaddā has passed away.
And since she passed away, the king has not bathed, anointed himself, eaten his meals, or got his business done.
Day and night he broods over Queen Bhaddā’s corpse.
Sir, please teach the king so that, when he hears your teaching, he can give up sorrow’s arrow.”
“Please, Piyaka, let the king come when he likes.”
Then Piyaka got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Venerable Nārada, keeping him on his right, before going to the king and saying,
“Sire, the request for an audience with Venerable Nārada has been granted.
Please, Your Majesty, go at your convenience.”
“Well then, my good Piyaka, harness the finest chariots.”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Piyaka the treasurer. He did so, then told the king:
“Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.
Please, Your Majesty, go at your convenience.”
Then King Muṇḍa mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp to see Venerable Nārada at the Chicken Monastery.
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.
Then the king went up to Nārada, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Then Nārada said to him:
“Great king, there are five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
What five?
That someone liable to old age should not grow old. …
That someone liable to sickness should not get sick. … That someone liable to death should not die. … That someone liable to ending should not end. … That someone liable to perishing should not perish. …
An uneducated ordinary person has someone liable to old age who grows old.
But they don’t reflect on old age:
‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to old age who grows old. For all sentient beings have someone liable to old age who grows old, as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn.
If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to old age grows old, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
This is called
an uneducated ordinary person struck by sorrow’s poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves.
Furthermore, an uneducated ordinary person has someone liable to sickness … death … ending … perishing.
But they don’t reflect on perishing:
‘It’s not just me who has someone liable to perishing who perishes. For all sentient beings have someone liable to perishing who perishes, as long as sentient beings come and go, pass away and are reborn.
If I were to sorrow and wail and lament, beating my breast and falling into confusion, just because someone liable to perishing perishes, I’d lose my appetite and my physical appearance would deteriorate. My work wouldn’t get done, my enemies would be encouraged, and my friends would be dispirited.’
And so, when someone liable to perishing perishes, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
This is called
an uneducated ordinary person struck by sorrow’s poisoned arrow, who only mortifies themselves.
An educated noble disciple has someone liable to old age who grows old.
So they reflect on old age:

And so, when someone liable to old age grows old, they don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
This is called
an educated noble disciple who has drawn out sorrow’s poisoned arrow, struck by which uneducated ordinary people only mortify themselves.
Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only extinguishes themselves.
Furthermore, an educated noble disciple has someone liable to sickness … death … ending … perishing.

Sorrowless, free of thorns, that noble disciple only extinguishes themselves.
These are the five things that cannot be had by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
Sorrowing and lamenting
doesn’t do even a little bit of good.
When they know that you’re sad,
your enemies are encouraged.
When an astute person doesn’t waver in the face of adversity,
as they’re able to assess what’s beneficial,
their enemies suffer,
seeing that their normal expression doesn’t change.
Chants, recitations, fine sayings,
charity or traditions:
if by means of any such things you benefit,
then by all means keep doing them.
But if you understand that ‘this good thing
can’t be had by me or by anyone else’,
you should accept it without sorrowing, thinking:
‘The karma is strong. What can I do now?’”
When he said this, King Muṇḍa said to Venerable Nārada,
“Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?”
“Great king, this exposition of the teaching is called ‘Pulling Out Sorrow’s Arrow’.”
“Indeed, sir, this is the pulling out of sorrow’s arrow!
Hearing this exposition of the teaching, I’ve given up sorrow’s arrow.”
Then King Muṇḍa addressed his treasurer, Piyaka,
“Well then, my good Piyaka, cremate Queen Bhaddā’s corpse and build a monument.
From this day forth, I will bathe, anoint myself, eat my meals, and apply myself to my work.”

Powers of a Trainee

So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, there are these five powers of a trainee.
What five?
The powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.
These are the five powers of a trainee.
So you should train like this:
‘We will have the trainee’s powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.’
That’s how you should train.”
That is what the Buddha said.

Brahmins
With Kāraṇapālī
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
Now at that time the brahmin Kāraṇapālī was working for the Licchavis.
He saw the brahmin Piṅgiyānī coming off in the distance
and said to him,
“So, Piṅgiyānī, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”
“I’m coming, my good man, from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”
“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom?
Do you think he’s astute?”
“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom?
You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.”
“Master Piṅgiyānī praises the ascetic Gotama with magnificent praise indeed.”
“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama?
He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans.”
“But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama?”
“Suppose a person was completely satisfied by the best tasting food. They wouldn’t be attracted to anything that tasted inferior.
In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
then you’re not attracted to the doctrines of the various ascetics and brahmins.
Suppose a person who was weak with hunger was to obtain a honey-cake.
Wherever they taste it, they would enjoy a sweet, delicious flavor.
In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
then you get a sense of uplift, a confidence of the heart.
Suppose a person were to obtain a piece of sandalwood,
whether yellow or red.
Wherever they smelled it—
whether at the root, the middle, or the top—
they’d enjoy a delicious fragrance.
In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
then you become filled with joy and happiness.
Suppose there was a person who was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
A good doctor would cure them on the spot.
In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
then you make an end of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful.
Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched.
They’d plunge into the lotus pond to bathe and drink. And all their stress, weariness, and heat exhaustion would die down.
In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—
whatever it may be, whether statements, songs, discussions, or amazing stories—
then all your stress, weariness, and exhaustion die down.”
When this was said, the brahmin Kāraṇapālī got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:
“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
Excellent, Master Piṅgiyānī! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Piṅgiyānī has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Piṅgiyānī remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

They live with energy roused up. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.

With Nāgita
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala.
He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard:
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
Then, when the night had passed, they took many different foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket.
Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant.
Then the Buddha said to Nāgita,
“Nāgita, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”
“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many different foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.”
“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me.
There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.
Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.”
“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent!
Now is the time for the Buddha to relent.
Wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country.
It’s like when it rains heavily and the water flows downhill.
In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country.
Why is that?
Because of the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.”
“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me.
There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.

What you eat, drink, chew, and taste ends up as excrement and urine.
This is its outcome.
When loved ones decay and perish, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress arise.

When you pursue meditation on the feature of ugliness, revulsion at the feature of beauty becomes stabilized.

Then those Licchavis sent a man out on to the road, saying,
“Mister, please tell us when you see the Buddha.”
That man saw the Buddha coming off in the distance.
He went to the Licchavis and said,
“Sirs, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is coming.
Please go at your convenience.”
Then those Licchavis went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
“Please go to the Sārandada shrine, out of compassion.”
The Buddha consented in silence.
Then the Buddha went up to the Sārandada shrine, where he sat on the seat spread out, and said to the Licchavis,
“Licchavis, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”
“Well, Master Gotama, this discussion came up among us while we were sitting together:
‘The appearance of five treasures is rare in the world. …’”
“You Licchavis are so fixated on sensual pleasures, that’s the only discussion that came up!

Accusation
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:
“Reverends, a mendicant who wants to accuse another should first establish five things in themselves.
What five?
I will speak at the right time, not at the wrong time.
I will speak truthfully, not falsely.
I will speak gently, not harshly.
I will speak beneficially, not harmfully.
I will speak lovingly, not from secret hate.
A mendicant who wants to accuse another should first establish these five things in themselves.
Take a case where I see a certain person being accused at the wrong time, not being disturbed at the right time. They’re accused falsely, not disturbed truthfully. They’re accused harshly, not disturbed gently. They’re accused harmfully, not disturbed beneficially. They’re accused with secret hate, not disturbed lovingly.
The mendicant who is accused improperly should be reassured in five ways.
‘Venerable, you were accused at the wrong time, not at the right time. There’s no need for you to feel remorse.
You were accused falsely, not truthfully. …
You were accused harshly, not gently. …
You were accused harmfully, not beneficially. …
You were accused with secret hate, not lovingly. There’s no need for you to feel remorse.’
A mendicant who is accused improperly should be reassured in these five ways.

You made an accusation harmfully, not beneficially. …
You made an accusation with secret hate, not lovingly. There’s a reason for you to feel remorse.’
The mendicant who makes improper accusations should be chastened in these five ways.
Why is that?
So that another mendicant wouldn’t think to make a false accusation.
Take a case where I see a certain person being accused at the right time, not being disturbed at the wrong time. They’re accused truthfully, not disturbed falsely. They’re accused gently, not disturbed harshly. They’re accused beneficially, not disturbed harmfully. They’re accused lovingly, not disturbed with secret hate.

Why is that?
So that another mendicant would think to make a true accusation.
A person who is accused should ground themselves in two things:
truth and an even temper.
Even if others accuse me—at the right time or the wrong time, truthfully or falsely, gently or harshly, beneficially or harmfully, lovingly or with secret hate—I will still ground myself in two things:
truth and an even temper.
If I know that
that quality is found in me, I will tell them that it is.
If I know that
that quality is not found in me, I will tell them that it is not.”
“Even when you speak like this, Sāriputta, there are still some foolish people here who do not respectfully take it up.”
“Sir, there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not dedicated to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and stupid. When I speak to them like this, they don’t respectfully take it up.

“Sāriputta, those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood … Leave them be.

Wealth
“Mendicants, there are these five kinds of wealth.
What five?
The wealth of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.
And what is the wealth of faith?
It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
This is called the wealth of faith.
And what is the wealth of ethics?
It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
This is called the wealth of ethics.
And what is the wealth of learning?
It’s when a noble disciple is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
This is called the wealth of learning.
And what is the wealth of generosity?
It’s when a noble disciple lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
This is called the wealth of generosity.
And what is the wealth of wisdom?
It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
This is called the wealth of wisdom.
These are the five kinds of wealth.
Whoever has faith in the Realized One,
unwavering and well grounded;
whose ethical conduct is good,
praised and loved by the noble ones;
who has confidence in the Saṅgha,
and correct view:
they’re said to be prosperous,
their life is not in vain.
So let the wise devote themselves
to faith, ethical behavior,
confidence, and insight into the teaching,

“Mendicants, a mendicant with six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
It’s a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.
They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.
They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,
and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’.
They understand mind with hate …
mind without hate …
mind with delusion …
mind without delusion …
constricted mind …
scattered mind …
expansive mind …
unexpansive mind …
mind that is not supreme …
mind that is supreme …
mind immersed in samādhi …
mind not immersed in samādhi …
freed mind …
They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.
They recollect many kinds of past lives.
That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds:
‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
A mendicant with these six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”

Respect for the Teacher, for the teaching, for the Saṅgha, for the training, for conscience, and for prudence.
These six things don’t lead to the decline of a mendicant.’
That is what that deity said.
Then he bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there.
Respect for the Teacher and the teaching,

reverential and respectful,

At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.
But do you develop mindfulness of death?”
When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I develop mindfulness of death.”
“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
“In this case, sir, I think:
‘Oh, if I’d only live for another day and night, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
“In this case, sir, I think:
‘Oh, if I’d only live for another day, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’

Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
“In this case, sir, I think:
‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to eat a meal of alms-food, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
“In this case, sir, I think:
‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
“In this case, sir, I think:
‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
Another mendicant said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”
“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”
“In this case, sir, I think:
‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’
That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”
When this was said, the Buddha said to those mendicants:
“As to the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing
to live for a day and night …
or to live for a day …
or to live as long as it takes to eat a meal of alms-food …
or to live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls—
these are called mendicants who live negligently. They slackly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.
But as to the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing
to live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful …
or to live as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out—
these are called mendicants who live diligently. They keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.
So you should train like this:
‘We will live diligently. We will keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.’
That’s how you should train.”

The Great Chapter
With Soṇa
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Now at that time Venerable Soṇa was staying near Rājagaha in the Cool Wood.
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“I am one of the Buddha’s most energetic disciples.
Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make merit.
Why don’t I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?”
Then the Buddha knew what Venerable Soṇa was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Vulture’s Peak and reappeared in the Cool Wood in front of Soṇa,
and sat on the seat spread out.
Soṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“Soṇa, as you were in private retreat didn’t this thought come to your mind:
‘I am one of the Buddha’s most energetic disciples.
Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make merit.
Why don’t I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?’”
“Yes, sir.”
“What do you think, Soṇa?
When you were still a layman, weren’t you a good harp player?”
“Yes, sir.”
“When your harp’s strings were tuned too tight, was it resonant and playable?”
“No, sir.”
“When your harp’s strings were tuned too slack, was it resonant and playable?”
“No, sir.”
“But when your harp’s strings were tuned neither too tight nor too slack, but fixed at an even tension, was it resonant and playable?”
“Yes, sir.”
“In the same way, Soṇa, when energy is too forceful it leads to restlessness. When energy is too slack it leads to laziness.
So, Soṇa, you should apply yourself to energy and serenity, find a balance of the faculties, and learn the pattern of this situation.”
“Yes, sir,” Soṇa replied.
After advising Soṇa like this, the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Cool Wood and reappeared on the Vulture’s Peak.
After some time Soṇa applied himself to energy and serenity, found a balance of the faculties, and learned the pattern of this situation.
Then Soṇa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected.
Then, when Soṇa had attained perfection, he thought,
“Why don’t I go to the Buddha and declare my enlightenment in his presence?”
Then Soṇa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is dedicated to six things.
They are dedicated to renunciation, seclusion, kindness, the ending of craving, the ending of grasping, and mental clarity.
It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks:
‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to renunciation solely out of mere faith.’
But it should not be seen like this.
A mendicant with defilements ended does not see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement. They’re dedicated to renunciation because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.
It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks:
‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to seclusion because they enjoy possessions, honor, and popularity.’
But it should not be seen like this. …
It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks:
‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to kindness because they believe that adhering to precepts and observances is the most important thing.’
But it should not be seen like this. …
They’re dedicated to the ending of craving because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.
They’re dedicated to the ending of grasping because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.
They’re dedicated to clarity of mind because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.
When a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t overcome their mind.
The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance.
Even if compelling sounds …
and thoughts come into the range of the mind they don’t overcome the mind.
The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance.
Suppose there was a mountain that was one solid mass of rock, without cracks or holes.
Even if violent storms were to blow up out of the east, the west, the north, and the south,
they couldn’t make it shake or rock or tremble.
In the same way, when a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t overcome their mind. …
The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance.
When you’re dedicated to renunciation
and seclusion of the heart;
when you’re dedicated to kindness
and the end of grasping;
when you’re dedicated to the ending of craving
and clarity of heart;
and you’ve seen the arising of the senses,
your mind is rightly freed.
For that one, rightly freed,
a mendicant with peaceful mind,
there’s nothing to be improved,
and nothing more to do.
As the wind cannot stir
a solid mass of rock,
so too sights, tastes, sounds,
smells, and touches—the lot—
and thoughts, whether liked or disliked,
don’t disturb the poised one.
Their mind is steady and free
as they observe disappearance.”

Venerable Mahācunda said this:
“Take a case where mendicants who practice discernment of principles rebuke mendicants who practice absorption meditation:
‘They say, ‘We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!’ And they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.
Why do they practice absorption meditation? In what way do they practice absorption meditation? How do they practice absorption meditation?’
In this case the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
Now, take a case where mendicants who practice absorption meditation rebuke mendicants who practice discernment of principles:
‘They say, “We practice discernment of principles! We practice discernment of principles!” But they’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.
Why do they practice discernment of principles? In what way do they practice discernment of principles? How do they practice discernment of principles?’
In this case the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.
Now, take a case where mendicants who practice discernment of principles praise only others like them, not mendicants who practice absorption meditation.

I do not see a single other person concerning whom I have made a declaration about after giving such wholehearted deliberation as Devadatta.
As long as I saw even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta
I did not declare that he was
going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.
But when I saw that there was not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta
I declared that he was
going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.
Suppose there was a sewer deeper than a man’s height, full to the brim with feces,
and someone was sunk into it over their head.
Then along comes a person who wants to help make them safe, who wants to lift them out of that sewer.
But circling all around the sewer they couldn’t see even a fraction of a hair’s tip on that person that was not smeared with feces.
In the same way, when I saw that there was not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta
I declared that he was
going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.
Ānanda, if only you would all listen to the Realized One’s analysis of the knowledges of the faculties of individuals.”
“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!
Let the Buddha analyze the faculties of persons.
The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Ānanda, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:
‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’
After some time I comprehend their mind and understand:
‘The skillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the unskillful qualities are still present.
Nevertheless, their skillful root is unbroken, and from that the skillful will appear.
So this person is not liable to decline in the future.’
Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. They’re sown in a well-prepared, productive field.
Wouldn’t you know that those seeds would grow, increase, and mature?”
“Yes, sir.”
“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand …
This person is not liable to decline in the future …
This is how another individual is known to the Realized One by comprehending their mind.
And this is how the Realized One knows a person’s faculties by comprehending their mind.
And this is how the Realized One knows the future origination of a person’s qualities by comprehending their mind.

And of the second three people, one is liable to decline, one is not liable to decline, and one is bound to become extinguished.”

Unsurpassable
“Mendicants, these six things are unsurpassable.
The unsurpassable seeing, listening, acquisition, training, service, and recollection.
And what is the unsurpassable seeing?
Some people go to see an elephant-treasure, a horse-treasure, a jewel-treasure, or a diverse spectrum of sights; or ascetics and brahmins of wrong view and wrong practice.
There is such a seeing, I don’t deny it.
That seeing is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
The unsurpassable seeing is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, goes to see a Realized One or their disciple. This is in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
This is called the unsurpassable seeing.
Such is the unsurpassable seeing.
But what of the unsurpassable hearing?

Some people recollect a child, a wife, wealth, or a diverse spectrum of things; or they recollect an ascetic or brahmin of wrong view and wrong practice.
There is such recollection, I don’t deny it.
That recollection is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

connected with seclusion,

They rejoice in diligence,

Penetrative
“Mendicants, I will teach you a penetrative exposition of the teaching.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, what is the penetrative exposition of the teaching?
Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
Deeds should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.
Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.
‘Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said,
but why did I say it?
There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Sounds known by the ear …
Smells known by the nose …
Tastes known by the tongue …
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
However, these are not sensual pleasures. In the training of the Noble One they’re called ‘kinds of sensual stimulation’.
Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure.
The world’s pretty things aren’t sensual pleasures.
Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure.
The world’s pretty things stay just as they are,
but a wise one removes desire for them.
And what is the source of sensual pleasures?
Contact is their source.
And what is the diversity of sensual pleasures?
The sensual desire for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches are all different.
This is called the diversity of sensual pleasures.
And what is the result of sensual pleasures?
When one who desires sensual pleasures creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—this is called the result of sensual pleasures.
And what is the cessation of sensual pleasures?
When contact ceases, sensual pleasures cease.
The practice that leads to the cessation of sensual pleasures is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
When a noble disciple understands sensual pleasures in this way—and understands their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation—they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of sensual pleasures.
‘Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are these three feelings:
pleasant, painful, and neutral.

There are material pleasant feelings, spiritual pleasant feelings, material painful feelings, spiritual painful feelings, material neutral feelings, and spiritual neutral feelings.
This is called the diversity of feelings.
And what is the result of feelings?
When one who feels creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—
this is called the result of feelings.

perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts.
And what is the source of perceptions?
Contact is their source.
And what is the diversity of perceptions?
The perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts are all different.
This is called the diversity of perceptions.
And what is the result of perceptions?
Communication is the result of perception, I say.
You communicate something in whatever manner you perceive it, saying ‘That’s what I perceived.’
This is called the result of perceptions.
And what is the cessation of perception?
When contact ceases, perception ceases.
The practice that leads to the cessation of perceptions is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:

‘Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are these three defilements:
the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
And what is the source of defilements?
Ignorance is the source of defilements.
And what is the diversity of defilements?
There are defilements that lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human world, and the world of the gods.
This is called the diversity of defilements.
And what is the result of defilements?
When one who is ignorant creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—this is called the result of defilements.
And what is the cessation of defilements?
When ignorance ceases, defilements cease.
The practice that leads to the cessation of defilements is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:

It is intention that I call deeds.
For after making a choice one acts
by way of body, speech, and mind.
And what is the source of deeds?
Contact is their source.
And what is the diversity of deeds?
There are deeds that lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human world, and the world of the gods.
This is called the diversity of deeds.
And what is the result of deeds?
The result of deeds is threefold, I say:
in this very life, on rebirth in the next life, or at some later time.
This is called the result of deeds.
And what is the cessation of deeds?
When contact ceases, deeds cease.
The practice that leads to the cessation of deeds is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
When a noble disciple understands deeds in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of deeds.

That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.
And what is the source of suffering?
Craving is the source of suffering.
And what is the diversity of suffering?
There is suffering that is severe, mild, slow to fade, and quick to fade.
This is called the diversity of suffering.
And what is the result of suffering?
It’s when someone who is overcome and overwhelmed by suffering sorrows and wails and laments, beating their breast and falling into confusion. Or else, overcome by that suffering, they begin an external search, wondering:
‘Who knows one or two phrases to stop this suffering?’
The result of suffering is either confusion or a search, I say.
This is called the result of suffering.
And what is the cessation of suffering?
When craving ceases, suffering ceases.
The practice that leads to the cessation of suffering is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
When a noble disciple understands suffering in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of suffering.

Second: Proper Occasions
At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
Then after the meal, on their return from alms-round, this discussion came up among them while sitting together in the pavilion.
“Reverends, how many occasions are there for going to see an esteemed mendicant?”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
“Reverends, there’s a time after an esteemed mendicant’s meal when they return from alms-round. Having washed their feet they sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. That is the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed mendicant.”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to that mendicant:
“Reverend, that’s not the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed mendicant.
For at that time the fatigue from walking and from eating has not faded away.
There’s a time late in the afternoon when an esteemed mendicant comes out of retreat. They sit in the shade of their porch cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. That is the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed mendicant.”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to that mendicant:
“Reverend, that’s not the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed mendicant.
For at that time they are still practicing the same meditation subject as a foundation of immersion that they focused on during the day.
There’s a time when an esteemed mendicant has risen at the crack of dawn. They sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. That is the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed mendicant.”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to that mendicant:
“Reverend, that’s not the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed mendicant.
For at that time their body is full of vitality and they find it easy to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas.”
When this was said, Venerable Mahākaccāna said to those senior mendicants:
“Reverends, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘Mendicants, there are six occasions for going to see an esteemed mendicant.
Firstly, there’s a time when a mendicant’s heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. On that occasion they should go to an esteemed mendicant and say:
“My heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and I don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.
Venerable, please teach me how to give up sensual desire.”
Then that esteemed mendicant teaches them how to give up sensual desire.
This is the first occasion for going to see an esteemed mendicant.
Furthermore, there’s a time when a mendicant’s heart is overcome and mired in ill will …
dullness and drowsiness …
restlessness and remorse …
Furthermore, there’s a time when a mendicant doesn’t understand what kind of meditation they need to focus on in order to end the defilements in the present life. On that occasion they should go to an esteemed mendicant and say,
“I don’t understand what kind of meditation to focus on in order to end the defilements in the present life.
Venerable, please teach me how to end the defilements.”
Then that esteemed mendicant teaches them how to end the defilements.

“Sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa describes six classes of rebirth:
black, blue, red, yellow, white, and ultimate white.
The black class of rebirth consists of slaughterers of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, hunters or fishers, bandits, executioners, butchers of cattle, jailers, and any others with a cruel livelihood.
The blue class of rebirth consists of mendicants who live on thorns, and any others who teach the efficacy of deeds and action.
The red class of rebirth consists of the Jain ascetics who wear one cloth.
The yellow class of rebirth consists of the lay people dressed in white who are disciples of the naked ascetics.
The white class of rebirth consists of male and female Ājīvaka ascetics.
And the ultimate white class of rebirth consists of Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and Makkhali Gosāla.
These are the six classes of rebirth that Pūraṇa Kassapa describes.”
“But Ānanda, did the whole world authorize Pūraṇa Kassapa to describe these six classes of rebirth?”
“No, sir.”
“It’s as if they were to force a steak on a poor, penniless person, telling them they must eat it and then pay for it.
In the same way, Pūraṇa Kassapa has described these six classes of rebirth without the consent of those ascetics and brahmins. And he has done so in a foolish, incompetent, unskilled way, lacking common sense.
I, however, also describe six classes of rebirth.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And what, Ānanda, are the six classes of rebirth?
Someone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result.
Someone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result.
Someone born into a dark class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.
Someone born into a bright class gives rise to a dark result.
Someone born into a bright class gives rise to a bright result.
Someone born into a bright class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.
And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a dark result?
It’s when someone is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find.
And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, chronically ill—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.
And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
That’s how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result.
And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a bright result?
It’s when some person is reborn in a low family …
But they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
That’s how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result.
And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright?
It’s when some person is reborn in a low family …
They shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
They give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. They firmly establish their mind in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They truly develop the seven awakening factors. And then they give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.
That’s how someone born in a dark class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.
And how does someone born into a bright class give rise to a dark result?
It’s when some person is reborn in an eminent family—a well-to-do family of aristocrats, brahmins, or householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain.
And they’re attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.
But they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
That’s how someone born into a bright class gives rise to a dark result.

A Gift With Six Factors
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, was preparing a religious donation for the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
The Buddha saw her doing this, with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,
and he addressed the mendicants:
“This Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, is preparing a religious donation for the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
And how does a religious donation have six factors?
Three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients.
What three factors apply to the donor?
It’s when a donor is in a good mood before giving, while giving they feel confident, and after giving they’re uplifted.
These three factors apply to the donor.
What three factors apply to the recipients?
It’s when the recipients are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them.
These three factors apply to the recipients.
Thus three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients.
That’s how a religious donation has six factors.
It’s not easy to grasp the merit of such an offering by saying that
this is the extent of their overflowing merit, overflowing goodness that nurtures happiness and is conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. And it leads to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.
It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.
It’s like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It’s not easy to say
how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are.
It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water.
In the same way, it’s not easy to grasp the merit of such an offering …
A good mood before giving,
confidence while giving,
feeling uplifted after giving:
this is the perfect sacrifice.
Free of greed, free of hate,
free of delusion, undefiled;
this is the field for the perfect sacrifice,
the disciplined spiritual practitioners.
After rinsing,
you give with your own hands.
This sacrifice is very fruitful
for both yourself and others.
When an intelligent, faithful person,
sacrifices like this, with a mind of letting go,
that astute one is reborn
in a happy, pleasing world.”

Topics for Recollection
“Mendicants, there are these six topics for recollection.
Firstly, a noble disciple recollects the Realized One:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
When a noble disciple recollects the Realized One their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion.
At that time their mind is unswerving. They’ve left behind greed; they’re free of it and have risen above it.
‘Greed’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
Relying on this some sentient beings are purified.
Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the teaching:
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
When a noble disciple recollects the teaching their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. …
Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha:
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
When a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. …
Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own ethical precepts, which are unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
When a noble disciple recollects their ethical precepts their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. …
Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own generosity:
‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate!
Among people full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.’
Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the deities:
‘There are the Gods of the Four Great Kings, the Gods of the Thirty-Three, the Gods of Yama, the Joyful Gods, the Gods Who Love to Create, the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others, the Gods of Brahmā’s Host, and gods even higher than these.
When those deities passed away from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’
When a noble disciple recollects the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and the deities their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion.

One’s Own Volition
Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, this is my doctrine and view:
One does not act of one’s own volition, nor does one act of another’s volition.”
“Well, brahmin, I’ve never seen or heard of anyone holding such a doctrine or view.
How on earth can someone who comes and goes on his own say that
one does not act of one’s own volition, nor does one act of another’s volition?

“Yes, sir.”
“Since this is so, do we find sentient beings who initiate activity?”
“Yes, sir.”

No-one guarded the fruit, yet no-one damaged another’s fruits.
Then a certain person ate as much as he liked of the fruit, then broke off a branch and left.
Then the deity haunting the royal banyan tree thought,
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
How wicked this person is, to eat as much as they like, then break off a branch and leave! Why don’t I make sure that the royal banyan tree gives no fruit in future?’
Then the royal banyan tree gave no more fruit.
Then King Koravya went up to Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him,
‘Please sir, you should know that the royal banyan tree called Well Planted gives no fruit.’
Then Sakka used his psychic powers to will that a violent storm come. And it felled and uprooted the royal banyan tree.
Then the deity haunting the tree stood to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face.
Then Sakka went up to that deity, and said,
‘Why, god, are you standing to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face?’
‘Because, my good sir, a violent storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’
‘Well, did you stand by your tree’s duty when the storm came?’
‘But my good sir, how does a tree stand by its duty?’
‘It’s when those who need the tree’s roots, bark, leaves, flowers, or fruit take what they need.
Yet the deity is not displeased or upset because of this.
This is how a tree stands by its duty.’
‘I was not standing by a tree’s duty when the storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’
‘God, if you were to stand by a tree’s duty, your home may be as it was before.’
‘I will stand by a tree’s duty! May my home be as it was before!’
Then Sakka used his psychic power to will that a violent storm come. And it raised up that mighty banyan tree and the bark of the roots was healed.
In the same way, Brahmin Dhammika, were you standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished you from all seven of the monasteries in your native land?”
“But sir, how do I stand by an ascetic’s duty?”
“When someone abuses, annoys, or argues with an ascetic, the ascetic doesn’t abuse, annoy, or argue back at them.
That’s how an ascetic stands by an ascetic’s duty.”
“I was not standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished me from all seven of the monasteries in my native land.”
“Once upon a time, there was a Teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.
He had many hundreds of disciples.
He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā.
Those lacking confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
Those full of confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
Once upon a time there was a teacher called Mūgapakkha …
Kuddālaka …
Hatthipāla …
Jotipāla. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.
He had many hundreds of disciples.
He taught them the way to rebirth in the company of Brahmā.
Those lacking confidence in Jotipāla were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
Those full of confidence in Jotipāla were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
What do you think, Brahmin Dhammika?
If someone with malicious intent were to abuse and insult these six teachers with their hundreds of followers, would they not make much bad karma?”
“Yes, sir.”
“They would indeed.
But someone who abuses and insults a single person accomplished in view with malicious intent makes even more bad karma.
Why is that?
Brahmin Dhammika, I say that any injury done by those outside of the Buddhist community does not compare with what is done to one’s own spiritual companions.
So you should train like this:
‘We will have no malicious intent for those who we want to have as our spiritual companions.’
That is how you should train.
Sunetta and Mūgapakkha,
and Aranemi the brahmin,
Hatthipāla the student,
and Kuddālaka were Teachers.
And Jotipāla Govinda
was priest for seven kings.
These six famous teachers,
harmless ones of the past,
were free of carrion-stench, compassionate,
gone beyond the fetter of sensuality.
Detached from sensual desire,
they were reborn in the Brahmā realm.
Many hundreds of
their disciples were also
free of carrion-stench, compassionate,
gone beyond the fetter of sensuality.
Detached from sensual desire,
they were reborn in the Brahmā realm.
A man who insults
with malicious intent
these outside hermits,
free of desire, immersed in samādhi,
makes much bad karma.
But the man who insults
with malicious intent
a single person accomplished in view,
a mendicant disciple of the Buddha,
makes even more bad karma.
You shouldn’t attack a holy person,
who has given up the grounds for views.
This person is called
the seventh of the noble Saṅgha.
They’re not free of desire for sensual pleasures,
and their faculties are still immature:
faith, mindfulness, and energy,
serenity and discernment.
If you attack such a mendicant,
you first hurt yourself.
Having hurt yourself,
you harm the other.
But if you protect yourself,
the other is also protected.
So you should protect yourself.
An astute person is always uninjured.”

At Sāma Village
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans near the little village of Sāma, by a lotus pond.
Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire lotus pond, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, three qualities lead to the decline of a mendicant.
What three?
Relishing work, talk, and sleep.
These three qualities lead to the decline of a mendicant.”
That’s what that deity said,
and the teacher approved.
Then that deity, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.
Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened, adding:
“It’s unfortunate for those of you who even the deities know are declining in skillful qualities.
I will teach you three more qualities that lead to decline.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And what, mendicants, are three qualities that lead to decline?
Enjoyment of company, being hard to admonish, and having bad friends.
These three qualities lead to decline.
Whether in the past, future, or present, all those who decline in skillful qualities do so because of these six qualities.”

Defilements
“Mendicants, a mendicant with six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
It’s a mendicant who, by restraint, has given up the defilements that should be given up by restraint.
By using, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by using.
By enduring, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by enduring.
By avoiding, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by avoiding.
By getting rid, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by getting rid.
By developing, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by developing.
And what are the defilements that should be given up by restraint?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, lives restraining the eye faculty.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the eye faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.
Reflecting properly, they live restraining the ear faculty …
the nose faculty …
the tongue faculty …
the body faculty …
the mind faculty.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the mind faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by restraint.
And what are the defilements that should be given up by using?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, makes use of robes:
‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts.’
Reflecting properly, they make use of almsfood:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
Reflecting properly, they make use of lodgings:
‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.’
Reflecting properly, they make use of medicines and supplies for the sick:
‘Only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health.’
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without using these things do not arise when they are used.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by using.
And what are the defilements that should be given up by enduring?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. They endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without enduring these things do not arise when they are endured.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by enduring.
And what are the defilements that should be given up by avoiding?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild ox, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, thorny ground, a pit, a cliff, a swamp, and a sewer. Reflecting properly, they avoid sitting on inappropriate seats, walking in inappropriate neighborhoods, and mixing with bad friends—whatever sensible spiritual companions would believe to be a bad setting.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without avoiding these things do not arise when they are avoided.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by avoiding.
And what are the defilements that should be given up by getting rid?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, doesn’t tolerate a sensual,
malicious,
or cruel thought that has arisen.
They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without getting rid of these things do not arise when they are gotten rid of.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by getting rid.
And what are the defilements that should be given up by developing?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, develops the awakening factors of mindfulness,
investigation of principles,
tranquility,
immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without developing these things do not arise when they are developed.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by developing.
A mendicant with these six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”

About Dhammika
The Giant
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Ānanda,
“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother for the day’s meditation.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Eastern Monastery.
In the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda,
“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe.
When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself.
Now, at that time King Pasenadi had a giant bull elephant called “White”. It emerged from the eastern gate to the beating and playing of musical instruments.
When people saw it they said,
“The royal giant is so handsome! The royal giant is so good-looking! The royal giant is so lovely! The royal giant has such a huge body!”
When they said this, Venerable Udāyī said to the Buddha,
“Sir, is it only when they see elephants with such a huge, formidable body that people say:
‘A giant, such a giant’? Or do they say it when they see any other creatures with huge, formidable bodies?”
“Udāyī, when they see elephants with such a huge, formidable body people say:
‘A giant, such a giant!’
And also when they see a horse with a huge, formidable body …
When they see a bull with a huge, formidable body …
When they see a snake with a huge, formidable body …
When they see a tree with a huge, formidable body …
And when they see a human being with such a huge, formidable body people say:
‘A giant, such a giant!’
But Udāyī, one who does nothing monstrous by way of body, speech, and mind is who I call a ‘giant’ in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.”
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
How well said this was by the Buddha:
‘But Udāyī, one who does nothing monstrous by way of body, speech, and mind is who I call a “giant” in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.’
And I celebrate the well-spoken words of the Buddha with these verses:
Awakened as a human being,
self-tamed and immersed in samādhi,
following the spiritual path,
he loves peace of mind.
Revered by people,
gone beyond all things,
even the gods revere him;
so I’ve heard from the perfected one.
He has transcended all fetters
and escaped from entanglements.
Delighting to renounce sensual pleasures,
he’s freed like gold from stone.
That giant outshines all,
like the Himalaya beside other mountains.
Of all those named ‘giant’,
he is truly named, supreme.
I’ll extol the giant for you,
for he does nothing monstrous.
Gentleness and harmlessness
are two feet of the giant.
Austerity and celibacy
are his two other feet.
Faith is the giant’s trunk,
and equanimity his white tusks.
Mindfulness is his neck, his head is wisdom—
inquiry and thinking about principles.
His belly is the sacred hearth of the Dhamma,
and his tail is seclusion.
Practicing absorption, enjoying the breath,
he is serene within.
The giant is serene when walking,
the giant is serene when standing,
the giant is serene when lying down,
and when sitting, the giant is serene.
The giant is restrained everywhere:
this is the accomplishment of the giant.
He eats blameless things,
he doesn’t eat blameworthy things.
When he gets food and clothes,
he avoids storing them up.
Having severed all bonds,
fetters large and small,
wherever he goes,
he goes without concern.
A white lotus,
fragrant and delightful,
sprouts in water and grows there,
but water does not stick to it.
Just so the Buddha is born in the world,
and lives in the world,
but the world does not stick to him,
as water does not stick to the lotus.
A great blazing fire
dies down when the fuel runs out.
When the coals have gone out
it’s said to be ‘extinguished’.
This simile is taught by the discerning
to express the meaning clearly.
Great giants will understand
what the giant taught the giant.
Free of greed, free of hate,
free of delusion, undefiled;
the giant, giving up his body,
will become extinguished without defilements.”

With Nāgita
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala.
He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard:
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased; and he explains a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
Then, when the night had passed, they took many different foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket.
Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant.
Then the Buddha said to Nāgita,

Nakula’s Father
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.
Now at that time the householder Nakula’s father was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then the housewife Nakula’s mother said to him:
“Householder, don’t pass away with concerns.
Such concern is suffering,
and it’s criticized by the Buddha.
Householder, you might think:
‘When I’ve gone, the housewife Nakula’s mother won’t be able to provide for the children and keep up the household carpets.’
But you should not see it like this.
I’m skilled at spinning cotton and carding wool.
I’m able to provide for the children and keep up the household carpets.
So householder, don’t pass away with concerns …
Householder, you might think:
‘When I’ve gone, the housewife Nakula’s mother will take another husband.’
But you should not see it like this.
Both you and I know that we have remained celibate while at home for the past sixteen years.
So householder, don’t pass away with concerns …
Householder, you might think:
‘When I’ve gone, the housewife Nakula’s mother won’t want to see the Buddha and his Saṅgha of mendicants.’
But you should not see it like this.
When you’ve gone, I’ll want to see the Buddha and his mendicant Saṅgha even more.
So householder, don’t pass away with concerns …
Householder, you might think:
‘The housewife Nakula’s mother won’t fulfill ethics.’
But you should not see it like this.
I am one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who fulfills their ethics.
Whoever doubts this can go and ask the Buddha. He is staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.
So householder, don’t pass away with concerns …
Householder, you might think:
‘The housewife Nakula’s mother doesn’t have internal serenity of heart.’
But you should not see it like this.
I am one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has internal serenity of heart.
Whoever doubts this can go and ask the Buddha. He is staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.
So householder, don’t pass away with concerns …
Householder, you might think:
‘The housewife Nakula’s mother has not gained a basis, a firm basis, and solace in this teaching and training. She has not gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and gained assurance. And she’s not independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions.’
But you should not see it like this.
I am one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has gained a basis, a firm basis, and solace in this teaching and training. I have gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and gained assurance. And I am independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions.

And then, as Nakula’s mother was giving this advice to Nakula’s father, his illness died down on the spot.
And that’s how Nakula’s father recovered from that illness.
Soon after recovering, leaning on a staff he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him:
“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate,
to have the housewife Nakula’s mother advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion.
She is one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who fulfills their ethics.

Diligence
Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, is there one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come?”
“There is, brahmin.”
“So what is it?”
“Diligence, brahmin, is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come.

With Mahāmoggallāna
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then as Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“Which gods know that they are
stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”
Now, at that time a monk called Tissa had recently passed away and been reborn in a Brahmā realm.
There they knew that
Tissa the Brahmā was very mighty and powerful.
And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.
Tissa saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance,
and said to him,
“Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, my good Moggallāna!
It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.
Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.”
Moggallāna sat down on the seat spread out.
Then Tissa bowed to Moggallāna and sat to one side.
Moggallāna said to him,
“Tissa, which gods know that they are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”
“The gods of the Four Great Kings know this.”
“But do all of them know this?”
“No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them.
Those who lack experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and lack the ethics loved by the noble ones, do not know that they are stream-enterers.
But those who have experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and have the ethics loved by the noble ones, do know that they are stream-enterers.”
“But Tissa, is it only the gods of the Four Great Kings who know that they are stream-enterers, or do the gods of the Thirty-Three …
the Gods of Yama …
the Joyful Gods …
the Gods Who Love to Create …
and the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others know that they are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”
“The gods of these various classes know this.”
“But do all of them know this?”
“No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them.

But those who have experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and have the ethics loved by the noble ones, do know that they are stream-enterers.”
Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Tissa the Brahmā said. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from that Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove.

Second: Mindfulness of Death
At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.
And how is mindfulness of death developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial, to culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless?
As day passes by and night draws close, a mendicant reflects:
‘I might die of many causes.
A snake might bite me, or a scorpion or centipede might sting me.
And if I died from that it would be an obstacle to me.
Or I might stumble off a cliff, or get food poisoning, or suffer a disturbance of bile, phlegm, or piercing winds.
And if I died from that it would stop my practice. ’
That mendicant should reflect:
‘Are there any bad, unskillful qualities that I haven’t given up, which might be an obstacle to me if I die tonight?’
Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that
there are such bad, unskillful qualities. Then in order to give them up they should apply outstanding enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness.
Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In order to extinguish it, you’d apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness.
In the same way, in order to give up those bad, unskillful qualities, that mendicant should apply outstanding enthusiasm …
But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that
there are no such bad, unskillful qualities. Then that mendicant should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.

Take a mendicant who says:

Yet somehow ill will still occupies my mind.’
They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! Don’t say that. Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.
It’s impossible, reverend, it cannot happen that the heart’s release by love has been developed and properly implemented,

Yet somehow the thought of harming still occupies my mind.’
They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! …
For it is the heart’s release by compassion that is the escape from thoughts of harming.’
Take another mendicant who says:
‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by rejoicing. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it.
Yet somehow negativity still occupies my mind.’
They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! …
For it is the heart’s release by rejoicing that is the escape from negativity.’
Take another mendicant who says:
‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by equanimity. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it.
Yet somehow desire still occupies my mind.’
They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! …
For it is the heart’s release by equanimity that is the escape from desire.’
Take another mendicant who says:
‘I’ve developed the signless release of the heart. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it.
Yet somehow my consciousness still follows after signs.’
They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! …
For it is the signless release of the heart that is the escape from all signs.’
Take another mendicant who says:
‘I’m rid of the conceit “I am”. And I don’t regard anything as “I am this”.
Yet somehow the dart of doubt and indecision still occupies my mind.’
They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! Don’t say that. Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.
It’s impossible, reverend, it cannot happen that the conceit “I am” has been done away with, and nothing is regarded as “I am this”,

A Fish Dealer
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
While walking along the road he saw a fish dealer in a certain spot selling fish that he had killed himself.
Seeing this he left the road, sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out,
and addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants, do you see that fish dealer selling fish that he killed himself?”
“Yes, sir.”
“What do you think, mendicants?

“No, sir.”

“It’s incredible, reverends,

How this Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, has found an opening in a confined space; that is, the six topics for recollection. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
Firstly, a noble disciple recollects the Realized One:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
When a noble disciple recollects the Realized One their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion.
At that time their mind is unswerving. They’ve left behind greed; they’re free of it and have risen above it.
‘Greed’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
That noble disciple meditates with a heart just like space, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Relying on this, some sentient beings have the factors for purity.
Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the teaching:
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
When a noble disciple recollects the teaching their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. …
Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha:
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
When a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. …
Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own ethical precepts, which are unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
When a noble disciple recollects their ethical precepts their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. …
Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own generosity:
‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate!
Among people full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.’
When a noble disciple recollects their own generosity their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. …
Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the deities:
‘There are the Gods of the Four Great Kings, the Gods of the Thirty-Three, the Gods of Yama, the Joyful Gods, the Gods Who Love to Create, the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others, the Gods of Brahmā’s Host, and gods even higher than these.
When those deities passed away from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’
When a noble disciple recollects the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and the deities their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion.
At that time their mind is unswerving. They’ve left behind greed; they’re free of it and have risen above it.

Venerable Phagguṇa saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and tried to rise on his cot.
The Buddha said to him,
“It’s all right, Phagguṇa, don’t get up.
There are some seats spread out by others, I will sit there.”
He sat on the seat spread out
and said to Venerable Phagguṇa:
“Phagguṇa, I hope you’re keeping well; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”
“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright.
The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.
The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.
I’m not keeping well.
The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.
I’m not keeping well.
The winds piercing my belly are so severe, it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver.
I’m not keeping well.
The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.
I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright.
The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”
Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Venerable Phagguṇa with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.
Not long after the Buddha left, Venerable Phagguṇa passed away.
At the time of his death, his faculties were bright and clear.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Phagguṇa died.
At the time of his death, his faculties were bright and clear.”
“And why shouldn’t his faculties be bright and clear?
The mendicant Phagguṇa’s mind was not freed from the five lower fetters.
But when he heard that teaching his mind was freed from them.
Ānanda, there are these six benefits to hearing the teaching at the right time and examining the meaning at the right time.
Firstly, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters.
At the time of death they get to see the Realized One.
The Realized One teaches them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
When they hear that teaching their mind is freed from the five lower fetters.
This is the first benefit of listening to the teaching.
Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters.
At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, but they get to see a Realized One’s disciple.
The Realized One’s disciple teaches them Dhamma …
When they hear that teaching their mind is freed from the five lower fetters.
This is the second benefit of listening to the teaching.
Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters.
At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, or to see a Realized One’s disciple.
But they think about and consider the teaching in their heart, examining it with the mind as they learned and memorized it.
As they do so their mind is freed from the five lower fetters.
This is the third benefit of listening to the teaching.
Next, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is freed from the five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments.
At the time of death they get to see the Realized One.
The Realized One teaches them Dhamma …
When they hear that teaching their mind is freed with the supreme ending of attachments.
This is the fourth benefit of listening to the teaching.
Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is freed from the five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments.
At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, but they get to see a Realized One’s disciple.
The Realized One’s disciple teaches them Dhamma …
When they hear that teaching their mind is freed with the supreme ending of attachments.
This is the fifth benefit of listening to the teaching.
Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is freed from the five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments.
At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, or to see a Realized One’s disciple.
But they think about and consider the teaching in their heart, examining it with the mind as they learned and memorized it.
As they do so their mind is freed with the supreme ending of attachments.
This is the sixth benefit of listening to the teaching.
These are the six benefits to hearing the teaching at the right time and examining the meaning at the right time.”

With Ānanda
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Ānanda sat down to one side, and said to Sāriputta:
“Reverend Sāriputta, how does a mendicant get to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before? How do they remember those teachings they have heard? How do they keep rehearsing the teachings they’ve already got to know? And how do they come to understand what they haven’t understood before?”
“Well, Venerable Ānanda, you’re very learned.
Why don’t you clarify this yourself?”
“Well then, Reverend Sāriputta, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” Sāriputta replied.
Ānanda said this:
“Reverend Sāriputta, take a mendicant who memorizes the teaching—
statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.
Then, just as they learned and memorized it, they teach others in detail, make them recite in detail, practice reciting in detail, and think about and consider the teaching in their heart, examining it with the mind.
They enter the rains retreat in a monastery with senior mendicants who are very learned, knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the texts on monastic training, and the outlines.
From time to time they go up to those mendicants and ask them questions:
‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’
Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters.
This is how a mendicant gets to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before. It’s how they remember those teachings they have heard. It’s how they keep rehearsing the teachings they’ve already got to know. And it’s how they come to understand what they haven’t understood before.”
“It’s incredible, reverend, it’s amazing! How well said this was by Venerable Ānanda!
And we will remember Venerable Ānanda as someone who has these six qualities.
For Ānanda memorizes the teaching …
statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.

Unsurpassable
With Udāyī
Then the Buddha said to Udāyī,
“Udāyī, how many topics for recollection are there?”
When he said this, Udāyī kept silent.
And a second time …
and a third time, the Buddha said to him,
“Udāyī, how many topics for recollection are there?”
And a second time and a third time Udāyī kept silent.
Then Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Udāyī,
“Reverend Udāyī, the teacher is addressing you.”
“Reverend Ānanda, I hear the Buddha.
It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives.
That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
This is a topic for recollection.”
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda:
“Ānanda, I know that
this silly man Udāyī is not committed to the higher mind.
Ānanda, how many topics for recollection are there?”
“Sir, there are five topics for recollection.
What five?
Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption.
When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to blissful meditation in this very life.
Furthermore, a mendicant focuses on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day regardless of whether it is night or day.
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.
When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to knowledge and vision.
Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.
‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’
When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to giving up sensual desire.
Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering.
They’d compare it with their own body:
‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’
Or suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures.
They’d compare it with their own body:
‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’
Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews …
A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews …
A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews …
Bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull … White bones, the color of shells … Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile … Bones rotted and crumbled to powder.
They’d compare it with their own body:
‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’
When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to uprooting the conceit ‘I am’.
Furthermore, a mendicant, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to the penetration of many elements.
These are the five topics for recollection.”
“Good, good, Ānanda.
Well then, Ānanda, you should also remember this sixth topic for recollection.
In this case, a mendicant goes out mindfully, returns mindfully, stands mindfully, sits mindfully, lies down mindfully, and applies themselves to work mindfully.
When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to mindfulness and situational awareness.”

At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, descended the Vulture’s Peak together with several mendicants. At a certain spot he saw a large tree trunk,
and he addressed the mendicants,
“Reverends, do you see this large tree trunk?”
“Yes, reverend.”
“If they wanted to, a mendicant with psychic powers who has mastered their mind could determine this tree trunk to be nothing but earth.
Why is that?
Because the earth element exists in the tree trunk. Relying on that a mendicant with psychic powers could determine it to be nothing but earth.
If they wanted to, a mendicant with psychic powers who has mastered their mind could determine this tree trunk to be nothing but water. …
Or they could determine it to be nothing but fire …
Or they could determine it to be nothing but air …
Or they could determine it to be nothing but beautiful …

The Great Chapter
In the Middle
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
Now at that time, after the meal, on return from alms-round, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them,
“Reverends, this was said by the Buddha in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’:
‘The sage has known both ends,
and is not stuck in the middle.
He is a great man, I declare,
he has escaped the seamstress here.’
But what is one end? What’s the second end? What’s the middle? And who is the seamstress?”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
“Contact, reverends, is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the seamstress,
for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another.
That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
“The past, reverends, is one end. The future is the second end. The present is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …
That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
“Pleasant feeling, reverends, is one end. Painful feeling is the second end. Neutral feeling is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …
That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
“Name, reverends, is one end. Form is the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …
That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
“The six interior sense fields, reverends, are one end. The six exterior sense fields are the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress …
That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
“Identity, reverends, is one end. The origin of identity is the second end. The cessation of identity is the middle. And craving is the seamstress,
for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another.
That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.”
When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:
“Each of us has spoken from the heart.
Come, reverends, let’s go to the Buddha, and inform him about this.
As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”
“Yes, reverend,” those senior mendicants replied.
Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. They asked,
“Sir, who has spoken well?”
“Mendicants, you’ve all spoken well in a way. However, this is what I was referring to in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’ when I said:
‘The sage has known both ends,
and is not stuck in the middle.
He is a great man, I declare,
he has escaped the seamstress here.’
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Contact, mendicants, is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the seamstress,
for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another.
That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.”

“Mendicants, isn’t poverty suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
“Yes, sir.”
“When a poor, penniless person falls into debt, isn’t being in debt also suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
“Yes, sir.”
“When a poor person who has fallen into debt agrees to pay interest, isn’t the interest also suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
“Yes, sir.”
“When a poor person who has fallen into debt and agreed to pay interest fails to pay it when it falls due, they get a warning.
Isn’t being warned suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
“Yes, sir.”
“When a poor person fails to pay after getting a warning, they’re prosecuted.
Isn’t being prosecuted suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
“Yes, sir.”
“When a poor person fails to pay after being prosecuted, they’re imprisoned.
Isn’t being imprisoned suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”
“Yes, sir.”
“So mendicants, poverty, debt, interest, warnings, prosecution, and imprisonment are suffering in the world for those who enjoy sensual pleasures.
In the same way, whoever has no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom when it comes to skillful qualities
is called poor and penniless in the training of the Noble One.
Since they have no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, or wisdom when it comes to skillful qualities, they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
This is how they’re in debt, I say.
In order to conceal the bad things they do by way of body, speech, and mind they harbour corrupt wishes.
They wish, plan, speak, and act with the thought: ‘May no-one find me out!’
This is how they pay interest, I say.
Good-hearted spiritual companions say this about them:
‘This venerable acts like this, and behaves like that.’
This is how they’re warned, I say.
When they go to a wilderness, the root of a tree, or an empty hut, they’re beset by remorseful, unskillful thoughts.
This is how they’re prosecuted, I say.
That poor, penniless person has done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re trapped in the prison of hell or the animal realm.
I don’t see a single prison that’s as brutal, as vicious, and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary as the prison of hell or the animal realm.
Poverty is said to be suffering in the world,
and so is being in debt.
A poor person who has fallen into debt
frets even when spending the loan.
And then they’re prosecuted,
or even thrown in jail.
Such imprisonment is true suffering
for someone who prays for pleasure and possessions.
In the same way, in the noble one’s training
whoever has no faith,
no conscience or prudence,
contemplates bad deeds.
After doing bad things
by way of body,
speech, and mind,
they wish, ‘May no-one find me out!’
Their behavior is creepy
by body, speech, and mind.
They pile up bad deeds
on and on, life after life.
That stupid evildoer,
knowing their own misdeeds,
is a poor person who has fallen into debt,
and frets even when spending the loan.
And when in village or wilderness
they’re prosecuted
by painful mental plans,
which are born of remorse.
That stupid evildoer,
knowing their own misdeeds,
goes to one of the animal realms,
or is trapped in hell.
Such imprisonment is true suffering,
from which a wise one is released.
With confident heart, they give
with wealth that is properly earned.
That faithful householder
wins both ways:
welfare and benefit in this life,
and happiness in the next.
This is how, for a householder,
merit grows by generosity.
In the same way, in the noble one’s training,
whoever is grounded in faith,
with conscience and prudence,
wise, and ethically restrained,
is said to live happily
in the noble one’s training.
After gaining spiritual bliss,
they concentrate on equanimity.
They give up the five hindrances,
constantly energetic,
and enter the absorptions,
unified, alert, and mindful.
Truly knowing in this way
the end of all fetters,
by not grasping in any way,
their mind is rightly freed.
To that poised one, rightly freed
with the end of the fetters of rebirth,
the knowledge comes:
‘My freedom is unshakable.’
This is the ultimate knowledge.
This is the supreme happiness.
Sorrowless, stainless, secure:
this is the highest freedom from debt.”

With Migasālā
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the laywoman Migasālā, where he sat on the seat spread out.
Then the laywoman Migasālā went up to Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, Ānanda, how on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life?
My father Purāṇa was celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was a once-returner, who was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.
But my uncle Isidatta was not celibate; he lived content with his wife.
When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was also a once-returner, who was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.
How on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life?”
“You’re right, sister, but that’s how the Buddha declared it.”
Then Ānanda, after receiving almsfood at Migasālā’s home, rose from his seat and left.
Then after the meal, on his return from alms-round, Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
“Ānanda, who is this laywoman Migasālā, a foolish incompetent matron, with an matron’s wit? And who is it that knows how to assess individuals?
These six people are found in the world.
Take a certain person who is sweet-natured and pleasant to be with. And spiritual companions enjoy living together with them.

This will be for their lasting harm and suffering.
In this case, the person who is sweet-natured … and has listened, learned, comprehended theoretically, and found temporary freedom
is better and finer than the other person.
Why is that?
Because the stream of the teaching carries them along.
But who knows the difference between them except a Realized One?
So, Ānanda, don’t be judgmental about people.

Take another person who is angry and conceited, and from time to time has the impulse to speak inappropriately.
But they’ve listened and learned and comprehended theoretically and found temporary freedom.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re headed for a higher place, not a lower. They’re going to a higher place, not a lower.
Judgmental people compare them, saying:
‘This one has just the same qualities as the other, so why is one worse and one better?’
This will be for their lasting harm and suffering.
In this case, the person who is angry and conceited, but has listened, learned, comprehended theoretically, and found temporary freedom
is better and finer than the other person.
Why is that?
Because the stream of the teaching carries them along.
But who knows the difference between them except a Realized One?
So, Ānanda, don’t be judgmental about people.
Don’t pass judgment on people.
Those who pass judgment on people harm themselves.
I, or someone like me, may pass judgment on people.
Who is this laywoman Migasālā, a foolish incompetent matron, with a matron’s wit? And who is it that knows how to assess individuals?
These six people are found in the world.
If Isidatta had achieved Purāṇa’s level of ethical conduct, Purāṇa could not have even known Isidatta’s destination.
And if Purāṇa had achieved Isidatta’s level of wisdom, Isidatta could not have even known Purāṇa’s destination.
So both individuals were lacking in one respect.”

The Great Chapter
The Lion’s Roar
“Mendicants, the Realized One possesses six powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And he lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
These are the six powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible,
the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons,
the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments,
the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of recollection of past lives,
the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of passing away and rebirth of sentient beings,
the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the ending of defilements,
the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.
And I say that true knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
And true knowledge of the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
And true knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
And true knowledge of the recollection of past lives is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
And true knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of sentient beings is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
And true knowledge of the ending of defilements is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.
And so, mendicants, immersion is the path. No immersion is the wrong path.”

About Dhammika
With Khema
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time Venerable Khema and Venerable Sumana were staying near Sāvatthī in the Dark Forest.
Then they went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Venerable Khema said to the Buddha:
“Sir, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—does not think:
‘There is someone better than me, or equal to me, or worse than me.’”
That is what Khema said,
and the teacher approved.
Then Khema, knowing that the teacher approved, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
And then, not long after Khema had left, Sumana said to the Buddha:
“Sir, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—does not think:
‘There is no-one better than me, or equal to me, or worse than me.’”
That is what Sumana said,
and the teacher approved.
Then Sumana, knowing that the teacher approved, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
And then, soon after Khema and Sumana had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, this is how gentlemen declare enlightenment.
The goal is spoken of, but the self is not involved.
But it seems that there are some foolish people here who declare enlightenment as a joke.
Later they will fall into anguish.
They don’t rank themselves
as being higher, or lower, or equal.
Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed.
They live freed from fetters.”

Aristocrats
And then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Aristocrats, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”
“Aristocrats, brahmin, have wealth as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with wisdom. They’re dedicated to power. They insist on territory. Their ultimate goal is authority.”
“Brahmins, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”
“Brahmins have wealth as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with wisdom. They’re dedicated to the hymns. They insist on sacrifice. Their ultimate goal is the Brahmā realm.”
“Householders, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”
“Householders have wealth as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with wisdom. They’re dedicated to their profession. They insist on work. Their ultimate goal is to complete their work.”
“Women, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”
“Women have a man as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with adornments. They’re dedicated to their children. They insist on being without a co-wife. Their ultimate goal is authority.”
“Bandits, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”
“Bandits have theft as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with a hiding place. They’re dedicated to their sword. They insist on darkness. Their ultimate goal is invisibility.”
“Ascetics, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”
“Ascetics have patience and gentleness as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with wisdom. They’re dedicated to ethical conduct. They insist on owning nothing. Their ultimate goal is extinguishment.”
“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing!
Master Gotama knows the ambition, preoccupation, dedication, insistence, and ultimate goal of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, women, bandits, and ascetics.
Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

Warm-hearted
First: Warm-hearted
“Mendicants, there are these six warm-hearted qualities.
Firstly, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with bodily kindness, both in public and in private. This is a warm-hearted quality.
Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with verbal kindness, both in public and in private. This too is a warm-hearted quality.
Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with mental kindness …
Furthermore, a mendicant shares without reservation any material possessions they have gained by legitimate means, even the food placed in the alms-bowl, using them in common with their ethical spiritual companions. This too is a warm-hearted quality.
Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the precepts shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. Those precepts are unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. This too is a warm-hearted quality.
Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the view shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. That view is noble and emancipating, and leads one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering. This too is a warm-hearted quality.
These are the six warm-hearted qualities.”

Warm-hearted
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, and sat down on the seat spread out.
Venerable Sāriputta also came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
Venerables Mahāmoggallāna,
Mahākassapa,
Mahākaccāna,
Mahākoṭṭhita,
Mahācunda,
Mahākappina,
Anuruddha,
and Ānanda did the same.
The Buddha spent most of the night sitting meditation, then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
And soon after the Buddha left those venerables each went to their own dwelling.
But those mendicants who were junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training slept until the sun came up, snoring.
The Buddha saw them doing this, with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman.
He went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out,
and addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, where is Sāriputta?
Where are Mahāmoggallāna,
Mahākassapa,
Mahākaccāna,
Mahākoṭṭhita,
Mahācunda,
Mahākappina,
Anuruddha,
and Ānanda?
Where have these senior disciples gone?”
“Soon after the Buddha left those venerables each went to their own dwelling.”
“So, mendicants, when the senior mendicants left, why did you sleep until the sun came up, snoring?
What do you think, mendicants?
Have you ever seen or heard
of an anointed aristocratic king who rules his whole life, dear and beloved to the country, while indulging in the pleasures of sleeping, lying, and drowsing as much as he likes?”
“No, sir.”

What do you think, mendicants?
Have you ever seen or heard
of an ascetic or brahmin who indulges in the pleasures of sleeping, lying, and drowsing as much as they like? Their sense doors are unguarded, they eat too much, they’re not dedicated to wakefulness, they’re unable to discern skillful qualities, and they don’t pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Yet they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”
“No, sir.”
“Good, mendicants!
I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.
So you should train like this:
‘We will guard our sense doors, eat in moderation, be dedicated to wakefulness, discern skillful qualities, and pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn.’

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:

With Hatthisāriputta
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
Now at that time several senior mendicants, after the meal, on their return from alms-round, sat together in the pavilion talking about the teachings.
Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta interrupted them while they were talking.
Then Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita said to Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta,
“Venerable, please don’t interrupt the senior mendicants while they’re talking about the teachings. Wait until the end of the discussion.”
When he said this, Citta Hatthisāriputta’s companions said to Mahākoṭṭhita,
“Venerable, please don’t rebuke Citta Hatthisāriputta. He is astute,
and quite capable of talking about the teachings with the senior mendicants.”
“It’s not easy to know this, reverends, for those who don’t comprehend another’s mind.
Take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet, the most unruffled of the unruffled, the calmest of the calm, so long as they live relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role.
But when they’re separated from the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role, they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; with rulers and their ministers, and with teachers of other paths and their followers.
As they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind.
They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
Suppose an ox fond of crops was tied up or shut in a pen.
Would it be right to say that that ox will never again invade the crops?”
“No it would not, reverend.

“In the same way, take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet …

Suppose it was raining heavily at the crossroads so that the dust vanished and mud appeared.
Would it be right to say that now dust will never appear at this crossroad again?”
“No it would not, reverend.
For it is quite possible that people or cattle and so on will cross over the crossroad, or that the wind and sun will evaporate the moisture so that the dust appears again.”
“In the same way, take the case of a person who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures … enters and remains in the first absorption.

But when the nourishment vanishes food will appeal again.”

Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake, unruffled and free of waves.

“In the same way, take the case of a person who, giving up pleasure and pain … enters and remains in the fourth absorption.
Thinking, ‘I get the fourth absorption!’ they mix closely with monks …
They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
Take the case of another person who, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart.
Thinking, ‘I get the signless immersion of the heart!’ they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; with rulers and their ministers, and with teachers of other paths and their followers.
As they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind.
They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
Suppose a ruler or their minister, while walking along the road with an army of four divisions, was to arrive at a forest grove where they set up camp for the night.
There, because of the noise of the elephants, horses, chariots, soldiers, and the drums, kettledrums, horns, and cymbals, the chirping of crickets would vanish.
Would it be right to say that now the chirping of crickets will never be heard in this woodland grove again?”
“No it would not, reverend.
For it is quite possible that the ruler or their minister will depart from that woodland grove so that the chirping of crickets will be heard there again.”
“In the same way, take the case of a person who, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart …
They resign the training and return to a lesser life.”
Then after some time Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.
Then the mendicants who were his companions went up to Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita and said,
“Did Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita comprehend Citta Hatthisāriputta’s mind and know that
he had gained such and such meditative attainments, yet he would still resign the training and return to a lesser life?
Or did deities tell you about it?”
“Reverends, I comprehended his mind and knew this.
And deities also told me.”
Then the mendicants who were Citta Hatthisāriputta’s companions went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, Citta Hatthisāriputta, who had gained such and such meditative attainments, has still resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.”
“Mendicants, soon Citta will remember renunciation.”
And not long after Citta Hatthisāriputta shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.
Then Citta Hatthisāriputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the perfected.

And then—in this world with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.
Even in the boundless desolation of interstellar space—so utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful, makes no impression—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.
And the sentient beings reborn there recognize each other by that light:
‘So, it seems other sentient beings have been reborn here!’
This is the first incredible and amazing thing that appears with the appearance of a Realized One.
Furthermore, the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, mindful and aware. And then … an immeasurable, magnificent light appears …

Seven Kinds of Deeds
“Mendicants, I will teach you a bad person and a worse person,
a good person and a better person.
And what is a bad person?
It’s someone who kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, and uses speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical.
This is called a bad person.
And what is a worse person?
It’s someone who kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, and uses speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they encourage others to do these things.
This is called a worse person.
And what is a good person?
It’s someone who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, or use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical.
This is called a good person.
And what is a better person?
It’s someone who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, or use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they encourage others to avoid these things.
This is called a better person.”

Deeds of Substance
Debtlessness
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him:
“Householder, these four kinds of happiness can be earned by a layperson who enjoys sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion.
What four?
The happiness of ownership, using wealth, debtlessness, and blamelessness.
And what is the happiness of ownership?
It’s when a gentleman owns legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow.
When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness.
This is called ‘the happiness of ownership’.
And what is the happiness of using wealth?
It’s when a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth, and makes merit with it.
When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness.
This is called ‘the happiness of using wealth’.
And what is the happiness of debtlessness?
It’s when a gentleman owes no debt, large or small, to anyone.
When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness.
This is called ‘the happiness of debtlessness’.
And what is the happiness of blamelessness?
It’s when a noble disciple has blameless conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness.
This is called ‘the happiness of blamelessness’.
These four kinds of happiness can be earned by a layperson who enjoys sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion.
Knowing the happiness of debtlessness,
and the extra happiness of possession,
a mortal enjoying the happiness of using wealth,
then sees clearly with wisdom.
Seeing clearly, a clever person knows
both kinds of happiness:
the other kind is not worth a sixteenth part
of the happiness of blamelessness.”

“Mendicants, there are these four kinds of clouds.
What four?
One thunders but doesn’t rain,
one rains but doesn’t thunder,
one neither thunders nor rains, and

These are the four kinds of clouds.
In the same way, these four people similar to clouds are found in the world.
What four?
One thunders but doesn’t rain,
one rains but doesn’t thunder,
one neither thunders nor rains, and

And how does a person thunder but not rain?
It’s when a person memorizes the teaching—
statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.
But they don’t truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
That’s how a person thunders but doesn’t rain.
That person is like a cloud that thunders but doesn’t rain, I say.
And how does a person rain but not thunder?
It’s when a person doesn’t memorize the teaching …
But they truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ …
And how does a person neither thunder nor rain?
It’s when a person doesn’t memorize the teaching …

It’s someone who has wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong immersion, wrong knowledge, and wrong freedom. And they encourage others in these same qualities.
This is called worse.
And who’s good?
It’s someone who has right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom.
This is called good.

Ways of Answering Questions
“Mendicants, there are these four ways of answering questions.
What four?
There is a question that should be answered definitively.
There is a question that should be answered analytically.
There is a question that should be answered with a counter-question.
There is a question that should be set aside.
These are the four ways of answering questions.
One is stated definitively,
another analytically,
a third with a counter-question,
while a fourth is set aside.
A mendicant who knows each of these,
in line with good principles,
is said to be skilled
in the four kinds of questions.
They’re intimidating, hard to defeat,
deep, and hard to crush.
They’re expert in both
what the meaning is and what it isn’t.
Rejecting what is not the meaning,
an astute person grasps the meaning.
A wise one, comprehending the meaning,

At Uruvelā
Second: At Uruvelā
“Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.
Then several old brahmins—elderly and senior, who were advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life—came up to me, and exchanged greetings with me.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, and said to me:
‘Master Gotama, we have heard this:
“The ascetic Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.”
And this is indeed the case,
for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.
This is not appropriate, Master Gotama.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘These venerables don’t know what a senior is, or what qualities make you a senior.’
Mendicants, suppose you’re eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old.
But your speech is untimely, false, meaningless, and against the teaching or training. You say things at the wrong time which are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial.
Then you’ll be considered a ‘childish senior’.
Now suppose you’re a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life.
But your speech is timely, true, meaningful, and in line with the teaching and training. You say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.
Then you’ll be considered an ‘astute senior’.
There are these four qualities that make a senior.
What four?
A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
These are the four qualities that make a senior.
The creature with a restless mind
speaks a lot of nonsense.
Their thoughts are unsettled,
and they don’t like the true teaching.
They’re far from seniority, with their bad views
and their lack of regard for others.
But one accomplished in ethics,
learned and eloquent, that wise one
is restrained when experiencing phenomena,
discerning the meaning with wisdom.
Gone beyond all things,
kind, eloquent,
they’ve given up birth and death,
and have completed the spiritual journey.
That’s who I call a senior,
who has no defilements.
With the ending of defilements, a mendicant
is declared a ‘senior’.”

Intention
Intention
“Mendicants, as long as there’s a body, the intention that gives rise to bodily action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself.
As long as there’s a voice, the intention that gives rise to verbal action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself.
As long as there’s a mind, the intention that gives rise to mental action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. But these only apply when conditioned by ignorance.
By oneself one makes the choice that gives rise to bodily, verbal, and mental action, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.
Or else others make the choice …
One consciously makes the choice …
Or else one unconsciously makes the choice …
Ignorance is included in all these things.
But when ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, there is no body and no voice and no mind, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.
There is no field, no ground, no scope, and no basis, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.
Mendicants, there are four kinds of reincarnation.
What four?
There is a reincarnation where one’s own intention is effective, not that of others.
There is a reincarnation where the intention of others is effective, not one’s own.
There is a reincarnation where both one’s own and others’ intentions are effective.
There is a reincarnation where neither one’s own nor others’ intentions are effective.
These are the four kinds of reincarnation.”
When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Buddha:
“Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.
Take the case of the reincarnation where one’s own intention is effective, not that of others. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to their own intention.
Take the case of the reincarnation where the intention of others is effective, not one’s own. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to the intention of others.
Take the case of the reincarnation where both one’s own and others’ intentions are effective. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to both their own and others’ intentions.
But sir, in the case of the reincarnation where neither one’s own nor others’ intentions are effective, what kind of gods does this refer to?”
“Sāriputta, it refers to the gods reborn in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.”
“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why some sentient beings pass away from that realm as returners who come back to this state of existence,
while others are non-returners who don’t come back?”
“Sāriputta, take a person who hasn’t given up the lower fetters. In the present life they enter and abide in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying.
If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who comes back to this state of existence.

At Uruvelā
First: At Uruvelā
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.
As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:
‘One without respect and reverence lives in suffering.
What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?’
Then it occurred to me:
‘I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on.
I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion …
I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entrie spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world … who is more accomplished than myself in wisdom …
I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world … who is more accomplished than myself in freedom …’
Then it occurred to me:
‘Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same teaching to which I was awakened?’
And then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, vanished from the Brahmā realm and appeared in front of me, as easily as a strong man would extend or contract his arm.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward me, and said:
‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching.
All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.
May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.’
That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said,
Then he went on to say:
‘All Buddhas, whether in the past,
the Buddhas of the future,
and the Buddha at present—
destroyer of the sorrows of many—
respecting the true teaching
they did live, they do live,
and they also will live.
This is the nature of the Buddhas.
Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare,
and wants to become the very best they can be,
should respect the true teaching,
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.’
That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
Then he bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there.
Then, knowing the request of Brahmā and what was suitable for myself, I honored and respected and relied on the same teaching to which I was awakened.
And since the Saṅgha has also achieved greatness, I also respect the Saṅgha.”

“What is the cause, Reverend Sāriputta, what is the reason why some sentient beings aren’t fully extinguished in the present life?”
“Reverend Ānanda, it’s because some sentient beings don’t really understand which perceptions make things worse, which keep things steady, which lead to distinction, and which lead to penetration.
That’s the cause, that’s the reason why some sentient beings aren’t fully extinguished in the present life.”

And how does a male zombie live with a female zombie?

Mental and physical.
Some sentient beings are seen who can claim to be free of physical illness for a year, or two, or three years … even up to a hundred years or more.
But it’s very hard to find any sentient beings in the world who can claim to be free of mental illness even for a moment, apart from those who have ended the defilements.
There are four kinds of illness for those gone forth.
What four?
To start with, a mendicant has many wishes, is frustrated, and is not content with any kind of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
Because of this, they focus their corrupt wishes on being looked up to, and on getting material possessions, honor, and popularity.
They try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things.
They have an ulterior motive when they visit families. They have an ulterior motive when they sit down, when they speak on Dhamma, and even when they hold it in when they need to go to the toilet.
These are the four kinds of illness for those gone forth.
So you should train like this:
‘We will not have many wishes or be frustrated. We will be content with any kind of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. We won’t focus our corrupt wishes on being looked up to, and on getting material possessions, honor, and popularity. We won’t try hard, strive, and make an effort to get these things. We will endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. We will endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. We will endure rude and unwelcome criticism. We will put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.’

Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying:
‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal.
May Your Majesty punish them!’
The king would say:
‘Go, my men, and tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.’
The king’s men would do as they were told.
Then a bystander might think:
‘This man must have done a truly bad and reprehensible deed, a capital offense.
There’s no way I’d ever do such a bad and reprehensible deed, a capital offense.’
In the same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception of peril regarding expulsion offenses.
It can be expected that if they haven’t committed an expulsion offense they won’t, and if they committed one they will deal with it properly.
Suppose a man was to put on a black cloth, mess up his hair, and put a club on his shoulder. Then he approaches a large crowd and says:
‘Sirs, I’ve done a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of clubbing. I submit to your pleasure.’
Then a bystander might think:

Then a bystander might think:
‘This man must have done a truly bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of a sack of ashes. …
There’s no way I’d ever do such a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of a sack of ashes.’
In the same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception of peril regarding confessable offenses. It can be expected that if they haven’t committed a confessable offense they won’t, and if they committed one they will deal with it properly.
Suppose a man was to put on a black cloth and mess up his hair. Then he approaches a large crowd and says:
‘Sirs, I’ve done a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of criticism.
I submit to your pleasure.’
Then a bystander might think:
‘This man must have done a truly bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of criticism. …

“Mendicants, I declare these four kinds of deeds, having realized them with my own insight.
What four?
There are dark deeds with dark results;
bright deeds with bright results;
dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results; and
neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds.
And what are dark deeds with dark results?
It’s when someone makes hurtful choices by way of body, speech, and mind. These are called dark deeds with dark results.
And what are bright deeds with bright results?
It’s when someone makes pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind. These are called bright deeds with bright results.
And what are dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results?
It’s when someone makes both hurtful and pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind. These are called dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results.
And what are neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds?
Right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
These are called neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds.
These are the four kinds of deeds that I declare, having realized them with my own insight.”

At Kusinārā
At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his final extinguishment.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Perhaps even a single mendicant has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice. So ask, mendicants! Don’t regret it later, thinking:
‘We were in the Teacher’s presence and we weren’t able to ask the Buddha a question.’”
When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.
For a second time the Buddha addressed the mendicants: …
For a second time, the mendicants kept silent.
For a third time the Buddha addressed the mendicants: …
For a third time, the mendicants kept silent.
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:
“Mendicants, perhaps you don’t ask out of respect for the Teacher. So let a friend tell a friend.”
When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.
Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha:
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
I am quite confident that there’s not even a single mendicant in this Saṅgha who has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice.”
“Ānanda, you speak from faith.
But the Realized One knows that there’s not even a single mendicant in this Saṅgha who has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice.
Even the last of these five hundred mendicants is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”

At Kāḷaka’s Monastery
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa, in Kāḷaka’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“In this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind: that I know.
In this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind: that I have insight into.
That has been known by a Realized One, but a Realized One is not subject to it.
If I were to say that ‘I do not know … the world with its gods’, I would be lying.
If I were to say that ‘I both know and do not know … the world with its gods’, that would be just the same.
If I were to say that ‘I neither know nor do not know … the world with its gods’, that would be my fault.
So a Realized One sees what is to be seen, but does not identify with what is seen, does not identify with what is unseen, does not identify with what is to be seen, and does not identify with a seer.
He hears what is to be heard, but does not identify with what is heard, does not identify with what is unheard, does not identify with what is to be heard, and does not identify with a hearer.
He thinks what is to be thought, but does not identify with what is thought, does not identify with what is not thought, does not identify with what is to be thought, and does not identify with a thinker.
He knows what is to be known, but does not identify with what is known, does not identify with what is unknown, does not identify with what is to be known, and does not identify with a knower.
Since a Realized One is poised in the midst of things seen, heard, thought, and known, he is the poised one.
And I say that there is no better or finer poise than this.
Such a one does not take anything
seen, heard, or thought to be ultimately true or false.
But others get attached, thinking it’s the truth,
limited by their preconceptions.
Since they’ve already seen this dart,
to which people are attached and cling,
they say, ‘I know, I see, that’s how it is’;
the Realized Ones have no attachments.”

Brahmins
Vassakāra on What is Heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then Vassakāra the brahmin, a chief minister of Magadha, went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, this is my doctrine and view:
There’s nothing wrong with talking about what you’ve seen, saying:
‘So I have seen.’
There’s nothing wrong with talking about what you’ve heard, saying:
‘So I have heard.’
There’s nothing wrong with talking about what you’ve thought, saying:
‘So I have thought.’
There’s nothing wrong with talking about what you’ve known, saying:
‘So I have known.’”
“Brahmin, I don’t say you should talk about everything you see, hear, think, and know.
But I also don’t say you should talk about nothing you see, hear, think, and know.
When talking about certain things you’ve seen, heard, thought, or known, unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline. I say that you shouldn’t talk about those things.
When talking about other things you’ve seen, heard, thought, or known, unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow. I say that you should talk about those things.”
Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.

Suppavāsā
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Pajjanika.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Suppavāsā the Koliyan, where he sat on the seat spread out.
Then Suppavāsā served and satisfied the Buddha with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, she sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to her:
“Suppavāsā, when a noble disciple gives food, she gives the recipients four things.
What four?
Long life, beauty, happiness, and strength.
Giving long life, she has long life as a god or human.
Giving beauty, she has beauty as a god or human.
Giving happiness, she has happiness as a god or human.
Giving strength, she has strength as a god or human.
When a noble disciple gives food, she gives the recipients these four things.
When she gives well-prepared food,
pure, fine, and full of flavor,
that offering—given to the upright,
who have good conduct, and are big-hearted—
joins merit to merit. It’s very fruitful,
and is praised by those who know the world.
Those who recall such sacrifices,
live in the world full of joy.
They’ve driven out the stain of stinginess, root and all,
blameless, they go to a heavenly place.”

Practice
Second: Patience
“Mendicants, there are four ways of practice.
What four?
Impatient practice, patient practice, taming practice, and calming practice.
And what’s the impatient practice?
It’s when a mendicant cannot endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. They cannot endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They cannot endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they cannot put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.
This is called the impatient practice.

This is called the patient practice.
And what’s the taming practice?
When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. …
When they hear a sound with their ears …
When they smell an odor with their nose …
When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
When they feel a touch with their body …
When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it.
This is called the taming practice.
And what’s the calming practice?
It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, calm them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
This is called the calming practice.
These are the four ways of practice.”

One who practices to benefit neither themselves nor others;
one who practices to benefit others, but not themselves;
one who practices to benefit themselves, but not others; and
one who practices to benefit both themselves and others.
Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness.
The person who practices to benefit neither themselves nor others is like this, I say.
The person who practices to benefit others, but not themselves, is better than that.
The person who practices to benefit themselves, but not others, is better than both of those.
But the person who practices to benefit both themselves and others is the foremost, best, chief, highest, and finest of the four.
From a cow comes milk, from milk comes curds, from curds come butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream of ghee. And the cream of ghee is said to be the best of these.
In the same way, the person who practices to benefit both themselves and others is the foremost, best, chief, highest, and finest of the four.
These are the four people found in the world.”

Wanderers
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers on the bank of the Sappinī river. They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderer’s monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river, He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to the wanderers:
“Wanderers, these four basic principles are primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them.
What four?
Contentment …
Good will … Right mindfulness … Right immersion …
These four basic principles are primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them.
Wanderers, if someone should say:
‘I’ll reject this basic principle of contentment, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who covets sensual pleasures with acute lust.’ Then I’d say to them:
‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’
It’s simply impossible to reject this basic principle of contentment, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who covets sensual pleasures with acute lust.
If someone should say:
‘I’ll reject this basic principle of good will, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who has ill will and malicious intent.’ Then I’d say to them:
‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’
It’s simply impossible to reject this basic principle of good will, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who has ill will and malicious intent.
If someone should say:
‘I’ll reject this basic principle of right mindfulness, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who is unmindful, with no situational awareness.’ Then I’d say to them:
‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’
It’s simply impossible to reject this basic principle of right mindfulness, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who is unmindful, with no situational awareness.
If someone should say:
‘I’ll reject this basic principle of right immersion, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who is scattered, with straying mind.’ Then I’d say to them:
‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’
It’s simply impossible to reject this basic principle of right immersion, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who is scattered, with straying mind.
If anyone imagines they can criticize and reject these four basic principles, they deserve rebuke and criticism on four legitimate grounds in the present life.
What four?
If you reject the basic principle of contentment, then you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who covet sensual pleasures with acute lust.
If you reject the basic principle of good will, you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who have ill will and malicious intent.
If you reject the basic principle of right mindfulness, then you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who are unmindful, with no situational awareness.
If you reject the basic principle of right immersion, you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who are scattered, with straying minds.
If anyone imagines they can criticize and reject these four basic principles, they deserve rebuke and criticism on four legitimate grounds in the present life.
Even those wanderers of the past, Vassa and Bhañña of Ukkalā, who taught the doctrines of no-cause, inaction, and nihilism, didn’t imagine that these four basic principles should be criticized or rejected.
Why is that?
For fear of being blamed, criticized, and faulted.
One who has good will, ever mindful,
serene within,
training to remove desire,
is called ‘a diligent one’.”

The Benefits of Training
“Mendicants, this spiritual life is lived with training as its benefit, with wisdom as its overseer, with freedom as its core, and with mindfulness as its ruler.
And how is training its benefit?
Firstly, I laid down for my disciples the training that deals with supplementary regulations in order to inspire confidence in those without it and to increase confidence in those who have it.
They undertake whatever supplementary regulations I have laid down, keeping them unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred.
Furthermore, I laid down for my disciples the training that deals with the fundamentals of the spiritual life in order to rightly end suffering in every way.
They undertake whatever training that deals with the fundamentals of the spiritual life I have laid down, keeping it unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred.

They examine with wisdom any teachings I taught them.

And how is freedom its core?
I taught the Dhamma to my disciples in order to rightly end suffering in every way.
They experience through freedom any teachings I taught them.

Mindfulness is well established in oneself: ‘In this way I’ll fulfill the training dealing with supplementary regulations, or support with wisdom in every situation the training dealing with supplementary regulations I’ve already fulfilled.’
Mindfulness is well established in oneself: ‘In this way I’ll fulfill the training dealing with the fundamentals of the spiritual life, or support with wisdom in every situation the training dealing with the fundamentals of the spiritual life I’ve already fulfilled.’

Impatient practice, patient practice, taming practice, and calming practice.
And what’s the impatient practice?
It’s when someone abuses, annoys, or argues with you, and you abuse, annoy, or argue right back at them.
This is called the impatient practice.
And what’s the patient practice?
It’s when someone abuses, annoys, or argues with you, and you don’t abuse, annoy, or argue back at them.
This is called the patient practice.
And what’s the taming practice?
When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it.
When they hear a sound with their ears …
When they smell an odor with their nose …
When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
When they feel a touch with their body …
When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it.
This is called the taming practice.
And what’s the calming practice?
It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, calm them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
This is called the calming practice.
These are the four ways of practice.”

The Great Chapter
Craving, the Weaver
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I will teach you about craving—the weaver, the migrant, the ubiquitous, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it. It makes the world tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And what is that craving …?
There are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the exterior.
What are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior?
When there is the concept ‘I am’, there are the concepts ‘I am such’, ‘I am thus’, ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am fleeting’, ‘I am lasting’; ‘mine’, ‘such is mine’, ‘thus is mine’, ‘otherwise is mine’; ‘also mine’, ‘such is also mine’, ‘thus is also mine’, ‘otherwise is also mine’; ‘I will be’, ‘I will be such’, ‘I will be thus’, ‘I will be otherwise’.
These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior.
What are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior?
When there is the concept ‘I am because of this’, there are the concepts ‘I am such because of this’, ‘I am thus because of this’, ‘I am otherwise because of this’; ‘I am fleeting because of this’, ‘I am lasting because of this’; ‘mine because of this’, ‘such is mine because of this’, ‘thus is mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is mine because of this’; ‘also mine because of this’, ‘such is also mine because of this’, ‘thus is also mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is also mine because of this’; ‘I will be because of this’, ‘I will be such because of this’, ‘I will be thus because of this’, ‘I will be otherwise because of this’.
These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior.
So there are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the exterior.
These are called the thirty-six currents of craving.
Each of these pertain to the past, future, and present,
making one hundred and eight currents of craving.
This is that craving—the weaver, the migrant, the ubiquitous, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it. It makes the world tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.”

Withdrawn
“Mendicants, a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has stilled the physical process, and is said to be ‘withdrawn’.
And how has a mendicant eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth?
Different ascetics and brahmins have different idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. For example:
the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.
A mendicant has dispelled, eliminated, thrown out, rejected, let go of, given up, and relinquished all these.
That’s how a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth.
And how has a mendicant totally given up searching?
It’s when they’ve given up searching for sensual pleasures, for continued existence, and for a spiritual path.
That’s how a mendicant has totally given up searching.
And how has a mendicant stilled the physical process?
It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
That’s how a mendicant has stilled the physical process.
And how is a mendicant withdrawn?
It’s when they’ve given up the conceit ‘I am’, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
That’s how a mendicant is withdrawn.
A mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has stilled the physical process, and is said to be ‘withdrawn’.
The search for sensual pleasures, for a good rebirth,
and the search for a spiritual path;
the holding tight to the notion ‘this is the truth’,
and the mass of grounds for views—
for one detached from all lusts,
freed by the ending of craving,
that searching has been relinquished,
and those viewpoints eradicated.
That mendicant is peaceful and mindful,
a tranquil champion.
And when they’re awakened by comprehending conceit,
they’re called ‘withdrawn’.”

It’s when a mendicant is a practicing trainee,

It’s like the eldest son of an anointed aristocratic king. He has not yet been anointed, but is eligible, and has been confirmed in the succession.
In the same way, a mendicant is a practicing trainee, who lives aspiring to the supreme sanctuary.
That’s how a person is a confirmed ascetic.
And how is a person a white lotus ascetic?
It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. But they don’t have direct meditative experience of the eight liberations.

And how is a person an exquisite ascetic of ascetics?
It’s when a mendicant usually uses only what they’ve been invited to accept—robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—rarely using them without invitation.
When living with other spiritual practitioners, they usually treat them agreeably by way of body, speech, and mind, and rarely disagreeably.
And they usually present them with agreeable things, rarely with disagreeable ones.
They’re healthy, so the various unpleasant feelings—stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their conjunction; or caused by change in weather, by not taking care of yourself, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds—usually don’t come up.
They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. …
That’s how a person is an exquisite ascetic of ascetics.
And if anyone should be rightly called an exquisite ascetic of ascetics, it’s me.
For I usually use only what I’ve been invited to accept …
When living with other spiritual practitioners, I usually treat them agreeably …
I’m healthy …
I get the four absorptions when I want, without trouble or difficulty.

“Mendicants, this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of deceiving people or flattering them, nor for the benefit of possessions, honor, or popularity, nor for the benefit of winning debates, nor thinking, ‘So let people know about me!’

not because of tradition,
but for the sake of restraint and giving up,

Your approach and articulation are excellent, and it’s a good question.
For you asked:
‘What leads the world on? What drags it around? What arises and takes control?’”
“Yes, sir.”
“Mendicant, the mind leads the world on. The mind drags it around. When the mind arises, it takes control.”
Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:
“Sir, they speak of ‘a learned memorizer of the teaching’.
How is a learned memorizer of the teaching defined?”
“Good, good, mendicant!
Your approach and articulation are excellent, and it’s a good question. …
I have taught many teachings:
statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.
But if anyone understands the meaning and the text of even a four-line verse, and if they practice in line with that teaching, they’re qualified to be called a ‘learned memorizer of the teaching’.”
Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:

The Snake King
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now, at that time a monk in Sāvatthī passed away due to a snake bite.
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, a monk in Sāvatthī has passed away due to a snake bite.”
“Mendicants, that monk mustn’t have spread a mind of love to the four royal snake families.
If he had, he wouldn’t have died due to a snake bite.
What four?
The royal snake families of Virūpakkha, Erāpatha, Chabyāputta, and Kaṇhāgotamaka. …
Mendicants, I urge you to spread a mind of love to the four royal snake families, for your own safety, security, and protection.

So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Nakula’s father, where he sat on the seat spread out.
Then the householder Nakula’s father and the housewife Nakula’s mother went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Nakula’s father said to the Buddha,
“Sir, ever since we were both young, and Nakula’s mother was given to me in marriage, I can’t recall betraying her even in thought, still less in deed.
We want to see each other in both this life and the next.”
Then Nakula’s mother said to the Buddha,
“Sir, ever since we were both young, and I was given in marriage to Nakula’s father, I can’t recall betraying him even in thought, still less in deed.
We want to see each other in both this life and the next.”
“Householders, if wife and husband want to see each other in both this life and the next, they should be equals in faith, ethical conduct, generosity, and wisdom.
When both are faithful and kind,

The Great Chapter
With Bhaddiya
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
Then Bhaddiya the Licchavi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, I have heard this:
‘The ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other paths.’
I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”
“Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’
But when you know for yourselves:
‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.
What do you think, Bhaddiya?
Does greed come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”
“Harm, sir.”
“A greedy individual—overcome by greed—kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
“Yes, sir.”
“What do you think, Bhaddiya?
Does hate … or delusion … or aggression come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”
“Harm, sir.”
“An aggressive individual kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”
“Yes, sir.”
“What do you think, Bhaddiya, are these things skillful or unskillful?”
“Unskillful, sir.”
“Blameworthy or blameless?”
“Blameworthy, sir.”
“Criticized or praised by sensible people?”
“Criticized by sensible people, sir.”
“When you undertake them, do they lead to harm and suffering, or not?
Or how do you see this?”
“When you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering.
That’s how we see it.”
“So, Bhaddiya, when we said:
‘Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.”
But when you know for yourselves:
“These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering”, then you should give them up.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
Please, Bhaddiya, don’t rely on oral transmission …
But when you know for yourselves:
‘These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness’, then you should acquire them and keep them.
What do you think, Bhaddiya?
Does contentment … love … understanding … benevolence come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”
“Welfare, sir.”
“An individual who is benevolent—not overcome by aggression—doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”
“Yes, sir.”
“What do you think, Bhaddiya, are these things skillful or unskillful?”
“Skillful, sir.”
“Blameworthy or blameless?”
“Blameless, sir.”
“Criticized or praised by sensible people?”
“Praised by sensible people, sir.”
“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happiness, or not?
Or how do you see this?”
“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness.
That’s how we see it.”
“So, Bhaddiya, when we said:
‘Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.”
But when you know for yourselves:
“These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness”, then you should acquire them and keep them.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
The good people in the world encourage their disciples:
‘Please, mister, live rid of greed.
Then you won’t act out of greed by way of body, speech, or mind.
Live rid of hate … delusion … aggression.
Then you won’t act out of hate … delusion … aggression by way of body, speech, or mind.”
When he said this, Bhaddiya the Licchavi said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
“Well, Bhaddiya, did I say to you:
‘Please, Bhaddiya, be my disciple,
and I will be your teacher’?”
“No, sir.”
“Though I speak and explain like this, certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim:
‘The ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other paths.’”
“Sir, this conversion magic is excellent.
This conversion magic is lovely!
If my loved ones—relatives and kin—were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.
If all the aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”
“That’s so true, Bhaddiya! That’s so true, Bhaddiya!
If all the aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.
If the whole world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to be converted by this, for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.
If these great sal trees were to be converted by this, for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness—if they were sentient.

Once the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Then Upaka the son of Maṇḍikā went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, this is my doctrine and view:
‘Whoever goes on complaining about others without giving any reasons

“Upaka, if someone goes on complaining about others without giving a reason, they’re reprehensible and at fault.
But that’s what you do, so you’re reprehensible and at fault!”
“Sir, like a fish caught in a big trap just as it rises,
so the Buddha caught me in a big trap of words just as I rose up.”
“Upaka, I’ve declared: ‘This is unskillful.’
And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that:
‘This is another way of saying that this is unskillful.’
I’ve declared: ‘The unskillful should be given up.’

But Ajātasattu became angry and upset, and said to Upaka,

At Sāpūga
At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Sāpūga.
Then several Koliyans from Sāpūga went up to Ānanda, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Then Venerable Ānanda said to them:
“Byagghapajjas, these four factors of trying to be pure have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
What four?
The factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind, view, and freedom.
And what is the factor of trying to be pure in ethics?
It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, with good behavior and supporters. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
This is called purity of ethics.
They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of ethics, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in ethics.
And what is the factor of trying to be pure in mind?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
This is called purity of mind.
They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of mind, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in mind.
And what is the factor of trying to be pure in view?
Take a mendicant who truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
This is called purity of view.
They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of view, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in view.
And what is the factor of trying to be pure in freedom?
That noble disciple—who has these factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind, and view—detaches their mind from things that arouse greed, and frees their mind from things that it should be freed from.
Doing so, they experience perfect freedom.
This is called purity of freedom.
They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of freedom, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in freedom.
These four factors of trying to be pure have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.

With Vappa
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
Then Vappa of the Sakyans, a disciple of the Jains, went up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Mahāmoggallāna said to him:
“Vappa, take a person who is restrained in body, speech, and mind. When ignorance fades away and knowledge arises,
do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?”
“Sir, I do see such a case.
Take a person who did bad deeds in a past life. But the result of that has not yet ripened.
For this reason defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life.”
But this conversation between Mahāmoggallāna and Vappa was left unfinished.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall.
He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Mahāmoggallāna,
“Moggallāna, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”
Moggallāna repeated the entire conversation to the Buddha, and concluded:
“This was my conversation with Vappa that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.”
Then the Buddha said to Vappa,
“Vappa, we can discuss this. But only if you allow what should be allowed, and reject what should be rejected. And if you ask me the meaning of anything you don’t understand, saying:
‘Sir, why is this? What’s the meaning of that?’”
“Sir, let us discuss this. I will do as you say.”
“What do you think, Vappa?
There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of undertaking bodily activity. These don’t occur in someone who avoids such bodily activity.
They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?”
“No, sir.”

“A mendicant whose mind is rightly freed like this has achieved six consistent responses.
Seeing a sight with the eye, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware.
Hearing a sound with the ears …
Smelling an odor with the nose …
Tasting a flavor with the tongue …
Feeling a touch with the body …
Knowing a thought with the mind, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware.
Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.’
Suppose there was a shadow cast by a sacrificial post.
Then along comes a person with a spade and basket.
They cut down the sacrificial post at its base,
dig it up,
and pull it out by its roots, right down to the fibers and stems.
Then they split it apart,
cut up the parts,
and chop them into splinters.
Next they dry the splinters in the wind and sun,
burn them with fire,
and reduce them to ashes.
Then they sweep away the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream.
And so the shadow cast by the post is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
In the same way, a mendicant whose mind is rightly freed like this has achieved six consistent responses.

When he said this, Vappa the Sakyan, the disciple of the Jains, said to the Buddha:
“Sir, suppose there was a man who raised commercial horses for profit.
But he never made any profit, and instead just got weary and frustrated.
In the same way, I paid homage to those Jain fools for profit.
But I never made any profit, and instead just got weary and frustrated.
From this day forth, any confidence I had in those Jain fools I sweep away as in a strong wind, or float away as down a swift stream.
Excellent, sir! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

Overflowing Merit
Second: Overflowing Merit
“Mendicants, there are these four kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.
What four?
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
This is the first kind of overflowing merit …
Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the teaching:
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
This is the second kind of overflowing merit …
Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
This is the third kind of overflowing merit …
Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
This is the fourth kind of overflowing merit …
These are the four kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.
Whoever has faith in the Realized One,
unwavering and well grounded;
whose ethical conduct is good,
praised and loved by the noble ones;
who has confidence in the Saṅgha,
and correct view:
they’re said to be prosperous,
their life is not in vain.
So let the wise devote themselves
to faith, ethical behavior,
confidence, and insight into the teaching,
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.

With Rohitassa
With Rohitassa
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then, late at night, the glorious god Rohitassa, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, is it possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn?”
“Reverend, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.”
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by the Buddha.
Once upon a time, I was a hermit called Rohitassa, son of Bhoja. I was a sky-walker with psychic powers.
I was as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow.
My stride was such that it could span from the eastern ocean to the western ocean.
Having such speed and stride, this wish came to me:
‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’
I traveled for my whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—and I passed away along the way, never reaching the end of the world.
It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by the Buddha.”
“Reverend, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.
But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.
For it is in this fathom-long carcass with its perception and mind that I describe the world, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.
The end of the world can never
be reached by traveling.
But without reaching the end of the world,
there’s no release from suffering.
So a clever person, understanding the world,
has completed the spiritual journey, and gone to the end of the world.
A peaceful one, knowing the end of the world,
does not hope for this world or the next.”

When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.

The Great Chapter
With Sāḷha
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
Then Sāḷha and Abhaya the Licchavis went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who advocate crossing the flood by means of two things:
purification of ethics, and mortification in disgust of sin.
What does the Buddha say about this?”
“Sāḷha, purification of ethics is one of the factors of the ascetic life, I say.
But those ascetics and brahmins who teach mortification in disgust of sin—regarding it as essential and clinging to it—are incapable of crossing the flood.
And those ascetics and brahmins whose livelihood and behavior by way of body, speech, and mind, is not pure are also incapable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening.
Suppose a man who wanted to cross a river took a sharp axe into a wood.
There he’d see a large green sal tree, straight and young and grown free of defects.
He’d cut it down at the base,
cut off the top,
and completely strip off the branches and foliage.
Then he’d trim it with axes and
and sand it with a rock.
Finally, he’d launch out on the river.
What do you think, Sāḷha?
Is that man capable of crossing the river?”
Because that green sal tree is well worked on the outside, but inside it’s still not cleared out.
I’d expect that green sal tree to sink, and the man to come to ruin.”
“In the same way, Sāḷha, those ascetics and brahmins who teach mortification in disgust of sin—regarding it as essential and clinging to it—are incapable of crossing the flood.
And those ascetics and brahmins whose livelihood and behavior by way of body, speech, and mind is not pure are also incapable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening.

Suppose a man who wanted to cross a river took a sharp axe into a wood.
There he’d see a large green sal tree, straight and young and grown free of defects.
He’d cut it down at the base,
cut off the top,
and completely strip off the branches and foliage.
Then he’d trim it with axes and
Then he’d take a chisel and completely clear it out inside.
Then he’d plane it,
sand it with a rock,
and make it into a boat.
Finally he’d fix it with oars and rudder,
and launch out on the river.
What do you think, Sāḷha?
Is that man capable of crossing the river?”
“Yes, sir.
Why is that?
Because that green sal tree is well worked on the outside, cleared out on the inside, made into a boat, and fixed with oars and rudder.
I’d expect
that boat to not sink, and the man to safely make it to the far shore.”
“In the same way, Sāḷha, those ascetics and brahmins who don’t teach mortification in disgust of sin—not regarding it as essential or clinging to it—are capable of crossing the flood.
And those ascetics and brahmins whose behavior by way of body, speech, and mind is pure are also capable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening.
Suppose there was a warrior who knew lots of fancy archery tricks.
It is only with these three factors that he becomes worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship.
What three?
He’s a long-distance shooter, a marksman, and one who shatters large objects.
Just as a warrior is a long-distance shooter,
a noble disciple has right immersion.
A noble disciple with right immersion truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
They truly see any kind of feeling …
perception …
consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
Just as a warrior is a marksman,
a noble disciple has right view.
A noble disciple with right view truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
Just as a warrior shatters large objects,
a noble disciple has right freedom.
A noble disciple with right freedom shatters the great mass of ignorance.”

This is the second thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.
Furthermore, the mendicants who are very learned—knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—don’t carefully make others recite the discourses.
When they pass away, the discourses are cut off at the root, with no-one to preserve them.
This is the third thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.

And how is love born of love?
It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person.
Others treat that person with liking, love, and care.

‘These others like the person I like.’
And so love for them springs up.
That’s how love is born of love.

These are the four things that are born of love and hate.
A time comes when a mendicant … enters and remains in the first absorption.
At that time they have no love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate.
A time comes when a mendicant … enters and remains in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
At that time they have no love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate.
A time comes when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
At that time any love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate is given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
This is called a mendicant who doesn’t draw close or push back or fume or ignite or burn up.

And what’s the painful practice with slow insight?
It’s when a mendicant meditates observing the ugliness of the body, perceives the repulsiveness of food, perceives dissatisfaction with the whole world, observes the impermanence of all conditions,
and has well established the perception of their own death.
They rely on these five powers of a trainee:

But these five faculties manifest in them weakly:

Because of this, they only slowly attain the conditions for ending the defilements in the present life.

Because of this, they swiftly attain the conditions for ending the defilements in the present life.

And what’s the pleasant practice with slow insight?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
They rely on these five powers of a trainee:
faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.
But these five faculties manifest in them weakly:
faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.
Because of this, they only slowly attain the conditions for ending the defilements in the present life.
This is called the pleasant practice with slow insight.
And what’s the pleasant practice with swift insight?

Truths of the Brahmins
Once the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers on the bank of the Sappinī river. They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderer’s monastery on the bank of the Sappinī river.
Now at that time this discussion came up while those wanderers who follow other paths were sitting together,
“The truths of the brahmins are like this; the truths of the brahmins are like that.”
Then the Buddha went up to those wanderers, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to them,
“Wanderers, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”
“Well, Master Gotama, this discussion came up among us while we were sitting together:
‘The truths of the brahmins are like this; the truths of the brahmins are like that.’”
“Wanderers, I declare these four truths of the brahmins, having realized them with my own insight.
What four?
Take a brahmin who says:
‘No sentient beings should be killed.’
Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies.
But they don’t think of themselves as an ‘ascetic’ or ‘brahmin’ because of that. Nor do they think ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’.
Rather, they simply practice out of kindness and compassion for living creatures, having had insight into the truth of that.
Take another brahmin who says:
‘All sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’
Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies.
But they don’t think of themselves as an ‘ascetic’ or ‘brahmin’ because of that. Nor do they think ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’.

Take another brahmin who says:

Overflowing Merit
Overflowing Merit
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, there are these four kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.
What four?
When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart while using a robe, the overflowing of merit for the donor is limitless …
When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart while eating alms-food, the overflowing of merit for the donor is limitless …
When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart while using lodgings, the overflowing of merit for the donor is limitless …
When a mendicant enters and remains in a limitless immersion of heart while using medicines and supplies for the sick, the overflowing of merit for the donor is limitless …
These are the four kinds of overflowing merit, overflowing goodness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. They lead to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness.
When a noble disciple has these four kinds of overflowing merit and goodness, it’s not easy to grasp how much merit they have by saying that this is the extent of their overflowing merit … that leads to happiness.
It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.
It’s like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It’s not easy to say how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are. It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water.
In the same way, when a noble disciple has these four kinds of overflowing merit it’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.
Hosts of people use the rivers,
and though the rivers are many,
all reach the great deep, the boundless ocean,
the cruel sea that’s home to precious gems.
In the same way, when a person gives food, drink, and clothes;
and they’re a giver of beds, seats, and mats—
the streams of merit reach that astute person,

Schism in the Saṅgha
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“Well, Ānanda, has that disciplinary issue been settled yet?”
“How could it be, sir?
Venerable Anuruddha’s pupil Bāhiya remains entirely committed to creating a schism in the Saṅgha.
But Anuruddha doesn’t think to say a single word about it.”
“But Ānanda, since when has Anuruddha been involved in disciplinary issues in the midst of the Saṅgha?
Shouldn’t you, together with Sāriputta and Moggallāna, settle all disciplinary issues that come up?
A bad monk sees four reasons to relish schism in the Saṅgha.
What four?
Take an unethical monk, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved.
He thinks:
‘Suppose the monks know that I’m a bad monk …
If they’re in harmony, they’ll expel me,
but if they’re divided they won’t.’
A bad monk sees this as the first reason to relish schism in the Saṅgha.
Furthermore, a bad monk has wrong view, he’s attached to an extremist view.
He thinks:
‘Suppose the monks know that I have wrong view …
If they’re in harmony they’ll expel me,
but if they’re divided they won’t.’
A bad monk sees this as the second reason to relish schism in the Saṅgha.
Furthermore, a bad monk has wrong livelihood and earns a living by wrong livelihood.
He thinks:
‘Suppose the monks know that I have wrong livelihood …
If they’re in harmony they’ll expel me,
but if they’re divided they won’t.’
A bad monk sees this as the third reason to relish schism in the Saṅgha.
Furthermore, a bad monk desires material possessions, honor, and admiration.
He thinks:
‘Suppose the monks know that I desire material possessions, honor, and admiration.
If they’re in harmony they won’t honor, respect, revere, or venerate me,

Self-mortification
“Mendicants, these four people are found in the world.
What four?
One person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves.
One person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others.
One person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others.
One person neither mortifies themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.
They live without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves.
And how does one person mortify themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves?
It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when asked. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal.
They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer.
They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.
They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.
They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight.
They live pursuing the practice of eating food at set intervals.
They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.
They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.
They tear out hair and beard, pursuing this practice.
They constantly stand, refusing seats.
They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting.
They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed.
They pursue the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening.
And so they live pursuing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.
That’s how one person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves.
And how does one person mortify others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others?
It’s when a person is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, a hunter or fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher of cattle, a jailer, or has some other cruel livelihood.
That’s how one person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others.
And how does one person mortify themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others?
It’s when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.
He has a new temple built to the east of the city. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the temple with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest.
There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass.
The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the remainder.
‘Slaughter this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!’
His bondservants, workers, and staff do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping, with tearful faces.
That’s how one person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others.
And how does one person neither mortify themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others,
living without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves?
It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some good family.
They gain faith in the Realized One,
and reflect:
‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open.
It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.
Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’
After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings.
They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.
They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words.
They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.
They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people.
They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.
They refrain from injuring plants and seeds.
They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time.
They refrain from dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows.
They refrain from beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup.
They refrain from high and luxurious beds.
They refrain from receiving gold and money,
raw grains,
women and girls,
male and female bondservants,
goats and sheep,
chickens and pigs,
elephants, cows, horses, and mares,
and fields and land.
They refrain from running errands and messages;
buying and selling;
falsifying weights, metals, or measures;
bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity;
mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.
They’re content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly.
Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.
They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.
In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly.
Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.
When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.
Seeing a sight with the eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it.
Hearing a sound with the ears …
Smelling an odor with the nose …
Tasting a flavor with the tongue …
Feeling a touch with the body …
Knowing a thought with the mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it.
When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.
They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.
When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,
they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.
After the meal, they return from alms-round, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.
Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire.
Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.
Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.
Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.
Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.
They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives …
knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings …
knowledge of the ending of defilements.
They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.
Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
That’s how one person neither mortifies themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others,
living without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves.
These are the four people found in the world.”

The practice that leads to the cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One;

In this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One.
That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.
From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise.
That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.
The Realized One does as he says, and says as he does.
Since this is so,
that’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.
In this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the Realized One is the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power.

He has attained the end of all karma,
freed with the end of attachments.
That Blessed One is the Buddha,
he is the supreme lion,
in all the world with its gods,
he turns the holy wheel.
And so those gods and humans,
who have gone to the Buddha for refuge,
come together and revere him,
great of heart and rid of naivety:
‘Tamed, he is the best of tamers,
peaceful, he is the hermit among the peaceful,
liberated, he is the foremost of liberators,
crossed over, he is the most excellent of guides across.’

great of heart and rid of naivety.

The Noble Traditions
“Mendicants, these four noble traditions are primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now, nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them.
What four?
Firstly, a mendicant is content with any kind of robe, and praises such contentment. They don’t try to get hold of a robe in an improper way. They don’t get upset if they don’t get a robe. And if they do get a robe, they use it untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape.
But they don’t glorify themselves or put others down on account of their contentment.
A mendicant who is deft, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient, primordial noble tradition.
Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of alms-food …
Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of lodgings …
Furthermore, a mendicant enjoys meditation and loves to meditate. They enjoy giving up and love to give up.
But they don’t glorify themselves or put down others on account of their love for meditation and giving up.
A mendicant who is deft, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient, primordial noble tradition.
These four noble traditions are primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them.
When a mendicant has these four noble traditions, if they live in the east they prevail over discontent, and discontent doesn’t prevail over them.
If they live in the west …
the north …
the south, they prevail over discontent, and discontent doesn’t prevail over them.
Why is that?
Because a wise one prevails over desire and discontent.
Dissatisfaction doesn’t prevail over a wise one;
for the wise one is not beaten by discontent.
A wise one prevails over discontent,
for the wise one is a beater of discontent.
Who can hold back the dispeller,
who’s thrown away all karma?
Like a pendant of river gold,
who is worthy to criticize them?
Even the gods praise them,
and by Brahmā, too, they’re praised.”

With Visākha, Pañcāli’s Son
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli’s son, was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear, articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out,
and addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants, who was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk?”
“Sir, it was Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli’s son.”
Then the Buddha said to Visākha,
“Good, good, Visākha!
It’s good that you educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, with words that are polished, clear, articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.
Though an astute person is mixed up with fools,

Then Ujjaya the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Does Master Gotama praise sacrifice?”
“Brahmin, I don’t praise all sacrifices.
Nor do I criticize all sacrifices.
Take the kind of sacrifice where cattle, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and various kinds of creatures are slaughtered.
I criticize that kind of violent sacrifice.
Why is that?
Because neither perfected ones nor those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a violent sacrifice.
But take the kind of sacrifice where cattle, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and various kinds of creatures are not slaughtered.
I praise that kind of non-violent sacrifice; for example, a regular gift as an ongoing family sacrifice.
Why is that?
Because perfected ones and those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a non-violent sacrifice.
Horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,
the sacrifices of the ‘stick-casting’,
the ‘royal soma drinking’, and the ‘unbarred’—
these huge violent sacrifices yield no great fruit.
The great sages of good conduct
don’t attend sacrifices
where goats, sheep, and cattle,
and various creatures are killed.
But the great sages of good conduct
do attend non-violent sacrifices
of regular family tradition,
where goats, sheep, and cattle,

An intelligent person should sacrifice like this,
for this sacrifice is very fruitful.
For a sponsor of sacrifices like this,
things get better, not worse.
Such a sacrifice is truly abundant,

It’s when a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters—is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

And how is a person a white lotus ascetic?
It’s when a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—is a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.
That’s how a person is a white lotus ascetic.
And how is a person a pink lotus ascetic?
It’s when a mendicant—with the ending of the five lower fetters—is reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
That’s how a person is a pink lotus ascetic.
And how is a person an exquisite ascetic of ascetics?
It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
That’s how a person is an exquisite ascetic of ascetics.

Queen Mallikā
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then Queen Mallikā went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why in this life some females are ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking;
and poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant?
And why are some females ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking;
but rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious?
And why are some females attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty;
but poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant?
And why are some females attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty; and rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious?”
“Take a female who is irritable and bad-tempered.
Even when criticized a little bit she loses her temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
She doesn’t give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.
And she’s jealous,
envying, resenting, and begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others.
If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking;
and poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant.
Take another female who is irritable and bad-tempered. …
But she does give to ascetics or brahmins …
And she’s not jealous …
If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking;
but rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious.
Take another female who isn’t irritable and bad-tempered. …

And some females are ugly …

When this was said, Queen Mallikā said to the Buddha:
“Sir, in another life I must have been irritable and bad-tempered.
Even when lightly criticized I must have lost my temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
For now I am ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking.
In another life I must have given to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. For now I am rich, affluent, and wealthy.
In another life, I must not have been jealous, envying, resenting, and begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others. For now I am illustrious.
In this royal court I command maidens of the aristocrats, brahmins, and householders.
So, sir, from this day forth I will not be irritable and bad-tempered.
Even when heavily criticized I won’t lose my temper, become annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, or display annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
I will give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.
I will not be jealous, envying, resenting, and begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others.

Overflowing Merit
First: Living Together
At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Madhura and Verañja,
as were several householders, both women and men.
The Buddha left the road and sat at the root of a tree,
where the householders saw him.
They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to them:
“Householders, there are four ways of living together.
What four?
A male zombie living with a female zombie;
a male zombie living with a goddess;
a god living with a female zombie;
a god living with a goddess.
And how does a male zombie live with a female zombie?
It’s when the husband kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, lies, and uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. He’s unethical, of bad character, living at home with his heart full of the stain of stinginess, abusing and insulting ascetics and brahmins.
And the wife is also … unethical, of bad character …
That’s how a male zombie lives with a female zombie.
And how does a male zombie live with a goddess?
It’s when the husband … is unethical, of bad character …
But the wife doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. She’s ethical, of good character, living at home with her heart rid of the stain of stinginess, not abusing and insulting ascetics and brahmins.
That’s how a male zombie lives with a goddess.
And how does a god live with a female zombie?
It’s when the husband … is ethical, of good character …
But the wife … is unethical, of bad character …
That’s how a god lives with a female zombie.
And how does a god live with a goddess?
It’s when the husband … is ethical, of good character …
And the wife is also … ethical, of good character …
That’s how a god lives with a goddess.
These are the four ways of living together.
When both are unethical,
miserly and abusive,
then wife and husband
live together as zombies.
When the husband is unethical,
miserly and abusive,
but the wife is ethical,
kind, rid of stinginess,
she’s a goddess living
with a zombie for a husband.
When the husband is ethical,
kind, rid of stinginess,
but the wife is unethical,
miserly and abusive,
she’s a zombie living
with a god for a husband.
When both are faithful and kind,
disciplined, living righteously,
then wife and husband
say nice things to each other.
They get all the things they need,
so they live at ease.
Their enemies are downhearted,
when both are equal in ethics.
Having practiced the teaching here,
both equal in precepts and observances,
they delight in the heavenly realm,

There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life.
There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision.
There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness.
There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements.
And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.
This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life.
And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision?
It’s when a mendicant focuses on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day,
regardless of whether it’s night or day.
And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.
This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision.
And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness?
It’s when a mendicant knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
They know perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness.
And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements?
It’s when a mendicant meditates observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates.
‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.
Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.
Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.
Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’
This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements.
These are the four ways of developing immersion further.
And it was in this connection that I said in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Puṇṇaka’:
‘Having assessed the world high and low,
they’re not shaken by anything in the world.

There are dark deeds with dark results;
bright deeds with bright results;

And what are dark deeds with dark results?
It’s when someone makes hurtful choices by way of body, speech, and mind.
Having made these choices, they’re reborn in a hurtful world,
where hurtful contacts touch them.
Touched by hurtful contacts, they experience hurtful feelings that are exclusively painful—like the beings in hell.
These are called dark deeds with dark results.
And what are bright deeds with bright results?
It’s when someone makes pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind.
Having made these choices, they’re reborn in a pleasing world,

Touched by pleasing contacts, they experience pleasing feelings that are exclusively happy—like the gods replete with glory.
These are called bright deeds with bright results.

It’s when someone makes both hurtful and pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind.
Having made these choices, they are reborn in a world that is both hurtful and pleasing,
where hurtful and pleasing contacts touch them.
Touched by both hurtful and pleasing contacts, they experience both hurtful and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and pain—like humans, some gods, and some beings in the underworld.
These are called dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results.
And what are neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds?

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis at the village of Bhaṇḍa.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,

The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, not understanding and not penetrating four things, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time.
What four?
Noble ethics,
immersion,
and freedom.
These noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the attachment to continued existence is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“Ethics, immersion, and wisdom,
and the supreme freedom:
these things have been understood
by Gotama the renowned.
And so the Buddha, having insight,
explained this teaching to the mendicants.

The fears of guilt, shame, punishment, and going to a bad place.
And what, mendicants, is the fear of guilt?
It’s when someone reflects:
‘If I were to do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, wouldn’t I blame myself for my conduct?’
Being afraid of guilt, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure.
This is called the fear of guilt.
And what, mendicants, is the fear of shame?
It’s when someone reflects:
‘If I were to do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, wouldn’t others blame me for my conduct?’
Being afraid of shame, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure.
This is called the fear of shame.
And what, mendicants, is the fear of punishment?
It’s when someone sees that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—
whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘demon’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘grass blades’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.
They think:
‘If I were to do the same kind of bad deed, the kings would punish me in the same way.’ …
Being afraid of punishment, they don’t steal the belongings of others.
They give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure.
This is called the fear of punishment.
And what, mendicants, is the fear of rebirth in a bad place?
It’s when someone reflects:
‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad result in the next life.
If I were to do such bad things, when my body breaks up, after death, I’d be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’
Being afraid of rebirth in a bad place, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure.
This is called the fear of rebirth in a bad place.
These are the four fears.”

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him:
“Householder, these four things that are likable, desirable, and agreeable are hard to get in the world.
What four?
The first thing is the wish: ‘May wealth come to me by legitimate means!’
The second thing, having got wealth by legitimate means, is the wish: ‘May fame come to me, together with my family and teachers.’
The third thing, having got wealth and fame, is the wish: ‘May I live long, keeping alive for a long time!’
The fourth thing, having got wealth, fame, and long life, is the wish: ‘When my body breaks up, after death, may I be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm!’
These are the four things that are likable, desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the world.
These next four things lead to the getting of those four things.
What four?
Accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.
And what is accomplishment in faith?
It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
This is called accomplishment in faith.
And what is accomplishment in ethics?
It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
This is called accomplishment in ethics.
And what is accomplishment in generosity?
It’s when a noble disciple lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
This is called accomplishment in generosity.
And what is accomplishment in wisdom?
When your heart is mastered by covetousness and immoral greed, you do what you shouldn’t, and fail to do what you should.
Your fame and happiness fall to dust.
When your heart is mastered by ill will …
dullness and drowsiness …
restlessness and remorse …
doubt, you do what you shouldn’t, and fail to do what you should.
Your fame and happiness fall to dust.
Knowing that ‘covetousness and immoral greed are corruptions of the mind’, that noble disciple gives them up.
Knowing that ‘ill will …’ …
‘dullness and drowsiness …’ …
‘restlessness and remorse …’ …
‘doubt is a corruption of the mind’, that noble disciple gives it up.
When a noble disciple has given up these things,
they’re called ‘a noble disciple of great wisdom, of widespread wisdom, who sees what matters, and is accomplished in wisdom’.
This is called accomplishment in wisdom.
These are the four things that lead to the getting of the four things that are likable, desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the world.
There are four deeds of substance that a noble disciple does with the legitimate wealth he has earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow.
What four?
To start with, with his legitimate wealth he makes himself happy and pleased, keeping himself properly happy.
He makes his mother and father happy …
He makes his children, partners, bondservants, workers, and staff happy …
He makes his friends and colleagues happy …
This is his first solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere.
Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he defends himself against threats from such things as fire, flood, rulers, bandits, or unloved heirs.
He keeps himself safe.
This is his second solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere.
Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes five spirit-offerings:
to relatives, guests, ancestors, king, and deities.
This is his third solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere.
Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins—those who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves—that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.
This is his fourth solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere.
These are the four deeds of substance that a noble disciple does with the legitimate wealth he has earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow.
Whatever wealth is spent on something other than these four deeds of substance is said to be not a solid or substantive investment, and not used in the appropriate sphere.
But whatever wealth is spent on these four deeds of substance is said to be a solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere.
‘I’ve enjoyed my wealth, supporting those who depend on me;
I’ve overcome losses;
I’ve given uplifting religious donations;
and made the five spirit-offerings.
I have served the ethical and
disciplined spiritual practitioners.
I’ve achieved the purpose
for which an astute lay person
wishes to gain wealth.
I don’t regret what I’ve done.’
A mortal person who recollects this
stands firm in the teaching of the noble ones.
They’re praised in this life,
and they depart to rejoice in heaven.”

“Kesi, what do you do with a horse in training that doesn’t follow these forms of training?”
“In that case, sir, I kill it.
Why is that?
So that I don’t disgrace my tradition.
But sir, the Buddha is the supreme guide for those who wish to train.
Just how do you guide a person in training?”
“Kesi, I guide a person in training sometimes gently, sometimes harshly, and sometimes both gently and harshly.
The gentle way is this:
‘This is good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. This is the result of good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. This is life as a god. This is life as a human.’
The harsh way is this:
‘This is bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. This is the result of bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. This is life in hell. This is life as an animal. This is life as a ghost.’

“In that case, Kesi, I kill them.”
“Sir, it’s not appropriate for the Buddha to kill living creatures.
And yet you say
you kill them.”
“It’s true, Kesi,
it’s not appropriate for a Realized One to kill living creatures.
But when a person in training doesn’t follow any of these forms of training, the Realized One doesn’t think they’re worth advising or instructing, and neither do their sensible spiritual companions.
For it is killing in the training of the Noble One
when the Realized One doesn’t think they’re worth advising or instructing, and neither do their sensible spiritual companions.”
“Well, they’re definitely dead

At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Ukkaṭṭhā and Setabya,
as was the brahmin Doṇa.
Doṇa saw that the Buddha’s footprints had thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail.
It occurred to him,
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
Surely these couldn’t be the footprints of a human being?”
The Buddha had left the road and sat at the root of a tree cross-legged, with his body straight and his mindfulness established right there.
Then Doṇa, following the Buddha’s footprints, saw him sitting at the tree root—impressive and inspiring, with peaceful faculties and mind, attained to the highest self-control and serenity, like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties.
He went up to the Buddha and said to him:
“Sir, might you be a god?”
“I will not be a god, brahmin.”
“Might you be a fairy?”
“I will not be a fairy.”
“Might you be a native spirit?”
“I will not be a native spirit.”
“Might you be a human?”
“I will not be a human.”
“When asked whether you might be a god, fairy, native spirit, or human,
you answer that you will not be any of these.
What then might you be?”
“Brahmin, if I had not given up defilements I might have become a god … a fairy … a native spirit … or a human. But I have given up those defilements, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.
Suppose there was a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Though it sprouted and grew in the water, it would rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to it.
In the same way, though I was born and grew up in the world, I live having mastered the world, and the world does not cling to me.
Remember me, brahmin, as a Buddha.
I could have been reborn as a god,
or as a fairy flying through the sky.
I could have become a native spirit,
or returned as a human.
But the defilements that could bring about these rebirths
I’ve ended, smashed, and gutted.

the world doesn’t cling to me,

‘Brahmā’ is a term for your parents.
‘First teachers’ is a term for your parents.
‘Old deities’ is a term for your parents.
‘Worthy of an offering dedicated to the gods’ is a term for your parents.
Why is that?
Parents are very helpful to their children, they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world.
Parents are said to be ‘Brahmā’
and ‘first teachers’.
They’re worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods from their children,
for they love their offspring.
Therefore an astute person
would revere them and honor them
with food and drink,
clothes and bedding,
by anointing and bathing,
and by washing their feet.
Because they look after
their parents like this,
they’re praised in this life by the astute,
and they depart to rejoice in heaven.”

Insight
With Māluṅkyaputta
Then Venerable Māluṅkyaputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
“Well now, Māluṅkyaputta, what are we to say to the young monks,
when even an old man like you, elderly and senior, asks the Realized One for brief advice?”
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!”
“Māluṅkyaputta, there are four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant.
What four?
For the sake of robes,
alms-food,
or rebirth in this or that state.
These are the four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant.
That craving is given up by a mendicant, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. Then they’re called a mendicant who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.”
When Māluṅkyaputta had been given this advice by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then Māluṅkyaputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Māluṅkyaputta became one of the perfected.

Extra Effort
“Mendicants, these four people are found in the world.
What four?
One person becomes fully extinguished in the present life by making extra effort.
One person becomes fully extinguished when the body breaks up by making extra effort.
One person becomes fully extinguished in the present life without making extra effort.
One person becomes fully extinguished when the body breaks up without making extra effort.
And how does a person become fully extinguished in the present life by making extra effort?
It’s when a mendicant meditates observing the ugliness of the body, perceives the repulsiveness of food, perceives dissatisfaction with the whole world, observes the impermanence of all conditions,
and has well established the perception of their own death.
They rely on these five powers of a trainee:
faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.
And these five faculties manifest in them strongly:
faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.
Because of the strength of the five faculties, they become fully extinguished in the present life by making extra effort.

Brahmins
With Vassakāra
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then Vassakāra the brahmin, a chief minister of Magadha, went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, could a bad person know of a bad person:
‘This fellow is a bad person’?”
“That’s impossible, brahmin, it can’t happen.”
“Could a bad person know of a good person:
‘This fellow is a good person’?”
“That too is impossible, it can’t happen.”
“Master Gotama, could a good person know of a good person:
‘This fellow is a good person’?”
“That, brahmin, is possible.”
“Could a good person know of a bad person:
‘This fellow is a bad person’?”
“That too is possible.”
“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by Master Gotama:
‘It’s impossible, it can’t happen, that a bad person could know …
But it is possible that a good person could know …’
Once, members of the brahmin Todeyya’s assembly were going on complaining about others:
‘This King Eḷeyya is a fool to be so devoted to Rāmaputta. He even shows him the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him.
And these king’s men are fools too—
Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindakī, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa—for they show the same kind of deference to Rāmaputta.’
Then the brahmin Todeyya reasoned with them like this:
‘What do you think, sirs?
When it comes to the various duties and speeches, isn’t King Eḷeyya astute, even better than the experts?’
‘That’s true, sir.’
‘It’s because Rāmaputta is even more astute and expert than King Eḷeyya that the king is so devoted to him. That’s why he even shows Rāmaputta the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him.
What do you think, sirs?

‘That’s true, sir.’
‘It’s because Rāmaputta is even more astute and expert than the king’s men that they have such devotion to him. …

It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by Master Gotama:
‘It’s impossible, it can’t happen, that a bad person could know …
But it is possible that a good person could know …
Well, now, Master Gotama, I must go.
I have many duties, and much to do.”
“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.”
Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.

“Mendicants, you can expect four benefits when the teachings have been followed by ear, reinforced by recitation, examined by the mind, and well comprehended theoretically.

Take a mendicant who memorizes the teaching—
statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.
They’ve followed those teachings by ear, reinforced them by recitation, examined them by the mind, and well comprehended them theoretically.
But they die unmindful and are reborn in one of the orders of gods.
Being happy there, passages of the teaching come back to them.

But they die unmindful and are reborn in one of the orders of gods.
Though they’re happy there, passages of the teaching don’t come back to them.
However, a mendicant with psychic powers, who has achieved mastery of the mind, teaches Dhamma to the assembly of gods.
They think:
‘I used to lead the spiritual life in this same teaching and training.’
Memory comes up slowly,
but then that being quickly reaches distinction.
Suppose a person was skilled in the sound of drums.
While traveling along a road they hear the sound of drums.
They wouldn’t have any doubts or uncertainties about whether
that was the sound of drums or not.
They’d just conclude, ‘That’s the sound of drums.’

“Mendicants, there are these four efforts.

The efforts to restrain, to give up, to develop, and to preserve.
And what, mendicants, is the effort to restrain?
It’s when you generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise.
This is called the effort to restrain.
And what, mendicants, is the effort to give up?
It’s when you generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities are given up.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to develop?
It’s when you generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise.

And what, mendicants, is the effort to preserve?
It’s when you generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development.
This is called the effort to preserve.

With the Stream
“These four people are found in the world.
What four?
A person who goes with the stream; a person who goes against the stream; a steadfast person; and a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore.
And who is the person who goes with the stream?
It’s a person who takes part in sensual pleasures and does bad deeds.
This is called a person who goes with the stream.
And who is the person who goes against the stream?
It’s a person who doesn’t take part in sensual pleasures or do bad deeds. They live the full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness, weeping, with tearful faces.
This is called a person who goes against the stream.
And who is the steadfast person?
It’s a person who, with the ending of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
This is called a steadfast person.
And who is a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore?
It’s a person who realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
This is called a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore.
These are the four people found in the world.
All those people with unbridled sensuality,
not free of lust, enjoying sensual pleasures in this life:
again and again, they return to birth and old age;
those who go with the stream are sunk in craving.
So a wise one in this life, with mindfulness established,
doesn’t take part in sensual pleasures and bad deeds.
In pain they’d give up sensual pleasures:
they call that person ‘one who goes against the stream’.
Someone who’s given up five corruptions,
a perfect trainee, not liable to decline,
who’s mastered their mind, with faculties immersed in samādhi,
that’s called ‘a steadfast person’.
The sage who has comprehended all things, high and low,
cleared them and ended them, so they are no more;
they’ve completed the spiritual journey, and gone to the end of the world,
they’re called ‘one who has gone beyond’.”

So I have heard.
At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
And then a certain nun addressed a man,
“Please, mister, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the nun named so-and-so is sick, suffering, and gravely ill.
She bows with her head to your feet.’ And then say:
‘Sir, please go to the nuns’ quarters to visit that nun out of compassion.’”
“Yes, ma’am,” that man replied.
He did as the nun asked.
Ānanda consented in silence.
Then Ānanda robed up and went to the nuns’ quarters to visit that nun, taking his bowl and robe.
That nun saw Ānanda coming off in the distance.
She wrapped herself up from head to foot and laid down on her cot.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to her, and sat down on the seat spread out.
Then Ānanda said to the nun:
“Sister, this body is produced by food. Relying on food,
you should give up food.
This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving,
you should give up craving.
This body is produced by conceit. Relying on conceit,
you should give up conceit.
This body is produced by sex.
The Buddha spoke of breaking off everything to do with sex.
‘This body is produced by food. Relying on food,
you should give up food.’ This is what I said,
but why did I say it?
Take a mendicant who reflects properly on the food that they eat:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice.
In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
After some time, relying on food, they give up food.
That’s why I said what I said.
‘This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving,
you should give up craving.’ This is what I said,
but why did I say it?
Take a mendicant who hears this:
‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’
They think:
‘Oh, when will I too realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. …’
After some time, relying on craving, they give up craving.
That's why I said what I said.
‘This body is produced by conceit. Relying on conceit,
you should give up conceit.’ This is what I said,
but why did I say it?
Take a mendicant who hears this:
‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’
They think:
‘Well, that venerable can realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. …
Why can’t I?’
After some time, relying on conceit, they give up conceit.
That’s why I said what I said.
‘This body is produced by sex.
The Buddha spoke of breaking off everything to do with sex.’”
Then that nun rose from her cot, placed her robe over one shoulder, bowed with her head at Ānanda’s feet, and said,
“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to act in that way.
Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I can restrain myself in future.”
“Indeed, sister, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way.
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”
