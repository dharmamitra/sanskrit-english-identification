Venerable nanda together with several mendicants went to the Aciravati River to batheWhen he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himselfThen a certain mendicant went up to Venerable nanda and said to himReverend nanda when the Buddha declared that Devadatta wasgoing to a place of loss to hell there to remain for an eon irredeemable did he do so after wholeheartedly deliberating or was this just a way of speakingYoure right reverend thats how the Buddha declared itThen Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenednanda that mendicant must be junior recently gone forth or else a foolish incompetent senior mendicantHow on earth can he take something that I have declared definitively to be ambiguousI do not see a single other person concerning whom I have made a declaration about after giving such wholehearted deliberation as DevadattaAs long as I saw even a fraction of a hairs tip of goodness in

declared that he wasgoing to a place of loss to hell there to remain for an eon irredeemableSuppose there was a sewer deeper than a mans height full to the brim with fecesand someone was sunk into it

absorption  second absorption  third absorptionWhen this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to blissful meditation in this very lifeFurthermore a mendicant focuses on the perception of light concentrating on the perception of day regardless of whether it is night or dayAnd so with an open and unenveloped heart they develop a mind thats full of radianceWhen this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to knowledge and visionFurthermore a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filthIn this body there is head hair body hair nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery undigested food feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva snot synovial fluid urineWhen this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to giving

reasons is for those with immersion not for those without immersionAnd true knowledge of corruption cleansing and emergence regarding the absorptions liberations immersions and attainments is for

things seen heard thought and known he is the poised oneAnd I say that there is no better or finer poise than thisSuch a one does not take anythingseen heard or thought to be ultimately true or
