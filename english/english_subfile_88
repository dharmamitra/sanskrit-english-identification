Second Anxiety Because of Grasping
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants I will teach you how grasping leads to anxiety and how not grasping leads to freedom from anxiety
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
And how does grasping lead to anxiety
Its when an uneducated ordinary person regards form like this This is mine I am this this is my self
But that form of theirs decays and perishes
which gives rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
They regard feeling 
perception 
consciousness like this This is mine I am this this is my self
But that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes
which gives rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Thats how grasping leads to anxiety
And how does not grasping lead to freedom from anxiety
Its when an educated noble disciple regards form like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
When that form of theirs decays and perishes
it doesnt give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress

Reverend Sāriputta what things should an educated mendicant properly attend to
An educated mendicant should properly attend to these five grasping aggregates as impermanent  as notself

That is the grasping aggregates of form feeling perception choices and consciousness
An educated mendicant should properly attend to these five grasping aggregates as impermanent  as notself

Its possible that a mendicant streamenterer who regards the five grasping aggregates in this way will realize the fruit of oncereturn

Its possible that a mendicant nonreturner who regards the five grasping aggregates in this way will realize the fruit of perfection 
But Reverend Sāriputta what things should a perfected one properly attend to
Reverend Koṭṭhita a perfected one should properly attend to the five grasping aggregates as impermanent as suffering as diseased as an abscess as a dart as misery as an affliction as alien as falling apart as empty as notself
A perfected one has nothing more to do and nothing that needs improvement
Still these things when developed and cultivated lead to blissful meditation in the present life and also to mindfulness and situational awareness

A Full Moon Night
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
Now at that time it was the sabbaththe full moon on the fifteenth dayand the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks
Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat arranged their robe over one shoulder raised their joined palms toward the Buddha and said
Sir Id like to ask the Buddha about a certain point if youd take the time to answer
Well then mendicant take your own seat and ask what you wish
Yes sir replied that mendicant He took his seat and said to the Buddha
Sir are these the five grasping aggregates that is
form feeling perception choices and consciousness
Yes they are replied the Buddha
Saying Good sir that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said Then he asked another question
But sir what is the root of these five grasping aggregates
These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire 
But sir is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another
Neither Rather the desire and greed for them is the grasping there
Saying Good sir that mendicant asked another question
But sir can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates
There can said the Buddha
Its when someone thinks
In the future may I be of such form such feeling such perception such choices or such consciousness
Thats how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates
Saying Good sir that mendicant asked another question
Sir what is the scope of the term aggregates as applied to the aggregates
Any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near this is called the aggregate of form
Any kind of feeling at all 
Any kind of perception at all 
Any kind of choices at all 
Any kind of consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near this is called the aggregate of consciousness
Thats the scope of the term aggregates as applied to the aggregates
Saying Good sir that mendicant asked another question
What is the cause sir what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found
What is the cause what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling 
perception 
consciousness is found
The four primary elements are the reason why the aggregate of form is found
Contact is the reason why the aggregates of feeling
perception
and choices are found
Name and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found
Saying Good sir that mendicant asked another question
Sir how does identity view come about
Its because an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons
They regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in form
consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousness
Thats how identity view comes about
Saying Good sir that mendicant  asked another question
But sir how does identity view not come about
Its because an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons
They dont regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in form
They dont regard feeling 
perception 
consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousness
Thats how identity view does not come about
Saying Good sir that mendicant  asked another question
Sir whats the gratification the drawback and the escape when it comes to form
perception
and consciousness
The pleasure and happiness that arise from form this is its gratification
That form is impermanent suffering and perishable this is its drawback
Removing and giving up desire and greed for form this is its escape
The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling 
perception 
consciousness this is its gratification
That consciousness is impermanent suffering and perishable this is its drawback
Removing and giving up desire and greed for consciousness this is its escape
Saying Good sir that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said Then he asked another question
Sir how does one know and see so that theres no ego possessiveness or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli
One truly sees any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near
all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
They truly see any kind of feeling 
perception 
consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understanding
This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Thats how to know and see so that theres no ego possessiveness or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli
Now at that time one of the mendicants had the thought
So it seems good sir that form feeling perception choices and consciousness are notself
Then what self will the deeds done by notself affect
Then the Buddha knowing what that monk was thinking addressed the mendicants
Its possible that some foolish person hereunknowing and ignorant their mind dominated by cravingthinks they can overstep the teachers instructions They think
So it seems good sir that form feeling perception choices and consciousness are notself
Then what self will the deeds done by notself affect
Now mendicants you have been educated by me in questioning with regards to all these things in all such cases
What do you think mendicants
Is form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
So you should truly see 
Seeing this 
They understand  there is no return to any state of existence
Two on the aggregates exactly the same and can there be
on the term and on the cause

gratification and that with consciousness
these are the ten questions

At Sāvatthī
Mendicants transmigration has no known beginning
No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
Suppose a dog on a leash was tethered to a strong post or pillar
Whether walking standing sitting or lying down it stays right beside that post or pillar
In the same way an uneducated ordinary person regards form like this This is mine I am this this is my self
consciousness like this This is mine I am this this is my self
When walking they walk right beside the five grasping aggregates
When standing 
lying down they lie down right beside the five grasping aggregates
So you should regularly check your own mind
For a long time this mind has been corrupted by greed hate and delusion
Sentient beings are corrupted because the mind is corrupted
Sentient beings are purified because the mind is purified

and tried to rise on his cot
But the Buddha said to him
Its all right Assaji dont get up
There are some seats spread out by others I will sit there
He sat on the seat spread out and said
Assaji I hope youre keeping well I hope youre alright And I hope the pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growing
Sir Im not all right Im not getting by My pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing is evident not its fading
I hope you dont have any remorse or regret
Indeed sir I have no little remorse and regret
I hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct
No sir I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct
In that case Assaji why do you have remorse and regret
Sir before my time of illness I meditated having completely stilled the physical process But now I cant get immersion
Since I cant get immersion I think
May I not decline

Ways of Regarding
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants whatever ascetics and brahmins regard various kinds of things as self all regard the five grasping aggregates or one of them
What five
Its when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons
They regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in form
consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousness
So theyre not rid of this way of regarding things and the conceit I am
As long as theyre not rid of the conceit I am the five faculties are conceived
the eye ear nose tongue and body
The mind thoughts and the element of ignorance are all present
Struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance an uneducated ordinary person thinks I am
I am this
I will be
I will not be
I will have form
I will be formless
I will be percipient
I will not be percipient
I will be neither percipient nor nonpercipient
The five faculties stay right where they are
But an educated noble disciple gives up ignorance about them and gives rise to knowledge
With the fading away of ignorance and the arising of knowledge they dont think I am
I am this
I will be
I will not be
I will be neither percipient nor nonpercipient

A Seed
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants there are five kinds of plants propagated from seeds
What five
Plants propagated from roots stems cuttings or joints and those from regular seeds are the fifth
Suppose these five kinds of plants propagated from seeds were intact unspoiled not weatherdamaged fertile and wellkept But theres no soil or water
Then would these five kinds of plants propagated from seeds reach growth increase and maturity
No sir
Suppose these five kinds of plants propagated from seeds were intact unspoiled not weatherdamaged fertile and wellkept And there is soil and water
Then would these five kinds of plants propagated from seeds reach growth increase and maturity
Yes sir
The four grounds of consciousness should be seen as like the earth element
Relishing and greed should be seen as like the water element
Consciousness with its fuel should be seen as like the five kinds of plants propagated from seeds
As long as consciousness remains it would remain involved with form supported by form grounded on form And with a sprinkle of relishing it would grow increase and mature
Or consciousness would remain involved with feeling 
Or consciousness would remain involved with perception 
Or as long as consciousness remains it would remain involved with choices supported by choices grounded on choices And with a sprinkle of relishing it would grow increase and mature
Mendicants suppose you say
Apart from form feeling perception and choices I will describe the coming and going of consciousness its passing away and reappearing its growth increase and maturity That is not possible
If a mendicant has given up greed for the form element
the support is cut off and there is no foundation for consciousness
If a mendicant has given up greed for the feeling element 
perception element 
choices element 
consciousness element
the support is cut off and there is no foundation for consciousness
Since that consciousness does not become established and does not grow with no power to regenerate it is freed
Being free its stable
Being stable its content
Being content theyre not anxious
Not being anxious they personally become extinguished
They understand Rebirth is ended  there is no return to any state of existence

At Pārileyya
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas Monastery
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Kosambi for alms
After the meal on his return from almsround he set his lodgings in order himself Taking his bowl and robe without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha he set out to go wandering alone with no companion
Then not long after the Buddha had left one of the mendicants went to Venerable nanda and told him what had happened
nanda said Reverend when the Buddha leaves like this it means he wants to stay alone
At this time noone should follow him
Then the Buddha traveling stage by stage arrived at Pārileyya
where he stayed at the root of a sacred sal tree
Then several mendicants went up to Venerable nanda and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side and said to him
Reverend its been a long time since weve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha
We wish to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha
Then Venerable nanda together with those mendicants went to Pārileyya to see the Buddha They bowed and sat down to one side
and the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired them with a Dhamma talk
Now at that time one of the monks had the thought
How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life
Then the Buddha knowing what that monk was thinking addressed the mendicants
Mendicants Ive taught the Dhamma analytically
Ive analytically taught the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
the four right efforts
the four bases of psychic power
the five faculties
the five powers
the seven awakening factors
and the noble eightfold path
Thats how Ive taught the Dhamma analytically
Though Ive taught the Dhamma analytically still a certain mendicant present here has this thought
How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life
And how mendicants do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life
Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons
They regard form as self
But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon
And whats the source origin birthplace and inception of that conditioned phenomenon
When an uneducated ordinary person is struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance craving arises
That conditioned phenomenon is born from that
So that conditioned phenomenon is impermanent conditioned and dependently originated

Even those wanderers of the past Vassa and Bhañña of Ukkalā who taught the doctrines of nocause inaction and nihilism didnt imagine that these three scopes of language should be criticized or rejected
Why is that
For fear of blame attack and condemnation

Second Hāliddikāni
So I have heard
At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain
Then the householder Hāliddikāni went up to Venerable Mahākaccāna  and asked him
Sir this was said by the Buddha in The Questions of Sakka
Those ascetics and brahmins who are freed due to the ending of craving have reached the ultimate goal the ultimate sanctuary the ultimate spiritual life the ultimate end and are best among gods and humans
How should we see the detailed meaning of the Buddhas brief statement
Householder consider any desire greed relishing and craving for the form element any attraction grasping mental fixation insistence and underlying tendencies With the ending fading away cessation giving away and letting go of that the mind is said to be well freed
Consider any desire greed relishing and craving for the feeling element 
the perception element 
the choices element 
the consciousness element any attraction grasping mental fixation insistence and underlying tendencies With the ending fading away cessation giving away and letting go of that the mind is said to be well freed
So householder thats how to understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief in The Questions of Sakka
Those ascetics and brahmins who are freed due to the ending of craving have reached the ultimate goal the ultimate sanctuary the ultimate spiritual life the ultimate end and are best among gods and humans

There the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment
It might not be and it might not be mine It will not be and it will not be mine
A mendicant who makes such a resolution can cut off the five lower fetters
When he said this one of the mendicants asked the Buddha
But sir how
can a mendicant who makes such a resolution cut off the five lower fetters
Mendicant take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in their teaching Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in their teaching
They regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in form
consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousness

They dont regard form as self

Its because of the disappearance of form feeling perception choices and consciousness that a mendicant who makes such a resolution
It might not be and it might not be mine It will not be and it will not be mine
can cut off the five lower fetters
Sir a mendicant who makes such a resolution can cut off the five lower fetters
But how are they to know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life
Mendicant an uneducated ordinary person worries about things that arent a worry
For an uneducated ordinary person worries
It might not be and it might not be mine It will not be and it will not be mine
An educated noble disciple doesnt worry about things that arent a worry
For an educated noble disciple doesnt worry
It might not be and it might not be mine It will not be and it will not be mine
As long as consciousness remains it would remain involved with form supported by form founded on form And with a sprinkle of relishing it would grow increase and mature
Or consciousness would remain involved with feeling 
Or consciousness would remain involved with perception 
Or consciousness would remain involved with choices supported by choices grounded on choices And with a sprinkle of relishing it would grow increase and mature
Mendicants suppose you say
Apart from form feeling perception and choices I will describe the coming and going of consciousness its passing away and reappearing its growth increase and maturity That is not possible
If a mendicant has given up greed for the form element the support is cut off and there is no foundation for consciousness
If a mendicant has given up greed for the feeling element 
perception element 
choices element 
consciousness element the support is cut off and there is no foundation for consciousness
Since that consciousness does not become established and does not grow with no power to regenerate it is freed
Being free its stable
Being stable its content
Being content theyre not anxious
Not being anxious they personally become extinguished
They understand Rebirth is ended  there is no return to any state of existence
The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this

Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood
Wandering in search of heartwood theyd take a sharp axe and enter a forest
There theyd see a big banana tree straight and young and grown free of defects
Theyd cut it down at the base cut off the top and unroll the coiled sheaths
But they wouldnt even find sapwood much less heartwood
And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it examining it carefully
And it would appear to them as completely void hollow and insubstantial For what substance could there be in a banana tree

For if form were self it wouldnt lead to affliction And you could compel form
May my form be like this May it not be like that

May my form be like this May it not be like that

Senior Mendicants

At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Kosambi in Ghositas Monastery
Now at that time Venerable Khemaka was staying in the Jujube Tree Monastery and he was sick suffering gravely ill
In the late afternoon those senior mendicants came out of retreat and addressed Venerable Dāsaka
Please Reverend Dāsaka go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him
Reverend Khemaka the seniors
hope youre keeping well they hope youre alright They hope that your pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growing
Yes reverends replied Dāsaka He went to Khemaka and said to him

Please Reverend Dāsaka go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him
Reverend Khemaka the seniors say that
these five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha that is
the grasping aggregates of form feeling perception choices and consciousness
Do you regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self

I do not regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self

Bring my staff

Then Venerable Khemaka leaning on a staff went to those senior mendicants and exchanged greetings with them
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side

Although a noble disciple has given up the five lower fetters they still have a lingering residue of the conceit I am the desire I am and the underlying tendency I am which has not been eradicated
After some time they meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates
Such is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of form
Such is feeling 
Such is perception 
Such are choices 
Such is consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousness
As they do so that lingering residue is eradicated
Suppose there was a cloth that was dirty and soiled so the owners give it to a launderer
The launderer kneads it thoroughly with salt lye and cow dung and rinses it in clear water
Although that cloth is clean and bright it still has a lingering scent of salt lye or cow dung that had not been eradicated
The launderer returns it to its owners who store it in a chest permeated with scent
And that lingering scent would be eradicated

As they do so that lingering residue is eradicated
When he said this the senior mendicants said to Venerable Khemaka
We didnt want to trouble Venerable Khemaka with our questions But youre capable of explaining teaching advocating establishing disclosing analyzing and clarifying the Buddhas instructions in detail
And thats just what youve done

Being free its stable
Being stable its content
Being content theyre not anxious

The Lion
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants towards evening the lion king of beasts emerges from his den yawns looks all around the four directions and roars his lions roar three times Then he sets out on the hunt
And whatever animals hear the roar of the lion king of beasts are typically filled with fear awe and terror They return to their lairs be they in a hole the water or a wood and the birds take to the air
Even the royal elephants bound with strong harness in the villages towns and capital cities break apart their bonds and urinate and defecate in terror as they flee here and there
Thats how powerful is the lion king of beasts among animals how illustrious and mighty
In the same way when a Realized One arises in the worldperfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedhe teaches the Dhamma
Such is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of form
Such is feeling 
Such is perception 
Such are choices 
Such is consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousness
Now there are gods who are longlived beautiful and very happy living for ages in their divine palaces When they hear this teaching by the Realized One theyre typically filled with fear awe and terror
Oh no It turns out were impermanent though we thought we were permanent
It turns out we dont last though we thought we were everlasting
It turns out were shortlived though we thought we were eternal
It turns out that were impermanent not lasting shortlived and included within identity
Thats how powerful is the Realized One in the world with its gods how illustrious and mighty
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
The Buddha the teacher without a peer
in all the world with its gods
rolls forth the Wheel of Dhamma
from his own insight
identity its cessation
the origin of identity
and the noble eightfold path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
And then the longlived gods
so beautiful and glorious
are afraid and full of terror
like the other beasts when they hear a lion
We havent transcended identity
It turns out were impermanent
So they say when they hear the word
of the perfected one free and poised

Then Mahāli the Licchavi went up to the Buddha  and said to him
Sir Pūraṇa Kassapa says this
There is no cause or condition for the corruption of sentient beings
Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or reason
Theres no cause or condition for the purification of sentient beings
Sentient beings are purified without cause or reason
What does the Buddha say about this
Mahāli there is a cause and condition for the corruption of sentient beings
Sentient beings are corrupted with cause and reason
There is a cause and condition for the purification of sentient beings
Sentient beings are purified with cause and reason
But sir what is the cause and condition for the corruption of sentient beings
How are sentient beings corrupted with cause and reason
Mahāli if form were exclusively painfulsoaked and steeped in pain and not steeped in pleasuresentient beings wouldnt lust after it
But because form is pleasurablesoaked and steeped in pleasure and not steeped in painsentient beings do lust after it
Since they lust after it theyre caught up in it and so they become corrupted
This is a cause and condition for the corruption of sentient beings

Senior Mendicants
With Channa
At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Channa came out of retreat Taking a key he went from dwelling to dwelling going up to the senior mendicants and saying
May the venerable senior mendicants advise me and instruct me May they give me a Dhamma talk so that I can see the teaching
When he said this the senior mendicants said to Venerable Channa
Reverend Channa form
perception
and consciousness are impermanent
and consciousness are notself
All conditions are impermanent
All things are notself
Then Venerable Channa thought
I too think in this way 
And yet my mind isnt eager confident settled and decided about the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishment
Anxiety and grasping arise
And the mind reverts to thinking
So then who exactly is my self
But that doesnt happen for someone who sees the teaching
Who can teach me the Dhamma so that I can see the teaching
Then Venerable Channa thought
The Venerable nanda is staying near Kosambi in Ghositas Monastery Hes praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions Hes quite capable of teaching me the Dhamma so that I can see the teaching
Since I have so much trust in Venerable nanda
why dont I go to see him
Then Channa set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe set out for Kosambi He went to see nanda in Ghositas Monastery exchanged greetings with him and told him what had happened Then he said
May Venerable nanda advise me and instruct me May he give me a Dhamma talk so that I can see the teaching
Im already delighted with Venerable Channa Hopefully youve opened yourself up and cut through your emotional barrenness
Listen well Channa
You are capable of understanding the teaching
Then right away Channa was filled with lofty rapture and joy
It seems Im capable of understanding the teaching
Reverend Channa I heard and learned in the presence of the Buddha his advice to the mendicant Kaccānagotta
Kaccāna this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and nonexistence
But when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding you wont have the notion of nonexistence regarding the world
And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding you wont have the notion of existence regarding the world
The world is for the most part shackled by attraction grasping and insisting
But ifwhen it comes to this attraction grasping mental fixation insistence and underlying tendencyyou dont get attracted grasp and commit to the notion my self
youll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising and what ceases is just suffering ceasing
Your knowledge about this is independent of others
This is how right view is defined
All exists this is one extreme
All doesnt exist this is the second extreme
Avoiding these two extremes the Realized One teaches by the middle way
Ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are a condition for consciousness 
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over choices cease 
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
Reverend nanda this is how it is when you have such venerables as spiritual companions to advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion
And now that Ive heard this teaching from Venerable nanda Ive comprehended the teaching

Theres not even this much of any incarnation thats permanent everlasting eternal imperishable and will last forever and ever
If there were this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering would not be found
But since there isnt this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering is found
Once upon a time I was an anointed aristocratic king
I had  cities with the capital Kusāvatī the foremost
I had  palaces with the palace named Principle the foremost
I had  chambers with the great foyer the foremost
I had  couches made of ivory or heartwood or gold or silver spread with woolen coversshagpiled or embroidered with flowersand spread with a fine deer hide with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends
I had  bull elephants with gold adornments and banners covered with gold netting with the royal bull elephant named Sabbath the foremost
I had  horses with gold adornments and banners covered with gold netting with the royal steed named Thundercloud the foremost
I had  chariots with gold adornments and banners covered with gold netting with the chariot named Triumph the foremost
I had  jewels with the jeweltreasure the foremost
I had  women with Queen Subhaddā the foremost
I had  aristocrat vassals with the counselortreasure the foremost
I had  milk cows with silken reins and bronze pails
I had  fine cloths of linen cotton silk and wool
I had  servings of food which were presented to me as offerings in the morning and evening
Of those  cities I only stayed in one the capital Kusāvatī
Of those  mansions I only dwelt in one the Palace of Principle
Of those  chambers I only dwelt in the great foyer
Of those  couches I only used one made of ivory or heartwood or gold or silver
Of those  bull elephants I only rode one the royal bull elephant named Sabbath
Of those  horses I only rode one the royal horse named Thundercloud
Of those  chariots I only rode one the chariot named Triumph
Of those  women I was only served by one a maiden of the aristocratic or merchant classes
Of those  cloths I only wore one pair made of fine linen cotton silk and wool
Of those  servings of food I only had one eating at most a serving of rice and suitable sauce
And so all those conditioned phenomena have passed ceased and perished
So impermanent are conditions
so unstable are conditions
so unreliable are conditions
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditions

Beggars
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
Then the Buddha having dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha for some reason robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Kapilavatthu for alms
He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Great Wood
plunged deep into it and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the days meditation
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
Ive sent the mendicant Saṅgha away
But there are mendicants here who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and training
Not seeing me they may change and fall apart
If a young calf doesnt see its mother it may change and fall apart 
Or if young seedlings dont get water they may change and fall apart
In the same way there are mendicants here who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and training
Not seeing me they may change and fall apart
Why dont I support the mendicant Saṅgha now as I did in the past
Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha
He arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
Thats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy One
The Buddha has sent the mendicant Saṅgha away
But there are mendicants who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and training 
May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha
May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha
May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past
The Buddha consented in silence
Then Brahmā Sahampati knowing that the Buddha had consented bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before vanishing right there
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery where he sat on the seat spread out
Then he used his psychic power to will that the mendicants would come to him timidly alone or in pairs
Those mendicants approached the Buddha timidly bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to them
Mendicants this relying on alms is an extreme lifestyle
The world curses you You beggar walking bowl in hand
Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason
Not because theyve been forced to by kings or bandits or because theyre in debt or threatened or to earn a living
But because theyre swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Theyre swamped by suffering mired in suffering
And they think Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
Thats how this gentleman has gone forth
Yet they covet sensual pleasures theyre infatuated full of ill will and malicious intent They are unmindful lacking situational awareness and immersion with straying mind and undisciplined faculties
Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre burning at both ends and smeared with dung in the middle It couldnt be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness
I say that person is just like this Theyve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life and havent fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life
There are these three unskillful thoughts
Sensual malicious and cruel thoughts
And where do these three unskillful thoughts cease without anything left over
In those who meditate with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation or who develop signless immersion
Just this much is quite enough motivation to develop signless immersion
When signless immersion is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial
There are these two views
Views favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existence
A noble disciple reflects on this
Is there anything in the world that I could grasp without fault
They understand
Theres nothing in the world that I could grasp without fault
For in grasping I would grasp only at form feeling
perception
choices or consciousness
That grasping of mine would be a condition for continued existence
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
What do you think mendicants
Is form permanent or impermanent

But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness

But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus

Senior Mendicants
With Anurādha
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut
Then several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side and said to him
Reverend Anurādha when a Realized One is describing a Realized Onea supreme person highest of people who has reached the highest pointthey describe them in these four ways
After death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist
When they said this Venerable Anurādha said to those wanderers
Reverends when a Realized One is describing a Realized Onea supreme person highest of people who has reached the highest pointthey describe them other than these four ways
After death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist
When he said this the wanderers said to him
This mendicant must be junior recently gone forth or else a foolish incompetent senior mendicant
Then after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him junior and foolish the wanderers got up from their seats and left
Soon after they had left Anurādha thought
If those wanderers were to inquire further
how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth How should I explain in line with his teaching so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him all that had happened
What do you think Anurādha
Is form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir

So you should truly see

In that case Anurādha since you dont acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life is it appropriate to declare

consciousness exists because of grasping consciousness and insisting on consciousness identity view arises
What do you think mendicants
Is form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir 
But by not grasping whats impermanent suffering and perishable would identity view arise
No sir
consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir 
But by not grasping whats impermanent suffering and perishable would identity view arise
No sir

Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha
He is our guide and our refuge
Sir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then mendicants listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
A Realized One a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha gives rise to the unarisen path gives birth to the unborn path and explains the unexplained path They know the path understand the path and are experts in the path
And now the disciples live following the path they acquire it later

The mendicants said to him
Venerable dont socialize with families too often
But that mendicant when spoken to by the mendicants did not stop
And then several mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
The Buddha said
Once upon a time mendicants a cat was standing by an alley or a drain or a dustbin hunting a little mouse thinking
When that little mouse comes out to feed Ill catch it right there and eat it
And then that little mouse came out to feed
The cat caught it and hastily swallowed it without chewing
But that little mouse ate its intestines and mesentery
resulting in death and deadly pain
In the same way take a certain monk who robes up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe enters the village or town for alms without guarding body speech and mind without establishing mindfulness and without restraining the sense faculties
There he sees a female scantily clad with revealing clothes
Lust infects his mind
resulting in death or deadly pain
For it is death in the training of the Noble One to resign the training and return to a lesser life
And it is deadly pain to commit one of the corrupt offenses
for which rehabilitation is possible

The young cubs following the example of the great bull elephants plunged into the lake and pulled up lotus bulbs with their trunks But they didnt wash them thoroughly and while they were still muddy they chewed and swallowed them

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Once upon a time mendicants a certain person left Rājagaha thinking Ill speculate about the world They went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world
Then that person saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk
When he saw this he thought
Ive gone mad really Ive lost my mind
Im seeing things that dont exist in the world
Then that person entered the city and informed a large crowd
Ive gone mad really Ive lost my mind
Im seeing things that dont exist in the world
But how is it that youre mad How have you lost your mind
And what have you seen that doesnt exist in the world
Sirs I left Rājagaha thinking Ill speculate about the world I went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world
Then I saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk
Thats why Im mad thats why Ive lost my mind
And thats what Ive seen that doesnt exist in the world
Well mister youre definitely mad youve definitely lost your mind
And youre seeing things that dont exist in the world
But what that person saw was in fact real not unreal
Once upon a time a battle was fought between the gods and the demons
In that battle the gods won and the demons lost
The defeated and terrified demons entered the demon city through the lotus stalk only to confuse the gods
So mendicants dont speculate about the world
For example the cosmos is eternal or not eternal or finite or infinite the soul and the body are the same thing or they are different things after death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist
Why is that
Because those thoughts arent beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment

Splitting Hairs
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Then Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Vesālī for alms
He saw several Licchavi youths practicing archery They were shooting arrows from a distance through a small keyhole shot after shot without missing
When he saw this he thought
These Licchavi youths really are trained so well trained
in that they shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole shot after shot without missing
Then nanda wandered for alms in Vesālī
After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
What do you think nanda
Which is harder and more challenging
to shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole shot after shot without missing Or to take a horsehair split into seven strands and penetrate one tip with another tip

At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana
There the Buddha addressed the group of five mendicants
Mendicants these two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth
Indulgence in sensual pleasures which is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless And indulgence in selfmortification which is painful ignoble and pointless
Avoiding these two extremes the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment
And what is that middle way of practice
It is simply this noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion
This is that middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment
Now this is the noble truth of suffering
Rebirth is suffering old age is suffering illness is suffering death is suffering association with the disliked is suffering separation from the liked is suffering not getting what you wish for is suffering In brief the five grasping aggregates are suffering
Now this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering
Its the craving that leads to future rebirth mixed up with relishing and greed taking pleasure in various different realms That is
craving for sensual pleasures craving to continue existence and craving to end existence
Now this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering
Its the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over giving it away letting it go releasing it and not adhering to it
Now this is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering

And while this discourse was being spoken the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Venerable Koṇḍañña
Everything that has a beginning has an end
And when the Buddha rolled forth the Wheel of Dhamma the earth gods raised the cry
Near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods the Gods of the Four Great Kings

And so at that moment in that instant the cry soared up to the Brahmā realm
And this galaxy shook and rocked and trembled And an immeasurable magnificent light appeared in the world surpassing the glory of the gods

There are those who dont understand suffering

ceases with nothing left over
And they dont know the path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
They lack the hearts release
as well as the release by wisdom
Unable to make an end

Living Creatures
Suppose a person was to strip all the grass sticks branches and leaves in India gather them together into one pile
and make them into stakes
Then theyd impale the large creatures in the ocean on large stakes the mediumsized creatures on mediumsized stakes and the small creatures on small stakes
They wouldnt run out of sizable creatures in the ocean before
using up all the grass sticks branches and leaves in India
There are far more small creatures in the ocean than this so it wouldnt be feasible to impale them on stakes
Why is that
Because of the small size of those lifeforms

Suppose there was a stone pillar sixteen feet long
Eight feet were buried underground and eight above ground
Even if violent storms were to blow up out of the east the west the north and the south they couldnt make it shake or rock or tremble

With Khemā
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time the nun Khemā was wandering in the land of the Kosalans between Sāvatthī and Sāketa when she took up residence in Toraṇavatthu
Then King Pasenadi was traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī and he too stayed in Toraṇavatthu for a single night
Then King Pasenadi addressed a man
Please mister check if theres a suitable ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu to whom I can pay homage
Yes Your Majesty replied that man He searched all over Toraṇavatthu but he couldnt see a suitable ascetic or brahmin for the king to pay homage to
But he saw that the nun Khemā was staying there
so he went to the king and said to him
Your Majesty theres no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu for the king to pay homage to
But there is the nun Khemā whos a disciple of the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
She has a good reputation as being
astute competent clever learned a brilliant speaker and eloquent
Your Majesty may pay homage to her
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the nun Khemā bowed sat down to one side and said to her
Maam does a Realized One exist after death
Great king this has not been declared by the Buddha
Well then does a Realized One not exist after death
This too has not been declared by the Buddha
Well then does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death
This has not been declared by the Buddha
Well then does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death
This too has not been declared by the Buddha
Maam when asked these questions you say
that this has not been declared by the Buddha
Whats the cause whats the reason why this has not been declared by the Buddha
Well then great king Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think great king
Is there any accountant or fingertallier or reckoner who can count the grains of sand in the Ganges that is
how many grains of sand there are how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of grains of sand
No maam
Is there any accountant or fingertallier or reckoner who can count the water in the ocean that is
how many gallons of water there are how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of gallons of water
No maam
Why is that
Because the ocean is deep immeasurable and hard to fathom
In the same way great king any form by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the future
A Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of form Theyre deep immeasurable and hard to fathom
like the ocean
To say that after death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist none of these apply
Any feeling 
perception 
consciousness by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the future

Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the nun Khemā said Then he got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled her keeping her on his right before leaving
Then on a later occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
He asked the Buddha exactly the same questions he had asked the nun Khemā and received the same answers
He said Its incredible sir its amazing
How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without contradiction when it comes to the chief matter
This one time I went to the nun Khemā and asked her about this matter
And she explained it to me with these words and phrases just like the Buddha

Well now sir I must go

This Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community and teaches a community Hes a wellknown and famous religious founder regarded as holy by many people
When a disciple passes away he declares that
this one is reborn here while that one is reborn there

But as for a disciple who is a supreme person highest of people having reached the highest point when they pass away he doesnt declare that
this one is reborn here while that one is reborn there
Rather he declares that they have
cut off craving untied the fetters and by rightly comprehending conceit have made an end of suffering
I had doubt and uncertainty about that
How on earth can I understand the ascetic Gotamas teaching
Vaccha no wonder youre doubting and uncertain
Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter
I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel not for someone who doesnt grasp fuel
Its like a fire which only burns with fuel not without fuel
In the same way I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel not for someone who doesnt grasp fuel
But when a flame is blown away by the wind what do you say is its fuel then
At such a time I say that its fueled by wind
For the wind is its fuel then
But when someone who is attached has laid down this body and has not been reborn in one of the realms what does Master Gotama say is their fuel then
When someone who is attached has laid down this body Vaccha and has not been reborn in one of the realms I say theyre fueled by craving

Master Kaccāna does a Realized One exist after death
Vaccha this has not been declared by the Buddha
Well then does a Realized One not exist after death
This too has not been declared by the Buddha
Well then does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death
This has not been declared by the Buddha
Well then does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death
This too has not been declared by the Buddha
Master Kaccāna when asked these questions you say that this has not been declared by the Buddha
Whats the cause whats the reason why this has not been declared by the Buddha
In order to describe him as possessing form or formless or percipient or nonpercipient or neither percipient nor nonpercipient there must be some cause or reason for doing so But if that cause and reason were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over
how could you describe him in any such terms
Master Kaccāna how long has it been since you went forth
Not long reverend three years
Well youve learned a lot already let alone what lies ahead

With Anurādha
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut
Then several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side and said to him
Reverend Anurādha when a Realized One is describing a Realized Onea supreme person highest of people who has reached the highest pointthey describe them in these four ways
After death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist
Reverends when a Realized One is describing a Realized Onea supreme person highest of people who has reached the highest pointthey describe them other than these four ways
After death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist
When he said this the wanderers said to him
This mendicant must be junior recently gone forth or else a foolish incompetent senior mendicant
Then after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him junior and foolish the wanderers got up from their seat and left
Soon after they had left Anurādha thought
If those wanderers were to inquire further
how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth How should I explain in line with his teaching so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
What do you think Anurādha
Is form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
Is feeling 
perception 
consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
So Anurādha you should truly see any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Any kind of feeling 
perception 
consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Seeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form feeling perception choices and consciousness
Being disillusioned desire fades away When desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
What do you think Anurādha
Do you regard the Realized One as form
No sir
Do you regard the Realized One as feeling 
perception 
consciousness
No sir
What do you think Anurādha
Do you regard the Realized One as in form
No sir
Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form
No sir
Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling 
or distinct from feeling 
as in perception 
or distinct from perception 
as in choices 
or distinct from choices 
as in consciousness 
or as distinct from consciousness
No sir
What do you think Anurādha
Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form feeling perception choices and consciousness
No sir
What do you think Anurādha
Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form feeling perception choices and consciousness
No sir
In that case Anurādha since you dont acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life is it appropriate to declare
Reverends when a Realized One is describing a Realized Onea supreme person highest of people who has reached the highest pointthey describe them other than these four ways
After death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist
No sir
Good good Anurādha
In the past as today what I describe is suffering and the cessation of suffering

WellSpoken Words
At Sāvatthī
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants speech that has four factors is well spoken not poorly spoken Its blameless and is not criticized by sensible people
What four
Its when a mendicant speaks well not poorly they speak on the teaching not against the teaching they speak pleasantly not unpleasantly and they speak truthfully not falsely
Speech with these four factors is well spoken not poorly spoken Its blameless and is not criticized by sensible people
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
Good people say that wellspoken words are foremost
second speak on the teaching not against it
third speak pleasantly not unpleasantly
and fourth speak truthfully not falsely
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
I feel inspired to speak Blessed One I feel inspired to speak Holy One
Then speak as you feel inspired said the Buddha
Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses
Speak only such words
as do not hurt yourself
nor harm others
such speech is truly well spoken
Speak only pleasing words
words gladly welcomed
Pleasing words are those
that bring nothing bad to others
Truth itself is the undying word
this is an ancient principle
Good people say that the teaching and its meaning
are grounded in the truth
The words spoken by the Buddha
for realizing the sanctuary extinguishment
for making an end of suffering
this really is the best kind of speech

Then Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms with Venerable Vaṅgīsa as his second monk
And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied as lust infected his mind
Then he addressed nanda in verse
Ive got a burning desire for pleasure
My mind is on fire
Please out of compassion Gotama
tell me how to quench the flames
Your mind is on fire
because of a perversion of perception
Turn away from the feature of things
thats attractive provoking lust
See all conditioned phenomena as other
as suffering and notself
Extinguish the great fire of lust
dont burn up again and again
With mind unified and serene
meditate on the ugly aspects of the body
With mindfulness immersed in the body
be full of disillusionment
Meditate on the signless
give up the underlying tendency to conceit
and when you comprehend conceit

The Invitation to Admonish
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred monks all of whom were perfected ones
Now at that time it was the sabbaththe full moon on the fifteenth dayand the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish
Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks who were so very silent He addressed them
Come now monks I invite you all
Is there anything Ive done by way of body or speech that you would criticize
When he had spoken Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
There is nothing sir that youve done by way of body or speech that we would criticize
For the Blessed One is the one who gave rise to the unarisen path who gave birth to the unborn path who explained the unexplained path He is the knower of the path the discoverer of the path the expert on the path
And now the disciples live following the path they acquire it later
And sir I invite the Blessed One
Is there anything Ive done by way of body or speech that you would criticize
There is nothing Sāriputta that youve done by way of body or speech that I would criticize
Sāriputta you are astute You have great wisdom widespread wisdom laughing wisdom swift wisdom sharp wisdom penetrating wisdom
A wheelturning monarchs oldest son rightly keeps wielding the power set in motion by his father
In the same way Sāriputta rightly keeps rolling the supreme Wheel of Dhamma that was rolled forth by me
Since it seems I have done nothing worthy of the Blessed Ones criticism
is there anything these five hundred monks have done by way of body or speech that you would criticize
There is nothing Sāriputta that these five hundred monks have done by way of body or speech that I would criticize
For of these five hundred monks sixty have the three knowledges sixty have the six direct knowledges sixty are freed both ways and the rest are freed by wisdom
Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
I feel inspired to speak Blessed One I feel inspired to speak Holy One
Then speak as you feel inspired said the Buddha
Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses
Today on the fifteenth day sabbath
five hundred monks have gathered together to purify their precepts
These untroubled sages have cut off their fetters and bonds
they will not be reborn again
Just as a wheelturning monarch
surrounded by ministers
travels all around this
land thats girt by sea
So disciples with the three knowledges
destroyers of death
revere the winner of the battle
the unsurpassed caravan leader
All are sons of the Blessed One
there is no rubbish here
I bow to the Kinsman of the Sun

Dissatisfaction
At one time Venerable Vaṅgīsa was staying near ḷavī at the Aggāḷava Treeshrine together with his mentor Venerable Nigrodhakappa
Now at that time after Venerable Nigrodhakappa had finished his meal on his return from almsround he would enter his dwelling and not emerge for the rest of that day or the next
And at that time Venerable Vaṅgīsa became dissatisfied as lust infected his mind
Then he thought
Its my loss my misfortune
that Ive become dissatisfied with lust infecting my mind How is it possible for someone else to dispel my discontent and give rise to satisfaction
Why dont I do it myself
Then on the occasion of dispelling his own discontent and giving rise to satisfaction he recited these verses
Giving up discontent and desire
along with all thoughts of the lay life
they wouldnt get entangled in anything
unentangled undesiring thats a real mendicant
Whether on this earth or in the sky
whatever in the world is included in form
wears out it is all impermanent
the thoughtful live having comprehended this truth
People are bound to their attachments
to what is seen heard felt and thought
Unstirred dispel desire for these things
for one called a sage does not cling to them
Attached to the sixty wrong views and full of their own opinions
ordinary people are fixed in wrong principles
But that mendicant wouldnt join a sectarian group
still less would they utter lewd speech
Clever long serene
free of deceit alert without envy
the sage has reached the state of peace
and because hes extinguished he awaits his time

Having overcome Māras devious path
you wander with hardheartedness dissolved
See him the liberator from bonds unattached
analyzing the teaching
He has explained in many ways
the path to cross the flood
The seers of Dhamma stand unfaltering
in the deathless youve explained
The bringer of light who has pierced the truth
youve seen what lies beyond all states of being
When you saw and realized this for yourself
you taught it first to the group of five
When the Dhamma has been so well taught
how could those who know it be negligent
So being diligent we should always respectfully train

Completely abandon the different kinds of conceit
Besotted with the different kinds of conceit
youve had regrets for a long time
Smeared by smears and slain by conceit
people fall into hell
When people slain by conceit are reborn in hell
they grieve for a long time
But a mendicant who practices rightly
winner of the path never grieves
They enjoy happiness and a good reputation
and they rightly call him a Seer of Truth

The Buddha said this
Mendicants when what exists because of grasping what and insisting on what does the view arise
Winds dont blow rivers dont flow pregnant women dont give birth the moon and stars neither rise nor set but stand firm like a pillar
Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha
He is our guide and our refuge
Sir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then mendicants listen and pay close attention I will speak

The Extensive View
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants when what exists because of grasping what and insisting on what does the view arise
There are these seven substances that are not made not derived not created without a creator barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
They dont move or deteriorate or obstruct each other Theyre unable to cause pleasure pain or neutral feeling to each other
What seven
The substances of earth water fire air pleasure pain and the soul is the seventh
These seven substances are not made not derived not created without a creator barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
They dont move or deteriorate or obstruct each other Theyre unable to cause pleasure pain or neutral feeling to each other
If you chop off someones head with a sharp sword you dont take anyones life
The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances
There are  million main wombs and  and  There are  deeds and five and three There are deeds and halfdeeds There are  paths  subeons six classes of rebirth and eight stages in a persons life There are  jīvaka ascetics  wanderers and  naked ascetics There are  faculties  hells and  realms of dust There are seven percipient embryos seven nonpercipient embryos and seven embryos without attachments There are seven gods seven humans and seven goblins There are seven lakes seven winds seven cliffs and  cliffs There are seven dreams and  dreams There are  million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering
And here there is no such thing as this By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by littlefor that cannot be
Pleasure and pain are allotted Transmigration lasts only for a limited period so theres no increase or decrease no getting better or worse
Its like how when you toss a ball of string it rolls away unraveling
In the same way after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering
Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha 
When form exists because of grasping form and insisting on form the view arises

Theres no meaning in giving sacrifice or offerings Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds Theres no afterlife There are no duties to mother and father No beings are reborn spontaneously And theres no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight

With Rāsiya
Then Rāsiya the chief went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir I have heard this The ascetic Gotama criticizes all forms of mortification He categorically condemns and denounces those selfmortifiers who live rough
Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth Is their explanation in line with the teaching Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Chief those who say this do not repeat what I have said They misrepresent me with what is false hollow and untrue
These two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth
Indulgence in sensual pleasures which is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless And indulgence in selfmortification which is painful ignoble and pointless
Avoiding these two extremes the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment
And what is that middle way of practice
It is simply this noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion
This chief is the middle way of practice woken up to by the Realized One which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment

These three selfmortifiers who live rough are found in the world

Take a selfmortifier who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness thinking
Hopefully I will achieve a skillful quality Hopefully I will realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones

Take another selfmortifier who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness thinking

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Then Tāḷapuṭa the dancing master came up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Sir I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said
Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of laughing gods
What does the Buddha say about this
Enough chief let it be
Dont ask me that

Sir I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said
Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of laughing gods
What does the Buddha say about this
Clearly chief Im not getting through to you when I say
Enough chief let it be
Dont ask me that
Nevertheless I will answer you
When sentient beings are still not free of greed and are still bound by greed
a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more arousing things
When sentient beings are still not free of hate and are still bound by hate
a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more hateful things
When sentient beings are still not free of delusion and are still bound by delusion
a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more delusory things
And so being heedless and negligent themselves theyve encouraged others to be heedless and negligent When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the hell called Laughter
But if you have such a view
Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of laughing gods This is your wrong view
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I say
hell or the animal realm
When he said this Tāḷapuṭa cried and burst out in tears
This is what I didnt get through to you when I said
Enough chief let it be Dont ask me that
Sir Im not crying because of what the Buddha said
But sir for a long time Ive been cheated tricked and deceived by the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers who said

With Maṇicūḷaka
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Now at that time while the kings retinue was sitting together in the royal compound this discussion came up among them
Gold and money are proper for Sakyan ascetics They accept and receive gold and money
Now at that time the chief Maṇicūḷaka was sitting in that assembly
He said to that retinue
Good sirs dont say that
Gold and money are not proper for Sakyan ascetics They neither accept nor receive gold and money They have set aside gems and gold and rejected gold and money
He was able to persuade that assembly
Then Maṇicūḷaka went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
He then said
Answering this way I trust that I repeat what the Buddha has said and dont misrepresent him with an untruth I trust my explanation is in line with the teaching and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism
Indeed in answering this way you repeat what Ive said and dont misrepresent me with an untruth Your explanation is in line with the teaching and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism
Gold and money are not proper for Sakyan ascetics They neither accept nor receive gold and money They have set aside gems and gold and rejected gold and money
If gold and money were proper for them then the five kinds of sensual stimulation would also be proper
And if the five kinds of sensual stimulation are proper for them you should definitely regard them as not having the qualities of an ascetic or a follower of the Sakyan
Rather chief I say this
Straw may be looked for by one needing straw wood may be looked for by one needing wood a cart may be looked for by one needing a cart a workman may be looked for by one needing a workman
But I say that there is no way they can accept or look for gold and money

Families
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at Nāḷandā
There he stayed near Nālandā in Pāvārikas mango grove
Now that was a time of famine and scarcity in Nāḷandā with blighted crops turned to straw
At that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics
Then Asibandhakas son the chief who was a disciple of the Jains went up to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta bowed and sat down to one side
Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta said to him
Come chief refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine
Then you will get a good reputation
Asibandhakas son the chief refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama so mighty and powerful
But sir how am I to do this
Here brahmin go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him
Sir dont you in many ways praise kindness protection and compassion for families
When hes asked this if he answers
Indeed I do chief say this to him
So what exactly are you doing wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity with blighted crops turned to straw
The Buddha is practicing to annihilate collapse and ruin families
When you put this dilemma to him the Buddha wont be able to either spit it out or swallow it down
Yes sir replied Asibandhakas son
He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta keeping him on his right Then he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir dont you in many ways praise kindness protection and compassion for families
Indeed I do chief
So what exactly are you doing wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity with blighted crops turned to straw
The Buddha is practicing to annihilate collapse and ruin families
Well chief I recollect ninety eons back but Im not aware of any family thats been ruined merely by offering some cooked almsfood
Rather rich affluent and wealthy familieswith lots of gold and silver lots of property and assets and lots of money and grainall acquired their wealth because of generosity truth and restraint
Chief there are eight causes and conditions for the ruin of families
Their ruin stems from rulers bandits fire or flood Or their savings vanish Or their business fails due to not applying themselves to work Or a wastrel is born into the family who squanders and fritters away their wealth And impermanence is the eighth
These are the eight causes and conditions for the ruin of families
Given that these eight reasons are found suppose someone says this
The Buddha is practicing to annihilate collapse and ruin families
Unless they give up that speech and thought and let go of that view they will be cast down to hell
When he said this Asibandhakas son the chief said to the Buddha

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas near the Mallian town called Uruvelakappa
Then Bhadraka the village chief went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Please sir teach me the origin and cessation of suffering
Chief if I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the past saying
this is how it was in the past you might have doubts or uncertainties about that
If I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the future saying
this is how it will be in the future you might have doubts or uncertainties about that
Rather chief I will teach you about the origin and ending of suffering as I am sitting right here and you are sitting right there
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Bhadraka replied
The Buddha said this
What do you think chief
Are there any people here in Uruvelakappa who if they were executed imprisoned fined or condemned it would cause you sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
There are sir
But are there any people here in Uruvelakappa who if they were executed imprisoned fined or condemned it would not cause you sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
There are sir
Whats the cause chief whats the reason why if this was to happen to some people it could cause you sorrow while if it happens to others it does not
The people regarding whom this would give rise to sorrow are those I desire and love
The people regarding whom this would not give rise to sorrow are those I dont desire and love
With this present phenomenon that is seen known immediate attained and fathomed you may infer to the past and future
All the suffering that arose in the past was rooted and sourced in desire
For desire is the root of suffering
All the suffering that will arise in the future will be rooted and sourced in desire
For desire is the root of suffering
Its incredible sir its amazing
How well said this was by the Buddha
All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire
For desire is the root of suffering
I have a boy called Ciravāsi who resides in a house away from here
I rise early and send someone saying
Go my man and check on my boy Ciravāsi
Until they get back I worry
I hope nothings wrong with Ciravāsi
What do you think chief
If Ciravāsi was executed imprisoned fined or condemned would it cause you sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
How could it not sir
This too is a way to understand
All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire
For desire is the root of suffering
What do you think chief
Before youd seen or heard of Ciravāsis mother did you have any desire or love or fondness for her
No sir
Then was it because you saw or heard of her that you had
desire or love or fondness for her
Yes sir
What do you think chief
If Ciravāsis mother was executed imprisoned fined or condemned would it cause you sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
How could it not sir
This too is a way to understand
All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire

With Pāṭaliya
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans where they have a town called Uttara
Then Pāṭaliya the chief went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir I have heard this
The ascetic Gotama knows magic
Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth Is their explanation in line with the teaching Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
For we dont want to misrepresent the Blessed One
Chief those who say this repeat what I have said and dont misrepresent me with an untruth Their explanation is in line with the teaching and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Sir we didnt believe that what those ascetics and brahmins said was really true
But it seems the ascetic Gotama is a magician
Chief does someone who says I know magic also say I am a magician
Thats right Blessed One Thats right Holy One
Well then brahmin Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think chief
Do you know the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses
I know them sir
And whats their job
To put a stop to bandits and to deliver messages for the Koliyans
What do you think chief
Are the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses moral or immoral
I know that theyre immoral of bad character sir They are among those in the world who are immoral and of bad character
Would it be right to say that
Pāṭaliya knows the Kolyian officers with drooping headdresses who are immoral of bad character so he too must be immoral and of bad character
Im quite different from the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses we have quite different characters
So if you can know those officers of bad character while you are not of bad character why cant the Realized One know magic without being a magician
I understand magic and its result And I understand how magicians practice so that when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
I understand killing living creatures and its result And I understand how those who kill living creatures practice so that when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
I understand stealing 
sexual misconduct 
divisive speech 
harsh speech 
talking nonsense 
covetousness 
ill will 
wrong view and its result And I understand how those who have wrong view practice so that when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
Everyone who kills living creatures experiences pain and sadness in the present life
Everyone who steals 
commits sexual misconduct 
lies experiences pain and sadness in the present life
But you can see someone garlanded and adorned nicely bathed and anointed hair and beard dressed taking his pleasure with women as if he were a king
You might ask someone
Mister what did that man do
And theyd reply
Mister that man attacked the kings enemy and killed them
The king was delighted and gave him this reward
Thats why hes garlanded and adorned nicely bathed and anointed hair and beard dressed taking his pleasure with women as if he were a king
And you can see someone else his arms tied tightly behind his back with a strong rope His head is shaven and hes marched from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum Then hes taken out the south gate and there to the south of the city they chop off his head
You might ask someone
Mister what did that man do
And theyd reply
Mister that man is an enemy of the king who has murdered a man or a woman
Thats why the rulers arrested him and inflicted such punishment
What do you think chief
Have you seen or heard of such a thing
Sir we have seen it and heard of it and we will hear of it again
Since this is so the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
everyone who kills living creatures experiences pain and sadness in the present life are they right or wrong
Theyre wrong sir
But those who speak hollow false nonsense are they moral or immoral
Immoral sir
And are those who are immoral of bad character practicing wrongly or rightly
Theyre practicing wrongly sir
And do those who are practicing wrongly have wrong view or right view
They have wrong view sir
But is it appropriate to have confidence in those of wrong view
No sir
You can see someone garlanded and adorned 
Mister that man attacked the kings enemy and took their valuables
The king was delighted and gave him this reward  
And you can see someone else his arms tied tightly behind his back 
Mister that man took something from a village or wilderness with the intention to commit theft
Thats why the rulers arrested him and inflicted such punishment
What do you think chief
Have you seen or heard of such a thing
Sir we have seen it and heard of it and we will hear of it again
Since this is so the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
everyone who steals experiences pain and sadness in the present life are they right or wrong 
Is it appropriate to have confidence in them
No sir
You can see someone garlanded and adorned 
Mister that man had sexual relations with the wives of an enemy king
The king was delighted and gave him this reward  
And you can see someone else his arms tied tightly behind his back 
Mister that man had sexual relations with the women and maidens of good families
Thats why the rulers arrested him and inflicted such punishment
What do you think chief
Have you seen or heard of such a thing
Sir we have seen it and heard of it and we will hear of it again
Since this is so the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
everyone who commits sexual misconduct experiences pain and sadness in the present life are they right or wrong 
Is it appropriate to have confidence in them
No sir
And you can see someone garlanded and adorned 
Mister that man amused the king with lies
The king was delighted and gave him this reward  
And you can see someone else his arms tied tightly behind his back 
Mister that man has ruined a householder or householders child by lying
Thats why the rulers arrested him and inflicted such punishment
What do you think chief
Have you seen or heard of such a thing
Sir we have seen it and heard of it and we will hear of it again
Since this is so the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
everyone who lies experiences pain and sadness in the present life are they right or wrong
Theyre wrong sir
But those who speak hollow false nonsense are they moral or immoral
Immoral sir
And are those who are immoral of bad character practicing wrongly or rightly
Theyre practicing wrongly sir
And do those who are practicing wrongly have wrong view or right view
They have wrong view sir
But is it appropriate to have confidence in those of wrong view
Its incredible sir its amazing
I have a guest house
where there are cots seats water pots and oil lamps
Whenever an ascetic or brahmin comes to stay I share what I have as best I can
Once it so happened sir that four teachers of different views and opinions came to stay at my guest house
One teacher had this doctrine and view
Theres no meaning in giving sacrifice or offerings
Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds Theres no afterlife There are no duties to mother and father No beings are reborn spontaneously And theres no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight
One teacher had this doctrine and view
There is meaning in giving sacrifice and offerings There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds There is an afterlife There are duties to mother and father There are beings reborn spontaneously And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight
One teacher had this doctrine and view
Nothing bad is done by the doer when they punish mutilate torture aggrieve oppress intimidate or when they encourage others to do the same Nothing bad is done when they kill steal break into houses plunder wealth steal from isolated buildings commit highway robbery commit adultery and lie
If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razoredged chakram no evil comes of that and no outcome of evil
If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing mutilating and torturing and encouraging others to do the same no evil comes of that and no outcome of evil
If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same no merit comes of that and no outcome of merit
In giving selfcontrol restraint and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit

I had doubt and uncertainty about that
I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth and who speaks falsehood
Chief no wonder youre doubting and uncertain
Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter
I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertainty
Chief there is immersion based on understanding of principle
If you gain such mental immersion you can give up that cause of uncertainty
And what is immersion based on understanding of principle
Its when a noble disciple has given up killing living creatures stealing sexual misconduct lying divisive speech harsh speech talking nonsense covetousness ill will and wrong view
Then that noble disciple is rid of desire rid of ill will unconfused aware and mindful They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They reflect thus

The Simile of the Field
At one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārikas mango grove

Well sir why exactly do you teach some people thoroughly and others less thoroughly
Well then chief Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think Suppose a farmer has three fields ones good ones average and ones poorbad ground of sand and salt
What do you think When that farmer wants to plant seeds where would he plant them first the good field the average one or the poor one
Sir hed plant them first in the good field then the average then he may or may not plant seed in the poor field
Why is that
Because at least it can be fodder for the cattle
To me the monks and nuns are like the good field
I teach them the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And I reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Why is that
Because they live with me as their island protection shelter and refuge
To me the laymen and laywomen are like the average field
I also teach them the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And I reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Why is that
Because they live with me as their island protection shelter and refuge
To me the ascetics brahmins and wanderers who follow other paths are like the poor field the bad ground of sand and salt
I also teach them the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And I reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Why is that
Hopefully they might understand even a single sentence which would be for their lasting welfare and happiness
Suppose a person had three water jars one thats uncracked and nonporous one thats uncracked but porous and one thats cracked and porous
What do you think When that person wants to store water where would they store it first in the jar thats uncracked and nonporous the one thats uncracked but porous or the one thats cracked and porous
Sir theyd store water first in the jar thats uncracked and nonporous then the one thats uncracked but porous then they may or may not store water in the one thats cracked and porous
Why is that
Because at least it can be used for washing the dishes
To me the monks and nuns are like the water jar thats uncracked and nonporous
I teach them the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And I reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure

With Asibandhakas Son
At one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārikas mango grove
Then Asibandhakas son the chief went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir there are western brahmins draped with moss who carry pitchers immerse themselves in water and serve the sacred flame
When someone has passed away they truly lift them up raise them up and guide them along to heaven
But what about the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha is he able to ensure that the whole world will be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm when their body breaks up after death
Well then chief Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think chief
Take a person who kills living creatures steals and commits sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious and have wrong view
And a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise circumambulating them with joined palms and saying
When this persons body breaks up after death may they be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
What do you think chief
Would that person be reborn in heaven because of their prayers
No sir
Chief suppose a person were to throw a broad rock into a deep lake
And a large crowd was to come together to offer up prayers and praise circumambulating it with joined palms and saying
Rise good rock Float good rock Float to shore good rock
What do you think chief
Would that broad rock rise up or float because of their prayers
No sir
In the same way take a person who kills living creatures steals and commits sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious and have wrong view
Even though a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise 
when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
What do you think chief
Take a person who doesnt kill living creatures steal or commit sexual misconduct They dont use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre contented kindhearted and have right view
And a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise circumambulating them with joined palms and saying
When this persons body breaks up after death may they be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
What do you think chief
Would that person be reborn in hell because of their prayers
No sir
Chief suppose a person were to sink a pot of ghee or oil into a deep lake and break it open
Its shards and chips would sink down while the ghee or oil in it would rise up
And a large crowd was to come together to offer up prayers and praise circumambulating it with joined palms and saying
Sink good ghee or oil Descend good ghee or oil Go down good ghee or oil
What do you think chief
Would that ghee or oil sink and descend because of their prayers
No sir

A Horn Blower
At one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārikas mango grove
Then Asibandhakas son the chief who was a disciple of the Jains went up to the Buddha and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Chief how does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teach his disciples
Sir this is how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teaches his disciples
Everyone who kills a living creature steal commits sexual misconduct or lies goes to a place of loss to hell
Youre led on by what you usually live by
This is how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teaches his disciples
Youre led on by what you usually live by if this were true then according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says noone would go to a place of loss to hell
What do you think chief
Take a person who kills living creatures If we compare periods of time during the day and night which is more frequent the occasions when theyre killing or when theyre not killing
The occasions when theyre killing are less frequent while the occasions when theyre not killing are more frequent
Youre led on by what you usually live by if this were true then according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says noone would go to a place of loss to hell
What do you think chief
Take a person who steals 
Take a person who commits sexual misconduct 
Take a person who lies If we compare periods of time during the day and night which is more frequent the occasions when theyre lying or when theyre not lying
The occasions when theyre lying are less frequent while the occasions when theyre not lying are more frequent
Youre led on by what you usually live by if this were true then according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says noone would go to a place of loss to hell
Take some teacher who has this doctrine and view
Everyone who kills a living creature steals commits sexual misconduct or lies goes to a place of loss to hell
And theres a disciple who is devoted to that teacher
They think
My teacher has this doctrine and view
Everyone who kills a living creature steals commits sexual misconduct or lies goes to a place of loss to hell
But Ive killed living creatures 
committed sexual misconduct 
They get the view I too am going to a place of loss to hell
Unless they give up that speech and thought and let go of that view they will be cast down to hell
But consider when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
In many ways he criticizes and denounces killing living creatures saying Stop killing living creatures
He criticizes and denounces stealing 
sexual misconduct 
lying saying Stop lying
And theres a disciple who is devoted to that teacher
Then they reflect
In many ways the Buddha criticizes and denounces killing living creatures saying Stop killing living creatures
But I have killed living creatures to a certain extent
Thats not right its not good
and I feel remorseful because of it
But I cant undo what I have done
Reflecting like this they give up killing living creatures
and in future they dont kill living creatures
Thats how to give up this bad deed
and get past it
In many ways the Buddha criticizes and denounces stealing

They give up killing living creatures

The Fortunate One is Worthy the Perfect Sambuddha
The Dhamma has been wellproclaimed by the Fortunate One

He who is the Realised One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
the one endowed with understanding and good conduct the Happy One the one who understands the worlds
the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming
the Teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Fortunate One
This world with its gods Māras and Brahmās
this generation with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas princes and men
he declared after gaining deep knowledge for himself
He taught the Dhamma which is good in the beginning
good in the middle good in the end
with its meaning with its proper phrasing
and explained the spiritual life which is complete full and pure
I worship that Fortunate One

I worship that Saṅgha
I bow my head to that Saṅgha
we will recite and the readings expounding the base for spiritual anxiety
The Buddha who is very pure with great oceanlike compassion
he who has the perpetual pure and noble eye of knowledge
who destroys the wickedness and corruptions of the world
with devotion I worship the Buddha
The Dhamma of the Teacher like a lamp
which is split into Path Fruit and the Deathless
which is supermundane and explains that goal
with devotion I worship that Dhamma
The Saṅgha known as a field better than the best field
who have seen peace and awakened like the Happy One
who have abandoned wavering are Noble and wise
with devotion I worship that Saṅgha
The one worthy of unfailing homage
the worship that is made based in the three jewels
 may there be no obstacles for me
through the potency and success of this merit
Here the Realised One has arisen in the world the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
and has taught the Dhamma which leads out which is peaceful
which leads to Nibbāna goes to Awakening and is declared by the Happy One
After hearing the Dhamma we understand it thus
birth is suffering also old age is suffering also death is suffering
also grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair is suffering
also being joined to what is not liked is suffering
also being parted from what is liked is suffering
also not to obtain that which one longs for is suffering
in brief the five components of mind and body that provide fuel for attachment are suffering
They are as follows
The bodilyform component that provides fuel for attachment
the feelings component that provides fuel for attachment
the perceptions component that provides fuel for attachment
the volitions component that provides fuel for attachment
the consciousness component that provides fuel for attachment
For whoever could understand while living the Fortunate One
guided his disciples many times
and this part of the Fortunate Ones instruction to his disciples
he many times repeated
Form is impermanent feelings are impermanent perceptions are impermanent
volitions are impermanent consciousness is impermanent
Form is not self feelings are not self perceptions are not self
volitions are not self consciousness is not self
All conditioned things are impermanent
All things are without a self
We are overcome
by birth old age death grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair
we are overcome by suffering we are afflicted with suffering
May the ending of this entire
mass of suffering become clear
Although the Fortunate One has attained Nibbāna long ago
on account of the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
we have gone forth out of faith from the home to the homeless life
We practice the spiritual life under the Fortunate One
Endowed with the monastic training and livelihood
 may this spiritual life leads us to the end
of the entire mass of suffering
Although the Fortunate One has attained Nibbāna long ago
we have gone for refuge to the Dhamma and the monastic Saṅgha
the Fortunate Ones dispensation
we apply our minds as far as we remember as far as we are able to following the path
 may this path leads us to the end
of the entire mass of suffering
Wholesome thoughts unwholesome thoughts thoughts without consequences
What are wholesome thoughts
When a wholesome thought in the sensuous worlds has arisen
connected with wellbeing joined with knowledge
taking form as object or sound as object
or smell as object or taste as object
or touch as object or thought as object
or whatever it begins with
at that time there is contact balance
At that time these or other
formless thoughts are conditionally originated
These are wholesome thoughts
There are five components
The bodilyform component the feelings component
the perceptions component the volitions component the consciousness component
Herein what is the bodilyform component
Whatever bodilyform there is in the past future or present
internal or external
gross or fine
inferior or excellent
whether far or near
after gathering these together collectively and briefly
This is called the bodilyform component
The compiled and the uncompiled
the uncollected with the collected
the collected with the uncollected
the collected with the collected
the uncollected with the uncollected
the joined and the parted
the parted with the joined
with the parted the joined and the uncollected
There are six designations
the designation of the components the designation of the sensespheres the designation of the elements
the designation of the truths the designation of the faculties the designation of the persons
In what way is there a designation of the person regarding persons
One free occasionally one free always
one unsteady one steady
one liable to fall one not liable to fall
one able in intention one able in guarding
the worldling the lineageholder
one abstaining through fear one not abstaining through fear
one able to arrive one unable to arrive
one determined one undetermined one pathattained one established in fruition
the Worthy One the one on the path to Worthiness
Is a person found in a real and ultimate way
That which is real and ultimate
is this person found in the same real and ultimate way
Acknowledge the refutation
If a person is found in a real and ultimate way
then you surely should have said That which is real and ultimate
this person is found in the same real and ultimate way
Your view is wrong
Whatever are wholesome things are they all wholesome roots
Whatever are wholesome roots are they all wholesome things
Whatever are wholesome things do they all have the same roots with the wholesome root
Whatever have the same roots with the wholesome root are they all wholesome roots
Root condition object condition predominance condition
preceding condition prior condition
arising together condition mutually arising condition
support condition strong support condition
arising before condition arising later condition habitual condition
intentional deed condition result condition
nutriment condition faculty condition
absorption condition path condition
association condition disassociation condition
presence condition absence condition
disappearance condition nondisappearance condition
May you be free from all disease may you avoid all grief
may you overcome all foes may you attain nibbāna
May you avoid all calamities and may all disease be destroyed
may there be no obstacles for you may you be happy and live long
For one in the habit of constantly worshipping respectable elders
four things increase length of life beauty happiness and strength

Monks a former member of another sect becomes one who succeeds thus one who fails thus
And how monks does a former member of another sect become one who fails
Herein monks a former member of another sect enters a village at too early a time he returns too late in the day
Thus monks does a former member of another sect become one who fails
And again monks a former member of another sect comes to be one whose resort is among prostitutes or he comes to be one whose resort is among widows or he comes to be one whose resort is among grown girls or he comes to be one whose resort is among eunuchs or he comes to be one whose resort is among nuns
Thus too monks does a former member of another sect become one who fails
And again monks a former member of another sect in regard to those various things which have to be done by his fellows in the Brahmafaring comes to be not dexterous therein not vigorous not possessed of consideration for those kinds of things not able to act himself not able to direct 
Thus too monks does a former member of another sect become one who fails
And again monks a former member of another sect comes to be one who is not of keen desire as to the recitation as to the interrogation as to the higher morality the higher thought the higher wisdom
Thus too monks does a former member of another sect become one who fails
And again monks a former member of another sect becomes angry displeased dissatisfied if dispraise is being spoken of the teacher the views the approval the persuasion the creed of that fold of a sect from which he has come over he becomes pleased elated satisfied if dispraise is being spoken of the awakened one or of dhamma or of the Order
or else he becomes pleased elated satisfied if praise is being spoken of the teacher the views the approval the persuasion the creed of that fold of a sect from which he has come over he becomes angry displeased dissatisfied if praise is being spoken of the awakened one or of dhamma or of the Order
This monks is the knitting together in regard to what may be the failure of a former member of another sect
It is thus monks that a former member of another sect becomes one who fails
Therefore monks if there come a former member of another sect who has failed he should not be ordained
This pair of things stated in combination as internal and external cannot be found in the form of an object at one time simultaneously It is not possible to objectify together is the meaning
For the purpose of reaching the knowledge of bodycontemplation to the highest extent is the meaning of To the extent necessary for just knowledge
With these words is stated the direct opposition of this meditation to the laying hold on craving and wrong views
In the same way he sees the arising of the aggregate of materiality through the origination of craving karma and food in the sense of the origin of conditions and also while seeing the sign of birth nibbatti lakkhana passanto pi He sees the passing away of the aggregate while thinking that the dissolution of materiality comes to be through the dissolution of ignorance in the sense of the dissolution of conditions and through the dissolution of craving karma and food in the same way and while seeing the sign of vicissitude viparinamalakkhana
Why is the Arousing of Mindfulness intended by the word way Are there not many other factors of the way namely understanding thinking speech action livelihood effort and concentration besides mindfulness
To be sure there are But all these are implied when the Arousing of Mindfulness is mentioned because these factors exist in union with mindfulness
Knowledge energy and the like are mentioned in the analytically expository portion niddese In the synopsis uddese however the consideration should be regarded as that of mindfulness alone by way of the mental disposition of those capable of being trained
And in order to elaborate just that and to show of which path or way the instruction in our Discourse is the preliminary part he further quoted the following also from the Patisambhida Magga
For the hearers savaka namely the disciples of the Buddha there is no attainment of the Noble Path Ariya Magga possible except by practicing the subject of meditation kammatthana of the Four Truths Catu Sacca
Spiritual development usually called meditation is the development of wisdom pañña bhavana
Just the contemplation of material form  of feeling consciousness or mental objects constitutes the cultivation of the Arousing of Mindfulness
Because he was in the habit of carrying a yellow pennon about his body also because he adorned himself with that pennon when taking part in wrestling matches he was wellknown as Pitamalla the yellow wrestler
Three kingdoms  Pandu Cola Gola
He came to Tambapanni Isle  Ceylon  having got the information that wrestlers were honored and hospitably received in the island
Craving tanha sews together samsibbati or weaves vinati aggregate with aggregate effect with cause and suffering with beings In Nibbana there is no vana Or in the man who has attained to Nibbana there is no vana
Ocular experience by oneself Sensing without aid from the outside
Since the heart of the man pursuing the path of insight takes to the contemplation of subtle consciousness and mental object these have been spoken of as the Path to Purity for the man dullwitted or keenwitted pursuing insight
The keenwitted man pursuing the path of quietude lays hold of the gross subject of meditation but he does not stay in that He lays hold of feeling the subtle subject of meditation by way of the factors of absorption jhana after attaining to and emerging from the absorption reached with the material body as subject
Because he does not continue to stay in the coarse
Consciousness and mental objects are decisive factors of craving as well as of theorizing And body and feeling are decisive factors of theorizing as well as of craving Yet to point out that which is stronger in body and feeling namely craving and that which is stronger in consciousness and mental objects namely theorizing distinctions have been drawn
Drawing distinctions it is said Body and feeling are the cause of zest assadassa karana For the rejection of that zest of body by the dullwitted manda man of the craving type tanhacarita the seeing dassana of the ugly asubha in the body the coarse object olarika arammana which is the basis of craving tanha vatthu is convenient To that type of man the contemplation on corporeality the First Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity Visuddhi Magga For the abandoning of that zest by the keenwitted tikha man of the craving type the seeing of suffering in feeling the subtle object sukhuma arammana which is the basis of craving is convenient and for him the contemplation on feeling the Second Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity For the dullwitted man of the theorizing type ditthi carita it is convenient to see consciousness citta in the fairly simple way it is set forth in this discourse by way of impermanence aniccata and by way of such divisions as mindwithlust saragadi vasena in order to reject the notion of permanence nicca sañña in regard to consciousness Consciousness is a special condition visesa karana for the wrong view due to a basic belief in permanence niccanti abhinivesa vatthutaya ditthiya The contemplation on consciousness the Third Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity of this type of man For the keenwitted man of the theorizing type it is convenient to see mental objects or things dhamma according to the manifold way set forth in this discourse by way of perception senseimpression and so forth nivaranadi vasena in order to reject the notion of a soul atta sañña in regard to mental things Mental things are special conditions for the wrong view due to a basic belief in a soul attanti abhinivesa vatthutaya ditthiya For this type of man the contemplation on mental objects the Fourth Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity
Further these Four Arousings of Mindfulness were taught not only for the purpose of casting out the four illusions but for getting rid of the four floods bonds outflowings knots clingings wrong courses and the penetration of fourfold nutriment too This is according to the method of exegesis in the Nettipakarana
By way of remembering by way of the reflection of actions of skill and so forth of body speech and thought
The meeting in the one Nibbana of the various Arousings of Mindfulness is called the meeting in the one thing on account of participation in that one Nibbana or on account of their becoming all of a kind
On account of the cause or on account of the sameness of entry into the one Nibbana the Arousing of Mindfulness is said to be just one thing
What he sees  What man or woman he sees
Why is there no seeing of man or a woman with the eye
There is I see a woman I see a man  these statements refer to what he sees by way of ordinary perception
That perception owing to wrong comprehension does not get at the sensebasis rupayatana in the highest sense philosophically through the falsely determined condition of material form viparita gahavasena miccha parikappita rupatta
Or the meaning is the absence of perception which is called the seeing of primary and derived materiality beginning with things such as the hair of the head owing to noncognizability of the collective nature of an object like a man or woman by eyeconsciousness kesadibhutupadaya samuhasankhatam ditthi na hoti acakkhuviññana viññeyyatta
What is seen that he does not properly see  He does not see according to reality by the eye of wisdom the sensebasis which exists the collection of primary and derived materiality beginning with hair of the head and the like yam rupayatanam kesadibhutupadaya samuhasankhatam dittham tam paññacakkhuna bhutato na passati
Not seeing properly he is shackled  Not seeing this body as it actually is with the eye of wisdom he thinks This is mine this am I this is my self and is bound with the fetter of defilement imam attabhavam yathabhutam paññacakkhuna apassanto etam mama esohamasmi eso me attati kilesa bandhanena bajjhati
Although the term burning atapana is applied to the abandoning of defilements here it is also applicable to right view  thought speech action livelihood mindfulness and concentration As ardour atapa like glow atappa is restricted by use to just energy generally it is said ardour is a name for energy
Or because of the occurrence of energy viriya by way of instigating the associated things in the abandoning of opposing qualities that itself is ardour atapa In this place only energy viriya is referred to by atapa
By taking the word ardent atapi the Master points out the one possessed of right energy or exertion sammappadhana
Clearly comprehending  Discerning rightly entirely and equally samma samantato samañca pajananto Rightly  Correctly aviparitam Entirely  By knowing in all ways sabbakarapajananena Equally  By reason of proceeding through the conveying of higher and higher spiritual attainments uparupari visesavahabhavena pavattiya
Necessary in all circumstances  Everywhere in the state of becoming in every sluggish and unbalanced state of mind it is desirable Or that by the help of which the other proper Factors of Enlightenment bojjhanga are capable of being developed is necessary in all circumstances
Here contemplation takes place by means of wisdom that is assisted by mindfulness
The word feelings is repeated to limit the object by isolating it anissato vavatthanam for the analysis of the apparently compact ghana vinibbhoga and for such other purposes in order to prevent any straying from the contemplation on feelings to some other object Erratic contemplation takes place because of the connection of the other nonmaterial aggregates with feelings and because of the dependence of nonmaterial things like feelings on material form in the fiveconstituentexistence pañca vokara bhava or the sensuous plane of becoming kama bhava By the repetition of the word the limiting of the object by isolating it is shown through the pointing out of only a doer of feelingcontemplation in the property called feeling as there is no contemplating of the body or consciousness or mental objects in feeling but only the contemplating of feeling
As in this matter of feeling when a pleasurable feeling occurs there is no occurrence of the other two and when a painful feeling or a neither pleasurable nor painful feeling occurs there is no occurrence of the remaining ones so is shown the analysis of the apparently compact the absence of permanence  by the pointing out of different feelings after penetrating them severally and not having spoken of the state of feeling in a general way Through the noticing of feelings as lasting just for the measure of a moment in time the seeing of impermanence is made clear Through the same cognizance suffering and soullessness too are seen
For the analysis of the apparently compact and for such other purposes By the words And for such other purposes the following should be understood
This yogavacara contemplates just feelings and not any other thing
because he is not one who contemplates by way of the lovely  after the manner of a fool who sees a gem in a bubble of water which has not the quality of a gem He does not see in this foolish way even in the stable instant when he experiences a pleasant feeling Much more so does he not stray away into fanciful thinking in regard to the two remaining feelings of pain and indifference On the other hand he contemplates along the real way of impermanence soullessness and the unlovely by way of momentary dissolution lack of power to control  and the trickling of the dirt of defilement and distinctively contemplates suffering as the pain of vicissitude and of the formations or the constituents of life
By the passage beginning with the words To be sure in whatsoever way the commentator points to the limit of the object 
In the way mentioned above should the repetition of words in the contemplation of consciousness and mental objects be explained too
Who sees pleasure as suffering  Who sees feelings by way of the suffering natural to change with the eye of wisdom
Who sees pain as a thorn  Who sees painful feeling as damage causing piercing in and as a thing hard to drive out
The neutral peace  The feeling of indifference is peaceful owing to the absence of grossness as in states of pain and pleasure and by way of a restful nature
Who sees feelings with the thought that they are impermanent by reason of their becoming nonexistent after having come to be owing to their being characterised by the qualities of arising and passing away owing to their temporariness and owing to their being in a state of constant negation
is he who sees the neutral peace of the neither pleasurable nor painful feelings as fleeting and is indeed the bhikkhu who will rightly know and live become still
Suffering is what it is because of the ill natural to the constituents of life sankhara dukkhataya dukkha
All that is in suffering  Everything experienced is plunged included in suffering sabbantam vedayitam dukkhasmim antogadham pariyapannam because the ill natural to the formations the constituents in life cannot be conquered sankhara dukkhata nativattanato
The three feelings should be contemplated upon as pleasant and painful When the first occurs the second changes and the third is known then feeling is pleasant When the first changes the second occurs and the third is not known then feeling is painful
Or the divisions of object noncausative functional process and so forth Contemplation should be done by way of the division of the blue and so forth pertaining to the variety of objects visual and so forth rupadi arammana nanattassa niladi tabbhedassa by way of the division of the low and so forth pertaining to the diverse kinds of dominance of the willtodo and so forth chandadi adhipati nanattassa hinadi tabbhedassa by way of the division of the spontaneous and nonspontaneous consciousness absorption with initial application and so forth pertaining to the variety of conditions of conascence of knowledge absorption and so forth ñana jhanadi nanattassa sasankharikasankharika savitakkadi tabbhedassa by way of the division of lofty middling and so forth pertaining to the diverse planes sensuous and so forth kamavacaradi bhuminanattassa ukkattha majjhimadi tabbhedassa by way of the division of conduciveness to devaplanerebirth and so forth pertaining to the diverse kind of moral action of skill and so forth kusaladi kammananattassa devagati samvattaniyatadi tabbhedassa by way of the division of the state of requital which could be perceived in this very present condition of life and so forth pertaining to the variety of dark and bright resultants of evil and good deeds kanha sukka vipaka nanattassa dittha dhamma vedaniyatadi tabbhedassa by way of the division of the three good conditions of rebirth and so forth pertaining to noncausative functional diversity of the sensuous plane and so forth paritta bhumakadi kriya nanattassa tihetukadi tabbhedassa
In regard to the four objects of contemplation through the Arousing of Mindfulness it is said in the Vibhanga thus Even the Five Aggregates are the world pañca pi khandha lokoti hi Vibhange catusu pi thanesu vuttanti
This statement refers to the supramundane meditation of Mindfulnessarousing In the case of mundane meditation the rejection is stated everywhere with reference to bare nonoccurrence of the defilements lokiya bhavanaya sabbattha appavatt mattam sandhaya vuttam
It is right to say that by the Path are the defilements abandoned
The abandoning of the defilements of one object in the thoughtunit of the Path is indeed the abandoning of the defilements of all objects
Or it should be understood thus It is stated in this manner in order to indicate that the abandoning of the defilements in one object implies the abandoning of the defilements in the remaining objects
The abandoning of the defilements of one person is not necessarily the abandonding of the defilements of another person nahi ekassa pahinam tato aññassa pahinam nama hoti Reference to the different types of persons is made to point this fact of possible difference of method by way of object
The diversity of the thoughtunit The mundane thoughtunit is meant
What is abandoned temporarily by mundane meditation in the body is not suppressed in the feelings and the other objects
Even if covetousness and grief should not occur in the feelings and the other objects when it is suppressed in the body it should not be stated that owing to efficient rejection by meditation opposed to covetousness and grief there is no covetousness and grief in the other objects such as feelings and in the case of suppression by meditation therefore it is fit to speak of the rejection of covetousness and grief again in feelings and the other objects
as the preliminary path is dealt with here
The person producing bodycontemplation in all modes As sects outside the Buddhas Dispensation also produce a part of this contemplation by their words the Buddhas disciples complete knowledge or allround grasp of this contemplation when it is practiced by him is told
because of the pointing out by him of the suitable abode for yogis
because like the leopard he lives alone in the forest and accomplishes his aim by overcoming those contrary to him namely the passions
By way of the practice of quietude samatha bhavana however there is no arising of the sign of full absorption appana nimittuppatti in anothers respirationbody
Without leaving aside at intervals nor from time to time nor occasionally
The time when the mind moves repeatedly back and forth Or the time when the meditation proceeds incessantly in the internal and external phenomena
This pair of things stated in combination as internal and external cannot be found in the form of an object at one time simultaneously It is not possible to objectify together is the meaning
Origination samudaya is that from which suffering arises
Contemplating originationthings Possessing the character of contemplation connected with the coarse body the nasal aperture and the mind the cause of the respirations
As the contemplation on originationanddissolutionthings too is split up as regards the scope of the object it is not possible to objectify both origination and dissolution at the same time
In the respiration sign  In the reflex image patibhaga nimitta
The worker in respiration examines the respiration while devoting himself to the development of insight through the means of corporeality
The basis namely the coarse body is where the mind and mental characteristics occur
Besides these phenomena there is neither a living being nor a person refers to vision that is purified Mindandbody is a bare impersonal process It is not unrelated to a cause and also not related to a discordant cause like god but is connected with a cause like ignorance tayidam dhammamattam na ahetukam napi issariyadi visamahetukam atha kho avijjadihi eva sahetukam A person who has transcended doubt regarding the past the future and the present 
Applies the three characteristics in order to grasp the qualities of the aggregates according to the method taught in the Anatta Lakkhana Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya beginning with the words Whatsoever form
Going The term is applicable both to the awareness of the fact of moving on and to the knowledge of the characteristic qualities of moving on
From the sort of mere awareness denoted by reference to canines and the like proceeds the idea of a soul the perverted perception with the belief that there is a doer and an experiencer
One who does not uproot or remove that wrong perception owing to nonopposition to that perception and to absence of contemplative practice cannot be called one who develops anything like a subject of meditation
There who goes is a doerquestion of the action of going without first separating efficient cause and action tattha ko gacchatiti sadhanam kriyañca avinibbhutam katva gamana kriya kattu puccha That is for indicating just the bare phenomenon of going through the condition of denying thedoerstateendowedwithasoul sa kattubhava visittha atta patikkhepatta dhamma mattasseva gamana dassanato
On what account is it This is a question for the real reason of the action of going from which the idea of a goer is rejected kim karanati pana patikkhitta kattukaya gamana kriyaya aviparita karana puccha Going is here shown to be one of the particular modes of bare phenomenal movement due to appropriate causeandcondition without attributing it to a fallacious reason such as the one formulated thus The soul comes into contact with the mind the mind with the senseorgans and the senseorgans with the object  idañhi gamanam nama atta manasa samyujjati mano indriyehi indriyani atthehiti evamadi miccha karana vinimutta anurupa paccaya hetuko dhammanam pavatti akara viseso
No living being or person because of the proving of the going of only a bare phenomenon and because of the absence of anyone besides that phenomenon
Now to show proof of the going of a bare phenomenon the words beginning with on account of the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity were spoken by the commentator
There mental activity and the diffusion and agitation in the process of oscillation which is mental activity  diffusion of the process of mental activity
The commentator by mentioning mental activity eschews the diffusion of the process of oscillation connected with inanimate things and by the mention of the diffusion of the process of oscillation eschews the class of mental activity producing volitional verbalexpression By the terms mental activity and the process of oscillation the commentator makes clear bodily expression
Produces the process of oscillation Brings about the group of materiality with the quality of oscillation in excess
The process of oscillation produces expression This was said concerning the process of oscillation arisen from the thought of going This process is a condition to the supporting with energy the bearing up and the movement of the conascent body of materiality Expression is that change which takes place together with the intention
Oscillation is mentioned by way of a predominant condition adhika bhava and not by way of production through oscillation alone Otherwise the state of derived materiality pertaining to expression would not be a fact aññatha viññattiya upadaya rupa bhavo durupapado siya
On who is clearly comprehending sampajano is one who knows according to every way intensively or in a detailed way samantato pakarehi pakattham va savisesam janati Clear comprehension sampajaññam is the state of that one It is likewise the knowledge of that one tassa bhavo sampajaññam Tatha pavatta ñanam
Prejudice asamapekkhana is the name given to the grasping of an object without wise reflection by way of worldly ignorant complacency gehasita aññanupekkha vasena arammanassa ayoniso gahanam
Harm come to the life through trampling down by an elephant and so forth purity through seeing those of the opposite sex and so forth
for the purpose of assisting the folk with the grace of the Dhamma thinking If I do not expound the Dhamma to them who will
Desirous of selfimprovement  wishing for personal good and wellbeing  those wishing for the Dhamma is the true meaning dhammacchandavantoti attho
by reason of the fact that the Dhamma is truly good and wellbeing dhammo hi hitam sukhañca tannimittakam
This also should be understood as included even by anothers knowing He makes systematic attention strong on account of the hungry condition of those coming behind pacchato agacchantanam chinna bhatta bhava bhayenapi yoniso manasikaram paribruhetiti idampi parassa jananeneva sangahitanti datthabbam
Material and mental phenomena would perhaps be taken as things of equal duration if the matter were put in a different way to this Should these two kinds of phenomena be wrongly considered as things of equal duration then there would be contradiction with such commentarial sayings as Material form is slowchanging is tardy as regards ceasing and with such textual sayings as I do not see a single thing so swiftly changing o bhikkhus as this mind
Since the nature of mind and mental characteristics citta cetasika is to cognize or to have objects mind and mental characteristics arise cognizing vibhaventa according to their strength yatha balam the thing become a condition to mind and mental characteristics in the form of an object or the thing become an objectcondition to mind and mental characteristics attano arammana paccayabhutamattam And immediately after the accomplishment or the effectuating of that which comprises the nature or quality of mind and mental characteristics and that quality is just the process of cognizing there occurs the ceasing of mind and mental characteristics tesam sabhava nipphatti anantaram nirodho Material phenomena however do not take objects have no objects anarammana they do no cognizing Material phenomena have to be cognized pakasetabba Cognizibilitys fulfillment pakasetabba bhava nipphatti occurs with sixteen thoughtunits solasehi cittehi hoti
Since the process of caloricity with oscillation coming behind it vayo dhatuya anugata tejo dhatu is the condition for upraising uddharanassa paccayo
caloricity and oscillation are in preponderance by reason of capability in the action of upraising
Raising up is the lifting of a foot from a place already stepped on to Stretching out is the carrying of a foot to the front from the place on which one is standing Shifting away is the carrying of a foot sidewards for the purpose of avoiding stake and the like or for avoiding contact with the other foot already set on the ground Or stretching out is the carrying of a foot to the place where the other foot is set and shifting away is the carrying of a foot further to a point beyond the place on which the other foot is
Since the process of oscillation with caloricity coming behind it tejo dhatuya anugata vayo dhatu is the condition for stretching out and shifting away atiharana vitiharananam paccayo
oscillation and caloricity are in preponderance by reason of capability in stretching out and shifting away Oscillation is naturally active and because in the actions of stretching out and shifting away its movement is excessive caloricity is subordinate to oscillation in these actions The other two processes are low in stretching out and shifting away because of the incapacity of these processes to stretch out and to shift away
Since the process of cohesion with extension coming behind it pathavi dhatuya anugata apodhatu is the condition for dropping down vossajjane paccayo
cohesion and extension are in preponderance by reason of capability in the action of dropping down The nature of cohesion is most gravid and so in the laying down of an upraised foot extension is subordinate to cohesion Because of their incapacity to drop down what is upraised the processes of caloricity and oscillation are called low in this connection
Since the process of extension with cohesion coming behind it apodhatuya anugata pathavidhatu is the condition for the keeping on the ground extension and cohesion are in preponderance by reason of capability in the keeping on the ground In keeping the foot on the ground too as in the state of something fixed cohesion is subordinate to extension owing to the excessive functioning of the latter process Cohesion is subordinate to extension also by way of the contactual action of the process of extension in pressing the foot against the ground
When the venerable elder Nanda was working for insight he slid into an unfavorable state of mind beginning with boredom in regard to the holy life and on becoming aware of that state of mind of his he stirred himself saying I shall restrain myself well Then having become energetic and very conscientious regarding guardedness at the doors of the controlling faculties of sense he reached the state of one of great perfection in selfrestraint through the fulfillment of all duties By reason of that perfection the Master placed him in the position of preeminence in regard to the controlling faculty of restraint with the words This one namely Nanda O bhikkhus is the chief among my disciples endowed with the controlling faculty of restraint
The passage beginning with the words Within it is said there certainly is no self or soul is stated to explain that looking straight on or looking away from the front is to be sure just a variety of occurrence of even bare phenomena and that therefore clear comprehension of nondelusion is the knowing of that fact as it really is
There two or three sittings  two or three sitting turns dve tayo nisajjavare Warming up is said concerning the matter of causing warmth to be taken up twice or thrice dve tini unhapanani sandhaya vuttam
The interpreting of rise and fall must be done on a state that is present according to continuity or present according to instant but not on one that is past or future which is why of present states is said
But that is hard to discern at the start so the interpreting by insight should be done by means of presence according to continuity
Present materiality is called born materiality it is included in the trio of instants of arising presence and dissolution is what is meant
Although states possessed of aginganddeath are mentioned under the heading of birth and of aging anddeath in comprehension by groups etc nevertheless here in the description of knowledge of rise and fall if it were said present birth is born the characteristic of its generation is rise the characteristic of its change is fall etc it would be tantamount to an affirmation and approval of the proposition that birth and aginganddeath were possessed of birth and of aginganddeath So the text ends with becoming in order to avoid that
With the seeing of rise and fall not only the characteristics of impermanence and pain become evident but also the characteristics in other words the individual essences of earth contact etc termed hardness touching etc respectively become clearly evident and discrete in their individual essences
The inclusion of only rise and fall here is because this kind of knowledge occurs as seeing only rise and fall not because of nonexistence of the instant of presence
Signless being secluded from the sign of the five aggregates it is taken as having no graspable entity 
Nutriment is edible nutriment
Since edible nutriment is a condition its nutriment condition for this body it follows that edible nutriment is a condition fortifying the physical sense bases such as the eye that originate through kamma
Although the streamenterer etc understand these as they really are the teaching is concluded with its culmination in arahatship in order to show the supremacy of the arahats understanding
And by the above passage of the sutta the Exalted One shows the liberating character of the Dhamma together with the Saṅghas practice of the good path
For when the commentary after asking Who understands
replies The cankerfree arahat etc the Bhikkhu Saṅgha is shown
Atthajāla is the Net of Meaning because it is perfect in meaning
Dhammajāla is the Net of the Dhamma because it is perfect in phrasing and because it expounds blameless dhammas such as virtue etc
Brahmajāla is the Supreme Net because it analyzes the paths fruits and nibbāna which are called Brahma in the sense of supreme
Diṭṭhijāla is the Net of Views because it demonstrates right view by elucidating emptiness through the refutation of wrong views
And it is the Incomparable Victory in Battle because it provides the means for crushing the doctrines of the sectarians
It shook at the great renunciation through the power of energy the bodhisattva displayed in relinquishing the glory of a worldruling monarch At the approaching of the terrace of enlightenment it shook through the power of his energy endowed with four factors
In the case of washing the dustrags some say it shook through the splendor of merit but the impact of wonder appears to apply here also In the ease of the Vessantara Jātaka it shook numerous times through the splendor of the merit acquired m the fulfillment of the pāramīs
In the teaching of the Brahmajāla it shook as a sign of applause as it did with the setting in motion of the Wheel of the Dhamma
and at the time of the councils etc
The strength of the condition feeling sometimes arises without the eyebase etc and without some of its concomitant dhammas but it can never arise without contact thus contact is a strong cause for feeling
The succession of conditions  this teaching is undertaken in order to elicit the succession of conditions thus These speculative views occur due to the agitation of craving Craving is conditioned by feeling and feeling is conditioned by contact If so what is the purpose of showing the succession of conditions The purpose is to communicate a difference in meaning thus Just as the dhamma of proclamation ie the view itself and the dhammas which condition the view arise only through their respective conditions and do not arise without them so too the dhammas about which the proclamation is madeie material form feeling etc  There is no eternal self or world at all to be found here The point is that the palpitation of craving and views ie the feeling that functions as the condition for craving which in turn functions as the cause for the view is conditioned by contact
The feeling of views is the feeling that functions as condition for the view This feeling is produced through its own conditions among which contact is the chief
For if a sense object is within range but the act of consciousness does not contact the object the latter will not become an object condition for consciousness Thus contact is a special condition for all the concomitant dhammas 
Hence when the Exalted One analyzed an act of consciousness  he brought forth contact first But it is the foundation especially for feeling
Though it is said in the commentary who do not know and do not see the true nature of dhammas as it really is
the theorists do not form a wrong adherence simply because they do not know the true nature of conditioned dhammas
This feeling the bait of the round  is fickle for it arises as the exhilaration of one who is pierced by the thorns of craving and views it does not persist with a steady tone like the pleasurable feeling of the noble paths and fruits
Feeling  the affective tone of experiencing which accompanies the proclamation of the view the self and the world are eternal and is experienced that view
So too  who do now know and do not see as they really are the origin and passing away etc of that feeling on account of which in their craving for feeling they cling to such a speculative view In this way he shows that whereas the Tathāgatas through the unobstructed knowledge of their universal eye know and see this matter as it really is the theorists only misapprehend through craving and views
Thus this teaching was given in order to mark the boundaries between the two 
Or as an alternative explanation  having analyzed the sixtytwo speculative views according to their specific causes  the present teaching is now undertaken to show their common cause 
for feeling ignorance and craving are causes common to all the views
Therein that  ie that proclamation that the self and the world are eternal
is made by those who do not know and do not see as they really are the three types of feelingpleasant painful and neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingas suffering a thorn and impermanent respectively and who do not know and see all feeling without exception in terms of its origin passing away satisfaction unsatisfactoriness and escape
In the doctrine of nonpercipient immortality the first doctrine arises through the experience of beings reborn in the nonpercipient realm The second takes perception to be the self and maintains a nonpercipient immortality on the ground that no other perception exists belonging to this self as its property The third doctrine arises when the material dhammas together with perception or all the material and immaterial dhammas together are apprehended as the self And the fourth is maintained by way of reasoning
In the second tetrad taking non percipient to signify that the materiality of the kasiṇa lacks the specific nature of perceiving the four doctrines should be understood according to the method slated in the discussion of the extensionist doctrines
In the doctrines of neither percipient nor nonpercipient immortality the first doctrine recognizes in the ase of a being reborn in the realm of neither perception nor nonperception the existence of a subtle perception incapable of performing the decisive function of perception at death and rebirthlinking or on any occasion  The second doctrines are maintained by acknowledging the specific nature of perceiving and the subtlety of the perception according to the method stated for the doctrine of nonpercipient immortality In order to show the unreasonableness of the theorists doctrines even when reasons are offered he says No special reason need be sought for this
Because these doctrines of percipient non percipient and neither percipient nor nonpercipient immortality all state that the self is immutable after death it is clear that they are included in eternalism
Query When formations are subject to constant cessation from moment to moment who kills and who is killed If it is said that the continuum of consciousness and its concomitants kills and is killed this answer has to be rejected For such a continuum is immaterial and because it is immaterial it is incapable of inflicting any harm by cutting breaking etc nor can it he harmed itself If it is said that killing and being killed apply to the material continuum this alternative too must he rejected For the material continuum is devoid of consciousness like a block of wood and so the destruction of life by cutting etc can no more apply to the body than to a lifeless corpse Again the means of destroying life such as striking a blow etc must apply to formations either in the past the future or the present But it is impossible that the means could apply to past or future formations since those do not exist  In the case of present formations any application of the means would he useless For the present formations due to their momentary nature are subject to complete cessation anyway and hence are already heading towards their own destruction by themselves Since therefore their destruction occurs without any extraneous cause  death would not be caused by the striking of blows or by other means Because the formations are devoid of personal initiative  to whom do the means of killing belong And who should be bound by the kamma of destroying life if due to momentariness the intention of killing breaks up at the very same time it arises and does not last up to the time of the acts completion
Reply The killer is the assemblage of formations conventionally called a being containing the aforementioned volition of killing That which is killed by him is the aggregation of material and immaterial dhammas that would have been capable of arising if the aforementioned means of killing had not been applied but which now continues as a bare procession conventionally termed dead deprived of vital warmth consciousness and the lifefaculty due to the application of the means of killing by the killer Or else the continuum of consciousness and its concomitants alone
Although the mental continuum does not itself form the actual object of the means of killing  still the notion of lifedestruction remains valid  For in the fiveconstituent existence the mental continuum occurs in dependence upon the material continuum so when an enemy applies the means of cutting off the lifefaculty to the material continuum in such a way that the successive arising of the vital material slates linked up with and supporting the correlative mental continuum is impaired then the disruption takes place  Again the destruction of life is not without a specific cause nor is the application of the means of killing useless Death is not without a specific cause because if the means of killing are applied to the present formations does occur through specific causes as explained above Therefore death is not causeless Nor are the means of destroying life void of agency  Though formations lack personal initiative nevertheless the conventional designation of agency is applicable to causes that are effective through their contiguity and are fixed in their capacity to give results adequate to themselves just as in the statements the lamp illuminates and the moon brings in the night  The act of destroying life must be recognized to pertain not only to the aggregation of consciousness and mental concomitants existing simultaneously with the intention of killing but must also be admitted to apply to the that endures by way of the continuum Just as the accomplishment of activity is seen in the case of lamps etc which likewise exist by way of continuity so too there certainly does exist one who is bound by the kamma of destroying life
The same method of investigation may with due alterations be applied in the ease of taking what is not given etc as well
By the phrase lives the life of chastity abstinence from sexual intercourse is meant
by the phrase he dwells remote abstinence from the seven bonds of sexuality is shown
Here unchastity denotes the volition of indulgence in impure conduct reaching expression through the bodily door and occasioning sexual union But in the offence of sexual misconduct  the volition of having sexual intercourse with an inviolable person such as a girl under the care of her parents etc should be substituted
Transgression against persons of inferior moral qualities is less blameworthy
But forceful compulsion is highly blameworthy even in the ease of persons of inferior qualities If the persons transgressed against are of equal qualities and give their consent then the act is less blameworthy when the defilements and force of the effort are mild more blameworthy when they are strong
For unchastity there are two components the lustful thought of indulgence and the union of sexual organs
For sexual misconduct there are four components the inviolable person the thought of indulgence the effort to indulge and the tolerance of sexual union
Some however say that in the case of a forceful transgression there is no offence of sexual misconduct for the violated individual even though he or she tolerates the union since he or she made no effort for union prior to the act of intercourse
But others reply that so long as the lustful thought or desire for indulgence arises the lack of effort is no criterion since women generally do not make effort for indulgence  one would be led to the untenable conclusion that a woman incurs no offence of sexual misconduct even when she has already moused the lustful thought of indulgence beforehand
Therefore it should be understood that four factors are mentioned as the maximum in the case of a man Otherwise there would be no offence of sexual misconduct even for a man at a time when a woman is playing the active role since the effort lor indulgence would be lacking on his part
This then is the ruling For one who engages through ones own desire there are three components the inviolable person the effort to indulge and the tolerance of union the lustful thought of indulgence being already implied by the effort to indulge For one who engages because one is forced to there are three components Because of the absence of any effort for union prior to the act there are only the inviolable person the lustful thought of indulgence and the tolerance of union But when all are mentioned without omission there are four
There is only one means ones own person
Even though an effort is made with the intention to deceive if the meaning is not understood by another the act of deceiving is incomplete thus the communication of the meaning to another is one factor
Whether one at whom the slander is directed suffers division or not as long as the meaning is communicated it is sufficient  But the act reaches the level of a course of kamma only when division occurs
Thus have I heard This is the introduction or beginning to the Brahmajāla Sutta spoken by the Venerable nanda on the occasion of the First Great Council For at the First Council after the compilation of the Vinaya Piṭaka was completed the Venerable Mahākassapa questioned the Venerable nanda about the Brahmajāla the first sutta in the first collection of the Sutta Piṭaka asking Friend nanda where was the Brahmajāla Sutta spoken  and so on When the questionnaire was finished the Venerable nanda explained everything where it was spoken the reason etc beginning with the words Thus have I heard 
By this he meant Thus have I heard concerning the Brahmajāla
The lions roar will be sounded in the portions of the teaching beginning These viewpoints etc
The views will be subsumed under the law of conditionality in the passage beginning With feeling as condition there arises in them craving etc
The pair of similes about Mount Sineru and the golden mallet has the purpose of showing the extreme difficulty of teaching the Brahmajala Sutta for that lies beyond the capacity of anybody other than 
Query What was the purpose in including the introductory narrative in the compilation of the Dhamma and Vinaya Shouldnt the collection only have included the actual words spoken by the Buddha
Reply The introductory narrative serves to promote the durability nonobscuration and credibility of the discourse
For a discourse provided with an indication of the time place teacher background story and assembly endures long remains free from obscuration and is credible
like a business contract provided with notations of the place date merchandise and conditions Therefore at the First Great Council the Venerable Mahākassapa asked about the place where the Brahmajāla Sutta was spoken etc and the Venerable Ananda the treasurer of the Dhamma recited the introduction in reply
Furthermore the introduction reveals the excellence of the Master
By showing that the Exalted One has no need for prior preparation inference or reasoning based on scripture it points to his attainment of perfect Buddhahood
For as a perfectly enlightened Buddha he requires no previous preparation  for him there is only one authoritative source of knowledgethe movement of his unimpeded knowledge in all knowable dhammas
Again by showing that the Master has no closed fist of a teacher no stinginess in sharing the Dhamma and no favoritism towards disciples it points to his freedom from cankers 
For through the destruction of cankers he has eliminated all closedfistedness and rendered his activity of benefitting others fully pure
Thus the Masters perfect Buddhahood and complete inner purity respectively indicate his accomplishment in knowledge and in the abandonment  and point to his freedom from ignorance and craving those corruptions which corrode a teachers attainments in wisdom and virtue They further prove that he is endowed with the first two of the Tathagalas grounds of self confidence The Masters lack of any confusion in regard to states obstructive to spiritual progress and in regard to the liberating potency of his doctrine prove that he is endowed with the third and fourth grounds of selfconfidence Thus the introduction by describing the Exalted One as he who knows and sees and by exhibiting his ingenuity in creating an opportunity to deliver a discourse appropriate to the inclinations of the assembly present reveals his endowment with the four grounds of selfconfidence and his conduct for the welfare of himself and others
Therefore it is said The introduction reveals the excellence of the Master
Furthermore the introduction also reveals the excellence of the Dispensation 
For the Exalted One whose every deed is accompanied by knowledge and compassion does not engage in any useless activity nor in any activity directed to his own welfare alone Every deed of the perfectly enlightened Buddha is directed to the welfare of others Since this is so all the actions of the Buddha bodily verbal and mental described as they actually occurred constitute his Dispensation in the sense that they instruct other beings in their own goodin the good pertaining to the present life to the life to come and to ultimate deliverance It is not mere poetry
For along with the indication of the time place teacher story and assembly the introduction here and there shows as far as possible the conduct of the Master
Or else the introduction reveals the authoritativeness of the Dispensation by revealing the authoritativeness of the Master The Masters aulhoritativeness is indicated by the title the Exalted One  signifying his supremacy among all beings by reason of his distinguished qualities and by the epithet he who knows and sees signifying his attainment of the knowledge of the propensities and latent tendencies of others etc The above is a mere outline of the purposes served by the introductory narrative
For who can exhaustively explain all the purposes of the introduction spoken by the treasurer of the Dhamma  who was enlightened after the Buddha himself
The sign is the learning sign and the counterpart sign
or both are stated here together
Herein the three similes beginning with cotton are properly the learning sign the rest are both
Some are certain teachers
No first point of ignorance can be discerned that is because no initial boundary exists not even my unimpeded knowledge of omniscience can discern a first boundary of ignorance of which it can be said Ignorance first arose in the time of such and such a perfectly enlightened Buddha or of such and such a worldruling monarch It did not exist before that Admittedly ignorance is said to lack an initial boundary
Nevertheless though it is said to lack an initial boundary in terms of temporal determination 
ignorance has a specific condition that is ignorance arises with the five hindrances as its condition And therefore a first point of ignorance can be discerned in terms of the order of dhammas 
For it is said in the same sutta And what is the nutriment for ignorance The reply is the five hindrances
Craving for existence  craving that functions as the fetter of existence 
Its specific condition is ignorance
For it is said in the sutta And what is the nutriment for craving for existence The reply is ignorance
The view of existence the eternalist view
Its specific condition is feeling
Sense sphere  here there are the two kinds of sense desire  sense desire as basis and sense desire as defilement 
Of these sense desire as objective basis particularized as the five cords of sense desire  is desired  Sense desire as defilement which is craving desires 
The sense sphere is where these two operate together
But what is that
It is the elevenfold sensedesire becoming ie hell asura demons ghosts animals human beings and six sensualsphere heavens
So too with the finematerial sphere and the immaterial sphere taking finematerial as craving for the finematerial too and immaterial as craving for the immaterial too
It crosses over from the world  thus it is supramundane 
To the six kinds of objects all classed as limited etc past etc internal etc
The source it has come from and so on means the source it has come from and its condition
Here in the opinion of certain teachers the result of the unprompted profitable is unprompted and the result of the prompted is prompted like the movement of the faces reflection in a lookingglass when the face moves thus it is due to the source it has come from
But in the opinion of other teachers the unprompted arises due to powerful kamma as condition and the prompted does so due to weak kamma thus it is due to its condition
With respect to such unsublime objects as the forms of skeletons or ghosts
Here kamma is storedup profitable kamma of the sense sphere that has got an opportunity to ripen
Sign of kamma is the gift to be given that was a condition for the volition at the moment of accumulating the kamma
Sign of destiny is the visibledata base located in the destiny in which he is about to be reborn
hence he said that has appeared
The sign of kamma here is only the kammas own object consisting of an earth kasiṇa etc
if kamma is the lifecontinuums object then it is that kamma if the sign of the kamma or the sign of the destiny then it is one of those
With that same object
Occurring endlessly this is in fact thus called bhavaṅga of becoming because of its occurring as the state of an aṅga of the rebirthprocess becoming 
The seeing of dreams is done with consciousness consisting only of the functional
A disturbance in the lifecontinuum is a wavering of the lifecontinuum consciousness the meaning is that there is the arrival at a state that is a reason for dissimilarity in its occurrence twice in that way
For it is called disturbance because it is like a disturbance since there seems to be a cause for an occasion in the minds continuity different from the previous occasion
Granted firstly that there is impact on the sensitivity owing to confrontation with an object since the necessity for that is established by the existence of the objective field and the possessor of the objective field but how does there come to be disturbance of the lifecontinuum that has a different support
Because it is connected with it
And here the example is this when grains of sugar are put on the surface of a drum and one of the grains of sugar is tapped a fly sitting on another grain of sugar moves
Next to adverting means next to fivedoor adverting
For those who do not admit the cognitive series beginning with receiving just as they do not admit the heart basis the Pali has been handed down in various places in the way beginning For the eyeconsciousness element as receiving  
for the Pali cannot be contradicted
If  vivid  this is said because it is the occurrence of consciousness at the end of the impulsions that is being discussed
For an object is here intended as vivid when its life is fourteen conscious moments and that should be understood as coming into focus when it has arisen and is two or three moments past
This includes also the preliminarywork and the cleansing  not changeoflineage only
That obtains a condition any impulsion that has obtained a condition for arising next to changeoflineage as that of the finematerial sphere and so on
A very vivid one is one with a life of sixteen conscious moments
For registration consciousness arises with respect to that not with respect to any other
Clear means very evident and that is only in the sense sphere
for registration arises with respect to that
Previous kamma this is said in order to show the differences in kinds of registration
for kamma that generates rebirthlinking is not the only kind to generate registration other kinds of kamma do so too
But the latter generates registration unlike that generatable by the kamma that generates rebirthlinking
Impulsion consciousness this is said in order to show what defines the registration
for it is said Registration is definable by impulsion 
The word etc includes rebirthlinking
however for that is not a condition for registration that is more outstanding than itself
Any condition any condition from among the desirable objects etc that has combined to produce the arising of registration
This should be regarded as a secondary characteristic of profitable feeling
that is to say the fact that whatever profitable feeling there is is all associated with profitable consciousness That however is not for the purpose of establishing its profitableness
For the profitableness of profitable feeling is not due to its association with profitable consciousness but rather to wise attention and so on
That is why he said as to kind
So too in the case of the unprofitable and so on
Pleasure and pain respectively gratify and afflict by acting in one way on the body and in another way on the mind but not so equanimity
which is why the latter is described as of one class
Just as when a man places a piece of cotton wool on an anvil and strikes it with an iron hammer and his hammer goes right through the cotton and hits the anvil the violence of the blow is great so too because the violence of the impacts blow is great bodyconsciousness is accompanied by pleasure when the object is a desirable or desirableneutral one
and by pain when the object is an undesirable or undesirable neutral one It is the impact of primary matter on the primaries of the body
The characteristic of agglomerating means the characteristic of adding together 
then they are said to have the function of accumulating for the dhammas in the formations aggregate are so described because volition is their basis
As the act of touching too by this he shows that this is its individual essence even though it is immaterial
And the characteristic of touching is obvious in its occurrence in such instances as say the watering of the mouth in one who sees another tasting vinegar or a ripe mango the bodily shuddering in a sympathetic person who sees another being hurt the trembling of the knees in a timid man standing on the ground when he sees a man precariously balanced on a high tree branch the loss of power of the legs in one who sees something terrifying such as a pisāca 
Nonadherent means not sticking 
On any one side means on any one side of itself like a pair of planks and so on
It is only the impact without adherence that contact shares with visible data and sound not the objective field
Just as though eye and ear are nonadherent respectively to visible data and sounds still they have the word touched used of them so too it can be said of contacts touching and impinging on the object
Contacts impinging is the actual concurrence of consciousness and object
Apilāpana is the steadying of an object the remembering and not forgetting it keeping it as immovable as a stone instead of letting it go bobbing about like a pumpkin in water
And here by tranquilization etc of consciousness only consciousness is tranquillized and becomes light malleable wieldy proficient and upright
But with tranquilization etc of the mental body also the material body is tranquillized and so on
This is why the twofoldness of states is given by the Blessed One here but not in all places
The act of resolving should be understood as the act of being convinced about an object not as trusting 
Because the path consciousnesses have Nibbāna as their object and because compassion gladness etc have living beings as their object there is no compassion etc in the path
Because the paralysis of consciousness comes about through stiffness but that of matter through torpor like that of the three aggregates beginning with feeling therefore torpor is manifested as nodding and sleep
Mere steadiness in occurrence is mere presence for a moment
That it is only mere steadiness in occurrence owing to the mere condition for the steadiness of the mind is because of lack of real steadiness due to absence of decidedness  and it is incapable of being a condition for such steadiness in continuity as the steadiness of consciousness stated thus like the steadiness of a flame sheltered from a draught 
Here when the time is delimited by death and rebirthlinking the term extent is applicable It is made known through the Suttas in the way beginning Was I in the past 
for the past state is likewise mentioned as extent in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta too in the way beginning He does not follow what is past  
Bhikkhus there are three extents
the past extent the future extent and the present extent But when it is delimited in the ultimate sense as in the Addhāniruttipatha Sutta thus then it is appropriate as delimited by moment
Herein Bhikkhus of matter that is born  manifested
it is said that It exists  the existingness of the present is stated thus and pastness and futureness are respectively called before and after that
Cold temperature is like with cold and hot with hot
But that temperature which falls on the body whether hot or cold and occurs as a continuity in one mode being neither less nor more is called single temperature The word single is used because of the plurality of like temperature So too with nutriment
In one cognitive series in one impulsion refers respectively to fivedoor and minddoor consciousness
The explanations of continuity and period are given in the Commentaries for the purpose of helping the practice of insight
Cause is what gives birth  condition is what consolidates 
Their respective functions are arousing and consolidating Just as the seeds function is to arouse the sprout and that of the earth etc is to consolidate it and just as kammas function is to arouse result as matter that is due to kamma performed and that of nutriment is to consolidate it so the function of those conditions that give birth to each material group and each thoughtarising and serve as kamma and proximityconditions etc for them and the function of those that consolidate them and serve as conascence prenascence and postnascence conditions for them may be construed accordingly as appropriate
Because there is similarity and dissimilarity in temperature etc in the way stated the pastness etc of material instances originated by it are stated according to continuity But there is no such similarity and dissimilarity in the kamma that gives birth to a single becoming so instead of stating according to continuity the pastness etc of material instances originated by that it is stated according to what consolidates
However when there comes to be reversal of sex then the male sex disappears owing to powerful unprofitable kamma and the female sex appears owing to weak profitable kamma
and the female sex disappears owing to weak unprofitable kamma while the male sex appears owing to powerful profitable kamma  So there is in fact dissimilarity in what is originated by kamma and consequent dissimilarity in what is past etc in accordance with the continuity of these as well But it is not included because it does not happen always
The feeling that accompanies the faith etc occurring in one who sees an image of the Buddha or who hears the Dhamma even for a whole day is present
Bhikkhus this saṃsara is without discoverable beginning
A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
Suppose bhikkhus a dog tied up on a leash was bound to a strong post or pillar
If it walks it walks close to that post or pillar If it stands it stands close to that post or pillar If it sits down it sits down close to that post or pillar If it lies down it lies down close to that post or pillar
So too bhikkhus the uninstructed worldling regards form thus This is mine this I am this is my self
He regards feeling  perception  volitional formations  consciousness thus This is mine this I am this is my self
If he walks he walks close to those five aggregates subject to clinging If he stands he stands close to those five aggregates subject to clinging If he sits down he sits down close to those five aggregates subject to clinging If he lies down he lies down close to those five aggregates subject to clinging
Therefore bhikkhus one should often reflect upon ones own mind thus For a long time this mind has been defiled by lust hatred and delusion
Through the defilements of the mind beings are defiled with the cleansing of the mind beings are purified
Now at that time scruples arose in the monks as to this and that occasion thinking Now what is permitted by the Lord What is not permitted
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Whatever monks has not been objected to by me saying This is not allowable if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable that is not allowable to you
Whatever monks has not been objected to by me saying This is not allowable if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable that is allowable to you
Whatever monks has not been permitted by me saying This is allowable if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable that is allowable to you
And whatever monks has not been permitted by me saying This is allowable if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable that is not allowable to you
Then it occurred to monks Now is during a watch of the night allowable with during a short period or it is not allowable
Now is during seven days allowable with during a short period or is it not allowable
Now is during life allowable with during a short period or is it not allowable
Now is during seven days allowable with during a watch of the night or is it not allowable
Now is during life allowable with during a watch of the night or is it not allowable
Now is during life allowable with during seven days or is it not allowable
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks during a watch of the night with during a short period is allowable at the right time on the day it is accepted it is not allowable at the wrong time
Monks during seven days with during a short period is allowable at the right time on the day it is accepted it is not allowable at the wrong time
Monks during life with during a short period is allowable at the right time on the day it is accepted it is not allowable at the wrong time
Monks during seven days with during a watch of the night is allowable in a watch of the night on the day it is accepted it is not allowable after the watch of the night is ended
Monks during life with during a watch of the night is allowable in a watch of the night on the day it is accepted it is not allowable after the watch of the night is ended
Monks during life with during seven days is allowable for seven days it is not allowable after the seven days are ended
Then the Lord walking on tour in due course arrived at tumā
The Lord stayed there in tumā in the House with the threshingfloor
Then he who had gone forth when old having had a quantity of conjey prepared towards the end of that night brought it to the Lord saying Lord may the Lord accept conjey from me
Now Truthfinders ask knowing and knowing do not ask they ask knowing the right time  and they do not ask knowing the right time  Truthfinders ask about what belongs to the goal not about what does not belong to the goal there is bridgebreaking for Truthfinders in whatever does not belong to the goal Awakened ones Lords question monks concerning two matters either Shall we preach dhamma or Shall we lay down a rule of training for disciples
Then the Lord spoke thus to him who had gone forth when old Where is this conjey from monk
Then he who had gone forth when old told this matter to the Lord
The awakened one the Lord rebuked him saying It is not suitable foolish man it is not fitting it is not becoming it is not worthy of a recluse it is not allowable it is not to be done
For how can you foolish man one who has gone forth cause to take what is not allowable
It is not foolish man for pleasing those who are not pleased  And having rebuked him having given reasoned talk he addressed the monks saying  Monks one who has gone forth should not make take what is not allowable Whoever should make take  there is an offence of wrongdoing
Nor monks should one who was formerly a barber carry about a barbers equipment
Whoever should carry it about there is an offence of wrongdoing
Then the Lord having stayed in Kusinārā for as long as he found suiting set out on tour for tumā together with the large Order of monks with the twelve hundred and fifty monks
Now at that time a certain  formerly a barber who had gone forth when old was living in tumā
He had two boys sweetvoiced intelligent skilled accomplished in their craft in the barbers profession their own teachers
Then that who had gone forth when old heard They say that the Lord is coming to tumā together with a large Order of monks with twelve hundred and fifty monks
Then that who had gone forth when old spoke thus to his boys It is said my dears that the Lord is coming to tumā together with a large Order of monks with twelve hundred and fifty monks
Do you go my dears and taking a barbers equipment tour from house to house for nāti measures of offerings and collect salt and oil and husked rice and solid food and when the Lord comes we will make him a conjey drink
Very well father and these boys having answered him who had gone forth when old in assent taking a barbers equipment toured from house to house for nāti measures of offerings collecting salt and oil and husked rice and solid food
Those people who having seen these sweetvoiced intelligent boys but had not wanted to have made even they had them made and having had them made also gave much
So these boys collected much salt and oil and husked rice and solid food
In the sense of entirety  In the sense of the jhānas entire object
It is not made its partial object
 The sign for the anchoring of mindfullness is the nosetip or upperlip which is the cause and the sign for the anchoring of mindfullness
 and approves of what is good if a companion exhorts others to do something good without considering the right place and time or without considering the hindrances and other undesired cor sequences arising therefrom he being aware of it approves of is Very good my dear lets do it
For the penetration of the characteristic of foulness for the observation of repulsiveness as the individual essence
Hatthasaṅkhalikāthe fingers of a pair of clasped hands a row of fingers 
With such a person of course he attains absorption But if this bhikkhu does not rest content with just that much and wants to break down the barriers he should next after that develop lovingkindness towards a very dearly loved friend then towards a neutral person as a very dearly loved friend then towards a hostile person as neutral
And while he does so he should make his mind malleable and wieldy in each instance before passing on to the next
So he should first as example pervade himself with lovingkindness Next after that in order to proceed easily he can recollect such gifts kind words etc as inspire love and endearment such virtue learning etc as inspire respect and reverence met with in a teacher or his equivalent or a preceptor or his equivalent developing lovingkindness towards him in the way beginning May this good man be happy and free from suffering
At one time the awakened one the Lord was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels feeding place
Now at that time a rainsresidence for monks had not come to be laid down by the Lord
So these monks walked on tour during the cold weather and the hot weather and the rains
People looked down upon criticised spread it about saying How can these recluses sons of the Sakyans walk on tour during the cold weather and the hot weather and the rains trampling down the crops and grasses injuring life that is onefacultied and bringing many small creatures to destruction
Shall it be that those members of other sects whose rules are badly kept cling to and prepare a rainsresidence
shall it be that these birds having made their nests in the treetops cling to and prepare a rainsresidence
while these recluses sons of the Sakyans walk on a tour during the cold weather and the hot weather and the rains trampling down the crops and grasses injuring life that is onefacultied and bringing many small creatures to destruction
Monks heard these people who  spread it about
Then these monks told this matter to the Lord
Then the Lord on this occasion in this connection having given reasoned talk addressed the monks saying I allow you monks to enter upon the rains
Then it occurred to these monks Now when should the rains be entered upon
They told this matter to the Lord
He said I allow you monks to enter upon the rains in the rainy season
Then it occurred to these monks Now how many are there for beginning the rains
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks there are these two for beginning the rains the earlier and the later
The earlier may be entered upon the day after sāḷhī the later may be entered upon a month after sāḷhī These monks are the two for beginning the rains
Now at that time the group of six monks having entered upon the rains walked on tour during the rains
People  spread it about saying How can these recluses sons of the Sakyans walk on tour during the cold weather and the hot weather and the rains trampling down  as in Kd  bringing many small creatures to destruction
Monks heard these people who  spread it about
Those who were modest monks  spread it about saying How can this group of six monks having entered upon the rains walk on tour during the rains
Then these monks told this matter to the Lord
Then the Lord on this occasion in this connection having given reasoned talk addressed the monks saying Monks having entered upon the rains but not having kept either the first three months or the last three months one should not set out on tour
Whoever should set out there is an offence of wrongdoing
Now at that time the group of six monks did not want to enter upon the rains
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks one should not not enter upon the rains
Whoever should not enter upon  there is an offence of wrongdoing
Now at that time the group of six monks on a day for beginning the rains not desiring to enter upon the rains intentionally passed a residence by
They told this matter to the Lord
He said Monks on a day for beginning the rains a residence should not be intentionally passed by one who does not desire to enter upon the rains
Whoever should pass one by there is an offence of wrongdoing
Ten women protected by the mother protected by the father protected by the parents protected by the brother protected by the sister protected by the relations protected by the lineage protected by dhamma with protection protected by a stick
Ten wives one bought with money one kept for passion a kept woman one who receives clothes one who provides water one who takes off the pad  the slave and wife the servant and wife the flagbrought the wife for the moment
Protected by the mother means the mother protects guards wields supremacy has her under control
the mother lets her go nowhere
she puts her in a place so guarded that other people cannot see 
restrains her from living in lodgings of her own choice and overrules her
Saying do this do not do that
neither lineage nor dhamma protects her but she is protected by her own clanspeople and by those regarding dhamma who on account of one teacher have gone forth belonging to one company
A countrywoman comes to be a wife having received the household implements
receiving as much as a garment or cloak a vagabond woman rises to be a wife
plunging their two hands into one pot of water he says Joined like this water so let them not be divided
Someone who is a gatherer of firewood and so on and taking the pad off her head he keeps her in the house
She works in the house for wages Somebody lives a household life with her  not satisfied with his own wife
Having gone with the army erecting the flag plundering another district she is brought back If anyone makes her his wife she is called flagbrought
This refers to the teacher Revata
In the Sarvāstivādin school and so on
The Niddesa method is this
Here the Masters possession of vision shows the greatness of understanding and his possession of conduct the greatness of his compassion
It was through understanding that the Blessed One reached the kingdom of the Dhamma and through compassion that he became the bestower of the Dhamma
It was through understanding that he felt revulsion for the round of rebirths and through compassion that he bore it
It was through understanding that he fully understood others suffering and through compassion that he undertook to counteract it
It was through understanding that he was brought face to face with Nibbāna and through compassion that he attained it
It was through understanding that he himself crossed over and through compassion that he brought others across
It was through understanding that he perfected the Enlightened Ones state and through compassion that he perfected the Enlightened Ones task
Or it was through compassion that he faced the round of rebirths as a Bodhisatta and through understanding that he took no delight in it
Likewise it was through compassion that he practiced noncruelty to others and through understanding that he was himself fearless of others
It was through compassion that he protected others to protect himself and through understanding that he protected himself to protect others
Likewise it was through compassion that he did not torment others and through understanding that he did not torment himself
so of the four types of persons beginning with the one who practices for his own welfare he perfected the fourth and best type
Likewise it was through compassion that he became the worlds helper and through understanding that he became his own helper
It was through compassion that he had humility as a Bodhisatta and through understanding that he had dignity as a Buddha
Likewise it was through compassion that he helped all beings as a father while owing to the understanding associated with it his mind remained detached from them all and it was through understanding that his mind remained detached from all dhammas while owing to the compassion associated with it that he was helpful to all beings
For just as the Blessed Ones compassion was devoid of sentimental affection or sorrow so his understanding was free from the thoughts of I and mine
Is not unobstructed knowledge different from omniscient knowledge  Otherwise the words Six kinds of knowledge unshared by disciples would be contradicted Note The six kinds are knowledge of what faculties prevail in beings knowledge of the inclinations and tendencies of beings knowledge of the Twin Marvel knowledge of the attainment of the great compassion omniscient knowledge and unobstructed knowledge 
 There is no contradiction because two ways in which a single kind of knowledges objective field occurs are described for the purpose of showing by means of this difference how it is not shared by others
It is only one kind of knowledge but it is called omniscient knowledge because its objective field consists of formed unformed and conventional ie conceptual dhammas without remainder and it is called unobstructed knowledge because of its unrestricted access to the objective field because of absence of obstruction
And it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā It knows all the formed and the unformed without remainder thus it is omniscient knowledge It has no obstruction therein thus it is unobstructed knowledge  and so on
So they are not different kinds of knowledge And there must be no reservation
otherwise it would follow that omniscient and unobstructed knowledge had obstructions and did not make all dhammas its object
There is not in fact a minimal obstruction to the Blessed Ones knowledge and if his unobstructed knowledge did not have all dhammas as its object there would be presence of obstruction where it did not occur and so it would not be unobstructed
Or alternatively even if we suppose that they are different still it is omniscient knowledge itself that is intended as unhindered since it is that which occurs unhindered universally
And it is by his attainment of that that the Blessed One is known as Omniscient Allseer Fully Enlightened not because of awareness of every dhamma at once simultaneously 
And it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā This is a name derived from the final liberation of the Enlightened Ones the Blessed Ones together with the acquisition of omniscient knowledge at the root of the Enlightenment Tree this name Buddha is a designation based on realization 
For the ability in the Blessed Ones continuity to penetrate all dhammas without exception was due to his having completely attained to knowledge capable of becoming aware of all dhammas
Here it may be asked But how then When this knowledge occurs does it do so with respect to every field simultaneously or successively
For firstly if it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field then with the simultaneous appearance of formed dhammas classed as past future and present internal and external etc and of unformed and conventional dhammas there would be no awareness of contrast  as happens in one who looks at a painted canvas from a distance That being so it follows that all dhammas become the objective field of the Blessed Ones knowledge in an undifferentiated form  as they do through the aspect of notself to those who are exercising insight thus All dhammas are notself 
And those do not escape this difficulty who say that the Enlightened Ones knowledge occurs with the characteristic of presence of all knowable dhammas as its objective field devoid of discriminative thinking  and universal in time and that is why they are called Allseeing and why it is said The Nāga is concentrated walking and he is concentrated standing  They do not escape the difficulty since the Blessed Ones knowledge would then have only a partial objective field because by having the characteristic of presence as its object past future and conventional dhammas which lack that characteristic would be absent
So it is wrong to say that it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field
Then secondly if we say that it occurs successively with respect to every objective field
that is wrong too
For when the knowable classed in the many different ways according to birth place individual essence etc and direction place time etc is apprehended successively then penetration without remainder is not effected since the knowable is infinite
And those are wrong too who say that the Blessed One is Allseeing owing to his doing his defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning and that such knowledge is not inferential since it is free from doubt
because it is what is doubtfully discovered that is meant by inferential knowledge in the world And they are wrong
because there is no such defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning without making all of it actually experienced For then that rest is not actually experienced
and if it were actually experienced it would no longer be the rest
All that is no argument
Why not
Because this is not a field for ratiocination
for the Blessed One has said this The objective field of Enlightened Ones is unthinkable it cannot be thought out
The agreed explanation here is this Whatever the Blessed One wants to knoweither entirely or partiallythere his knowledge occurs as actual experience because it does so without hindrance And it has constant concentration because of the absence of distraction
anyone who tried to think it out would reap madness and frustration 
And it cannot occur in association with wishing of a kind that is due to absence from the objective field of something that he wants to know There can be no exception to this because of the words All dhammas are available to the adverting of the Enlightened One the Blessed One are available at his wish are available to his attention are available to his thought 
And the Blessed Ones knowledge that has the past and future as its objective field is entirely actual experience since it is devoid of assumption based on inference tradition or conjecture
And yet even in that case suppose he wanted to know the whole in its entirety then would his knowledge not occur without differentiation in the whole objective field simultaneously And so there would still be no getting out of that difficulty
That is not so because of its purifiedness
Because the Enlightened Ones objective field is purified and it is unthinkable
Otherwise there would be no unthinkableness in the knowledge of the Enlightened One the Blessed One if it occurred in the same way as that of ordinary people
So although it occurs with all dhammas as its object it nevertheless does so making those dhammas quite clearly defined as though it had a single dhamma as its object This is what is unthinkable here
 There is as much knowledge as there is knowable
there is as much knowable as there is knowledge
the knowledge is limited by the knowable the knowable is limited by the knowledge 
So he is Fully Enlightened because he has rightly and by himself discovered all dhammas together and separately simultaneously and successively according to his wish
Because of the words Also all dhammas of the three planes are sense desires in the sense of being desirable  greed for becoming is sensedesire clinging
Development of the recollection comes to success in him who has that not in any other
 Absolute confidence is the confidence afforded by the noble path
The thirtysix modes of behaviour of craving are the three craving for sense desires for becoming and for nonbecoming in the cases of each one of the twelve internal external bases or they are those given in the KhuddakavatthuVibhaṅga  leaving out the three periods of time
for with those they come to one hundred and eight
Thoughts of renunciation etc in the mundane moment they are the three separately that is nongreed loving kindness and compassion they are given as one at the path moment owing to the cutting off of greed ill will and cruelty
Consciousness concentration  is the road to power consisting of purity of consciousness they say
Those who hold that there is an Overlord as reason say An Overlord makes the world occur prepares it halts it disposes of it
Those who hold that there is a Basic Principle as reason say The world is manifested from out of a Basic Principle  and it is reabsorbed in that again
Time it is that creates beings Disposes of this generation
Time watches over those who sleep To outstrip Time is hard indeed
 those who hold the theory of Time say
Those who hold the theory of Nature say The world appears and disappears just because of its nature  like the sharp nature of thorns like the roundness of woodapples  like the variedness of wild beasts birds snakes and so on
The word etc refers to those who preach fatalism and say The occurrence of the world is due to atoms All is due to causes effected in the past The world is determined like drilled gems threaded on an unbroken string There is no doing by a man
It is by chance that they occur By chance as well that they do not
Pleasure and pain are due to chance This generation lives by chance
 and to those who preach liberation by chance
Taking final release to be in the immaterial world like that of Rāmudaka ḷāra  etc or in a World Apex  like that of the Nigaṇṭhas 
And by the word etc are included also the preachers of Nibbāna here and now as the selfs establishment in its own self when it has become dissociated from the qualities owing to the nonoccurrence of the Basic Principle  and being in the same world as in the presence of or in union with Brahmā
Right speech has as its individual essence the embracing of associated states through affectionateness because it is the opposite of false speech and the other kinds which being rough owing to their respective functions of deceiving etc do not embrace
Bodily work originates whatever has to be done And that originating is itself a combining so the abstinence called right action is said to have originating as its individual essence
Or it is the picking up of associated states which is the causing of them to be originated on the part of bodily work like the picking up of a burden
The purification of a living being or of associated states is cleansing
Dhammas without condition Unformed dhammas 
Bhikkhus there is that base where neither earth   
This state is very hard to see that is to say the stilling of all formations the relinquishing of all substance of becoming 
Bhikkhus I shall teach you the unformed and the way leading to the unformed  and so on and in this sutta Bhikkhus there is an unborn   Now in the ultimate sense the existingness of the Nibbānaelement has been demonstrated by the Fully Enlightened One compassionate for the whole world by many sutta passages such as these So even if the wise trust completely in the Dispensation and have no doubts though they may not yet have had direct perception of it
nevertheless there are persons who come to understand through anothers guidance  and the intention here is that this logical reasoning under the heading of deduction should be for the purpose of removing their doubts
Just as it is owing to fullunderstanding that from the sense desires and from materiality etc  that have something beyond them there is made known an escape from them that is their opposite and whose individual essence is devoid of them so there must exist an escape that is the opposite of and whose individual essence is devoid of all formed dhammas all of which have the aforesaid individual essence 
and it is this escape that is the unformed element
Besides insight knowledge which has formed dhammas as its object and also conformity knowledge abandon the defilements with the abandoning consisting in substitution of opposites being unable to abandon them with the abandoning consisting in cutting off
Likewise the kind of knowledge that has conventional truth that is concepts as its object in the first jhāna etc abandons the defilements only with the abandoning consisting in suppression not by cutting them off
So because the kind of knowledge that has formed dhammas as its object and that which has conventional truth as its object are both incapable of abandoning defilements by cutting them off there must consequently exist an object for the noblepath knowledge that effects their abandonment by cutting them off which object must be of a kind opposite to both And it is this that is the unformed element 
Likewise the words Bhikkhus there is an unborn an unbecome an unmade an unformed and so on which demonstrate the existingness of Nibbāna in the ultimate sense are not misleading because they are spoken by the Blessed One
like the words All formations are impermanent all formations are painful all dhammas are not self   Likewise in certain instances as regards scope the word Nibbāna has the correct ultimate meaning
Just as a lion directs his strength against the man who shot the arrow at him not against the arrow so the Buddhas deal with the cause not with the fruit
But just as dogs when struck with a clod snarl and bite the clod and do not attack the striker so the sectarians who want to make suffering cease devote themselves to mutilating the body not to causing cessation of defilements
On coming to that  on reaching that Nibbāna by making it the object
The question But why is it suffering means this granted firstly that birth in hell is painful since hell is unalloyed pain and that it is painful in the other unhappy destinies since it is originated by bad kamma but how is it so in the happy destinies since it is there originated by kamma that leads to bliss
The answer Because it is the basis for many kinds of suffering etc shows that this birth is not called suffering because of having suffering as its individual essencefor there is no rebirthlinking associated with painful feelingbut rather because it is the foundation for suffering
Since also what does not have suffering as its individual essence is yet called suffering indirectly consequently intrinsic suffering is said particularizing what does have suffering as its individual essence just as in the case of particularizing concrete matter 
Sickness is not included here 
because no particular person is meant
and there are persons in whom sickness does not arise at all
like the venerable Bakkula  otherwise it may be taken as already included by suffering itself
for in the ultimate sense sickness is bodily pain conditioned by disturbance of elements
Momentary unification of the mind concentration lasting only for a moment
For that too when it occurs uninterruptedly on its object in a single mode and is not overcome by opposition fixes the mind immovably as if in absorption
Delivering secluding separating by means of deliverance consisting in suppression abandoning the hindrances is the meaning
At the actual time of insight at the time of contemplation of dissolution
For dissolution is the furthest extreme of impermanence So the meditator who is contemplating dissolution by its means sees under the heading of consciousness the whole field of formations as impermanent not as permanent
and because of the suffering inherent in what is impermanent and because of the absence of self in what is painful he sees that same whole field of formations as painful not as pleasant
and as notself not as self
But since what is impermanent painful and notself is not something to delight in
and what is not something to delight in is not something to be greedy for
consequently he becomes dispassionate towards that whole field of formations when it is seen in the light of dissolution as impermanent painful notself he does not delight in it
and his greed for it fades away does not dye him
Now as he thus becomes dispassionate and his greed fades away it is firstly by means of mundane knowledge only that he causes greed to cease and does not arouse it The meaning is that he does not bring about its arising
Or alternatively his greed having thus faded away he causes by means of his own knowledge the cessation of the unseen field of formations just as that of the seen he does not arouse it
the meaning is that he brings about only its cessation he does not bring about its arising
Having entered on this way he relinquishes he does not grasp
What is meant
It is that this contemplation of impermanence etc is called relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into because it gives up defilements along with aggregate producing kammaformations and because by seeing the flaws in what is formed and by inclining towards the opposite of what is formed namely Nibbāna it enters into that Nibbāna
Consequently the meditator who has that contemplation gives up defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way stated
Herein the contemplation of what is impermanent as only impermanent is contemplation of impermanence
this is a name for insight that occurs by taking formations of the three mundane planes and leaving aside the supramundane as impermanent
From the perception of permanence from the wrong perception that occurs perceiving formed things as permanent eternal
also the various views should be regarded as included under the heading of perception
Likewise with the perception of pleasure and so on
By means of the contemplation of dispassion by means of the contemplation that occurs in the mode of dispassion for formations
From delight from craving accompanied by happiness
By means of the contemplation of fading away by means of the contemplation that occurs similarly in the mode of fading away
By means of the contemplation of cessation by means of the successive seeing of formations cessation
hence delivering from greed is said
Or contemplating cessation is contemplation such that formations cease only and do not arise with future renewal
For this is knowledge of desire for deliverance grown strong
Hence he said delivering from arousing
Contemplation that occurs in the mode of relinquishing is contemplation of relinquishment
From grasping from taking as permanent etc or the meaning can also here be regarded as from grasping rebirthlinking
What is called permanent is what is lasting eternal like Nibbāna What is called impermanent is what is not permanent and is possessed of rise and fall He said The five aggregates are the impermanent signifying that they are formed dhammas as to meaning
Why
Because their essence is rise and fall and change the meaning is that their individual essences have rise and fall and change
Herein formed dhammas arising owing to cause and condition their coming to be after nonexistence their acquisition of an individual self  is rise
Their momentary cessation when arisen is fall
Destruction is the vanishing of formations it is the act of those formations fading away their disintegration that is fading away Destruction itself as fading away is fading away as destruction this is momentary cessation
Formations fade away absolutely here when this has been reached thus it is absolute fading away this is Nibbāna
The act of relinquishing as the act of giving up by means of substituting for what should be abandoned its opposite quality or by cutting it off is relinquishment as giving up
Likewise the act of relinquishing of self that takes place in nonformation of kamma which is the relinquishing of all substrata of becoming being the entering into that Nibbāna either by inclination towards it in insight or by having it as object in the path is relinquishment as entering into
Through substitution of opposite qualities here contemplation of impermanence firstly gives up perception of permanence by abandoning through substitution of the opposite eg substituting perception of impermanence for that of permanence in the case of all formed things And the giving up in this way is in the form of inducing nonoccurrence For all kammaformations that are rooted in defilements due to apprehending as permanent and the kammaresultant aggregates rooted in both which might arise in the future are abandoned by causing their nonoccurrence Likewise in the case of perception of pain and so on
Through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed through seeing the fault of impermanence etc in the formed threeplane field of formations
When defilements are given up by the path then kammaformations are called given up through producing in them the nature of not causing result and aggregates rooted in them are called given up through their being rendered fit for nonarising So the path gives up all these is what is meant
It is the opposite of the formed owing to its permanence and so on
With the object under the heading of the object The happiness included in the jhāna that has that object is experienced because of the experiencing of the object
What is meant
Just as when a man who is looking for a snake discovers its abode the snake is as it were already discovered and caught owing to the ease with which he will then be able to catch it with charms and spells so too when the object which is the abode of the happiness is experienced  then the happiness itself is experienced too owing to the ease with which it will be apprehended in its specific and general characteristics
By his penetration of its characteristics by penetration of the specific and general characteristics of happiness
For when the specific and general characteristics of anything are experienced then that thing is experienced according to reality
The similes beginning with the cluster of gems are properly the counterpart sign
Because of difference in perception because of the difference in the manner of perceiving that occurred before the arising of the sign
Following  is occurring along with  going after  by means of mindfulness through making the breaths the object as they occur
Hence he said And that is not by following after the beginning middle and end
The navel is the beginning because of their first arising there
For the notion of a beginning is here in the sense of first arising not in the sense of just arising once only
For they actually go on arising throughout the whole length from the navel to the nosetip
and wherever they arise there in that same place they dissolve because there is no going of dhammas
The ordinary term motion refers to successive arisings in adjacent locations according to conditions
The heart is the middle near the heart just above it is the middle
The nose tip is the end the place where the nostrils are is the end that is the limit of the application of the ordinary term inbreaths and out breaths
for it is accordingly that they are called consciousnessoriginated there being no production externally of what is consciousnessoriginated
Buffeted by wind if he gives much attention to the wind that has gone inside that place seems to him as if it were buffeted by the wind as if filled with fat
As a meditation subject for a beginner is said with reference to the serenity meditation subject
but the insight meditation subject applies to the other tetrads too
The faint sound itself as a sign is the sign of the faint sounds it has that as its object
What is meant
Of course the faint sounds have ceased too then but the sign of the sounds has been well apprehended and so consciousness occurs with the sign of fainter sounds as its object
For as from the outset he ascertains with undistracted consciousness the sign of each sound as it ceases eventually his consciousness occurs in the end with the sign of ultrasubtle sounds too as its object
Bodily formation the inbreath and outbreath 
For although it is consciousnessoriginated it is nevertheless called bodily formation since its existence is bound up with the kammaborn body and it is formed with that as the means
In the first part of the system in the first part of the system of development in the first two bases is what is intended
Of course arousing of knowledge must be admitted to take place here too because of the presence of awareness of the length and shortness of the breaths as they actually are  and it is not hard to do that for it is merely the taking account of them as they occur That is why it is put in the present tense here
But what follows is as hard as for a man to walk on a razors edge which is why the future tense is used for the subsequent stages in order to indicate the need for exceptional prior effort
Zeal arises additional zeal which is profitable and has the characteristic of desire to act arises due to the satisfaction obtained when the meditation has brought progressive improvement
More subtle than before more subtle than before the alreadydescribed zeal arose
for the breaths occur more subtly owing to the meditations influence in tranquilizing the bodys distress and disturbance
Gladness arises fresh happiness arises of the kinds classed as minor etc which is the gladness that accompanies the consciousness occupied with the meditation and is due to the fact that the peacefulness of the object increases with the growing subtlety of the breaths and to the fact that the meditation subject keeps to its course
The mind turns away the mind turns away from the breaths which have reached the point at which their manifestation needs investigating owing to their gradually increasing subtlety
But some say  It is when the inbreaths and out breaths have reached a subtler state owing to the influence of the meditation and the counterpart sign for when that has arisen the mind turns away from the normal breaths 
Equanimity is established when concentration classed as access and absorption has arisen in that counterpart sign then since there is no need for further interest to achieve jhāna onlooking ensues which is specific neutrality
In these nine ways that occur in the nine ways just described
Long inbreaths and outbreaths are a body the inbreaths and outbreaths which exist as particles though they have the aspect of length constitute a body in the sense of a mass
And here the sign that arises with the breaths as its support is also called inbreath and outbreath 
The establishment is mindfulness mindfulness is called establishment  since it approaches the object and remains there
The contemplation is knowledge contemplation of the sign by means of serenity and contemplation of mentalitymateriality by defining with insight the inbreaths and outbreaths and the body which is their support as materiality and the consciousness and the states associated with it as the immaterial  are knowledge in other words awareness of what is actually there 
The body is the establishment  there is that body and mindfulness approaches it by making it its object and remains there thus it is called establishment 
And the words the body is the establishment include the other kind of body too since the abovementioned comprehension by insight is needed here too
But it is not the mindfulness that body is not called mindfulness though it is called the establishment
Mindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness being so both in the sense of remembering and in the sense of establishing 
By means of that mindfulness by means of that mindfulness already mentioned
And that knowledge and the knowledge already mentioned
That body that inbreathandoutbreath body and that material body which is its support
He contemplates  he keeps re seeing with jhāna knowledge and with insight knowledge
That is why Development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said in virtue of that contemplation this is said to be development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body of the kind already stated
What is meant is this the contemplation of the body as an inbreathandoutbreath body as stated and of the physical body that is its material support which is not contemplation of permanence etc in a body whose individual essence is impermanent etclike the contemplation of a waterless mirage as waterbut which is rather contemplation of its essence as impermanent painful notself and foul according as is appropriate
or alternatively which is contemplation of it as a mere body only by not contemplating it as containing anything that can be apprehended as I or mine or woman or man all this is contemplation of the body The mindfulness associated with that contemplation of the body which mindfulness is itself the establishment is the establishment  The development the increase of that is the development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body
Regarded as particles as a number of groups 
In the hot season the forest is favourable in the cold season the root of a tree in the rainy season an empty place For one of phlegmatic humour phlegmatic by nature the forest is favourable for one of bilious humour the root of a tree for one of windy humour an empty place For one of deluded temperament the forest for one of hating temperament the root of a tree for one of greedy temperament an empty place
The words in all its aspects refer to the sixteen bases
for these are only found in total in this dispensation
When outsiders know mindfulness of breathing they only know the first four modes
Some is said with reference to the inmates of the Uttara monastery in Anurādhapura
Sorrow etc have already been established as ignorance but death consciousness itself is devoid of ignorance and formations and is not a condition for the next becoming that is why because it assures sorrow etc is said
Though feeling is condition is said in order to prevent a generalization from the preceding words With feeling as condition to the effect that craving arises in the presence of every condition accompanied by feeling
But is it not impossible to prevent overgeneralization in the absence of any such statements as Feeling accompanied by inherent tendency is a condition for craving
No for we are dealing with an exposition of the round of rebirths
Since there is no round of rebirths without inherent tendencies so far as the meaning is concerned it may be taken for granted that the condition is accompanied by inherent tendency
Or alternatively it may be recognized that this condition is accompanied by inherent tendency because it follows upon the words With ignorance as condition
And with the words With feeling as condition craving the ruling needed is this There is craving only with feeling as condition and not With feeling as condition there is only craving
This means due to the heat element in the materiality that arose together with the rebirthlinking consciousness
It is because the heartbasis is arisen only at that very moment that there is weakness of the physical basis
It is that performed next to death or which is conspicuous in the memory then whenever it was performed
Sign of the kamma is the event by means of which a man accumulates kamma through making it the object at the time of accumulation
Even if the kamma was performed as much as a hundred thousand eons ago nevertheless at the time of its ripening it appears as kamma or sign of kamma
The sign of the destiny is one of the visual scenes in the place where rebirth is due to take place
It consists in the visual appearance of flames of fire etc to one ready to be reborn in hell and so on as already stated
Owing to craving being unabandoned and because the previouslyarisen continuity is similarly deflected consciousness occurs inclining leaning and tending towards the place of rebirthlinking
The conascent formations are the volitions conascent with the impulsion consciousness next to death Or they are all those that begin with contact
They fling consciousness on to that place of rebirthlinking which is the object of the kamma and so on
The meaning is that they occur as the cause for the establishment of consciousness on the object by rebirthlinking as though flinging it there
As a continuous process consisting of death rebirthlinking and the adjacent consciousnesses
By the words the appearance of the mothers womb etc only visual appearance is given as the sign of destiny
Herein in the first place it would be logical that sound has not been given in the Commentaries as a sign of destiny because it is included in the happy destinies as notclungto but the reason for odour etc not having been given will be inquired into
With the appearance of fire and flames etc in the hells is said owing to likeness to that
appearance of hell and fire does not itself come into focus for him then
Unprofitable resultant eye consciousness etc sometimes arise even in Brahmās when undesirable visible data etc come into focus
As to Ox hair and rams hair etc and the rest ox hair and rams hair are conditions for the unlike dubbā grassa ram should be understood as a red sheep 
curds sesame flour and molasses are for bhūtiṇaka grass
moss is for the taṇḍuleyyaka plant a she donkey is for a mule and so on in this way as included by the word etc
horn is for reeds 
The assertion of a single cause is undesirable
because it follows that there would be production of everything all the time and because it follows that there would be a single homogeneous state
And Nibbāna does not after being unhelpful by its own absence of existingness to those states that have Nibbāna as their object become helpful to them by obtaining existingness Or alternatively the presence condition which by its nonexistingness is the opposite of helpfulness to those states that are associated with arising etc is helpful to them by its existingness So Nibbāna is not a presence condition
For a presence condition is that which is unhelpful by its absence of existingness and becomes helpful by obtaining existingness
 The presence condition is not applicable to Nibbāna
Reviewing changeoflineage applies to streamenterers
Reviewing cleansing applies to oncereturners and nonreturners
Proximity and contiguity conditions are not stated in accordance with the distinction between making occur and giving opportunity as the absence and disappearance conditions are rather they are stated as the causes of the regular order of consciousness in the cognitive series
This refers to the Elder Revata too
The state of proximity condition is the ability to cause arising proximately because there is no interval between the cessation of the preceding and the arising of the subsequent
The state of contiguity condition is the ability to cause arising by being quite proximate through approaching as it were identity with itself owing to absence of any distinction that This is below above or around that which is because of lack of any such copresence as in the case of the components of the material groups and because of lack of any copositionality of the condition and the conditionally arisen
And in general because of the uninterestedness of all states  when a given state has ceased or is present in a given mode and other states come to be possessed of that particular mode it is that states mode that must be regarded as what is called ability to cause arising
Which are contingent upon other such states because it is said without distinction of all visibledata bases  and of all mentaldata bases there is consequently no dhamma among the formed unformed and conceptual dhammas classed as sixfold under visible data etc that does not become an object condition
that is why when rice grains etc are pounded they get scattered and reduced to powder It is called indeterminate to distinguish it from mentality which is profitable etc at different times
Materiality is dispersible since it has in itself nothing beyond the water element to hold it absolutely together so its function is to be dispersed
Inseparability of its components is owing to their having no separate existence mentality here being feeling perception and formations
Mentalitys function is to associate since it joins with consciousness in a state of mutuality
Consciousnesss function is to go before since it precedes mentalitymateriality at rebirthlinking
To accumulate is to heap up
Formations accumulate work for the purpose of rebirth So that is their function
No theory is unknowing about suffering etc wrong theory is perverted perception of what is foul etc as beautiful etc
or else no theory is unassociated with false view and wrong theory is associated with it
With the nature of result and so on the words and so on here include neither trainernornontrainer conducive to fetters  and so on
Mundane resultant and so on the words and so on here include indeterminate  formed  and so on
With rootcause and without rootcause and so on the words and so on here include prompted unprompted and so on
The law is the text of the dependent origination
The meaning is the meaning of that
Or they are the cause and the fruit of the cause here is what is meant
Or law is regularity 
Now some misinterpreting the meaning of the sutta passage Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise there yet remains that element   wrongly describe the regularity of the dependent origination as a permanent dependent origination instead of which it should be described as having the individual essence of a cause  defined according to its own fruit in the way stated
And some misinterpret the meaning of the dependent origination thus Without cessation without arising instead of taking the unequivocal meaning in the way stated
Such terms as woman man etc are local forms of speech 
because even wise men instead of saying Fetch the five aggregates or Let the mentalitymateriality come use the current forms woman and man This is how in those who have not fully understood what a physical basis is there comes to be the insistence  This is really a woman this is really a man
But since this is a mere concept which depends on states made to occur in such and such wise one who sees and knows the dependent origination does not insist on it as the ultimate meaning
Current speech is speech current in the world
Not overriding is not going beyond
For when a being is said instead of making an analysis like this What is the lasting being here Is it materiality Or feeling and so on one who does not override current usage should express a worldly meaning in ordinary language as those in the world do employing the usage current in the world
The doctrine of eternalism is that beginning The world and self are eternal 
That of nocause is that beginning There is no cause there is no condition for the defilement of beings 
That of fictitiouscause holds that the worlds occurrence is due to Primordial Essence  atoms  time  and so on
That of a powerwielder asserts the existence of an Overlord  or of a World soul  or of Pajāpati 
Also the doctrines of Nature  Fate  and Chance  should be regarded as included here under the doctrine of nocause
Some however say that the doctrine of fictitiouscause is that beginning with The eye is the cause of the eye
and that the doctrine of the powerwielder is that beginning Things occur owing to their own individual essence 
Patīyamāna  When it is gone to by direct confrontation by means of knowledges going when it is penetrated to  is the meaning
Subject to destruction means that its individual essence is the state of being destroyed 
But since the object is stated with individual essences the breakup of states with individual essences their destruction their fallall that has to do only with states with individual essences
Hence the Blessed One said Bhikkhus agingand death is impermanent formed dependently arisen 
If it cannot reach absorption because of its object being states with individual essences then what about the supramundane jhānas and certain of the immaterial jhānas It was to answer this that he said now with special development the supramundane jhāna and so on
When consciousness dissolves the world is dead just as in the case of the death consciousness this world is also called dead in the highest sense with the arrival of any consciousness whatever at its dissolution since its cessation has no rebirthlinking 
Nevertheless though this is so the highest sense this concept will allow the ultimate sense will allow this concept of continuity which is what the expression of common usage Tissa lives Phussa lives refers to and which is based on consciousnesses momentarily existing along with a physical support this belongs to the ultimate sense here since as they say It is not the name and surname that lives
Person is the states other than the alreadymentioned life feeling and consciousness
The words just these alone mean that it is unmixed with self or permanence
The word etc includes Nandayakkha Nandamāṇava and others
Herein just as when a pint measure of milk is poured into a number of pints of water though the milk becomes completely mixed up with the water and is present appreciably in all it is nevertheless not the milk that has increased there but only the water And so too although the clungto and unclungto occur mixed up together it is nevertheless not the clungto that is enlarged It should be taken that it is the consciousnessborn matter that is enlarged by the influence of the supernormal power and the temperatureborn is enlarged pari passu
Though the clungto and the unclungto occur as it were mixed up in a single continuity they are nevertheless not mixed up in meaning
And so to take it as enlargement of that is likewise not correct Consequently enlargement should be understood only in the way stated
Or alternatively clungto is intended as all matter that is bound up with faculties  too
Only this is correct because instances of clungto materiality do not arise owing to consciousness or to temperature
The ramparts of Sineru the girdle of Sineru
There are it seems four ramparts that encircle Sineru measuring  leagues in breadth and width They were built to protect the realm of the Thirtythree against nāgas garudas kumbhaṇḍas and yakkhas
They enclose half of Sineru it seems
At Savatthi
Sitting to one side King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One Venerable sir for one who has taken birth is there anything other to expect than aging and death
For one who has taken birth great king there is nothing other to expectthan aging and death
Even in the case of those affluent khattiyasrich with great wealth and property with abundant gold and silver abundant treasures and commodities abundant wealth and grainbecause they have taken birth there is nothing other to expect than aging and death
Even in the case of those affluent brahmins  affluent householders  rich  with abundant wealth and grainbecause they have taken birth there is nothing other to expect than aging and death
Even in the case of those bhikkhus who are arahants whose taints are destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached their own goal utterly destroyed the fetters of existenceand are completely liberated through final knowledge even for them this body is subject to breaking up subject to being laid down
The beautiful chariots of kings wear out
This body too undergoes decay
But the Dhamma of the good does not decay
So the good proclaim along with the good
At Savatthi
in the middle of the day King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one side The Blessed One then asked him Now where are you coming from great king in the middle of the day
Just now venerable sir I have been engaged in those affairs of kingship typical for kings who are intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty who are obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures whohave attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth
What do you think great king Suppose a man would come to you from the east one who is trustworthy and reliable
and would tell youFor sure great king you should know this I am coming from the east
and there I saw a great mountain high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings
Do whatever you think should be done great king
Then a second man would come to you from the west a third man from the north  and a fourth man from the south one who is trustworthy and reliable
For sure great king you should know this I am coming from the south
and there I saw a great mountain high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings
Do whatever you think should be done great king
If great king such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life the human state being so difficult to obtain what should be done
If venerable sir such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life the human state being so difficult to obtain what else should be done but to live by the Dhamma to live righteously and to do wholesome and meritorious deeds
I inform you great king I announce to you great king aging and death are rolling in on you
When aging and death are rolling in on you great king what should be done
As aging and death are rolling in on me venerable sir what else should be done but to live by the Dhamma to live righteously and to do wholesome and meritorious deeds
Venerable sir kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and rule over a great sphere of territory conquer by means of elephant battles cavalry battles chariot battles and infantry battles but there is no hope of victory by such battles no chance of success when aging and death are rolling in
In this royalcourt venerable sir there are counselors who when the enemies arrive are capable of dividing them by subterfuge
but there is no hope of victory by subterfuge no chance of success when aging and death are rolling in
In this royal court venerable sir there exists abundant bullion and gold stored in vaults and lofts and with such wealth we are capable of mollifying the enemies when they come
but there is no hope of victory by wealth no chance of success when aging and death are rolling in
As aging and death are rolling in on me venerable sir what else should I do but live by the Dhamma live righteously and do wholesome and meritorious deeds
So it is great king So it is great king
As aging and death are rolling in on you what else should you do but live by the Dhamma live righteously and do wholesome and meritorious deeds
This is what the Blessed One said Having said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said this
Just as mountains of solid rock Massive reaching to the sky
Might draw together from all sides Crushing all in the four quarters
So aging and death come Rolling over living beings
Khattiyas brahmins vessas suddas Outcasts and scavengers
They spare none along the way But come crushing everything
Theres no hope there for victory By elephant troops chariots and infantry
One cant defeat them by subterfuge Or buy them off by means of wealth
Therefore a person of wisdom here Out of regard for his own good
Steadfast should settle faith In the Buddha Dhamma and Sahgha
When one conducts oneself by Dhamma With body speech and mind
They praise one here in the present life And after death one rejoices in heaven
There are monks three divine messengers
What three
There is a person of bad conduct in body speech and mind
On the dissolution of the body after death he is reborn in the plane of misery in a bad destination in a lower world in hell
There the wardens of hell seize him by both arms and take him before Yama the Lord of Death saying This man your majesty had no respect for father and mother not for ascetics and brahmins nor did he honor the elders of the family
May your majesty inflict due punishment on him
Then monks King Yama questions that man examines him and addresses him concerning the first divine messenger Didnt you ever see my good man the first divine messenger appearing among humankind
And he replies No Lord I did not see him
Then King Yama says to him But my good man didnt you ever see a woman or a man eighty ninety or a hundred years old frailbent like a roof bracket crooked leaning on a stick shakily going along ailing youth and vigor gone with broken teeth with gray and scanty hair or bald wrinkled with blotched limbs
And the man replies Yes Lord I have seen this
Then King Yama says to him My good man didnt it ever occur to you an intelligent and mature person I too am subject to old age and cannot escape it Let me now do noble deeds by body speech and mind
No Lord I could not do it
I was negligent
Then King Yama says Through negligence my good man you have failed to do noble deeds by body speech and mind
Well you will be treated as befits your negligence
That evil action of yours was not done by mother or father brothers sisters friends or companions not by relatives devas ascetics or brahmins But you alone have done that evil deed and you will have to experience the fruit
When monks King Yama has questioned examined and addressed him thus concerning the first divine messenger he again questions examines and addresses the man about the second one saying Didnt you ever see my good man the second divine messenger appearing among humankind
No Lord I did not see him
But my good man didnt you ever see a woman or a man who was sick and in pain seriously ill lying in his own filth having to be lifted up by some and put to bed by others
Yes Lord I have seen this
My good man didnt it ever occur to you an intelligent and mature person I too am subject to illness and cannot escape it Let me now do noble deeds by body speech and mind
No Lord I could not do it
I was negligent
Through negligence my good man you have failed to do noble deeds by body speech and mind
Well you will be treated as befits your negligence
That evil action of yours was not done by mother or father brothers sisters friends or companions nor by relatives devas ascetics or brahmins But you alone have done that evil deed
and you will have to experience the fruit
When monks King Yama has questioned examined and addressed him thus concerning the second divine messenger he again questions examines and addresses the man about the third one saying Didnt you ever see my good man the third divine messenger appearing among humankind
No Lord I did not see him
But my good man didnt you ever see a woman or a man one two or three days dead the corpse swollen discolored and festering
Yes Lord I have seen this
Then my good man didnt it ever occur to you an intelligent and mature person I too am subject to death and cannot escape it Let me now do noble deeds by body speech and mind
No Lord I could not do it
I was negligent
Through negligence my good man you have failed to do noble deeds by body speech and mind
Well you will be treated as befits your negligence
That evil action of yours was not done by mother or father brothers sisters friends or companions nor by relatives devas ascetics or brahmins But you alone have done that evil deed
and you will have to experience the fruit
Monks when the uninstructed worldling experiences a painful feeling he sorrows grieves and laments he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught
He feels two feelingsa bodily one and a mental one
Bhikkhus the uninstructed worldling feels a pleasant feeling a painful feeling and a neitherpainfulnotpleasant feeling
The instructed noble disciple too feels a pleasant feeling a painful feeling and a neitherpainfulnotpleasant feeling
There in bhikkhus what is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling
Venerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One guided by the Blessed One take recourse in the Blessed One It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement Having heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember it Then listen and attend closely bhikkhus I will speak Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied The Blessed one said this
Suppose they were to strike a man with a dart
he feels two feelingsa bodily one and a mental one
So too when the uninstructed worldling is being contacted by a painful feeling 
For what reason
Being contacted by painful feeling he seeks delight in sensual pleasure
When he harbours aversion towards painful feeling the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling lies behind this
Being contacted by that same painful feeling he harbours aversion towards it
Because the uninstructed worldrldling does not know of any escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasure When he seeks delight in sensual pleasure the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling lies behind this
He does not understand as it really is the origin and the passing away the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these feelings
When he does not understand these things the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling lies behind this
If he feels a pleasant feeling he feels it attached
If he feels a painful feeling he feels it attached
If he feels a neitherpainfulnotpleasant feeling he feels it attached
This bhkkhus is called an uninstructed worldling who is attached to birth aging and death who is attached to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair who is attached to sufferingI say
so that the man would feel a feeling caused by two darts
and then they would strike him immediately afterwards with a second dart
Bhikkhus when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful feeling he does not sorrow grieve or lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraught
He feels one feelinga bodily one not a mental one
For what reason
Suppose they were to strike a man with a dart
but they would not strike him immediately afterwards with a second dart
so that the man would feel a feeling caused by one dart only
Bhikkhus when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful feeling he does not sorrow grieve or lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraught
He feels one feelinga bodily one not a mental one
Being contacted by that same painful feeling he harbours no aversion towards it
Since he harbours no aversion towards feeling the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling does not lie behind this
Being contacted by painful feeling he does not seek delight in sensual pleasure
Because the instructed noble disciple knows of an escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasure
Since he does not seek delight in sensual pleasure the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling does not lie behind this
He understands as it really is the origin and the passing away the gatificationthe danger and the escape in the case of these feelings
Since he understands these things the underly ingtendency to ignorance in regard to neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling does not lie behind this
If he feels a pleasant feeling he feels it detached
If he feels a painful feeling he feels it detached
If he feels a neither painfulnorpleasant feeling he feels it detached
This bhikkhus is called a noble disciple who is detached from birth aging and death who is detached from sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair who is detached from suffering I say
This bhikkhus is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling
The wise one learned does not feel
The pleasant and painful mentalfeeling
This between The wise one and the worldling
is the great difference
For the learned one who has comprehended Dhamma
Who clearly sees this world and the next
Desirable things do not provoke his mind
Towards the undesired he has no aversion
For him attraction and repulsion
no more exist Both have been extinguished brought to an end
Having known the dustfree sorrowless state
The transcender of existence rightly understands
These eight worldly conditions monks keep the world turning around and the world turns around these eight worldly conditions
What eight
Gain and loss fame and disrepute praise and blame pleasure and pain
These eight worldly conditions monks are encountered by an uninstructed worldling
and they are also encountered by an instructed noble disciple
What now is the distinction the disparity the difference between an instructed noble disciple and an uninstructed worldling
Venerable sir our knowledge of these things has its roots in the Blessed One it has the Blessed One as guide and resort
It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would clarify the meaning of that statement
Having heard it from him the monks will bear it in mind
Listen then monks and attend carefully I shall speak
Yes venerable sir the monks replied
The Blessed One then spoke thus When an uninstructed worldling monks comes upon gain
This gain that has come to me is impermanent bound up with suffering subject to changeHe does not know it as it really is
And when he comes upon loss fame and disrepute praise and blame
 he does not reflect on them thus All these are impermanent bound up with suffering subject to change He does not know them as they really are
With such a person gain and loss fame anddisrepute praise and blame pleasure and pain keep his mind engrossed
When gain comes he is elated and when he meets with loss he is dejected When fame comes he is elated and when he meets with disrepute he is dejected When praise comes he is elated and when he meets with blame he is dejected When he experiences pleasure he is elated and when he experiences pain he is dejected
Being thus involved in likes and dislikes he will not be freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain dejection and despair
he will not be freed from suffering I say
But monks when an instructed noble disciple comes upon gainhe reflects on it thus
This gain that has come to me is impermanent bound up with suffering subject to change
And so he will reflect when loss and so forth come upon him
He understands all these things as they really are
and they do not engross his mind
Having thus given up likes and dislikes he will be freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain dejection and despair
he will be freed from suffering I say
This monks is the distinction the disparity the difference between an instructed noble disciple and an uninstructed worldling
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus I will teach you agitation through clinging and nonagitation through nonclinging
Listen to that and attend closely I will speak
Yes venerable sir those bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
And how bhikkhus is there agitation through clinging
Here bhikkhus the uninstructed worldling who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards form as self or self aspossessingform or form as in self or self as in form
That form of his changes and alters
With the change and alteration of form his consciousness becomes preoccupied with the change of form
Agitation and a constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of form remain obsessing his mind
Because his mind is obsessed he is frightened distressed and anxious and through clinging he becomes agitated
He regards feeling as self  
regards consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousnessor consciousnessas in self or self as in consciousness
That consciousness of his changes and alters
With the change and alteration of consciousness his consciousness becomes preoccupied with the change of consciousness
Agitation and a constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of consciousness remain obsessing his mind
Because his mind is obsessed he is frightened distressed and anxious and through clinging he becomes agitated
It is in such a way bhikkhus that there is agitation through clinging
And how bhikkhus is there nonagitation through nonclinging
Here bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple who is a seer of the noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who is a seerof superior persons and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma does not regard form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in form
That form of his changes and alters
Despite the change and alteration of form his consciousness does not become preoccupied with the change of form
No agitation and constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of form remain obsessing his mind
Because his mind is not obsessedbe is not frightened distressed or anxious and through nonclinging he does not become agitated
He does not regard feeling as self
He does not regard consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness That consciousness of his changes and alters
Despite the change and alteration of consciousness his consciousnessdoes not become preoccupied with the change of consciousness
No agitation and constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of consciousness remain obsessing his mind
Because his mind is not obsessed he is not frightened distressed or anxious and through nonclinging he does not become agitated
It is in such a way bhikkhus that there is nonagitation through nonclinging
Bhikkhus there are these three unwholesome roots
What three
The unwholesome root greed the unwholesome root hatred and the unwholesome root delusion
Whatever greed occurs bhikkhus is unwholesome Whatever deed a greedy person performs by body speech and mind is also unwholesome When a greedy person overcome by greed with mind obsessed by it inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretext  by killing imprisonment confiscation censure or banishmentthinking I am powerful I want power that too is unwholesome
Thus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of greed caused by greed arisen from greed conditioned by greed
Whatever hatred occurs is unwholesome Whatever deed a person full of hate performs by body speech and mind is also unwholesome When a person full of hate overcome by hatred with mind obsessed by it inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretextthinking I am powerful I want power that too is unwholesome
Thus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of hatred caused by hatred arisen from hatred conditioned by hatred
Whatever delusion occurs is unwholesome Whatever deed a deluded person performs by body speech and mind is also unwholesome When a deluded person overcome by delusion with mind obsessed by it inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretextthinking I am powerful I want power that too is unwholesome
Thus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of delusion caused by delusion arisen from delusion conditioned by delusion
Such a person bhikkhus is called one who speaks at an improper time who speaks falsely who speaks what is unbeneficial who speaks nonDhamma who speaks non discipline
And why is such a person called one who speaks at an improper time  who speaks nondiscipline
Therefore such a person is called one who speaks at an improper time who speaks falsely who speaks what is unbeneficial who speaks nonDhamma who speaks nondiscipline
This person inflicts suffering upon an other under a false pretext by killing imprisonment confiscation censure or banishmentthinking I am powerful I want power
Thus when spoken to in accordance with fact he despises the one who reproaches him  he does not admit his faults When spoken to contrary to fact he does not make an effort to unravel what is said to him For such and such a reason this is untrue for such and such a reason this is contrary to fact
Such a person overcome by bad unwholesome qualities born of greed 
Suppose a tree was choked and enveloped by three maluva creepers It would meet with calamity with disasterwith calamity and disaster So too such a person overcome by bad unwholesome qualities born of greed
These are the three unwholesome roots
There are bhikkhus these three wholesome roots
What three
The wholesome root nongreed the wholesome root nonhatred and thew holesome root nondelusion
Whatever nongreed occurs bhikkhus is wholesome Whatever deed one without greed performs by body speech and mind is also wholesome When one without greed not overcome by greed with mind not obsessed by it does not inflict suffering upon another urider a false pretextby killing im prisonment confiscation censure or banishment thinkingI am powerful I want power that too is wholesome
Thus numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of nongreed caused by nongreed arisen from nongreed conditioned by nongreed
Whatever nonhatred occurs is wholesome Whatever deed one without hate performs by body speech and mind is also wholesome When one without hate not overcome by hatred with mind not obsessed by it does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretextthat too is wholesome
Thus numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of nonhatred caused by nonhatred arisen from nonhatred conditioned by nonhatred
Whatever nondelusion occurs is wholesome Whatever deed one who is undeluded performs by body speech and mind is also wholesome When one who is undeluded not overcome by delusion with mind not obsessed by it does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretext  that too is wholesome
Thus numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of nondelusion caused by nondelusion arisen from nondelusion conditioned by nondelusion
Such a person bhikkhus is called one who speaks at the proper time who speaks in accordance with fact who speaks what is beneficial who speaks Dhamma who speaks discipline
And why is such a person called one who speaks at the proper time who speaks discipline
This person does not inflict suffering upon an other under a false pretext by killing imprisonment confiscation censure or banishment thinking I am powerful I want power
Thus when spoken to in accordance with fact he admits his faults he does not despise the one who reproaches him  When spoken to contrary to fact he makes an effort to unravel what is said to him For such and such a reason this is untrue for such and such a reason this is contrary to fact
Therefore such a person is called one who speaks at the proper time who speaks in accordance with fact who speaks what is beneficial who speaks Dhamma who speaks discipline
Such a person has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities born of greed
He dwells happily in this very life without distress anguish or fever
and in this very life he attains nibbana
Suppose a tree was choked and enveloped by three maluva creepers
Then a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basket
He would cut down the creepers at their roots dig them up and pull out the roots even the fine rootlets and rootfiber
In this way those maluva creepers would be cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising
He would cut the creepers into pieces split the pieces and reduce them to slivers Then he would dry the slivers in the wind and sun burn them in a firereduce them to ashes and winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried a way by the swift current of a river
So too bhikkhus such a person has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities born of greed
He dwells happily in this very life without distress anguish or fever
and in this very life he attains nibbana
These are the three wholesome roots
born of hatred  born of delusioncut them off at the root made them like a palm stump obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising
born of hatred  he attains nibbana
born of delusion  he attains nibbana
He dwells happily in this very life without distress anguish or fever
And in this very life he attains nibbana
Bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning
A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
Suppose bhikkhus a man would cut up whatever grass sticks branches and foliage there are in this Jambudipa and collect them together into a single heap Having done so he would put them down saying for each one This is my mother this my mothers mother The sequence of that mans mothers and grandmothers would not come to an end yet the grass wood branches and foliage in this Jambudipa would be used up and exhausted
For what reason 
Because bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning
A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
For such a long timebhikkhus you have experienced suffering anguish and disaster and swelled the cemetery
It is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations enough to become dispassionate towards them enough to be liberated from them
Bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning
A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
Suppose bhikkhus a man would reduce this great earth to balls of clay the size of jujube kernels and put them down saying for each one  This is my father this my fathers father The sequence of that mans fathers and grandfathers would not come to an end yet this great earth would be used up and exhausted
For what reason
Because bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning
A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
For such a long time bhikkhus you have experienced suffering anguish and disaster and swelled the cemetery
It is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations enough to become dispassionate towards them enough to be liberated from them
At Savatthi
Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed Onepaid homage to him
sat down to one side and said to him Venerable sir how long is an aeon
An aeon is long bhikkhu
It is not easy to count it and say it is so many years or so many hundreds of years or so many thousands of years or so many hundreds of thousands of years
Then is it possible to give a simile venerable sir
It is possible bhikkhu the Blessed One said
Supposebhikkhu there was a great stone mountain a yojana long a yojana wide and a yojana high without holes or crevices one solid mass of rock
At the end of every hundred years a man would stroke it once with a piece of Kasian cloth
That great stone mountain might by this effort be worn away and eliminated but the aeon would still not have come to an end
So long is an aeon bhikkhu
And of aeons of such length we have wandered through so many aeons so many hundreds of aeons so many thousands of aeons so many hundreds of thousands of aeons
For what reason 
Because bhikkhu this samsara is without discoverable beginning
It is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations enough to become dispassionate towards them enough to be liberated from them
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagahain the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel Sanctuary
Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one side
and said to him Master Gotama how many aeons have elapsed and gone by
Brahmin many aeons have elapsed and gone by
It is not easy to count them and say they are so many aeons or so many hundreds of aeons or so many thousands of aeons or so many hundreds of thousands of aeons
But is it possible to give a simile Master Gotama
It is possible brahmin the Blessed One said
Suppose brahmin the grains of sand between the point where the river Ganges originates and the point where it enters the great ocean it is not easy to count these and say there are so many grains of sand or so many hundreds of grains or so many thousands of grains or so many hundreds of thousands of grains
Brahmin the aeons that have elapsed and gone by are even more numerous than that
It is not easy to count them and say that they are so many aeons or so many hundreds of aeons or so many thousands of aeonsor so many hundreds of thousands of aeons
For what reason
Because brahmin this samsara is without discoverable beginning
A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignoranceand fettered by craving
For such a long timebhikkhus you have experienced suffering anguish and disaster and swelled the cemetery
It is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations enough to become dispassionate towards them enough to be liberated from them
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning
A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
There comes a time bhikkhus when the great ocean dries up and evaporates and no longer exists but still I say there is no making an end of suffering for those beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
There comes a time bhikkhus when Sineru the king of mountains burns up and perishes and no longer exists but still I say there is no making an end of suffering for those beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fetteredby craving
There comes a time bhikkhus when the great earth burns up and perishes and no longer exists but still I say there is no making an end of suffering for those beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
Suppose bhikkhus a dog tied up on a leash was bound to a strong post or pillar it would just keep on running and revolving around that same post or pillar So too the uninstructed worldling  regards form as self feeling as self  perception as self volitional formations as self consciousness as self
He just keeps running and revolving around form around feeling around perception around volitional formations around consciousness
As he keeps on running and revolving around them he is not freed from form not freed from feelingnot freed from perception not freed from volitional formations not freed from consciousness He is not freed frombirth aging and death not freed from sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
not freed from suffering I say
But the instructed noble disciple  does not regard form as self  not feeling as self  not perception as self  not volitional formations as self  not consciousness as self
He no longer keeps running and revolving around form around feeling around perception around volitional formations around consciousness
As he no longer keeps running and revolving around them he is freed from form freed from feeling freed from perception freed from volitional formations freed from consciousness He is freed from birth aging and death He is freed from birth aging and death freed from sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
freed from suffering I say
Bhikkhus there is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of devas and human beings
Who is that one person
The Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One
This is that One person who arises in the w orld for the welfare of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of devas and human beings
Bhikkhus the manifestation of one person is rare in the world
Bhikkhus there is one person arising in the world who is extraordinary
Who is that one person
The Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One
That is one person arising in the world who is extraordinary
Bhikkhusthe death of one person is lamented by many people
Bhikkhus there is one person arising in the world who is unique without a peer without counterpart in comparable matchless unrivaled unequaled without equalthe foremost of bipeds
Who is that one person
The Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One
Thay is one person arising in the world who is unique without a peer without counterpart in comparable matchless unrivaled unequaled without equalthe foremost of bipeds
Bhikkhus the manifestation of one person is the manifestation of great vision the manifestation of great light the manifestation of great radiance the manifestation of the six things unsurpassed the realization of the four analytical knowledges the penetration of numerous elements the penetration of the diversity of elements the realization of the fruit of trueknowledge and liberation PTS the realization of the fruit of stream entry the realization of the fruit of oncereturning the realization of the fruit of non returning the realization of the fruit of arahantship
Bhikkhus I do not see even a single person who properly continues to keep in motion the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma set in motion by the Tathagata as does Sariputta
Sariputta properly continues to keep in motion die unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma set in motion by the Tathagata
At Savatthi Bhikkhus before my enlightenment while I was still a bodhisatta not yet fully enlightened it occurred to me Alas this world has fallen into trouble in that it is born ages and dies it passes away and is reborn
yet it does not understand the escape from this suffering headed by aginganddeath
When now will an escape be discerned from this suffering headed by aginganddeath
Then bhikkhus it occurred to me When what exists does aginganddeath come to be By what is aginganddeath conditioned
Then bhikkhus through careful attention there took place in me a breakthrough by wisdom When there is birth aginganddeath comes to be aginganddeath has birth as its condition
Then bhikkhus it occurred to me When what exists does birth come to beexistenceclingingcravingfeelingcontact  the six sense bases nameandform  By what is nameandform conditioned 
Then bhikkhus through careful attention there took place in me a breakthrough by wisdom When there is consciousness nameandform comes to be nameandform has consciousnessas its condition
Then bhikkhus it occurred to me When what exists does consciousness come to be By what is consciousness condietioned
Then bhikkhus through careful attention there took place in me a breakthrough by wisdom When there is nameandform consciousness comes to be consciousness has nameandform as its condition
Then bhikkhus it occurred to me This consciousness turns back it does not go further than nameandform
It is to this extent that one may be born and age and die pass away and be reborn that is when there is consciousness with nameandform as its condition and nameandform with consciousness as its condition With nameandform as condition the six sense bases with the six sense bases as condition contact PTS Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering
Origination originationthus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose in me vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light
Then bhikkhus it occurred to me When what does not exist does aginganddeath not come to be  With the cessation of what does the cessation of aginganddeath come about
Then bhikkhus through careful attention there took place in me a breakthrough by wisdom When there is no birth aginganddeath does not come to be with the cessation of birth comes cessation of aginganddeath
It occurred to me When what does not exist does birth not come to be existence clinging craving feelingcontactthe six sense basesnameandform
With the cessation of what does the cessationof nameandform come about
Then bhikkhus through carefulattention there took place in me a breakthrough by wisdom When there is no conscious nameandform does not come to be with the cessation of consciousness comes cessation of nameandform
It occurred to me When what does not exist does consciousness not come to be With the cessation of what does the cessation of consciousness come about
Then bhikkhus through careful attention there took place in me a breakthrough by wisdom When there is no nameandform consciousness does not come to be with the cessation of nameandform comes cessation of consciousness
Then bhikkhus it occurred to me I have discovered this path to enlightenment that is with the cessation of nameandformcomes cessationof consciousnesswith the cessation of consciousnesscomes cessation of nameandformwith the cessation of nameandform cessation of the six sense bases with the cessation of the six sense bases cessation of contactSuch is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering
Cessation cessationthus bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose in my wision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light
Suppose bhikkhus a man wandering through a forest would see an ancient path an ancient road travelled upon by people in the past
He would follow it and would see an ancient city an ancient capital PTS that had been inhabited by people in the past with parks groves ponds and ramparts a delightful place
Then the man would inform the king or a royal ministerSire know that while wandering through the forest I saw an ancient path an ancient road travelled upon by people in the past
I followed it and saw an ancient city an ancient capital that had been inhaited by people in the past with parks groves ponds and ramparts a delightful place
Then the king or the roal minister would renovate the city
and some time later that city would become successful and prosperous well populated filled with people attained to growth and expansion
So too bhikkhus I saw the ancient path the ancient road travelled by the Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the past
And what is that andncient path that ancient road 
It is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelhood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
I followed that path and by doing so I have directly known aginganddeath its origin its cessation and the way leading to its cessation
I have directly known birth existenceclinging craving  feeling contact the six sense basesnameandform consciousness
volitional formations their origin their cessation and the way leading to their cessation PTS
Having directly known them I have explained them to the bhikkhus the bhikkhunis the male lay followers and the female lay followers
This holy life bhikkhus has become suecessful and prosperous extended popular widespread well proclaimed among devas and humans
Then the Venerable Anuruddha approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side and said
NowBhante with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that women with the breakup of the body after death are mostly reborn in the plane of misery in a bad destination in the lower world in hell
What qualities does a woman possess on account of which with the breakup of the body after death she is reborn in the plane of m isery in a bad destination in the lower world in hell
When she possesses three qualities Anuruddha with the breakup of the body after death a woman is reborn in the plane of misery in a bad destination in the lower world in hell
What three
Here Anuruddha in the morning a woman dwells at home with a mind obsessed by the stain of miserliness At midday she dwells at home with a mind obsessed by envy And in the evening she dwells at home with a mind obsessed by sensual lust
When she possesses these three qualities with the breakup of the body after death a woman is reborn in the plane of misery in a bad destination in the lower world in hell

Then Bhadraka the headman approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to
one side and said to him It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me about the origin and the pasing away of suffering
If headman I were to teach you about the origin and the passing away of suffering with reference to the past saying so it was in the past perplexity and uncertainty about that might arise in you
And if I were to teach you about the origin and the passing away of suffering with reference to the future saying So it will be in the future perplexity and uncertainty about that might arise in you
Instead headman while I am sitting right here and you are sitting right there I will teach you about the origin and the passing away of suffering
Listen to that and attend closely I will speak
Yes Venerable sir Bhadraka the headman replied
The Blessed One said this
What do you think headman Are there any people in Uruvelakappa on whose account sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair would arise in you if they were to be executed imprisoned fined or censured 
But are there any people in Uruvelakappa on whose account sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair would not arise in you in such an event 
There are such people venerable sir
What headman is the cause and reason why in relation to some people in Uruvelakappa sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair would arise in you if they were to be executed imprisoned fined or censured while in regard to others no such sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair would arise in you 
Those people in Uruvelakappa venerable sir in relation to whom sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair would arise in me if they were to be executed imprisoned fined or tensuredthese are the ones for whom I have desire and attachment
But those people in Uruvelakappa in relation to whom no sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair would arise in methese are the ones for whom I have no desire and attachment
Headman by means of this principle that is seen understood immediately attained fathomed apply the method to the past and to the future thusPTS Whatever suffering arose in the past all that arose rooted in desire with desire as its source
for desire is the root of suffering
Whatever suffering will arise in the future all that will arise rooted in desire with desire as its source
for desire is the root of suffering
It is wonderful venerable sir It is amazing venerable sir
How well that has been stated by the Blessed One Whatever suffering arises all that is rooted in desire has desire as its source
for desire is the root of suffering Venerable sir I have a boy named Ciravasi who stays at an outside residence
I rise early and send a man saying Go man and find out how Ciravassi is
Until that man returns venerable sir I am upset thinking I hope Ciravassi has not met with any affliction 
What do you think headman If Ciravasi were to be executed imprisoned fined or censured vould sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair arise in you 
Venerable sir if Ciravasi were to be executed imprisoned fined or censured even my life would be upset so how could sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair not arise in me 
In this way too headman it can be understood Whatever suffering arises all that arises rooted in desire with desire as its source
for desire is the root of suffering
No venerable sir
Then was it headman because of seeing her or hearing about her that this desire attachment and affection arose in you 
Yes venerable sir
What do you think headman If Ciravasis mother were to be executed imprisoned fined or censured would sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair arise in you 
Venerable sir if Ciravasis mother were to be executed imprisoned fined or censured even my life would be upset so how could sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair not arise in me 
In this way too headman it can be understood Whatever suffering arises all that arises rooted in desire with desire as its source
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at a town of the Mallans named Uruvelakappa
There are such people venerable sir
What do you think headman Before you saw Ciravasis mother or heard about her did you have any desire attachment or affection for her 
for desire is the root of suffering 
Bhikkhus even a wheelturning monarch  a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma does not turn the wheel without a king above him
When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One But Bhante who is the king above a wheelturning monarch  a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma 
It is the Dhamma bhikkhu the Blessed One said Here bhikkhu a wheelturning monarch a righ teous king who rules by the Dhamma relying just on the Dhamm a honoring respecting and venerating the Dhamma taking the Dhamma as his standard banner and authority provides righteous protection shelter and guard for the people in his court

Having provided such righteous protection shelter and guard for all these beings that wheelturning monarch a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma turns the wheel solely through the Dhamma
So too bhikkhu the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One the righteous king of the Dhamma relying just on the Dhamma honoring respecting and Venerating the Dhamma taking the Dhamma as his standard  banner and authority provides righteous protection shelter and guard in regard to bodily action saying Such bodily action should be cultivated such bodily action should not be cultivated
Again the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened Onethe righteous king of the Dhamma relying just on the Dhamma honoring respecting and venerating the Dhamma taking the Dhamma as his standard banner and authority provides righteous protection shelter and guard in regard to verbal action saying Such verbal action should be cultivated such verbal action should not be cultivated    Such mental action should be cultivated such mental action should not be cultivated 
Having provided such righteous protection shelter and guard in regard to bodily action verbal action and mental action the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One the righteous king of the Dhamma sets in motion the unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma solely through the Dhamma
a wheel that cannot be turned back by any ascetic brahmin deva Mara or Brahma or by anyone in the world
a wheel that cannot be turned back by any hostile human being

It is in such a way that a wretch lives together with a wretch
And how does a wretch live together with a female deva
Here the husband is one who destroys lifehe insults and reviles ascetics and brahmins But his wife is one who abstains from the destruction of life from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from false speech and from liquor wine and intoxicants the basis for heedlessness she is virtuous of good character she dwells at home with a heart free from the stain of miserliness she does not insult or revile ascetics and brahmins

Here the husband is one who abstains from the destruction of lifehe does not insult or revile ascetics and brahmins And his wife is also one who abstains from the destruction of lifeshe does not insult or revile ascetics and brahmins
It is in such a way that a deva lives together with a female deva
These are the four ways of living to gether
Householders there are these four ways of living together
The Blessed One then said to them
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhaggas in Sumsumaragira in the deer park at Bhesakala Grove
Then in the morning the Blessed One dressed took his bowl and robe and went to the residence of the householder Nakulapita where he sat down in the prepared seat
Then the householder Nakulapita and the housewife Nakulamata approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one side
The householder Nakulapita then said to the Blessed One
We wish Bhante to see one another not only in this present life but also in future lives
The housewife Nakulamata in turn said to the Blessed One Bhante since I was a young girl given to the young householder Nakulapita in marriage I do not recall ever transgressing against him even in thought muchless by deed
We wish Bhante to see one another not only in this present life but also in future lives
Householders if both husband and wife wish to see one an other not only in this present life but also in future lives they should have the same faith the same virtuous behavior the same generosity and the same wisdom Then they will see one another not only in this present life but also in future lives
Bhante since I was young when the young girl Nakulamata was given to me in marriage I do not recall ever transgressing against her even in thought muchless by deed
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park Then in the morning the Blessed One dressed took his bowl and robe and went to the residence of the householder Anathapindika where he sat down on the seat that was prepared for him
Now on that occasion people in Anathapindikas residence were making an uproar and a racket
Then the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one side
The Blessed One then said to him
Householder why are people in your residence making such an uproar and a racket One would think it w as fishermen at a haul of fish
This Bhante is my daughterinlaw Sujata who is rich and has been brought here from a rich family
She doesnt obey her fatherinlaw her m otherinlaw or her husband She doesnt even honor respect esteem and venerate the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One addressed Sujata Come here Sujata
Yes Bhante she replied She went to the Blessed One paid homage to him and satdown to one side
Sujata a man might have seven kinds of wives
What seven
One like a killer one like a thief one like a tyrant one like a mother one like a sister one like a friend and one like a slave
A man might have these seven kinds of wives
Which one are you 
Bhante I do not understand in detail the meaning of this statement that the Blessed One has spoken in brief
Please let the Blessed One teach me the Dham main such a way that I might understand in detail the meaning of this statement spoken in brief
Then listen and attend closely Sujata I will speak
Yes Bhante she replied
The Blessed One said this
The Blessed One then said to her
A man Sujata might have these seven kinds of wives
Now which one are you
Beginning today Bhante let the Blessed One consider me a wife who is like a slave
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans near the Koliyan town named Kakkarapatta
There the young Koliyan Dighajanu approached the Blessed One paid homage to him  satdown to one side and said to him
Bhante we are laymen enjoying sensual pleasures living at home in a house full of children We use sandalwood from Kasi we wear garlands scents and unguents we receive gold and silver
Let the Blessed One teach us the Dhamma in a way that will lead to our welfare and happiness in this present life and in future lives
There are Byagghapajja these four things that lead to the welfare ahd happiness of a clansman in this present life
What four
Accomplishment in initiative accomplishment in protection good friendship and balanced living
And what is accomplishment in initiative
Here whatever may be the means by which a clansman earns his livingwhether by farming trade raising cattle archery government service or some other crafthe is skillful and diligent he possesses sound judgment about it in order to carry out and arrange it properly
This is called accomplishment in initiative
And what is accomplishment in protection
Here a clansman sets up protection and guard over the wealth he has acquired by initiative and energy amassed by the strength of his arms earned by the sweat of his brow righteous wealth righteously gained
This is called accomplishment in protection
And what is good friendship
Here in whatever village or town a clansman lives he associates with householders or their sons whether young but of mature virtue or old and of mature virtuewho are accomplished in faith virtuous behavior generosity and wisdom  he converses with them and engages in discussions with them Insofar as they are accomplished in faith he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in faith insofar as they are accomplished in virtuous behavior he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in virtuous behavior insofar as they are accomplished in generosity he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in generosity insofar as they are accomplished in wisdom he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in wisdom
This is called good friendship
And what is balanced living
Here a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life neither too extravagant nor too frugal aware In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse
Just as an appraiser or his apprentice holding up a scale knows By so much it has dipped down by so much it has gone up so a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life neither too extravagant not too frugal aware In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse
If this clansman has a small income but lives luxuriously others would say of him  This clansman eats his wealth just like an eater of figs
But if he has a large income but lives sparingly others would say of him This clansman may even starve him self
But it is called balanced living when a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life neither too extravagant not too frugal awareIn this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse
The wealth thus amassed has four sources of dissipation womanizing drunkenness gambling and bad friendship bad companionship bad comradeship
Just as if there were a large reservoir with four inlets and four outlets
and a man would close the inlets and open the outlets and sufficient rain does not fall one could expect the water in the reservoir to decrease rather than in crease so the wealth thus amassed has four sources of dissipation womanizingbad comradeship
The wealth thus amassed has four sources of accretion one avoids womanizing drunkenness and gambling and cultivates good friendship good companionship good comradeship
Just as if there were a large reservoir with four inlets and four outlets and a man would open the inlets and close the outlets and sufficient rain falls
one could expect the water in the reservoir to increase rather than decrease so the wealth amassed has four sources of accretion
one avoids womanizingand cultivates good friendship
These are the four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a clansman in this very life
There are Byagghapajja these four other things that lead to a clansmans welfare and happiness in future lives
What four
Accomplishment in faith accomplishment in virtuous behavior accomplishment in generosity and accomplishment in wisdom
And what is accomplishment in faith
Here a clansman is endowed with faith He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathagata thus The Blessed One is an arahantteacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One
This is called accom plishment in faith
And what is accomplishment in virtuous behavior
Here a clansman abstains from the destruction of life from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from false speech and from liquor wine and intoxicants the basis for heedlessness
This is called accom plishm ent in virtuous behavior
And what is accomplishment in generosity
This is called accomplishment in generosity
And what is accomplishment in wisdom
Here a clansman is wise he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering
This is called accomplishment in wisdom
These are the four other things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a clansman in future lives
thinking How cah I prevent kings and thieves from taking it fire from burning it floods from sweeping it off and displeasing heirs from taking it 
Here a clansman dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness freely generous openhanded delighting in relinquishment one devoted to charity delighting in giving and sharing
Bhikkhus a lay follower should not engage in these five trades
What five
Trading in weaponstrading in living beings trading in meat trading in intoxicants and trading in poisons A lay follower should not engage in these five trades
Then the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One
Householder there are these four things that are wished for desired agreeable and rarely gained in the world
What four
One thinks May wealth come to me righteously This is the first thing in the world that is wished for  and rarely gained in the world

Having gained wealth righteously and having gained fame for oneself and for ones relatives and preceptors one thinks May I live long and enjoy a long life span  This is the third thingrarely gained in the world
Having gained wealth righteously having gained fame for oneself and for ones relatives and preceptors living long and enjoying a long life span one thinks With the breakup of the body after death may I be reborn in a good destination in a heavenly world 
This is the fourth thingrarely gained in the world
These are the four things that are wished for desired agreeable and rarely gained in the world There are householder four other things that lead to obtaining those four things
What four
Accomplishment in faith accomplishment in virtuous behavior accomplishment in generosity and accomplishment in wisdom
And what householder is accomplishment in faith
Here a noble disciple is endowed with faith he places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathagata thus The Blessed One is an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One

This is called accomplishment in virtuous behavior
And what is accomplishment in generosity
Here a noble disciple dwells at home with a mind free from the stain of miserliness freely generous openhanded delighting in relinquishment devoted to charity delighting in giving and sharing
This is called accomplishment in generosity
And what is accomplishment in wisdom
If one dwells with a heart overcome by longing and unrighteous greed one does what should be avoided and neglects ones duty
so that ones fame and happiness are spoiled
by doubt one does what should be avoided and neglects ones duty
so that ones fame and happiness are spoiled
When householder a noble disciple has understood thus Longing and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind he abandons them
When he has understood thus Ill will is a defilement of the mind he abandons it
When he has understood thus Dullness and drowsiness are a defilement of the mind he abandons them
When he has understood thus Restlessness and remorse are a defilement of the mind he abandons them
When he has understood thus Doubt is a defilement of the mind he abandons it
When householder a noble disciple has understood thus Longing and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind and has abandoned them
when he has understood thus Ill will
he is then called a noble disciple of great wisdom of wide wisdom one who sees the range one accomplished in wisdom
This is called accomplishment in wisdom
These are the four otherthings that lead to obtaining the four things that are wished for desired agreeable and rarely gained in the world
What four
Here householder with wealth acquired by energetic strivingrighteously gained the noble disciple makes himself happy and pleased and properly maintains himself in happiness
he makes his parents happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness
he makes his wife and children his slaves workers and servants happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness
he makes his friends and companions happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiriess

These householder are the four worthy deeds that the noble disciple undertakes with wealth acquired by energetic striving amassed by the strength of his arms earned by the sweat of his brow righteous wealth righteously gained
When anyone exhausts wealth on anything apart from these four worthy deeds that wealth is said to have gone to waste to have been squandered to have been used frivolously
The Blessed One said to him
With wealth acquired by energetic striving amassed by the strength of his arms earned by the sweat of his brow righteous wealth righteously gaine the noble disciple undertakes four worthy deeds
This is the second case of wealth that has gone to good use for a worthy cause
he makes himself secure against them
Doubt is a defilement of the mind and has abandoned it
But when anyone exhausts wealth on these four worthy deeds that wealth is said to have gone to good use to have been properly used to have been utilized for a worthy cause
Ive enjoyed wealth supported my dependents and overcome adversities
I have given an uplifting offering and perform ed the five oblations
I have served the virtuous monks the selfcontrolled celibate ones
I have achieved whatever purpose a wise person dwelling at home
might have in desiring wealth what I have done brings me no regret

They praise him here in this life and after death he rejoices in heaven
If one dwells with a heart overcome by ill will
by dullness and drowsiness
by restlessness and remorse
Dullness and drowsiness
Restlessness and remorse

These are the four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after I realized them for myself with direct knowledge
Monks do not fear meritorious deeds
This is an expression denoting happiness what is desirable wished for dear and agreeable that is meritorious deeds
For I know full well monks that for a long time I experienced desirable wished for dear and agreeable results from often performing meritorious deeds
Having cultivated for seven years a mind of lovingkindness for seven eons of contraction and expansion I did not return to this world
Whenever the eon contracted I reached the plane of streaming radiance and when the eon expanded I arose in an empty divine mansion
And there I was Brahma the great Brahma the unvanquished victor the allseeing the allpowerful
Thirtysix times I was Sakka ruler of the devas And many hundreds of times I was a wheelturning monarch righteous a king of righteousness conqueror of the four regions of the earth maintaining stability in the land in possession of the seven treasures
What need is there to speak of mere local kingship
It occurred to me monks to wonder Of what kind of deed of mine is this the fruit Of what deeds ripening am I now of such great accomplishment and power 
Bhikkhus there are these three bases of meritorious activity
And then it occurred to me It is the fruit of three kinds of deeds of mine the ripening of three kinds of deeds that I am now of such great accomplishment and power deeds of giving of selfmastery and of refraining

These bhikkhus are the three bases of meritorious activity
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Vesali at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
And at that time a large number of Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were staying at Vesali on some business
And they heard say The ascetic Gotama son of the Sakyans who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is staying at Vesali at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Ara hant a fullyenlightened Buddha perfected in knowledge and conduct a WellFarer Knower of the worlds unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans a Buddha a Blessed Lord
He proclaims this world with its gods maras and Brahmas the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and peoples having come to know it by his own knowledge
He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and he displays the fullyperfected thoroughly purified holy life
And indeed it is good to see such Arahants
And so these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha went to the Great Forest to the Gabled Hall
At that time the Venerable Nagita was the Lords personal attendant
So they approached the Venerable Nagita
We would like to see him
Friends it is not the right time to see the Lord He is in solitary meditation
But the Brahmins just sat down to one side and said When we have seen the Lord Gotama we will go
Just then Otthaddha the Licchavi came to the Gabled Hall with a large company saluted the Venerable Nagita and stood aside
saying Where is the Blessed Lord staying the Ara hant the fullyenlightened Buddha We would like to see him
Mahali it is not the right time to see the Lord He is in solitary meditation
But Otthaddha just sat down to one side and said When I have seen the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha I will go
Then the novice Siha came to the Venerable Nagita stood aside
and said Venerable Kassapa these many Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Lord and Otthaddha the Licchavi too has come with a large company to see the Lord It would be well Venerable Kassapa to allow these people to see him
Well then Siha you announce them to the Lord
Yes Venerable Sir said Siha Then he went to the Lord saluted him stood aside
It would be well if the Lord were to let these people see him
Then Siha prepare a seat in the shade of this dwelling
Yes Lord said Siha and did so
Then the Lord came out of his dwelling place and sat down on the prepared seat
The Brahmins approached the Lord
Having exchanged courtesies with him they sat down to one side
But Otthaddha did obeisance to the Lord and then sat down to one side
saying Lord not long ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said Soon I shall have been a follower of the Lord for three years I have seen heavenly sights pleasant delightful enticing but I have not heard any heavenly sounds that were pleasant delightful enticing
Lord are there any such heavenly sounds which Sunakkhatta cannot hear or are there not
There are such sounds Mahali
Then Lord what is the reason what is the cause why Sunakkahtta cannot hear them
Mahali in one case a monk facing east goes into onesided samadhi and sees heavenly sights pleasant delightful enticing
By means of this onesided samadhi he sees heavenly sights but does not hear heavenly sounds
Why is this
Because this samadhi only leads to the seeing of heavenly sights but not to the hearing of heavenly sounds
Again a monk facing south west north goes into a onesided samadhi and facing upwards downwards or across sees heavenly sights in that direction
Why is this
Because this samadhi only leads to the seeing of heavenly sights but not to the hearing of heavenly sounds
In another case Mahali a monk facing east hears heavenly sounds but does not see heavenly sights
Again a monk facing south west north facing upwards downwards or across hears heavenly sounds but does not see heavenly sights
In another case Mahali a monk facing east goes into twosided samadhi and both sees heavenly sights pleasant delightful enticing and hears heavenly sounds
Why is this
Because this twosided samadhi leads to both the seeing of heavenly sights and the hearing of heavenly sounds
Again a monk facing south west north facing upwards downwards or across sees heavenly sights and hears heavenly sounds
Well Lord is it for the realisation of such samadhi states that monks lead the holy life under the Blessed Lord
 No Mahali there are other things higher and more perfect than these for the sake of which monks lead the holy life under me
What are they Lord
 Mahali in one case a monk having abandoned three fetters becomes a StreamWinner not liable to states of woe firmly set on the path to enlightenment
Again a monk who has abandoned the three fetters and has reduced his greed hatred and delusion becomes a OnceRetumer who having returned to this world once more will make an end of suffering
Again a monk who has abandoned the five lower fetters takes a spontaneous rebirth in a higher sphere and without returning from that world gains enlightenment
Again a monk through the extinction of the corruptions reaches in this very life the uncorrupted deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom which he has realised by his own insight
That is another thing higher and more perfect than these for the sake of which monks lead the holy life under me
Lord is there a path is there a method for the realisation of these things
 There is a path Mahali there is a method
And Lord what is this path what is this method
It is the Noble Eightfold Path
namely Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration
This is the path this is the way to the realisation of these things
Once Mahali I was staying at KosambI in the Ghosita Park
And two wanderers Mandissa and Jaliya the pupil of the woodenbowl ascetic
Then they said How is it friend Gotama is the soul the same as the body or is the soul one thing and the body another
Well now friends you listen pay proper attention and I will explain
Yes friend they said and I went on
Friends a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha 
remains in the first jhana
Now of one who thus knows and thus sees is it proper to say The soul is the same as the body or The soul is different from the body
It is not friend
But I thus know and see
and I do not say that the soul is either the same as or different from the body And the same with the second the third the fourth jhana 
The mind bends and tends towards knowledge and vision Now of one who thus knows and thus sees is it proper to say The soul is the same as the body or The soul is different from the body
It is not friend
Now of one who thus knows and thus sees is it proper to say The soul is the same as the body or The soul is different from the body
It is not friend
But I thus know and see
Bhikkhus there are these four foremost kinds of confidence
What four
To whatever extent there are beings whether footless or with two feet four feet or many feet whether having form or formless whether percipient or nonpercipient or neither percipient nor nonpercipient the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One is declared the foremost among them
Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the foremost
To whatever extent there are phenomena that are conditioned the noble eightfold path is declared the foremost among them
Those who have confidence in the noble eightfold path have confidence in the foremost
To whatever extent there are phenomena conditioned or unconditioned dispassion is declared the foremost among them  that is the crushing of pride the removal of thirst the uprooting of attachment the termination of the round the destruction of craving dispassion cessation nibbana
Those who have confidence in the Dhamma have confidence in the foremost
To whatever extent there are Sanghas or groups the Sangha of the Tathagatas disciples is declared the foremost among them that is the four pairs of persons the eight types of individuals  this Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worth y of reverential salutation the unsurpassed field of merit for the world
Those who have confidence in the Sangha have confidence in the foremost
These are the four foremost kinds of confidence
and for those who have confidence in the foremost the result is foremost
and for those who have confidence in the foremost the result is foremost
and for those who have confidence in the foremost the result is foremost
and for those who have confidence in the foremost the result is foremost
For those confident in regard to the foremost knowing the foremost Dhamma
for those confident in the foremost Dhamma in the blissful peace of dispassion
for those giving gifts to the foremost the foremost kind of merit increases
The wise one who gives to the foremost concentrated upon the foremost Dhamma
O monks if people knew as I know the result of giving and sharing they would not eat without having given nor would they allow the stain of niggardliness to obsess them and take root in their minds
Even if it were their last morsel their last mouthful they would not eat without having shared it if there were someone to share it with
But monks as people do not know as I know the result of giving and sharing they eat without having given and the stain of niggardliness obsesses them and takes root in their minds
What eight 
One gives a gift from desire  One gives a gift from hatred  One gives a gift from delusion  One gives a gift from fear One gives a gift thinking Giving was practiced before by my father and forefathers I should not abandon this ancient family custom One gives a gift thinking Having given this gift with the breakup of the body after death I will be reborn in a good destination in a heavenly world  One gives a gift thinking When I am giving this gift my mind becomes placid and elation and joy a rise One gives a gift for the purpose of ornamenting the mind equipping the mind 
These are the eight grounds for giving 
confident in the Buddha the foremost  unsurpassed worthy of offerings
for those confident in the foremost Sangha the unsurpassed field of merit
the foremost life span beauty and glory good reputation happiness and strength
having become a deva or a human being rejoices having attained the foremost
Bhikkhus there are these eight grounds for giving
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans near the Koliyan town named SajjanelaThen in the morning the Blessed One dressed took his bowl and robe and went to the residence of the Koliyan daughter Suppavasa where he sat down in the prepared seat
Then the Koliyan daughter Suppavasa with her own hand served and satisfied the Blessed One with various kinds of delicious food
When the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl
The Blessed One then said to her
Suppavasa a female noble disciple who gives food gives the recipients four things
What four
She gives life beauty happiness and strength
Having given life she partakes of life whether celestial or human
Having given beauty she partakes of beauty whether celestial or human
Having given happiness she partakes of happiness whether celestial or human
Having given strength she partakes of strength whether celestial or human
Suppavasa a female noble disciple who gives food gives the recipients these four things
the Koliyan daughter Suppavasa sat down to one side
When one gives wellprepared food pure delicious and flavorful to the upright ones who are exalted and of excellent conduct that offering which links merit with merit is praised as very fruitful by the worldknowers
Those recollecting such generosity dwell in the world inspired by joy Having rem oved the stain of miserliness and its root blameless they go to the heavenly abode
Bhikkhus there are these five gifts of a good person
What five
Because he has given a gift out of faith wherever the result of that gift is produced  he becomes rich with great wealth and property and he is handsome attractive graceful possessing supreme beauty of complexion
Because he has given a gift respectfully wherever the result of that gift is produced he becomes rich with great wealth and property
Because he has given a timely gift wherever the result of that gift is produced he becomes rich with great wealth and property and timely benefits come to him in abundance
Because he has given a gift unreservedly wherever the result of that gift is produced he becomes rich with great wealth and property and his mind inclines to the enjoyment of tire five kinds of fine sensual pleasures
Because he has given a gift without injuring himself or others wherever the result of that gift is produced he becomes rich with great wealth and property and no damage comes to his property from any source whether from fire floods kings thieves or displeasing heirs
These are the five gifts of a good person
He gives a gift out of faith he gives a gift respectfully he gives a timely gift he gives a gift unreservedly he gives a gift without injuring himself or others
and his sons and wives slaves servants and workers are obedient lendanear and apply their minds to understand
Monks brahmins and householders are very helpful to you They provide you with the requisites of robes almsfood lodgings and medicines in time of sickness
And you monks are very helpful to brahmins and householders as you teach them the Dhamma that is good in the beginning the middle and the end with the correct meaning and wording and you proclaim the spiritual life in its fulfillment and complete purity
Thus monks this spiritual life is lived with mutual support for the purpose of crossing the flood and making a complete end of suffering
Bhikkhus there are these eight kinds of rebirth on account of giving

Whatever he gives he expects something in return

and said Reverend Nagita where is the Reverend Gotama now staying
and said Lord these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Lord and Otthaddha the Licchavi likewise with a large company
but does not hear heavenly sounds
but does not hear heavenly sounds
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodhas Park
Then Mahapajapati Gotami took a new pair of cloths and went to the Blessed One
After paying homage to him she sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One Venerable sir this new pair of cloths has been spun by me woven by me especially for the Blessed One
Venerable sir let the Blessed One accept it from me out of compassion
When this was said the Blessed One told her Give it to the Sangha Gotami
A second time she said to the Blessed One Venerable sir
A second time and a third time the Blessed One told her Give it to the Sangha Gotami
When you give it to the Sangha the offering will be made both to me and to the Sangha
Then the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One Venerable sir let the Blessed One accept the new pair of cloths from Mahapajapati Gotami
Mahapajapati Gotami has been very helpful to the Blessed One venerable sir As his mothers sister she was his nurse his foster mother the one who gave him milk She suckled the Blessed One when his own mother died
The Blessed One too has been very helpful to Mahapajapati GotamI venerable sir
It is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati Gotami has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
It is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati Gotami abstains from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech and from wine liquor and intoxicants which are the basis of negligence
It is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati Gotami is free from doubt about suffering about the origin of suffering about the cessation of suffering and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering
The Blessed One has been very helpful to Mahapajapati Gotami
That is so Ananda that is so
When one person owing to another has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha I say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying homage to him rising up for him according him reverential salutation and polite services and by providing robes almsfood resting places and medicinal requisites
When one person owing to another has come to possess perfect confidence in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and to possess the virtues loved by noble ones I say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying homage to himand medicinal requisites
There are fourteen kinds of personal offerings Ananda
One gives a gift to the Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened this is the first kind of personal offering
One gives a gift to a paccekabuddha this is the second kind of personal offering
One gives a gift to an arahant disciple of the Tathagata this is the third kind of personal offering
One gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of arahantship this is the fourth kind of personal offering
One gives a gift to a nonreturner this is the fifth kind of personal offering
One gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of nonreturn this is the sixth kind of personal offering
One gives a gift to a oncereturner this is the seventh kind of personal offering

One gives a gift to a streamenterer this is the ninth kind of personal offering
One gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of streamentry this is the tenth kind of personal offering
One gives a gift to one outside the Dispensation who is free from lust for sensual pleasures  this is the eleventh kind of personal offering

One gives a gift to an animal this is the fourteenth kind of personal offering
Herein Ananda by giving a gift to an animal the offeriing may be expected to repay a hundredfold By giving a gift to an immoral ordinary person the offering may be expected to repay a thousandfold By giving a gift to a virtuous ordinary person the offering may be expected to repay a hundredthousandfold By giving a gift to one outside the Dispensation who is free from lust for sensual pleasures the offering may be expected to repay a hundredthousand times a hundredthousandfold By giving a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of streamentry the offering may be expected to repay incalculably immeasurably What then should be said about giving a gift to a streamenterer What should be said about giving a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of oncereturnto a oncereturnerto one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of nonreturnto a nonreturnerto one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of arahantshipto an arahant o a paccekabuddha What should be said about giving a gift to a Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened
There are seven kinds of offerings made to the Sangha Ananda
One gives a gift to a Sangha of both bhikkhus and bhikkhunls headed by the Buddha this is the first kind of offering made to the Sangha
One gives a gift to a Sangha of both bhikkhus and bhikkhunls after the Tathagata has attained final Nibbana this is the second kind of offering made to the Sangha
One gives a gift to a Sangha of bhikkhus this is the third kind of offering made to the Sangha
One gives a gift to a Sangha of bhikkhunis this is the fourth kind of offering made to the Sangha
One gives a gift saying Appoint so many bhikkhus and bhikkhunls for me from the Sangha this is the fifth kind of offering made to the Sangha
One gives a gift saying Appoint so many bhikkhus for me from the Sangha this is the sixth kind of offering made to the Sangha
One gives a gift saying Appoint so many bhikkhunls for me from the Sangha this is the seventh kind of offering made to the Sangha
In future times Ananda there will be members of the clan who are yellownecks immoral of evil character
People will give gifts to those immoral persons for the sake of the Sangha
Even then I say an offering made to the Sangha is incalculable immeasurable
And I say that in no way does a gift to a person individually ever have greater fruit than an offering made to the Sangha
There are four kinds of purification of offering
What four
There is the offering that is purified by the giver not by the receiver
There is the offering that is purified by the receiver not by the giver
There is the offering that is purified neither by the giver nor by the receiver
There is the offering that is purified both by the giver and by the receiver
And what is the offering that is purified by the giver not by the receiver
Here the giver is virtuous of good character and the receiver is immoral of evil character Thus the offering is purified by the giver not by the receiver
And what is the offering that is purified by the receiver not by the giver
Here the giver is immoral of evil character and the receiver is virtuous of good character Thus the offering is purified by the receiver not by the giver
And what is the offering that is purified neither by the giver nor by the receiver
Here the giver is immoral of evil character and the receiver is immoral of evil character Thus the offering is purified neither by the giver nor by the receiver
And what is the offering that is purified both by the giver and by the receiver
Here the giver is virtuous of good character and the receiver is virtuous of good character Thus the offering is purified both by the giver and by the receiver
These are the four kinds of purification of offering
That is what the Blessed One said
When the Sublime One had said that the Teacher said further
When you give it to the Sangha the offering will be made both to me and to the Sangha
accept it from me out of compassion
 and a third time
It is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati GotamI possesses perfect confidence in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and that she possesses the virtues loved by noble ones
When one person owing to another has come to abstain from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech and from wine liquor and intoxicants which are the basis of negligence I say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying homage to himand medicinal requisites
When one person owing to another has become free from doubt about suffering about the origin of suffering about the cessation of suffering and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering I say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying homage to himand medicinal requisites
When a virtuous person to an immoral person gives
With trusting heart a gift righteously obtained
Placing faith that the fruit of action is great
The givers virtue purifies the offering
When an immoral person to a virtuous person gives
With untrusting heart a gift unrighteously obtained
Nor places faith that the fruit of action is great
The receivers virtue purifies the offering
When an immoral person to an immoral person gives
With untrusting heart a gift unrighteously obtained
Nor places faith that the fruit of action is great
Neithers virtue purifies the offering
When a virtuous person to a virtuous person gives
With trusting heart a gift righteously obtained
Placing faith that the fruit of action is great
That gift I say will come to full fruition
When a passionless person to a passionless person gives
With trusting heart a gift righteously obtained
Placing faith that the fruit of action is great
That gift I say is the best of worldly gifts
Both are endowed with faith charitable and selfcontrolled living their lives righteously
Then many benefits accrue to them and they dwell at ease
Having practiced the Dhamma here the same in virtuous behavior and observances
Mother and father are called Brahma and also first teachers They are worthy of gifts from their children for they have compassion for their offspring Therefore a wise person should revere them and treat themw ith honor One should serve them with food and drink with clothes and bedding by massaging and bathing them  and by washing their feet Because of that service to mother and father the wise praise one in this world and after death one rejoices in heaven
With hateful mind devoid of sympathy lusting for others despising her husband she seeks to kill the one who bought her with wealth a wife like this is called a wife and a killer
When the womans husband acquires wealth by toiling at a craft trade or farming she tries to steal it even if he earns but little a wife like this is called a wife and a thief
The lazy glutton unwilling to work harsh fierce rough in speech a w om an who dominates her own supporters a wife like this is called a wife and a tyrant
One always benevolent and sympathetic who guards her husband as a mother her son who protects the wealth he earns a wife like this is called a wife and a mother
She who holds her husband in high regard as younger sister her elder brother conscientious following her husbands will a wife like this is called a wife and a sister
One who rejoices when she sees her husband as if seeing a friend after a long absence well raised virtuous devoted to her husband a wife like this is called a wife and a friend
One who remains patient and calm  when threatened with violence by the rod who tolerates her husband with a mind free of hate patient submissive to her husbands will a wife like this is called a wife and a slave
The types of wives here called a killer a thief and a tyrant immoral harsh disrespectful with the bodys breakup go to hell
But the types of wives here called mother sister friend and slave firm in virtue long restrained with the bodys breakup go to heaven
Enterprising in his occupations heedful in his arrangements balanced in his way of living he safeguards the wealth he earns
Endowed with faith accomplished in virtue charitable and devoid of miserliness he constantly purifies the path that leads to safety in future lives
Thus these eight qualities of the faithful seeker of the household life are said by the one who is truly named to lead to happiness in both states to good and welfare in this very life and to happiness in future lives
Thus for those dwelling at home their generosity and merit increas
Having known the happiness of freedom from debt one should recall the happiness of ownership Enjoying the happiness of enjoyment a mortal then sees things clearly with wisdom
While seeing things clearly the wise one knows both kinds of happiness The other is not worth a sixteenth part of the bliss of blamelessness
Capable in attending to her work managing the domestic help she treats her husband in agreeable ways and safeguards the wealth he earns
Rich in faith possessed of virtue charitable and devoid of miserliness she constantly purifies the path that leads to safety in the future life
They call any woman who has these eight qualities virtuous firm in Dhamma a speaker of truth
Accomplished in sixteen aspects complete in eight factors such a virtuous female lay follower is reborn in an agreeable deva world

Monks whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the liberation of mind by lovingkindness
The liberation of mind by lovingkindness surpasses them and shines forth bright and brilliant
Just as the radiance of all the stars does not equal a sixteenth part of the moons radiance but the moons radiance surpasses them and shines forth bright and brilliant even so whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the liberation of mind by lovingkindness The liberation of mind by lovingkindness surpasses them and shines forth bright and brilliant

And just as in the night at the moment of dawn the morning star shines forth bright and brilliant even so whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the liberation of mind by lovingkindness The liberation of mind by lovingkindness surpasses them and shines forth bright and brilliant
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas G rove Anathapindikas Park
Then the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and satdown to one side
The Blessed One asked him
Alms are given in my family Bhante but they consist of broken rice accompanied by rice gruel
If householder one gives alms coarse or excellent and one gives disrespectfully gives inconsiderately does not give with ones own hand gives what would be discarded gives without a view of future consequences
Also ones children and wives and ones slaves servants and workers do not want to listen to one do not lend an ear and do not apply their minds to understand
For what reason
Just this is the result of actions that are done disrespectfully
If householder one gives alms whether coarse or excellent and one gives respectfully gives considerately gives with ones own hand gives what would not be discarded gives with a view of future consequences
Also ones children and wives and ones slaves servants and workers want to listen to one lend an ear and apply their minds to understand
For what reason
Just this is the result of actions that are done respectfully
In the past householder there was a brahm in named Velama
He gave such a great alms offering as this
eightyfour thousand golden bowls filled with silver eightyfour thousand silver bowls filled with gold eightyfour thousand bronze bowls filled with bullion eightyfour thousand elephants with golden ornaments golden banners covered with nets of gold thread eightyfour thousand chariots with upholstery of lion skins tiger skins leopard skins and saffrondyed blankets with golden ornaments golden banners covered with nets of gold thread eightyfour thousand milk cows with jute tethers and bronze palls eightyfour thousand maidens adorned with jeweled earrings eightyfour thousand couches spread with rugs blankets and covers with excellent coverings of antelope hide with canopies and red bolsters at both ends eightyfour thousand kotis of cloths made of fine linen fine silk fine wool and fine cotton How much more of food and drink snacks meals refreshments and beverages It seemed to be flowing like rivers
You might think householder He was someone else the brahmin Velama who on that occasion gave that great alms offering
But you should not look at it in such a way
I myself was the brahmin Velama
Now householder at that alms offering there was no one worthy of offerings no one who purified the offering
Even more fruitful than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velama gave would it be to feed one person accomplished in view
Even more fruitful than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velama gave and feeding a hundred persons accomplished in view would it be to feed one oncereturner
Even more fruitful than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velama gave and feeding a hundred oncereturners would it be to feed onenonreturner Even more fruitful thanfeeding a hundred nonreturners would it be to feed one arahant Even more fruitful thanfeeding a hundred arahants would it be to feed one paccekabuddha Even more fruitful thanfeeding a hundred paccekabuddhas would it be to feed the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened Onewould it be to feed the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddhawould it be to build a dwelling dedicated to the Sangha of the four quartersw ould it be for one with a mind of confidence to go for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sanghawould it be for one with a mind of confidence to undertake the five training rules to abstain from the destruction of life to abstain from taking what is not given to abstain from sexual misconduct to abstain from false speech to abstain from liquor wine and intoxicants the basis for heedlessness Even more fruitfulwould it be to develop a mind of lovingkindness even for the time it takes to pull a cows udder
Even more fruitful householder than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velama gave and feeding one person accomplished in view and feeding a hundred persons accomplished in view and feeding one oncereturner and feeding a hundred oncereturners and feeding one nonreturner and feeding a hundred nonreturners and feeding one arahant and feeding a hundred arahants and feeding one paccekabuddha and feeding a hundred paccekabuddhas and feeding the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One and feeding the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha and building a dwelling dedicated to the Sangha of the four quarters and for one with a mind of confidence to go for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and for one with a mind of confidence to undertake the five training rules to abstain from the destruction of lifeto abstain from liquor wine and intoxicants the basis for heedlessness and for one to develop a mind of lovingkindness even for the time it takes to pull a cows udder would it be to develop the perception of impermanence just for the time of a finger snap
Are alms given in your family householder 
then wherever the result of that gift is produced for one ones mind does not incline toward the enjoyment of superb food nor toward the enjoyment of superb clothing nor toward the enjoyment of superb vehicles nor toward the enjoyment of whatever is superb among the five objects of isensual pleasure
then wherever the result of that gift is produced for one ones mind inclines toward the enjoyment of superb food toward the enjoyment of superb clothing toward the enjoyment of superb vehicles toward the enjoyment of whatever is superb among the five objects of sensual pleasure
who on that occasion gave that great alms offering
came to me exchanged courtesies with me
and sat down to one side
Bhikkhus with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened One four astounding and amazing things become manifest
What four
People delight in attachment take delight in attachment rejoice in attachment But when a Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma about nonattachment people wish to listen and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding it
This is the first astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened One
People delight in conceit take delight in conceit rejoice in conceit
But when a Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma for the removal of conceit people wish to listen and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding it
This is the second astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened One
People delight in excitement take delight in excitement rejoice in excitement
But when a Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma that leads to peace people wish to listen and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding it
This is the third astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened One
People are immersed in ignorance become like an egg completely enveloped
But when a Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma for the removal of ignorance people wish to listen and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding it
This is the fourth astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened One
These bhikkhus are the four astounding and amazing things that become manifest with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened One
Bhikkhus before my enlightenment while I was just a bodhisatta not yet fully enlightened it occurred to me What is the gratification in the world What is the danger in it What is the escape from it 
Then bhikkhus it occurred to me The pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on the world this is the gratification in the world
That the world is impermanent suffering and subject to change this is the danger in the world
The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for the world this is the escape from the world
So long bhikkhus as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification in the world as gratification the danger as danger and the escape from it as escape I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma in this population with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans
But when I directly knew as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification the danger as danger and the escape from it as escape then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world withits devas and humans
The knowledge and vision arise in me Unshakable is my liberation of mind this is my last birth now there is no more renewed existence
Bhikkhus I set out seeking the gratification in the world
Whatever gratification there is in the world  that I found
I have clearly seeri with wisdom just how far the gratification in the world extends
I set out seeking the danger in the world
Whatever danger there is in the world  that I found
I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the danger in the world extends
I set out seeking the escape from the world
Whatever escape there is from the world  that I found
I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the escape from the world extends
So long bhikkhus as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification in the world as gratification the danger as danger and the escape from it as the escape I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans
But when I directly knew as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification  the danger as danger and the escape from it as escape then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world withits devas and humans
The knowledge and vision arose in me Unshakable is my liberation of mind this is my last birth now there is no more renewed existence
Bhikkhus if there were no gratification in the world beings would not become enamored of it
If there were no danger in the world beings would not become disenchanted with it
If there were no escape from the world beings would not escape from it
So long bhikkhus as beings have not directly known as they really are the gratification in the world as gratification the danger as danger and the escape from it as escape they have not escaped from this world with its devas Mara and Brahma from this population with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and hum ans they have not become detached from it released from it nor do they dwell with a mind rid of barriers
But when beings have directly known as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification the danger as danger and the escape from it as escape then they have escaped from this world withits devas and humans they have become detached from it released from it and they dwell with a mind rid of barriers
but because there is gratification in the world beings become enamored of it
but because there is danger in the world beings become disenchanted with it
but because there is an escape from the world beings escape from it
Bhikkhus there are three things that give no satiation by indulging in them
What three
There is no satiation by indulging in sleep
There is no satiation by indulging in liquor and wine
There is no satiation by indulging in sexual intercourse
These are the three things that give no satiation by indulging in them
and I do not say that the soul is either the same as or different from the body
Thus the Lord spoke
and Otthaddha the Licchavi rejoiced at his words
And that is the reason why Sunakkhatta comes to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly sounds
 He knows There is nothing further here
Bhikkhus in the past there was a teacher named Araka the founder of a spiritual sect one without lust for sensual pleasures
to whom he taught such a Dhamma as this Brahmins short is the life of human beings limited and fleeting it has much suffering much misery One should wisely understand this One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life for none who are born can escape death
Just as a drop of dew on the tip of a blade of grass will quickly vanish at sunrise and will not last long so too brahmins human life is like a drop of dew It is limited and fleeting it has much suffering much misery One should wisely understand this One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life for none who are born can escape death
Just as when thick drops of rain are pouring down a water bubble will quickly vanish and will not last long so too brahmins human life is like a water bubble It is limitedfor none who are born can escape death
Just as a line drawn on water with a stick will quickly vanish and will not last long so too brahmins human life is like a line drawn on water with a stick It is limitedfor none who are born can escape death
Just as a river flowing down from a mountain going a long distance with a swift current carrying along much flotsam will not stand still for a moment an instant a second but will rush on swirl and flow forward so too brahmins human life is like a mountain stream It is limitedfor none who are born can escape death
Just as a strong man might form a lump of spittle at the tip of his tongue and spit it out without difficulty so too brahmins human life is like a lump of spittle It is limitedfor none who are born can escape death
Just as a piece of meat thrown into an iron pan heated all day will quickly vanish and will not last long so too brahmins human life is like this piece of meat It is limitedfor none who are born can escape death
Just as when a cow to be slaughtered is being led to the slaughterhouse whatever leg she lifts she is close to slaughter close to death so too brahmins human life is like a cow doomed to slaughter It is limited and fleeting it has much suffering much misery One should wisely understand this One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life for none who are born can escape death
But at that time bhikkhus the human life span was  years and girls were marriageable at the age of five hundred
At that time people had but six afflictions cold heat hunger thirst excrement and urine
Though people had such long life spans and lived so long and though their afflictions were so few still the teacher Araka gave his disciples such a teaching Brahmins short is the life of human beingsfor none who are born can escape death
But nowadays bhikkhus one could rightly say Short is the life of human beings limited and fleeting it has much suffering much misery One should wisely understand this One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life for none who are born can escape death
For today one who lives long lives for a hundred years or a little more
And when living for a hundred years one lives just for three hundred seasons a hundred winters a hundred summers and a hundred rains
When living for tree hundred seasons one lives just for twelve hundred months four hundred winter months four hundred summer months and four hundred months of the rains
When living for twelve hundred months one lives just for twentyfour hundred fortnights eight hundred fortnights of winter eight hundred fortnights of summer and eight hundred fortnights of the rains
And when living for twentyfour hundred fortnights one lives just for  nights  nights of winter  nights of summer and  nights of the rains
And when living for  nights one eats just  meals  meals in winter  in summer and  in the rains And this includes the taking of mothers milk and the times when there are obstacles to meals
These are the obstacles to meals one who is angry does not eat a meal one in pain does not eat a meal one who is ill does not eat a meal one observing the uposatha does not eat a meal and when not obtaining food one does not eat a meal
Thus bhikkhus for a human being with a life span of a hundred years I have reckoned his life span the limit of his life span the number of seasons years months and fortnights in his life the number of his nights days and meals and the obstacles to meals
Whatever bhikkhus should be done by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples seeking their welfare that I have done for you These are the feet of trees these are empty huts
Meditate bhikkhus do not be heedless Do not have cause to regret it later
The teacher Araka had many hundreds of disciples
This is our instruction to you
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Kosambi in the Ghosita Park
And two wanderers Mandissa and Jaliya the pupil of the woodenbowl ascetic came to him exchanged courtesies with him and sat down to one side
Thus the Lord spoke
and the two wanderers rejoiced at his words
Bhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen unwholesome qualities arise and arisen unwholesome qualities increase and expand so much as wrong view
For one of wrong view unarisen unwholesome qualities arise and arisen unwholesome qualities increase and expand
Bhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities increase and expand so much as right view
For one of right view unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities increase and expand
Bhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen wholesome qualities do not arise and arisen wholesome qualities decline so much as wrong view 
For one of wrong view unarisen wholesome qualities do not arise and arisen wholesome qualities decline
Bhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen unwholesome qualities do not arise and arisen unwholesome qualities decline so much as right view
For one of right view unarisen unwholesome qualities do not arise and arisen unwholesome qualities decline
Bhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen wrong view arises and arisen wrong view increases so much as careless attention
For one of careless attention unarisen wrong view arises and arisen wrong view increases
Bhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen right view arises and arisen right view increases so much as careful attention
For one of careful attention unarisen right view arises and arisen right view increases
Bhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which with the breakup of the body after death  beings are reborn in the plane of misery in a bad destination in the lower world in hell so much as wrong view
Possessing wrong view with the breakup of the body after death beings are reborn in the plane of misery in a bad destination in the lower world in hell
Bhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which with the breakup of the body after death beings are reborn in a good destination in a heavenly world so much as right view
Possessing right view with the breakup of the body after death beings are reborn in a good destination in a heavenly world
Bhikkhus for a person of wrong view whatever bodily kamma verbal kamma and mental kamma he instigates and undertakes in accordance with that view and whatever his volition yearning inclination and volitional activities all lead to what is unwished for undesired and disagreeable to harm and suffering
For what reason
Because the view is bad
Suppose bhikkhus a seed of neem bitter cucumber or bitter gourd were planted in moist soil Whatever nutrients it takes up from the soil and from the water would all lead to its bitter pungent and disagreeable flavor
For what reason
Because the seed is bad
So too for a person of wrong viewall lead to what is unwished for undesired and disagreeable to harm and suffering
For what reason
Because the view is bad
Bhikkhus for a person of right view whatever bodily kamma verbal kamma and mental kamma he instigates and undertakes in accordance with that view and whatever his volition yearning inclination and volitional activities all lead to what is wished for desired and agreeable to wellbeing and happiness
For what reason
Because the view is good
Suppose bhikkhus a seed of sugar cane hill rice or grape were planted in moist soil Whatever nutrients it takes up from the soil and from the water would all lead to its sweet agreeable and delectable flavor
For what reason
Because the seed is good
So too for a person of right viewall lead to what is wished for desired and agreeable to welfare and happiness
For what reason
Because the view is good
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Now at that time a number of ascetics and brahmins wanderers of other sects were living around Savatthi They held various views beliefs and opinions and propagated various views
Then a number of monks entered Savatthi on almsround
Having returned after their meal they approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side
They do not know what is the Dhamma and what is not the Dhamma and thus they are so quarrelsome and disputatious
Formerly monks there was a king in Savatthi
When the man had done so
To some of the blind men he presented the head of the elephant
to some the ear
Those who had been shown the head of the elephant replied An elephant your majesty is just like a water jar
Those who had been shown the ear replied An elephant is just like a winnowing basket
Those who had been shown the tusk replied An elephant is just like a plowshare
Those who had been shown the trunk replied An elephant is just like a plow pole
Those who had been shown the body replied An elephant is just like a storeroom
Then saying An elephant is like this an elephant is not like that An elephant is not like this an elephant is like that  they fought each other with their fists
And the king was delighted
Even so monks are the wanderers of other sects blind and sightless
who addressed a man and asked him to round up all the persons in the city who were blind from birth
Monks held by two kinds of views some devas and human beings hold back and some overreach only those with vision see
And how monks do some hold back
Devas and human beings delight in existence are delighted with existence rejoice in existence When the Dhamma is taught to them for the cessation of existence their minds do not enter into it acquire confidence in it settle upon it or resolve upon it
Thus monks do some hold back
And how monks do some overreach
Now some are troubled ashamed and disgusted by this very same existence and they rejoice in nonexistence saying In as much as this self good sirs is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death this is peaceful this is excellent this is just so
Thus monks do some overreach
And how monks do those with vision see
Here a monk sees what has come to be as having come to be Having seen it thus he practices the course for disenchantment for dispassion for the cessation of what has come to be
Thus monks do those with vision see
Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world
And they were quarrelsome disputatious wrangling wounding each other with verbal darts saying The Dhamma is like this the Dhamma is not like that The Dhamma is not like this the Dhamma is like that 
and told him what they had seen
The Blessed One said Monks wanderers of other sects are blind and sightless They do not know what is beneficial and harmful
the king asked the man to show the blind men an elephant
When he reported to the king what he had done
the king went to the blind men and asked them
Tell me blind men what is an elephant like 
to others a tusk
the trunk
the body
a foot
the hindquarters
the tail
or the tuft at the end of the tail And to each one he said This is an elephant
and thus they become quarrelsome disputatious and wrangling wounding each other with verbal darts
What four Here bhikkhus secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states some person enters and dwells in the first jhana which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by thought and examination
He relishes it desires it and finds satisfaction in it
If he is firm in it focused on it often dwells in it and has not lost it when he dies he is reborn in companionship w ith the devas of Brahmas company
The life span of the devas of Brahmas company is an eon
The worldling remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he goes to hell to the animal realm or to the sphere of afflicted spirits
But the Blessed Ones disciple remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he attains final nibbana in that very same state of existence
This is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling that is when there is future destination and rebirth
Again some person with the subsiding of thought and examination enters and dwells in the second jhana which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration without thought and examination
He relishes it desires it and finds satisfaction in it
If he is firm in it focused on it often dwells in it and has not lost it when he dies he is reborn in companionship with the devas of streaming radiance
The life span of the devas of streaming radiance is two eons
The worldling remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he goes to hell to the animal realm or to the sphere of afflicted spirits
But the Blessed Ones disciple remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he attains final nibbana in that very same state of existence
This is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling that is when there is future destination and rebirth
Again some person with the fading away as well of rapture dwells equanimous and mindful and clearly comprehending he experiences pleasure with the body he enters and dwells in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare He is equanimous mindful one who dwells happily
He relishes it desires it and finds satisfaction in it
If he is firm in it focused on it often dwells in it and has not lost it when he dies he is reborn in companionship with the devas of refulgent glory
The life span of the devas of refulgent glory is four eons
The worldling remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he goes to hell to the animal realm or to the sphere of afflicted spirits
But the Blessed Ones disciple remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he attains final nibbana in that very same state of existence
This is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling that is when there is future destination and rebirth
Again some person with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection enters and dwells in the fourth jhana neither painful nor pleasant which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity
He relishes it desires it and finds satisfaction in it
If he is firm in it focused on it often dwells in it and has not lost it when he dies he is reborn in companionship with the devas of great fruit
The life span of the devas of great fruit is five hundred eons
The worldling remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he goes to hell to the animal realm or to the sphere of afflicted spirits
But the Blessed Ones disciple remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he attains final nibbana in that very same state of existence
This is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling that is when there is future destination and rebirth
These bhikkhus are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion there were many contemplatives brahmans  wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views
Some of the contemplatives  brahmans held this doctrine this view The cosmos is eternal Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
The cosmos is finite Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
And they kept on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like this
Then in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and  carrying their bowls  robes  went into Sāvatthī for alms
Having gone for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
Monks the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyelessThey dont know what is beneficial and what is harmful
They dont know what is the Dhamma and what is nonDhamma Not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is Dhamma and what is nonDhamma they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like this
Once monks in this same Sāvatthī there was a certain king
and the king said to a certain man Come my good man Gather together all the people in Sāvatthī who have been blind from birth
Responding As you say your majesty to the king the man  having rounded up all the people in Sāvatthī who had been blind from birth  went to the king and on arrival said Your majesty the people in Sāvatthī who have been blind from birth have been gathered together
Very well then I say show the blind people an elephant
Responding As you say your majesty to the king the man showed the blind people an elephant
To some of the blind people he showed the elephants head saying This blind people is what an elephant is like
To some of them he showed the elephants ear saying This blind people is what an elephant is like
To some of them he showed the elephants tusk
Then having shown the blind people the elephant the man went to the king and on arrival said Your majesty the blind people have seen the elephant May your majesty do what you think it is now time to do
Then the king went to the blind people and on arrival asked them Blind people have you seen the elephant 
Yes your majesty We have seen the elephant
Now tell me blind people what the elephant is like
The blind people who had been shown the elephants head said The elephant your majesty is just like a jar
Those who had been shown the elephants ear said The elephant your majesty is just like a winnowing basket
Those who had been shown the elephants tusk said The elephant your majesty is just like plowshare
Those who had been shown the elephants trunk said The elephant your majesty is just like the pole of a plow
Those who had been shown the elephants body said The elephant your majesty is just like a granary
Those who had been shown the elephants foot said The elephant your majesty is just like a post
Those who had been shown the elephants hindquarters said The elephant your majesty is just like a mortar
Those who had been shown the elephants tail said The elephant your majesty is just like a pestle
Those who had been shown the tuft at the end of the elephants tail said The elephant your majesty is just like a broom
Saying The elephant is like this its not like that The elephants not like that its like this they struck one another with their fists
That gratified the king
In the same way monks the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyeless
They dont know what is beneficial and what is harmful
They dont know what is the Dhamma and what is nonDhamma Not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is Dhamma and what is nonDhamma they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like this
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Some of the contemplatives  brahmans held this doctrine this view The cosmos is not eternal
The cosmos is infinite
The soul is the same thing as the body
The soul is one thing and the body another
After death a Tathāgata exists
After death a Tathāgata does not exist
After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist
After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist
the elephants trunk
the elephants body
the elephants foot
the elephants hindquarters
the elephants tail
the tuft at the end of the elephants tail saying This blind people is what an elephant is like
With regard to these things theyre attached  some contemplatives  brahmans
with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views And they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like this
Lord there are many contemplatives brahmans  wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī
They quarrel  fight  people seeing one side
As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One
At Savatthi Bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning
A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
What do you think bhikkhus which is more the stream of tears that you have shed as you roamed and wandered on through this long course weeping and wailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable  this or the water in the four great oceans 
As we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One venerable sir the stream of tears that we have shed as we roamed and wandered through this long course weeping and wailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable  this alone is more than the water in the four great oceans
Good good bhikkhus It is good that you understand the Dhamrna taught by me in such a way
The stream of tears that you have shed as you roamed and wandered through this long course weeping and wailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable  this alone is more than the water in the four great oceans
For a long time bhikkhus you have experienced the death of a mother as you have experienced this weeping and wailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable the stream of tears that you have shed is more than the water in the four great oceans
For a long time bhikkhus you have experienced the death of a father  the death of a brother  the death of a sister  the death of a son  the death of a daughter  the loss of relatives  the loss of wealth  loss through illness
For what reason
Because bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning  It is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations enough to become dispassionate towards them enough to be liberated from them
as you have experienced this weeping and wailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable the stream of tears that you have shed is more than the water in the four great oceans
At Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove
Then thirty bhikkhus from Pava approached the Blessed One  all forest dwellers almsfood eaters ragrobe wearers triplerobe users yet all were still with fetters Having approached they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side
Then it occurred to the Blessed One These thirty bhikkhus from Pava are all forest dwellers almsfood eaters ragrobe wearers triplerobe users yet all are still with fetters
Let me teach them the Dhamma in such a way that while they are sitting in these very seats their minds will be liberated from the taints by nonclinging
Then the Blessed One addressed those bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus 
The Blessed One said this
A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
What do you think bhikkhus which is more the stream of blood that you have shed when you were beheaded as you roamed and wandered on through this long coursethis or the water in the four great oceans 
As we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One venerable sir the stream of blood that we have shed when our heads were cut off as we roamed and wandered on through this long coursethis alone is more than the water in the four great oceans
Good good bhikkhus It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in such a way
The stream of blood that you have shed as you roamed and wandered on through this long course this alone is more than the water in the four great oceans
For a long time bhikkhus you have been cows and when as cows you were beheaded the stream of blood that you shed is greater than the waters in the four great oceans
For what reason
Because bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning  It is enough to be liberated from them
This is what the Blessed One said
Elated those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed Ones statement
Venerable sir  those bhikkhus replied
Bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning
highwaymen
For a long time you have been buffalo sheep goats deer chickens and pigs  For a long time you have been arrested as burglars
and adulterers and when you were beheaded the stream of blood that you shed is greater than the water in the four great oceans
And while this exposition was being spoken the minds of the thirty bhikkhus from Pava were liberated from the taints by nonclinging
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus if wanderers of other sects ask you For what purpose friends is the holy life lived under the ascetic Gotama  being asked thus you should answer them thus It is friends for the fading away of lust that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
Then bhikkhus if the wanderers of other sects ask you But friends is there a path is there a way for the fading away of lust   being asked thus you should answer them thus There is a path friends there is a way for the fading away of lust
And what bhikkhus is that path what is that way for the fading away of lust
It is tlus Noble Eightfold Path that is right view  right concentration
This is the path this is the way for the fading away of lust
Being asked thus bhikkhus you should answer those wanderers of other sects in such a way
Bhikkhus if wanderers of other sects ask you For what purpose friends is the holy lifelived under the ascetic Gotama   being asked thus you should answer them thus It is friendsfor the abandoning of the fetters  for the uprooting of the underlying tendencies  for the full understanding of the course  for the destruction of the taints  for the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation  for the sake of knowledge and vision   that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One Then bhikkhus if the wanderers of other sects ask you But fiends is there a path is there a way for for the sake of knowledge and vision   being asked thus you should answer them thus There is a path friends there is a way for for the sake of knowledge and vision And what bhikkhus is that path what is that way for for the sake of knowledge and vision It is this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view  right concentration This is the path this is the way for the sake of knowledge and vision Being asked thus bhikkhus you should answer those wanderers of other sects in such a way
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus if wanderers of other sects ask you For what purpose friends is the holy life lived under the ascetic Gotama  being asked thus you should answer them thus It is friendsfor the sake of final Nibbana without clinging that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
Then bhikkhus if the wanderers of other sects ask you But friends is there a path is there a way for the sake of final Nibbana without clinging    being asked thus you should answer them thus There is a path friends there is a way for the sake of final Nibbana without clinging
And what bhikkhus is that path what is that way for the sake of final Nibbana without clinging 
It is thus Noble Eightfold Path that is right view  right concentration
This is the path this is the way for the sake of final Nibbana without clinging
Being asked thus bhikkhus you should answer those wanderers of other sects in such a way 
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans where there was a town of the Sakyans named Nagaraka
Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One
Having approached he paid homage to the Blessed One sat down to one side and said to him Venerable sir this is half of the holy lifethat is good friendship good companionship good comradeship
Not so Ananda Not so Ananda
This is the entire holy life Ananda that is good friendship good companionship good comradeship
And how Ananda does a bhikkhu who has a good friend a good companion a good comrade develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path
Here Ananda a bhikkhu develops right view which is based upon seclusion dispassion and cessation maturing in release He develops right intention  right speech  right action  right livelihood  right effort right mindfulness  right concentration which is based upon seclusion dispassion and cessation maturing in release
It is in this way Ananda that a bhikkhu who has a good friend a good companion a good comrade develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path
By this method Ananda it may be understood how the entire holy life is good friendship good companionship good comradeship
When a bhikkhu has a good friend a good companion a good comrade it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path
By the following method too Ananda it may be understood how the entire holy life is good friendship good companionship good comradeship
by relying upon me as a good friend Ananda beings subject to birth are freed from birth beings subject to aging are freed from aging beings subject to death are freed from death beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair are freed from sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair
Bhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when undeveloped is so unwieldy as the mind
An undeveloped mind is unwieldy
Bhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when developed is so wieldy as the mind
A developed mind is wieldy
Bhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when undeveloped leads to such great harm as the mind
An undeveloped mind leads to great harm
Bhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when developed leads to such great good as the mind
A developed mind leads to great good
Bhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when undeveloped and unmanifested leads to such great harm as the mind
The mind when undeveloped and unmanifested leads to great harm
Bhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when developed and manifested leads to such great good as the mind
The mind when developed and manifested leads to great good
Bhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when undeveloped and uncultivated leads to such great harm as the mind
The mind when undeveloped and uncultivated leads to great harm
Bhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when developed and cultivated leads to such great good as the mind
The mind when developed and cultivated leads to great good
Bhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when undeveloped and uncultivated brings such suffering as the mind
The mind when undeveloped and uncultivated brings suffering
Bhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when developed and cultivated brings such happiness as the mind
The mind when developed and cultivated brings happiness
On one occasion the Venerable Ananda was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas Park
There the Venerable Ananda addressed the bhikkhus Friends bhikkhus 
Friend those bhikkhus replied
Friends whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni has declared the attainment of arahantship in my presence has done so by these four paths or by a certain one among them
What four
Here a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by serenity
As he is developing insight preceded by serenity the path is generated
He pursues this path develops it and cultivates it
As he is pursuing developing and cultivating this path the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted
Again a bhikkhu develops serenity preceded by insight
As he is developing serenity preceded by insight the path is generated
He pursues this path develops it and cultivates it
As he is pursuing developing and cultivating this path the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted
Again a bhikkhu develops serenity and insight in conjunction
As he is developing serenity and insight in conjunction the path is generated
He pursues this path develops it and cultivates it
As he is pursuing developing and cultivating this path the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted
Again a bhikkhus mind is seized by restlessness about the Dhamma
But there comes an occasion when his mind becomes internally steady composed unified and concentrated
Then the path is generated in him
He pursues this path develops it and cultivates it
As he is pursuing developing and cultivating this path the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted
Whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni friends has declared the attainment of arahantship in my presence has done so by these four paths or by a certain one among them
The Venerable Ananda said this
Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world
Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world
What four
Here some person gains internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
Some other person gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind
Still another gains neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
And still another gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
Bhikkhus the person among these who gains internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomen a should base himself on internal serenity of mind and make an effort to gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
Then some time later he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
The person who gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind should base himself on the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and make an effort to gain internal serenity of mind
Then sometime later he gains both the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and internal serenity of mind
The person who gainsneither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena should put forth extraordinary desire effort zeal enthusiasm indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesom equalities
Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire effort zeal enthusiasm  indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to extinguish the fire on his clothes or head so that person should put forth extraordinary desire effort zeal enthusiasm  indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesome qualities
Then some time later he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
The person who gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena should base him self on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints
These bhikkhus are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world
What four
Here bhikkhus some person gains internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
Some other person gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind
Still another gains neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
And still another gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
Bhikkhus the person among these who gains internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena should approach one who gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and inquiry of him How friend should conditioned phenomena be seen
How should conditioned phenomena be explored
How should conditioned phenomena be discerned by insight 
The other then answers him as he has seen and understood the matter thus Conditioned phenomena should be seen in such a way explored in such a way discerned by insight in such a way
Then some time later he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
The person who gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind should approach one who gains internal serenity of mind and inquire of him How friend should the mind be steadied
How should the mind be composed
How should the mind be unified
How should the mind be concentrated
The other then answers him as he has seen and understood the matter thus The mind should be steadied in such a way composed in such a way unified in such a way concentrated in such a way
Then some time later he gains both the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and internal serenity of mind
The person who gains neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena should approach one who gains both and inquire of him How friend should the mind be steadied
How should the mind be composed
How should the mind be unified
How should the mind be concentrated
How should conditioned phenomena be seen
How should conditioned phenomena be explored
How should conditioned phenomena be discerned by insight 
The other then answers him as he has seen and Understood the matter thus The mind should be steadied in such a way composed in such a way unified in such a way concentrated in such a way Conditioned phenomena should be seen in such a way explored in such a way discerned by insight in such a way
Then some time later he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena
The person who gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort for the destruction of the taints
These bhikkhus are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world
At Savatthi
Then the brahmin Sangarava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one
side and said to the Blessed One
Master Gotama what is the cause and reason why sometimes even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
What is the cause and reason why sometimes those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited  Brahmin when one dwells with a mind obsessed by sensual lust overwhelmed by sensual lust and one does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lustll on that occasion one neither knows nor sees as it really is ones own good or the good of others or the good of both
Then even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
Suppose brahmin there is a bowl of water mixed with lac turmeric blue dye or crimson dye
If a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it he would neither bow nor see it as it really is
So too brahmin when one dwells with a mind obsessed by sensual lust   on that occasion even those hymns that have been recited over a long perid not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
Again brahmin when one dwells with a mind obsessed by ill will overwhelmed by ill will and one does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen ill will on that occasion one neither knows nor sees as it really is ones own good or the good of others or the good of both Then even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
Suppose brahmin there is a bowl of water being heated over a fire bubbling and boiling
If a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it he would neither know nor see it as it really is
So too brahmin when one dwells with a mind obsessed by ill will  on that occasion even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
Again brahmin when one dwells with a mind obsessed by sloth and torpor overwhelmed by sloth and torpor and one does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen sloth and torpor on that occasion one neither knows nor sees as it really is ones own good or the good of others or the good of both Then even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
Suppose brahrmn there is a bowl of water covered over with water plants and algae
If a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it he would neither know nor see it as it really is
So too brahmin when one dwells with a mind obsessed by sloth and torpor  on that occasion even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
Again brahmin when one dwells with a mind obsessed by restlessness and remorse overwhelmed by restlessness and remorse and one does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen restlessness and remorse on that occasion one neither knows nor sees as it really is ones own good or the good of others or the good of both Then even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
Suppose brahmin there is a bowl of water stirred by the wind rippling swirling churned into wavelets
If a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it he would neither know nor see it as it really is
So too brahmin when one dwells with a mind obsessed by restlessness and remorse  on that occasion even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
Again brahmin when one dwells with a mind obsessed by doubt overwhelmed by doubt and one does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen doubt on that occasion one neither knows nor sees as it really is ones own good or the good of others or the good of both Then even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
Suppose brahmin there is a bowl of water that is turbid unsettled muddy placed in the dark
If a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it he would neither know nor see it as it really is
So too brahmin when one dwells with a mind obsessed by doubt  on that occasion even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recitedThis brahmin is the cause and reason why even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recited
Brahmin when one dwells with a mind that is not obsessed by sensual lust not overwhelmed by sensual lust and one understands as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust on that occasion one knows and sees as it really is ones own good and the good of othersand the good of both
Then even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited
Suppose brahmin there is a bowl of water not mixed with lac turmeric blue dye or crimson dye
If a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it he would know and see it as it really is
So too brahmin when one dwells with a mind that is not obsessed by sensual lust  on that occasion even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited
Again brahmin when one dwells with a mind that is not obsessed by ill will  on that occasion even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited
Suppose brahmin there is a bowl of water not heated over fire not bubbling not boiling If a man with good sight were examine his own facial reflection in it he would know and see it as it really is
So too brahmin when one dwells with a mind that is not obsessed by ill will  on that occasion even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited
Again brahmin when one dwells with a mind that is not obsessed by sloth and torpor  on that occasion even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited
Suppose brahmin there is a bowl of water not covered over with water plants and algae
If a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it he would know and see it as it really is
So too brahmin when one dwells with a mind that is not obsessed by sloth and torpor  on that occasion even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited
Again brahmin when one dwells with a mind that is not obsessed by restlessness and remorse  on that occasion even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited
Suppose brahmin there is a bowl of water not stirred by the wind without ripples without swirls not churned into wavelets
If a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it he would know and see it as it really is
So too brahmin when one dwells with a mind that is not obsessed by restlessness and remorse  on that occasion even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited

Suppose brahmin there is a bowl of water that is clear serene limpid set out in the light
If a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it he would know and see as it really is
So too brahmin when one dwells with a mind that is not obsessed by doubt  on that occasion even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited
This brahmin is the cause and reason why even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind let alone those that have been recited
These seven factors of enlightenment brahmin are nonobstructions nonhindrances noncorruptions of the mind when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation
What seven
The enightenment factor of mindfulness is a nonobstruction  The enlightenment factor of equanimity is a nonobstruction
These seven factors of enlightenment are nonobstructions nonhindrances noncorruptions of the mind when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation
When this was said the brahmin Sangarava said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama  From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Bhikkhus there are gross defilements of gold soil grit and gravel
Now the soil remover or his apprentice first pours the gold into a trough and washes rinses and cleans it
When that has been removed and eliminated there still remain middlesize defilements in the gold fine grit and coarse sand
The soil remover or his apprentice washes rinses and cleans it again
When that has been removed and eliminated there still remain subtle defilements in the gold fine sand and black dust
So the soil remover or his apprentice washes rinses and cleans it again
When that has been removed and eliminated only grains of gold remain
The goldsmith or his apprentice now pours the gold into a melting pot and fans it melts it and smelts it
But even when this has been done the gold is not yet settled and the dross has not yet been entirely removed
The gold is not yet malleable wieldy and luminous but still brittle and not properly fit for work
But as the goldsmith or his apprentice continues to fan melt and smelt the gold a time comes when the gold is settled and the dross has been entirely removed so that the gold becomes malleable wieldy and luminous pliant and properly fit for work
Then whatever kind of ornament the goldsmith wishes to make from it  whether a bracelet earrings a necklace or a golden garland  he can achieve his purpose
So too bhikkhus when a bhikkhu is devoted to the higher mind there are in him gross defilements bodily verbal and mental misconduct An earnest capable bhikkhu abandons dispels terminates and obliterates them
When this has been done there remain in him middling defilements sensual thoughts thoughts of ill will and thoughts of harming An earnest capable bhikkhu abandons dispels terminates and obliterates them
When this has been done there remain in him subtle defilements thoughts about his relations thoughts about his country and thoughts about his reputation An earnest capable bhikkhu abandons dispels terminates and obliterates them
When this has been done then there remain thoughts connected with the Dhamma
That concentration is not peaceful and sublime not gained by full tranquilization not attained to unification but is reined in and checked by force fully suppressing the defilements
But bhikkhus there comes a time when his mind becomes internally steady composed unified and concentrated
That concentration is peaceful and sublime gained by full tranquilization and attained to unification it is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing the defilements
Then there being a suitable basis he is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mind
If he wishes May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency having been one may I become many having been many may I become one may I appear and vanish may I go unhindered through a wall through a rampart through a mountain as though through space may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were water may I walk on w ater with out sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged may I travel in space like a bird with my hand may I touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahma world he is capable of realizing it there being a suitable basis

There is Ananda one thing which when developed and cultivated fulfils four things and four things which when developed and cultivated fulfil seven thiigs and seven things which when developed and cultivated fulfil two thiigs
But venerable sir what is the one thing which when developed and cultivated fulfils four things and the four things which when developed and cultivated fulfil seven things and the seven things which when developed and cultivated fulfil two things 
Concentration by mindfulness of breathing Ananda is the one thing which when developed and cultivated fulfils the four establishments of mindfulness The four establishments of mindfulness when developed and cultivated fulfil the seven factors of enlightenmentThe seven factors of enlightenment when developed and cultivated fulfil true knowledge and liberation
 How Ananda is concentration by mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it fulfils the four establishments of mindfulness
Here Ananda a bhikkhu having gone to the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty hut sits down Having folded his legs crosswise straightened his body and set up mindfulness in front of him just mindful 
Whenever Ananda a bhikkhu when breathing in long knows I breathe in long   when he trains thus Tranquillizing the bodily formation I will breathe out on that occasion the bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending mindful having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world
For what reason

On one occasion the Venerable Sariputta was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then in the morning the Venerable Sariputta dressed and taking bowl and robe entered Savatthi for alms
Having plunged into the Blind Mens Grove he sat down at the foot of a tree for the days abiding
Then in the evening the Venerable Sariputta emerged from seclusion and went to Jetas Grove Anathapiqdikas Park
and said to him Friend Sariputta your faculties are serene your facial complexion is pure and bright
In what dwelling has the Venerable Sriputta spent the day 
Here friend secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states I entered and dwelt in the first jhana which is accompanied by thought and examination with rapture and happiness born of seclusion
Yet friend it did not occur to me I am attaining the first jhana or I have attained the first jhana or I have emerged from the first jhana 
It must be because Imaking minemaking and the underlying tendency to conceit have been thoroughly uprooted in the Venerable Sariputta for a long time that such thoughts did not occur to him
Then when he had walked for alms in Savatthi and had returned from the alms round after his meal he went to the Blind Mens Grove for the days abiding
The Venerable Ananda saw the Venerable Sariputta coming in the distance
At Savatthi   The Venerable Ananda saw the Venerable Sariputta coming in the distance and said to him
Friend Siiriputta your faculties are serene your complexion is pure and bright
In what dwelling has the Venerable Sariputta spent the day 
Here friend with the subsiding of thought and examination I entered and dwelt in the second jhana which has internal confidence and unification of mind is without thought and examination and has rapture and happiness born of concentration
Yet friend it did not occur to me I am attaining the second jhana or I have attained the second jhana or I have emerged from the second jhana 
It must be because Imaking minemaking and the underlying tendency to conceit have been thoroughly uprooted in the Venerable Sariputta for a long time that such thoughts did not occur to him
At Savatthi 
Here friend with the fading away as well of rapture I dwelt equanimous and mindful and clearly comprehendingI experienced happiness with the body  I entered and dwelt in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare He is equanimous mindful one who dwells happily
Yet friend it did not occur to me I am attaining the third jhana  
The Venerable Ananda saw the Venerable Sariputta coming in the distance
 Here friend with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous passing away of joy and displeasure I entered and dwelt in the fourth jhana which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purificationof mindfulness by equanimity
Yet friend it did not occur to me I am attaining the fourth jhana 
At Savatthi 
The Venerable Ananda saw the Venerable Sariputta coming in the distance
At Savatthi
The Venerable Ananda saw the Venerable Sariputta coming in the distance   Here friend with the complete transcendence of perceptions of forms with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite I entered and dwelt in the base of the infinity of space Yet friend it did not occur to me I am attaining the base of the infinity of space 
At Savatthi
 The Venerable Ananda saw the Venerable Sariputta coming in the distance  Here friend by completely transcending the base of the infinity of space aware that consciousness is infinite I entered and dwelt in the base of the infinity of consciousnessYet friend it did not occur to me I am attaining the base of the infinity of consciousness

Here friend by completely transcending the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception I entered and dwelt in the cessation of perception and feeling
Yet friend it did not occur to me I am attaining the cessation of perception and feeling or I have attained the cessation of perception and feeling or I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling
It must be because Imaking minemaking and the underlying tendency to conceit have been thoroughly uprooted in the Venerable Sariputta for a long time that such thoughts did not occur to him
At Savatthi 
The Venerable Ananda saw the Venerable Sariputta coming in the distance
On one occasion the Venerable Sariputta was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel Sanctuary
Then in the morning the Venerable Sariputta dressed and taking bowl and robe entered Rajagaha for alms Then when he had walked for alms on continuous alms round in Rajagaha he ate that almsfood leaning against a certain wall
Then the female wanderer Sucimukhi approached the Venerable Sariputta and said to him
I dont eat facing downwardssister
Then ascetic do you eat facing upwards 
I dont eat facing upwards sister
Then asceticdo you eat facing the fourquarters 
I dont eat facingthe four quarters sister
Then ascetic do you eat facingthe intermediate directions 
I dont eat facing the intermediate directions sister
When you are asked Ascetic do you eat facing downwards
Do you eat facing the intermediate directions you reply I dont eat thus sister
How then do you eat ascetic 
Sister those ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by the debased art of geomancy wrong means of livelihood these are called ascetics and brahmins who eat facing downwards
Those ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by the debased art of astrology  a wrong means of livelihood  these are called ascetics and brahmins who eat facing upwards
Those ascetic sand brahmins who earn their living by undertaking to go on errands and run messages  a wrong means of livelihood  these are called ascetics and brahmins who eat facing the four quarters
Those ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by the debased art of palmistry  a wrong means of livelihood  these are called ascetics and brahmins who eat facing the intermediate directions
Sister I do not earn my living by such wrong means of livelihood as the debased art of geomancy or the debased art of astrology or by undertaking to go on errands and run messages or by the debased art of palmistry
I seek almsfood righteously and having sought it I eat my almsfood righteously
Then the female wanderer Sucimukhi went from street to street and fromsquare to square in Rajagaha announcing The ascetics following the Sakyan son eat righteous food they eat blameless food
Give almsfood to the ascetics following the Sakyan son
Ascetic do you eat facing downwards 
Thus have I heardOnce the Lord was staying at Ujunnaya in the deerpark of Kannakatthale
Then he said Friend Gotama I have heard it said The ascetic Gotama disapproves of all austerities and censures and blames all those who lead a harsh life of selfmortification
Now are those who say this telling the truth and do they not slander the Lord Gotama with lies Do they explain the truth about his Dhamma and what pertains to it or does some fellow teacher of a different sect deserve to be blamed for this statement
We would like to see the Lord Gotama refute this charge
Kassapa those who say this are not telling the truth they slander me with lies
The situation occurs Kassapa that I see one practiser of mortification and with the divine eye which is purified beyond the sight of humans I see him arising after death at the breakingup of the body in a place of woe a baleful state a place of destruction in hell
Again I see one practiser of mortification arising after death in a good place a heavenly state
Since I can see as it is the arising the destiny the death and rearising of those ascetics how could I disapprove of all austerities and censure and blame all those who lead a harsh life of selfmortification
Kassapa there are some ascetics and Brahmins who are wise skilled practised in disputation splitters of hairs acute
who walk deverly along the paths of views
Sometimes their views accord with mine sometimes they do not
What they sometimes applaud we sometimes applaud
What they sometimes do not applaud we sometimes do not applaud
What we sometimes applaud they sometimes applaud
On approaching them I say In these things there is no agreement let us leave them aside
In these things there is agreement there let the wise take up crossquestion and criticise these matters with the teachers or with their followers saying Of those things that are unskilful and reckoned as such censurable to be refrained from unbefitting a Noble One black and reckoned as such 
who is there who has completely abandoned such things and is free from them the ascetic Gotama or some other venerable teachers
It may be that the wise say Of those things that are unskilled
In this case the wise give us the greatest share of praise
Or the wise may say Of those things that are skilled and reckoned as jsuch blameless to be practised fitting for a Noble One bright and reckoned as such
who is there who has completely mastered them  the ascetic Gotama or some other reverend teachers
Or the wise may say Of these things
Kassapa there is a path there is a course of training whereby one who has followed it will know and see for himself The ascetic Gotama speaks at the proper time what is true to the point  the Dhamma and the discipline
What is this path and this course of training
It is the Noble Eightfold Path
This is the path whereby one may know and see for oneself The ascetic Gotama speaks at the proper time what is true to the point  the Dhamma and the discipline 
At this Kassapa said to the Lord Gotama these ascetic practices of certain practisers of selfmortification are considered proper to them
a naked ascetic uses no polite restraints licks his hands does not come or stand still when requested He does not accept food offered or prepared for him or an invitation to a meal
He does not accept food out of the pot or pan nor on the threshold among the firewood or the ricepounders nor where two people are eating from a pregnant or nursing woman or from one living with a man nor from gleanings from where a dog is standing or where flies are swarmingHe eats no fish or meat and drinks no rum or spirits or fermented ricegruel
He is a onehouse man or a onepiece man a twohouse man a sevenpiece man or a sevenhouse man He exists on one two or seven little offerings eats only once a day once in two days once in seven days
He takes to eating rice only twice a month
These are considered proper practices
Or a man becomes a herbeater a milleteater a rawrice eater a wildriceeater an eater of waterplants of ricehusk powder of ricescum of the flowers of oilseeds grass or cow dung of forest roots and fruits eating windfalls
He wears coarse hemp or mixed material shrouds from corpses rags from the dustheap garments of barkfibre antelope skins grass bark shavings blankets of human hair or horsehair the wings of owls He is a pluckerout of hair and beard devoted to this practice he is a coveredthom man making his bed on them sleeping alone in a garment of wet mud living in the open air accepting whatever seat is offered living on filth and addicted to the practice one who drinks no water and is addicted to the practice or he dwells intent on the practice of going to bathe three times before evening 
but if his morality his heart and his wisdom are not developed and brought to realisation
But Kassapa when a monk develops nonenmity nonillwill and a heart full of lovingkindness and abandoning the corruptions realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom having realised it in this very life by his own insight
then Kassapa that monk is termed an ascetic and a Brahmin
At this Kassapa said to the Lord Reverend Gotama it is hard to be an ascetic it is hard to be a Brahmin
So they say in the world Kassapa It is hard to be an ascetic it is hard to be a Brahmin
But Kassapa because there is a very different kind of asceticism beside this therefore it is right to say It is hard to be an ascetic it is hard to be a Brahmin
But Kassapa when a monk develops nonenmity nonillwill and a heart full of loving kindness 
At this Kaseapa said to the Lord Reverend Gotama it is hard to understand an ascetic it is hard to understand a Brahmin
So they say in the world Kassapa It is hard to understand an ascetic it is hard to understand a Brahmin
If a naked ascetic were to do all these things
But Kassapa because there is a very different kind of asceticism and Brahmanism beside this it is right to say It is hard to understand an ascetic or a Brahmin
But Kassapa when a monk develops nonenmity nonillwill and a heart full of lovingkindness and abandoning the corruptions realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom having realised it in this very life by his own insight
Then Kassapa said to the Lord Reverend Gotama what then is the development of morality of the heart and of wisdom 
Kassapa a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fully enlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed He having realised it by his own superknowledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and people He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fully perfected and purified holy life A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities 
and attains the four jhanas 
That is the perfection of the heart
He attains various insights and the cessation of the corruptions 
That is the perfection of wisdom
Kassapa there are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach morality
They praise morality in various ways
But as regards the highest Ariyan morality Kassapa I do not see any who have surpassed me in this
I am supreme in this regard in supermorality
There are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach selfmortification and scrupulous austerity
But as regards the highest Ariyan selfmortification and austerity Kassapa I do not see any who have surpassed me in this
I am supreme in this regard in superausterity
There are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach wisdom
They praise wisdom in various ways
But as regards the highest Ariyan wisdom Kassapa I do not see any who have surpassed me in this
I am supreme in this regard in superwisdom
There are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach liberation
They praise liberation in various ways
But as regards the highest Ariyan liberation Kassapa I do not see any who have surpassed me in this
I am supreme in this regard in superliberation
Kassapa it may be that wanderers of other sects will say The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar but only in empty places not in company
They should be told that this is not true
Or they may say The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar and in company but he does so without confidence
They should be told that this is not true
Or they may say The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar and in company and confidently but they do not question himThey should be told that this is not true The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roarand they question himOr they may say and they question him but he does not answer  Or they may say  he answers but he does not win them over with his answersOr they may say but they dont find it pleasingOr they may say but they are not satisfied with what they have heard  Or they may say  but they dont behave as if they were satisfied  Or they may say  but they are not on the path of truth Or they may say but they are not satisfied with the practice
They should be told that this is not true
Once Kassapa I was staying at Rajagaha at the Vultures Peak
Lord who on hearing Dhamma from you would fail to be delighted beyond all measure
I am delighted beyond all measure
Excellent Lord excellent
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
Lord may I receive the goingforth at the Lords hands may I receive ordination
Kassapa whoever has formerly belonged to another sect and wishes for the goingforth or ordination in this Dhamma and discipline must wait four months and at the end of four months probation the monks who are established in mind will give him the goingforth and the monastic ordination
But there can be a distinction of persons in this
Lord if such is the case
Then Kassapa received the goingforth from the Lord himself and the monastic ordination
And the newlyordained Venerable Kassapa alone secluded unwearying zealous and resolute in a short time attained that for which young men of good birth go forth from the household life into homelessness that unexcelled culmination of the holy life having realised it here and now by his own superknowledge and dwelt therein knowing
