forever and everMendicant there is no form at all thats permanent everlasting eternal imperishable and will last forever and everTheres no feeling perception consciousness at all thats permanent

everlasting eternal imperishable and will last forever and everIf there were this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering would not be foundBut since there isnt this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering is foundOnce upon a time I was an anointed aristocratic kingI had  cities with the capital Kusāvatī the foremostI had  palaces with the palace named Principle the foremostI had  chambers with the great foyer the foremostI had  couches made of ivory or heartwood or gold or silver spread with woolen coversshagpiled or embroidered with

named Sabbath the foremostI had  horses with gold adornments and banners covered with gold netting with the royal steed named Thundercloud the foremostI had  chariots with gold adornments and banners covered with gold netting with the chariot named Triumph the foremostI had  jewels with the jeweltreasure the foremostI had  women with Queen Subhaddā the foremostI had  aristocrat vassals with the

in the Banyan Tree MonasteryThen the Buddha having dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha for some reason robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Kapilavatthu for almsHe wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Great Woodplunged deep into it and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the days meditationThen as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mindIve sent the mendicant Saṅgha awayBut there are mendicants here who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and trainingNot seeing me they may change and fall apartIf a young calf doesnt see its mother it may change and fall apart Or if young seedlings dont get water they may change and fall apartIn the same way there are mendicants here who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and trainingNot seeing me they may change and fall apartWhy dont I support the mendicant Saṅgha now as I did in the pastThen Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the BuddhaHe arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and saidThats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy OneThe Buddha has sent the mendicant Saṅgha awayBut there are mendicants who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and training May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant SaṅghaMay the Buddha welcome the mendicant SaṅghaMay the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the pastThe Buddha consented in silenceThen Brahmā Sahampati knowing that the Buddha had consented bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before vanishing right thereThen in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery where he sat on the seat spread outThen he used his psychic power to will that the mendicants would come to him timidly alone or in pairsThose mendicants approached the Buddha timidly bowed and sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to themMendicants this relying on alms is an extreme lifestyleThe world curses you You beggar walking bowl in handYet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reasonNot because theyve been forced to by kings or bandits or because theyre in debt or threatened or to earn a livingBut because theyre swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Theyre swamped by suffering mired in sufferingAnd they think Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of sufferingThats how this gentleman has gone forthYet they covet sensual pleasures theyre infatuated full of ill will and malicious intent They are unmindful lacking situational awareness and immersion with straying mind and undisciplined facultiesSuppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre burning at both ends and smeared with dung in the middle It couldnt be used as timber either in the village or the wildernessI say that person is just like this Theyve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life and havent fulfilled the goal of the ascetic lifeThere are these three unskillful thoughtsSensual malicious and cruel thoughtsAnd where do these three unskillful thoughts cease without anything left overIn those who meditate with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation or who develop signless immersionJust this much is quite enough motivation to develop signless immersionWhen signless immersion is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficialThere are these two viewsViews favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existenceA noble disciple reflects on thisIs there anything in the world that I could grasp without faultThey understandTheres nothing in the world that I could grasp without faultFor in grasping I would grasp only at form feelingperceptionchoices or consciousnessThat grasping of mine would be a condition for continued existenceContinued existence is a condition for rebirthRebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressThat is how this entire mass of suffering originatesWhat do you think mendicantsIs form permanent or impermanentImpermanent sirBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSuffering sirBut if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thusThis is mine I am this this is my selfNo sirconsciousness permanent or

death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt existWhen he said this the wanderers said to himThis mendicant must be junior recently gone forth or else a foolish incompetent senior mendicantThen after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him junior and foolish the wanderers got up from their seats and leftSoon after they had left Anurādha thoughtIf those wanderers were to inquire furtherhow should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth How should I explain in line with his teaching so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticismThen Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him all that had happenedWhat do you think AnurādhaIs form permanent or impermanentImpermanent sirBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSuffering sirBut if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded

various other paths were sitting together in the debating hall and this discussion came up among themThis Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community and teaches a community Hes a wellknown and famous religious founder regarded as holy by many peopleWhen a disciple passes away he declares thatthis one is reborn here while that one is reborn thereAnd as for a disciple who is a supreme person

reached the highest point when they pass away he doesnt declare thatthis one is reborn here while that one is reborn thereRather he declares that they havecut off craving untied the fetters and by rightly comprehending conceit have made an end of sufferingI had doubt and uncertainty about thatHow on earth can I understand the ascetic Gotamas teachingVaccha no wonder youre doubting and uncertainDoubt has come up in you about an uncertain matterI describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel not for someone who doesnt grasp fuelIts like a fire which only burns with fuel not without fuelIn the same way I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel not for someone who doesnt grasp fuelBut when a flame is blown away by the wind what do you say is its fuel thenAt such a time I say that its fueled by windFor the wind is its fuel thenBut when someone who is attached has laid down this body and has not been reborn in one of the realms what does Master Gotama say is their fuel thenWhen someone who is attached has laid down this body Vaccha and has not been reborn in one of the realms I say theyre fueled by cravingFor craving is their fuel thenLinked DiscoursesThe Undeclared

BuddhaMaster Gotama does the self exist absolutelyBut when he said this the Buddha kept silentThen does the self not exist absolutelyBut for a second time the Buddha kept silentThen the wanderer Vacchagotta got up from his seat and leftAnd then not long after Vacchagotta had left Venerable nanda said to the BuddhaSir why didnt you answer Vacchagottas questionnanda when Vacchagotta asked me whether the self exists absolutely if I had answered that the self exists absolutely I would have been siding with the ascetics and brahmins who are eternalistsWhen Vacchagotta asked me whether the self does not exist absolutely if I had answered that the self does not exist absolutely I would have been siding with the ascetics and brahmins who are annihilationistsWhen Vacchagotta asked me whether the self exists absolutely if I had answered that the self exists absolutely would that have helped give rise to the knowledge thatall things are notselfNo sirWhen Vacchagotta asked me whether

exist after deathThis has not been declared by the BuddhaWell then does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after deathThis too has not been declared by the BuddhaMaster Kaccāna when asked these questions you say that this has not been declared by the BuddhaWhats the cause whats the reason why this has not been declared by the BuddhaIn order to describe him as possessing form or formless or percipient or nonpercipient or neither percipient nor nonpercipient there must be some cause or reason for doing so But if that cause and reason were to totally and utterly cease without anything left overhow could you describe him in any such termsMaster Kaccāna how long has it been since you went forthNot long reverend three yearsWell youve learned a lot already let alone what lies aheadThe Linked Discourses on undeclared questions are completeThe Book of the Aggregates is finishedLinked DiscoursesThe Undeclared PointsWith AnurādhaAt one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofNow at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hutThen several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side and said to himReverend Anurādha when a Realized One is describing a Realized Onea supreme person highest of people who has reached the highest pointthey describe them in these four waysAfter death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt existReverends when a Realized One is describing a Realized Onea supreme person highest of people who has reached the highest pointthey describe them other than these four waysAfter death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt existWhen he said this the wanderers said to himThis mendicant must be junior recently gone forth or else a foolish incompetent senior mendicantThen after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him junior and foolish the wanderers got up from their seat and leftSoon after they had left Anurādha thoughtIf those wanderers were to inquire furtherhow should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth How should I explain in line with his teaching so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticismThen Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenedWhat do you think AnurādhaIs form permanent or impermanentImpermanent sirBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSuffering sirBut if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thusThis is mine I am this this is my selfNo sirIs feeling perception consciousness permanent or impermanentImpermanent sirBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSuffering sirBut if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thusThis is mine I am this this is my selfNo sirSo Anurādha you should truly see any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfAny kind of feeling perception consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfSeeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form feeling perception choices and consciousnessBeing disillusioned desire fades away When desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceWhat do you think AnurādhaDo you regard the Realized One as formNo sirDo you regard the Realized One as feeling perception consciousnessNo sirWhat do you think AnurādhaDo you regard the Realized One as in formNo sirOr do you regard the Realized One as distinct from formNo sirDo you regard the Realized One as in feeling or distinct from feeling as in perception or distinct from perception as in choices or distinct from choices as in consciousness or as distinct from consciousnessNo sirWhat do you think AnurādhaDo you regard the Realized One as possessing form feeling perception choices and consciousnessNo sirWhat do you think AnurādhaDo you regard the Realized One as one who is without form feeling perception choices and consciousnessNo sirIn that case Anurādha since you dont acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life is it appropriate to declareReverends when a Realized One is describing a Realized Onea supreme person highest of people who has reached the highest pointthey describe them other than these four waysAfter death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt existNo sirGood good AnurādhaIn the past as today

brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insightOne teacher had this doctrine and viewThere is meaning in giving sacrifice and offerings There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds There is an afterlife There are duties to mother and father There are beings reborn spontaneously And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insightOne teacher had this doctrine and viewNothing bad is done by the doer when they punish mutilate torture aggrieve oppress intimidate or when they encourage others to do the same Nothing bad is done when they kill steal break into houses plunder wealth steal from isolated buildings commit highway robbery commit adultery and lieIf you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razoredged chakram no evil comes of that and no outcome of evilIf you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing mutilating and torturing and encouraging others to do the same no evil comes of that and no outcome of evilIf you were to go along the north bank

one whose resort is among widows or he comes to be one whose resort is among grown girls or he comes to be one whose resort is among eunuchs or he comes to be one whose resort is among nunsThus too monks does a former member of another sect become one who failsAnd again monks a former member of another sect in regard to those various things which have to be done by his fellows in the Brahmafaring comes to be not dexterous therein not vigorous not possessed of consideration for those kinds of things not able to act himself not able to direct Thus too monks does a former member of another sect become one who failsAnd again monks a former member of another sect comes to be one who is not of keen desire as to the recitation as to the interrogation as to the higher morality the higher thought the higher wisdomThus too monks does a former member of another sect become one who failsAnd again monks a former member of another sect becomes angry displeased dissatisfied if dispraise is being spoken of the teacher the views the approval the persuasion the creed of that fold of a sect from which he has come over he becomes pleased elated satisfied if dispraise is being spoken of the awakened one or of dhamma or of the Orderor else he becomes pleased elated satisfied if praise is being spoken of the teacher the views the approval the persuasion the creed of that fold of a sect from which he has come over he becomes angry displeased dissatisfied if praise is being spoken of the awakened one or of dhamma or of the OrderThis monks is the knitting together in regard to what may be the failure of a former member of another sectIt is thus monks that a former member of another sect becomes one who failsTherefore monks if there come a former member of another sect who has failed he should not be ordainedThis pair of things stated in combination as internal and external cannot be found in the form of an object at one time simultaneously It is not possible to objectify together is the meaningFor the purpose of reaching the knowledge of bodycontemplation to the highest extent is the meaning of To the extent necessary for just knowledgeWith these words is stated the direct opposition of this meditation to the laying hold on craving and wrong viewsIn the same way he sees the arising of the aggregate of materiality through the origination of craving karma and food in the sense of the origin of conditions and also while seeing the sign of birth nibbatti lakkhana passanto pi He sees the passing away of the aggregate while thinking that the dissolution of materiality comes to be through the dissolution of ignorance in the sense of the dissolution of conditions and through the dissolution of craving karma and food in the same way and while seeing the sign of vicissitude viparinamalakkhanaWhy is the Arousing of Mindfulness intended by the word way Are there not many other factors of the way namely understanding thinking speech action livelihood effort and concentration besides mindfulnessTo be sure there are But all these are implied when the Arousing of Mindfulness is mentioned because these factors exist in union with mindfulnessKnowledge energy and the like are mentioned in the analytically expository portion niddese In the synopsis uddese however the consideration should be regarded as that of mindfulness alone by way of the mental disposition of those capable of being trainedAnd in order to elaborate just that and to show of which path or way the instruction in our Discourse is the preliminary part he further quoted the following also from the Patisambhida MaggaFor the hearers savaka namely the disciples of the Buddha there is no attainment of the Noble Path Ariya Magga possible except by practicing the subject of meditation kammatthana of the Four Truths Catu SaccaSpiritual development usually called meditation is the development of wisdom pañña bhavanaJust the contemplation of material form  of feeling consciousness or mental objects constitutes the cultivation of the Arousing of MindfulnessBecause he was in the habit of carrying a yellow pennon about his body also because he adorned himself with that pennon when taking part in wrestling matches he was wellknown as Pitamalla the yellow wrestlerThree kingdoms  Pandu Cola GolaHe came to Tambapanni Isle  Ceylon  having got

path of insight takes to the contemplation of subtle consciousness and mental object these have been spoken of as the Path to Purity for the man dullwitted or keenwitted pursuing insightThe keenwitted man pursuing the path of quietude lays hold of the gross subject of meditation but he does not stay in that He lays hold of feeling the subtle subject of meditation by way of the factors of absorption jhana after attaining to and emerging from the absorption reached with the material body as subjectBecause he does not continue to stay in the coarseConsciousness and mental objects are decisive factors of craving as well as of theorizing And body and feeling are decisive factors of theorizing as well as of craving Yet to point out that which is stronger in body and feeling namely craving and that which is stronger in consciousness and mental objects namely theorizing distinctions have been drawnDrawing distinctions it is said Body and feeling are the cause of zest assadassa karana For the rejection of that zest of body by the dullwitted manda man of the craving type tanhacarita the seeing dassana of the ugly asubha in the body the coarse object olarika arammana which is the basis of craving tanha vatthu is convenient To that type of man the contemplation on corporeality the First Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity Visuddhi Magga For the abandoning of that zest by the keenwitted tikha man of the craving type the seeing of suffering in feeling the subtle object sukhuma arammana which is the basis of craving is convenient and for him the contemplation on feeling the Second Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity For the dullwitted man of the theorizing type ditthi carita it is convenient to see consciousness citta in the fairly simple way it is set forth in

PurityFurther these Four Arousings of Mindfulness were taught not only for the purpose of casting out the four illusions but for getting rid of the four floods bonds outflowings knots clingings wrong courses and the penetration of fourfold nutriment too This is according to the method of exegesis in the NettipakaranaBy way of remembering by way of the reflection of actions of skill and so forth of body speech and thoughtThe meeting in the one Nibbana of the various Arousings of Mindfulness is called the meeting in the one thing on account of participation in that one Nibbana or on account of their becoming all of a kindOn account of the cause or on account of the sameness of entry into the one Nibbana the Arousing of Mindfulness is said to be just one thingWhat he sees  What man or woman he seesWhy is there no seeing of man or a woman with the eyeThere is I see a woman I see a man  these statements refer to what he sees by way of ordinary perceptionThat perception owing to wrong comprehension does not get at the sensebasis rupayatana in the highest sense philosophically through the falsely determined condition of material form viparita gahavasena miccha parikappita rupattaOr the meaning is the absence of perception which is called the seeing of primary and derived materiality beginning with things such as the hair of the head owing to noncognizability of the collective nature of an object like a man or woman by eyeconsciousness kesadibhutupadaya samuhasankhatam ditthi na hoti acakkhuviññana viññeyyattaWhat is seen that he does not properly see  He does not see

applied to the abandoning of defilements here it is also applicable to right view  thought speech action livelihood mindfulness and concentration As ardour atapa like glow atappa is restricted by use to just energy generally it is said ardour is a name for energyOr because of the occurrence of energy viriya by way of instigating the associated things in the abandoning of opposing qualities that itself is ardour atapa In this place only energy viriya is referred to by atapaBy taking the word ardent atapi the Master points out the one possessed of right energy or exertion sammappadhanaClearly

and unbalanced state of mind it is desirable Or that by the help of which the other proper Factors of Enlightenment bojjhanga are capable of being developed is necessary in all circumstancesHere contemplation takes place by means of wisdom that is assisted by mindfulnessThe word feelings is repeated to limit the object by isolating it anissato vavatthanam for the analysis of the apparently compact ghana vinibbhoga and for such other purposes in order to prevent any straying from the contemplation on feelings to some other object Erratic contemplation takes place because of the connection of the other nonmaterial aggregates with feelings and because of the dependence of nonmaterial things like feelings on material form in the fiveconstituentexistence pañca vokara bhava or the sensuous plane of becoming kama bhava By the repetition of the word the limiting of the object by isolating it is shown through the pointing out of only a doer of feelingcontemplation in the property called feeling as there is no contemplating of the body or consciousness or mental objects in feeling but only the contemplating of feelingAs in this matter of feeling when a pleasurable feeling occurs there is no occurrence of the other two and when a painful feeling or a neither pleasurable nor painful feeling occurs there is no occurrence of the remaining ones so is shown the analysis of the apparently compact the absence of permanence  by the pointing out of different feelings after penetrating them severally and not having spoken of the state of feeling in a general way Through the noticing of feelings as lasting just for the measure of a moment in time the seeing of impermanence is made clear Through the same cognizance suffering and soullessness too are seenFor the analysis of the apparently compact and for such other purposes By the words And for such other purposes the following should be understoodThis yogavacara contemplates just feelings and not any other thingbecause he is not one who contemplates by way of the lovely  after the manner of a fool who sees a gem in a bubble of water which has not the quality of a gem He does not see in this foolish way even in the stable instant when he experiences a pleasant feeling Much more so does he not stray away into fanciful thinking in regard to the two remaining feelings of pain and indifference On the other hand he contemplates along the real way of impermanence soullessness and the unlovely by way of momentary dissolution lack of power to control  and the trickling of the dirt of defilement and distinctively contemplates suffering as the pain of vicissitude and of the formations or the constituents of lifeBy the passage beginning with the words To be sure in whatsoever way the commentator points to the limit of the object In the way mentioned above should the repetition of words in the contemplation of consciousness and mental objects be explained tooWho sees pleasure as suffering  Who sees feelings by way of the suffering natural to change with the eye of wisdomWho sees pain as a thorn  Who sees painful feeling as damage causing piercing in and as a thing hard to drive outThe neutral peace  The feeling of indifference is peaceful owing to the absence of grossness as in states of pain and pleasure and by way of a restful natureWho sees feelings with the thought that they are impermanent by reason of their becoming nonexistent after having come to be owing to their being characterised by the qualities of arising and passing away owing to their temporariness and owing to their being in a state of constant negationis he who sees the neutral peace of the neither pleasurable nor painful feelings as fleeting and is indeed the bhikkhu who will rightly know and live

bare nonoccurrence of the defilements lokiya bhavanaya sabbattha appavatt mattam sandhaya vuttamIt is right to say that by the Path are the defilements abandonedThe abandoning of the defilements of one object in the thoughtunit of the Path is indeed the abandoning of the defilements of all objectsOr it should be understood thus It is stated in this manner in order to indicate that the abandoning of the defilements in one object implies the abandoning of the defilements in the remaining objectsThe abandoning of the defilements of one person is not necessarily the abandonding of the defilements of another person nahi ekassa pahinam tato aññassa pahinam nama hoti Reference to the different types of persons is made to point this fact of possible difference of method by way of objectThe diversity of the thoughtunit The mundane thoughtunit is meantWhat is abandoned temporarily by mundane meditation in the body is not suppressed in the feelings and the other objectsEven if covetousness and grief should not occur in the feelings and the other objects when it is suppressed in the body it should not be stated that owing to efficient rejection by meditation opposed to covetousness and grief there is no covetousness and grief in the other objects such as feelings and in the case of suppression by meditation therefore it is fit to speak of the rejection of covetousness and grief again in feelings and the other objectsas the preliminary path is dealt with hereThe person producing bodycontemplation in all modes As sects outside the Buddhas Dispensation also produce a part of this contemplation by their words the Buddhas disciples complete knowledge or allround grasp of this contemplation when it is practiced by him is toldbecause of the pointing out by him of the suitable abode for yogisbecause like the leopard he lives alone in the forest and accomplishes his aim by overcoming those contrary to him namely the passionsBy way of the practice of quietude samatha bhavana

mind moves repeatedly back and forth Or the time when the meditation proceeds incessantly in the internal and external phenomenaThis pair of things stated in combination as internal and external

reflex image patibhaga nimittaThe worker in respiration examines the respiration while devoting himself to the development of insight through the means of corporealityThe basis namely the coarse body is where the mind and mental characteristics occurBesides these phenomena there is neither a living being nor a person refers to vision that is purified Mindandbody is a bare impersonal process It is

knowledge of the characteristic qualities of moving onFrom the sort of mere awareness denoted by reference to canines and the like proceeds the idea of a soul the perverted perception with the belief that there is a doer and an experiencerOne who does not uproot or remove that wrong perception owing to nonopposition to that perception and to absence of contemplative practice cannot be called one

oscillation born of mental activity were spoken by the commentatorThere mental activity and the diffusion and agitation in the process of oscillation which is mental activity  diffusion of the process of mental activityThe commentator by mentioning mental activity eschews the diffusion of the process of oscillation connected with inanimate things and by the mention of the diffusion of the process of oscillation eschews the class of mental activity producing volitional verbalexpression By the terms mental activity and the process of oscillation the commentator makes clear bodily expressionProduces the process of oscillation Brings about the group of materiality with the quality of oscillation in excessThe process of oscillation produces expression This was said concerning the process of oscillation arisen from the thought of going This process is a condition to the supporting with energy the bearing up and the movement of the conascent body of materiality Expression is that change which takes place together with the intentionOscillation is mentioned by way of a predominant condition adhika bhava and not by way of production through oscillation alone Otherwise the

phenomena be wrongly considered as things of equal duration then there would be contradiction with such commentarial sayings as Material form is slowchanging is tardy as regards ceasing and with such textual sayings as I do not see a single thing so swiftly changing o bhikkhus as this mindSince the nature of mind and mental characteristics citta cetasika is to cognize or to have objects mind and

paccayocaloricity and oscillation are in preponderance by reason of capability in the action of upraisingRaising up is the lifting of a foot from a place already stepped on to Stretching out is the carrying of a foot to the front from the place on which one is standing Shifting away is the carrying of a foot sidewards for the purpose of avoiding stake and the like or for avoiding contact with the other foot already set on the ground Or stretching out is the carrying of a foot to the place where the other foot is set and shifting away is the carrying of a foot further to a point beyond the place on which the other foot isSince the process of oscillation with caloricity coming behind it tejo dhatuya anugata vayo dhatu is the condition for stretching out and shifting away atiharana vitiharananam paccayooscillation and caloricity are in preponderance by reason of capability in stretching out and shifting away Oscillation is naturally active and because in the actions of stretching out and shifting away its movement is excessive caloricity is subordinate to oscillation in these actions The other two processes are low in stretching out and shifting away because of the incapacity of these processes to stretch out and to shift awaySince the process of cohesion with extension coming behind it pathavi dhatuya anugata apodhatu is the condition for dropping down vossajjane paccayocohesion and extension are in preponderance by reason of capability in the action of dropping down The nature of cohesion is most gravid and so in the laying down of an upraised foot extension is subordinate to cohesion Because of their incapacity to drop down what is upraised the processes of caloricity and oscillation are called low in this connectionSince the process of extension with cohesion coming behind it apodhatuya anugata pathavidhatu is the condition for the keeping on the ground extension and cohesion are in preponderance by reason of capability in the keeping on the ground In keeping the foot on the ground too as in the state of something fixed cohesion is subordinate to extension owing to the excessive functioning of the latter process Cohesion is subordinate to extension also by way of the contactual action of the process of extension in pressing the foot against the groundWhen the venerable elder Nanda was working for insight he slid into an unfavorable state of mind beginning with boredom in regard to the holy life and on becoming aware of that state of mind of his he stirred himself saying I shall restrain myself well Then having become energetic and very conscientious regarding guardedness at the doors of the controlling faculties of sense he reached the state of one of great perfection in selfrestraint through the fulfillment of all duties By reason of that perfection the Master placed him in the position of preeminence in regard to the controlling faculty of restraint with the words This one namely Nanda O bhikkhus is the chief among my disciples endowed with the controlling faculty of restraintThe passage beginning with the words Within it is said there certainly is no self or soul is stated to explain that looking straight on or looking away from the front is to be sure just a variety of occurrence of even bare phenomena and that therefore clear comprehension of nondelusion is the knowing of that fact as it really isThere two or three sittings  two or three sitting turns dve tayo nisajjavare Warming up is said concerning the matter of causing warmth to be taken up twice or thrice dve tini unhapanani sandhaya vuttamThe interpreting of rise and fall must be done on a state that is present according to continuity or present according to instant but not on one that is past or future which is why of present states is saidBut that is hard to discern at the start so the interpreting by insight should be done by means of presence according to continuityPresent materiality is called born materiality it is included in the trio of instants of arising presence and dissolution is what is meantAlthough states possessed of aginganddeath are mentioned under the heading of birth and of aging anddeath in comprehension by groups etc nevertheless here in the description of knowledge of rise and fall if it were said present birth is born the characteristic of its generation is rise the characteristic of its change is fall etc it would be tantamount to an affirmation and approval of the proposition that birth and aginganddeath were possessed of birth and of aginganddeath So the text ends with becoming in order to avoid thatWith the seeing of rise and fall not only the characteristics of impermanence and pain become evident but also the characteristics in other words the individual essences of earth contact etc termed hardness touching etc respectively become clearly evident and discrete in their individual essencesThe inclusion of only rise and fall here is because this kind of knowledge occurs as seeing only rise and fall not because of nonexistence of the instant of presenceSignless being secluded from the sign of the five aggregates it is taken as having no graspable entity Nutriment is edible nutrimentSince edible nutriment is a condition its nutriment condition for this body it follows that edible nutriment is a condition fortifying the physical sense bases such as the eye that originate through kammaAlthough the streamenterer etc understand these as they really are the teaching is concluded with its culmination in arahatship in order to show the supremacy of the arahats understandingAnd by the above passage of the sutta the Exalted One shows the liberating character of the Dhamma together with the Saṅghas practice of the good pathFor when the commentary after asking Who understandsreplies The cankerfree arahat etc the Bhikkhu Saṅgha is shownAtthajāla is the Net of Meaning because it is perfect in meaningDhammajāla is the Net of the Dhamma because it is perfect in phrasing and because it expounds blameless dhammas such as virtue etcBrahmajāla is the Supreme Net because it analyzes the paths fruits and nibbāna which are called Brahma in the sense of supremeDiṭṭhijāla is the Net of Views because it demonstrates right view by elucidating emptiness through the refutation of wrong viewsAnd it is the Incomparable Victory in Battle because it provides the means for crushing the doctrines of the sectariansIt shook at the great renunciation through the power of energy the bodhisattva displayed in relinquishing the glory of a worldruling monarch At the approaching of the terrace of enlightenment it shook through the power of his energy endowed with four factorsIn the case of washing the dustrags some say it shook through the splendor of merit but the impact of wonder appears to apply here also In the ease of the Vessantara Jātaka it shook numerous times through the splendor of the merit acquired m the fulfillment of the pāramīsIn the teaching of the Brahmajāla it shook as a sign of applause as it did with the setting in motion of the Wheel of the Dhammaand at the time of the councils etcThe strength of the condition feeling sometimes arises without the eyebase etc and without some of its concomitant dhammas but it can never arise without contact thus contact is a strong cause for feelingThe succession of conditions  this teaching is undertaken in order to elicit the succession of conditions thus These speculative views occur due to the agitation of craving Craving is conditioned by feeling and feeling is conditioned by contact If so what is the purpose of showing the succession of conditions The purpose is to communicate a difference in meaning thus Just as the dhamma of proclamation ie the view itself and the dhammas which condition the view arise only through their respective conditions and do not arise without them so too the dhammas about which the proclamation is madeie material form feeling etc  There is no eternal self or world at all to be found here The point is that the palpitation of craving and views ie the feeling that functions as the condition for craving which in turn functions as the cause for the view is conditioned by contactThe feeling of views is the feeling that functions as condition for the view This feeling is produced through its own conditions among which contact is the chiefFor if a sense object is within range but the act of consciousness does not contact the object the latter will not become an object condition for consciousness Thus contact is a special condition for all the concomitant dhammas Hence when the Exalted One analyzed an act of consciousness  he brought forth contact first But it is the foundation especially for feelingThough it is said in the commentary who do not know and do not see the true nature of dhammas as it really isthe theorists do not form a wrong adherence simply because they do not know the true nature of conditioned dhammasThis feeling the bait of the round  is fickle for it arises as the exhilaration of one who is pierced by the thorns of craving and views it does not persist with a steady tone like the pleasurable feeling of the noble paths and fruitsFeeling  the affective tone of experiencing which accompanies the proclamation of the view the self and the world are eternal and is experienced that viewSo too  who do now know and do not see as they really are the origin and passing away etc of that feeling on account of which in their craving for feeling they cling to such a speculative view In this way he shows that whereas the Tathāgatas through the unobstructed knowledge of their universal eye know and see this matter as it really is the theorists only misapprehend through craving and viewsThus this teaching was given in order to mark the boundaries between the two Or as an alternative explanation  having analyzed the sixtytwo speculative views according to their specific causes  the present teaching is now undertaken to show their common cause for feeling ignorance and craving are causes common to all the viewsTherein that  ie that proclamation that the self and the world are eternalis made by those who do not know and do not see as they really are the three types of feelingpleasant painful and neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingas suffering a thorn and impermanent respectively and who do not know and see all feeling without exception in terms of its origin passing away satisfaction unsatisfactoriness and escapeIn the doctrine of nonpercipient immortality the first doctrine arises through the experience of beings reborn in the nonpercipient realm The second takes perception to be the self and maintains a nonpercipient immortality on the ground that no other perception exists belonging to this self as its property The third doctrine arises when the material dhammas together with perception or all the material and immaterial dhammas together are apprehended as the self And the fourth is maintained by way of reasoningIn the second tetrad taking non percipient to signify that the materiality of the kasiṇa lacks the specific nature of perceiving the four doctrines should be understood according to the method slated in the discussion of the extensionist doctrinesIn the doctrines of neither percipient nor nonpercipient immortality the first doctrine recognizes in the ase of a being reborn in the realm of neither perception nor nonperception the existence of a subtle perception incapable of performing the decisive function of perception at death and rebirthlinking or on any occasion  The second doctrines are maintained by acknowledging the specific nature of perceiving and the subtlety of the perception according to the method stated for the doctrine of nonpercipient immortality In order to show the unreasonableness of the theorists doctrines even when reasons are offered he says No special reason need be sought for thisBecause these doctrines of percipient non percipient and neither percipient nor nonpercipient immortality all state that the self is immutable after death it is clear that they are included in eternalismQuery When formations are subject to constant cessation from moment to moment who kills and who is killed If it is said that the continuum of consciousness and its concomitants kills and is killed this answer has to be rejected For such a continuum is immaterial and because it is immaterial it is incapable of inflicting any harm by cutting breaking etc nor can it he harmed itself If it is said that killing and being killed apply to the material continuum this alternative too must he rejected For the material continuum is devoid of consciousness like a block of wood and so the destruction of life by cutting etc can no more apply to the body than to a lifeless corpse Again the means of destroying life such as striking a blow etc must apply to formations either in the past the future or the present But it is impossible that the means could apply to past or future formations since those do not exist  In the case of present formations any application of the means would he useless For the present formations due to their momentary nature are subject to complete cessation anyway and hence are already heading towards their own destruction by themselves Since therefore their destruction occurs without any extraneous cause  death would not be caused by the striking of blows or by other means Because the formations are devoid of personal initiative  to whom do the means of killing belong And who should be bound by the kamma of destroying life if due to momentariness the intention of killing breaks up at the very same time it arises and does not last up to the time of the acts completionReply The killer is the assemblage of formations conventionally called a being containing the aforementioned volition of killing That which is killed by him is the aggregation of material and immaterial dhammas that would have been capable of arising if the aforementioned means of killing had not been applied but which now continues as a bare procession conventionally termed dead deprived of vital warmth consciousness and the lifefaculty due to the application of the means of killing by the killer Or else the continuum of consciousness and its concomitants aloneAlthough the mental continuum does not itself form the actual object of the means of killing  still the notion of lifedestruction remains valid  For in the fiveconstituent existence the mental continuum occurs in dependence upon the material continuum so when an enemy applies the means of cutting off the lifefaculty to the material continuum in such a way that the successive arising of the vital material slates linked up with and supporting the correlative mental continuum is impaired then the disruption takes place  Again the destruction of life is not without a specific cause nor is the application of the means of killing useless Death is not without a specific cause because if the means of killing are applied to the present formations does occur through specific causes as explained above Therefore death is not causeless Nor are the means of destroying life void of agency  Though formations lack personal initiative nevertheless the conventional designation of agency is applicable to causes that are effective through their contiguity and are fixed in their capacity to give results adequate to themselves just as in the statements the lamp illuminates and the moon brings in the night  The act of destroying life must be recognized to pertain not only to the aggregation of consciousness and mental concomitants existing simultaneously with the intention of killing but must also be admitted to apply to the that endures by way of the continuum Just as the accomplishment of activity is seen in the case of lamps etc which likewise exist by way of continuity so too there certainly does exist one who is bound by the kamma of destroying lifeThe same method of investigation may with due alterations be applied in the ease of taking what is not given etc as wellBy the phrase lives the life of chastity abstinence from sexual intercourse is meantby the phrase he dwells remote abstinence from the seven bonds of sexuality is shownHere unchastity denotes the volition of indulgence in impure conduct reaching expression through the bodily door and occasioning sexual union But in the offence of sexual misconduct  the volition of having sexual intercourse with an inviolable person such as a girl under the care of her parents etc should be substitutedTransgression against persons of inferior moral qualities is less blameworthyBut forceful compulsion is highly blameworthy even in the ease of persons of inferior qualities If the persons transgressed against are of equal qualities and give their consent then the act is less blameworthy when the defilements and force of the effort are mild more blameworthy when they are strongFor unchastity there are two components the lustful thought of indulgence and the union of sexual organsFor sexual misconduct there are four components the inviolable person the thought of indulgence the effort to indulge and the tolerance of sexual unionSome however say that in the case of a forceful transgression there is no offence of sexual misconduct for the violated individual even though he or she tolerates the union since he or she made no effort for union prior to the act of intercourseBut others reply that so long as the lustful thought or desire for indulgence arises the lack of effort is no criterion since women generally do not make effort for indulgence  one would be led to the untenable conclusion that a woman incurs no offence of sexual misconduct even when she has already moused the lustful thought of indulgence beforehandTherefore it should be understood that four factors are mentioned as the maximum in the case of a man Otherwise there would be no offence of sexual misconduct even for a man at a time when a woman is playing the active role since the effort lor indulgence would be lacking on his partThis then is the ruling For one who engages through ones own desire there are three components the inviolable person the effort to indulge and the tolerance of union the lustful thought of indulgence being already implied by the effort to indulge For one who engages because one is forced to there are three components Because of the absence of any effort for union prior to the act there are only the inviolable person the lustful thought of indulgence and the tolerance of union But when all are mentioned without omission there are fourThere is only one means ones own personEven though an effort is made with the intention to deceive if the meaning is not understood by another the act of deceiving is incomplete thus the communication of the meaning to another is one factorWhether one at whom the slander is directed suffers division or not as long as the meaning is communicated it is sufficient  But the act reaches the level of a course of kamma only when division occursThus have I heard This is the introduction or beginning to the Brahmajāla Sutta spoken by the Venerable nanda on the occasion of the First Great Council For at the First Council after the compilation of the Vinaya Piṭaka was completed the Venerable Mahākassapa questioned the Venerable nanda about the Brahmajāla the first sutta in the first collection of the Sutta Piṭaka asking Friend nanda where was the Brahmajāla Sutta spoken  and so on When the questionnaire was finished the Venerable nanda explained everything where it was spoken the reason etc beginning with the words Thus have I heard By this he meant Thus have I heard concerning the BrahmajālaThe lions roar will be sounded in the portions of the teaching beginning These viewpoints etcThe views will be subsumed under the law of conditionality in the passage beginning With feeling as condition there arises in them craving etcThe pair of similes about Mount Sineru and the golden mallet has the purpose of showing the extreme difficulty of teaching the Brahmajala Sutta for that lies beyond the capacity of anybody other than Query What was the purpose in including the introductory narrative in the compilation of the Dhamma and Vinaya Shouldnt the collection only have included the actual words spoken by the BuddhaReply The introductory narrative serves to promote the durability nonobscuration and credibility of the discourseFor a discourse provided with an indication of the time place teacher background story and assembly endures long remains free from obscuration and is crediblelike a business contract provided with notations of the place date merchandise and conditions Therefore at the First Great Council the Venerable Mahākassapa asked about the place where the Brahmajāla Sutta was spoken etc and the Venerable Ananda the treasurer of the Dhamma recited the introduction in replyFurthermore the introduction reveals the excellence of the MasterBy showing that the Exalted One has no need for prior preparation inference or reasoning based on scripture it points to his attainment of perfect BuddhahoodFor as a perfectly enlightened Buddha he requires no previous preparation  for him there is only one authoritative source of knowledgethe movement of his unimpeded knowledge in all knowable dhammasAgain by showing that the Master has no closed fist of a teacher no stinginess in sharing the Dhamma and no favoritism towards disciples it points to his freedom from cankers For through the destruction of cankers he has eliminated all closedfistedness and rendered his activity of benefitting others fully pureThus the Masters perfect Buddhahood and complete inner purity respectively indicate his accomplishment in knowledge and in the abandonment  and point to his freedom from ignorance and craving those corruptions which corrode a teachers attainments in wisdom and virtue They further prove that he is endowed with the first two of the Tathagalas grounds of self confidence The Masters lack of any confusion in regard to states obstructive to spiritual progress and in regard to the liberating potency of his doctrine prove that he is endowed with the third and fourth grounds of selfconfidence Thus the introduction by describing the Exalted One as he who knows and sees and by exhibiting his ingenuity in creating an opportunity to deliver a discourse appropriate to the inclinations of the assembly present reveals his endowment with the four grounds of selfconfidence and his conduct for the welfare of himself and othersTherefore it is said The introduction reveals the excellence of the MasterFurthermore the introduction also reveals the excellence of the Dispensation For the Exalted One whose every deed is accompanied by knowledge and compassion does not engage in any useless activity nor in any activity directed to his own welfare alone Every deed of the perfectly enlightened Buddha is directed to the welfare of others Since this is so all the actions of the Buddha bodily verbal and mental described as they actually occurred constitute his Dispensation in the sense that they instruct other beings in their own goodin the good pertaining to the present life to the life to come and to ultimate deliverance It is not mere poetryFor along with the indication of the time place teacher story and assembly the introduction here and there shows as far as possible the conduct of the MasterOr else the introduction reveals the authoritativeness of the Dispensation by revealing the authoritativeness of the Master The Masters aulhoritativeness is indicated by the title the Exalted One  signifying his supremacy among all beings by reason of his distinguished qualities and by the epithet he who knows and sees signifying his attainment of the knowledge of the propensities and latent tendencies of others etc The above is a mere outline of the purposes served by the introductory narrativeFor who can exhaustively explain all the purposes of the introduction spoken by the treasurer of the Dhamma  who was enlightened after the Buddha himselfThe sign is the learning sign and the counterpart signor both are stated here togetherHerein the three similes beginning with cotton are properly the learning sign the rest are bothSome are certain teachersNo first point of ignorance can be discerned that is because no initial boundary exists not even my unimpeded knowledge of omniscience can discern a first boundary of ignorance of which it can be said Ignorance first arose in the time of such and such a perfectly enlightened Buddha or of such and such a worldruling monarch It did not exist before that Admittedly ignorance is said to lack an initial boundaryNevertheless though it is said to lack an initial boundary in terms of temporal determination ignorance has a specific condition that is ignorance arises with the five hindrances as its condition And therefore a first point of ignorance can be discerned in terms of the order of dhammas For it is said in the same sutta And what is the nutriment for ignorance The reply is the five hindrancesCraving for existence  craving that functions as the fetter of existence Its specific condition is ignoranceFor it is said in the sutta And what is the nutriment for craving for existence The reply is ignoranceThe view of existence the eternalist viewIts specific condition is feelingSense sphere  here there are the two kinds of sense desire  sense desire as basis and sense desire as defilement Of these sense desire as objective basis particularized as the five cords of sense desire  is desired  Sense desire as defilement which is craving desires The sense sphere is where these two operate togetherBut what is thatIt is the elevenfold sensedesire becoming ie hell asura demons ghosts animals human beings and six sensualsphere heavensSo too with the finematerial sphere and the immaterial sphere taking finematerial as craving for the finematerial too and immaterial as craving for the immaterial tooIt crosses over from the world  thus it is supramundane To the six kinds of objects all classed as limited etc past etc internal etcThe source it has come from and so on means the source it has come from and its conditionHere in the opinion of certain teachers the result of the unprompted profitable is unprompted and the result of the prompted is prompted like the movement of the faces reflection in a lookingglass when the face moves thus it is due to the source it has come fromBut in the opinion of other teachers the unprompted arises due to powerful kamma as condition and the prompted does so due to weak kamma thus it is due to its conditionWith respect to such unsublime objects as the forms of skeletons or ghostsHere kamma is storedup profitable kamma of the sense sphere that has got an opportunity to ripenSign of kamma is the gift to be given that was a condition for the volition at the moment of accumulating the kammaSign of destiny is the visibledata base located in the destiny in which he is about to be rebornhence he said that has appearedThe sign of kamma here is only the kammas own object consisting of an earth kasiṇa etcif kamma is the lifecontinuums object then it is that kamma if the sign of the kamma or the sign of the destiny then it is one of thoseWith that same objectOccurring endlessly this is in fact thus called bhavaṅga of becoming because of its occurring as the state of an aṅga of the rebirthprocess becoming The seeing of dreams is done with consciousness consisting only of the functionalA disturbance in the lifecontinuum is a wavering of the lifecontinuum consciousness the meaning is that there is the arrival at a state that is a reason for dissimilarity in its occurrence twice in that wayFor it is called disturbance because it is like a disturbance since there seems to be a cause for an occasion in the minds continuity different from the previous occasionGranted firstly that there is impact on the sensitivity owing to confrontation with an object since the necessity for that is established by the existence of the objective field and the possessor of the objective field but how does there come to be disturbance of the lifecontinuum that has a different supportBecause it is connected with itAnd here the example is this when grains of sugar are put on the surface of a drum and one of the grains of sugar is tapped a fly sitting on another grain of sugar movesNext to adverting means next to fivedoor advertingFor those who do not admit the cognitive series beginning with receiving just as they do not admit the heart basis the Pali has been handed down in various places in the way beginning For the eyeconsciousness element as receiving  for the Pali cannot be contradictedIf  vivid  this is said because it is the occurrence of consciousness at the end of the impulsions that is being discussedFor an object is here intended as vivid when its life is fourteen conscious moments and that should be understood as coming into focus when it has arisen and is two or three moments pastThis includes also the preliminarywork and the cleansing  not changeoflineage onlyThat obtains a condition any impulsion that has obtained a condition for arising next to changeoflineage as that of the finematerial sphere and so onA very vivid one is one with a life of sixteen conscious momentsFor registration consciousness arises with respect to that not with respect to any otherClear means very evident and that is only in the sense spherefor registration arises with respect to thatPrevious kamma this is said in order to show the differences in kinds of registrationfor kamma that generates rebirthlinking is not the only kind to generate registration other kinds of kamma do so tooBut the latter generates registration unlike that generatable by the kamma that generates rebirthlinkingImpulsion consciousness this is said in order to show what defines the registrationfor it is said Registration is definable by impulsion The word etc includes rebirthlinkinghowever for that is not a condition for registration that is more outstanding than itselfAny condition any condition from among the desirable objects etc that has combined to produce the arising of registrationThis should be regarded as a secondary characteristic of profitable feelingthat is to say the fact that whatever profitable feeling there is is all associated with profitable consciousness That however is not for the purpose of establishing its profitablenessFor the profitableness of profitable feeling is not due to its association with profitable consciousness but rather to wise attention and so onThat is why he said as to kindSo too in the case of the unprofitable and so onPleasure and pain respectively gratify and afflict by acting in one way on the body and in another way on the mind but not so equanimitywhich is why the latter is described as of one classJust as when a man places a piece of cotton wool on an anvil and strikes it with an iron hammer and his hammer goes right through the cotton and hits the anvil the violence of the blow is great so too because the violence of the impacts blow is great bodyconsciousness is accompanied by pleasure when the object is a desirable or desirableneutral oneand by pain when the object is an undesirable or undesirable neutral one It is the impact of primary matter on the primaries of the bodyThe characteristic of agglomerating means the characteristic of adding together then they are said to have the function of accumulating for the dhammas in the formations aggregate are so described because volition is their basisAs the act of touching too by this he shows that this is its individual essence even though it is immaterialAnd the characteristic of touching is obvious in its occurrence in such instances as say the watering of the mouth in one who sees another tasting vinegar or a ripe mango the bodily shuddering in a sympathetic person who sees another being hurt the trembling of the knees in a timid man standing on the ground when he sees a man precariously balanced on a high tree branch the loss of power of the legs in one who sees something terrifying such as a pisāca Nonadherent means not sticking On any one side means on any one side of itself like a pair of planks and so onIt is only the impact without adherence that contact shares with visible data and sound not the objective fieldJust as though eye and ear are nonadherent respectively to visible data and sounds still they have the word touched used of them so too it can be said of contacts touching and impinging on the objectContacts impinging is the actual concurrence of consciousness and objectApilāpana is the steadying of an object the remembering and not forgetting it keeping it as immovable as a stone instead of letting it go bobbing about like a pumpkin in waterAnd here by tranquilization etc of consciousness only consciousness is tranquillized and becomes light malleable wieldy proficient and uprightBut with tranquilization etc of the mental body also the material body is tranquillized and so onThis is why the twofoldness of states is given by the Blessed One here but not in all placesThe act of resolving should be understood as the act of being convinced about an object not as trusting Because the path consciousnesses have Nibbāna as their object and because compassion gladness etc have living beings as their object there is no compassion etc in the pathBecause the paralysis of consciousness comes about through stiffness but that of matter through torpor like that of the three aggregates beginning with feeling therefore torpor is manifested as nodding and sleepMere steadiness in occurrence is mere presence for a momentThat it is only mere steadiness in occurrence owing to the mere condition for the steadiness of the mind is because of lack of real steadiness due to absence of decidedness  and it is incapable of being a condition for such steadiness in continuity as the steadiness of consciousness stated thus like the steadiness of a flame sheltered from a draught Here when the time is delimited by death and rebirthlinking the term extent is applicable It is made known through the Suttas in the way beginning Was I in the past for the past state is likewise mentioned as extent in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta too in the way beginning He does not follow what is past  Bhikkhus there are three extentsthe past extent the future extent and the present extent But when it is delimited in the ultimate sense as in the Addhāniruttipatha Sutta thus then it is appropriate as delimited by momentHerein Bhikkhus of matter that is born  manifestedit is said that It exists  the existingness of the present is stated thus and pastness and futureness are respectively called before and after thatCold temperature is like with cold and hot with hotBut that temperature which falls on the body whether hot or cold and occurs as a continuity in one mode being neither less nor more is called single temperature The word single is used because of the plurality of like temperature So too with nutrimentIn one cognitive series in one impulsion refers respectively to fivedoor and minddoor consciousnessThe explanations of continuity and period are given in the Commentaries for the purpose of helping the practice of insightCause is what gives birth  condition is what consolidates Their respective functions are arousing and consolidating Just as the seeds function is to arouse the sprout and that of the earth etc is to consolidate it and just as kammas function is to arouse result as matter that is due to kamma performed and that of nutriment is to consolidate it so the function of those conditions that give birth to each material group and each thoughtarising and serve as kamma and proximityconditions etc for them and the function of those that consolidate them and serve as conascence prenascence and postnascence conditions for them may be construed accordingly as appropriateBecause there is similarity and dissimilarity in temperature etc in the way stated the pastness etc of material instances originated by it are stated according to continuity But there is no such similarity and dissimilarity in the kamma that gives birth to a single becoming so instead of stating according to continuity the pastness etc of material instances originated by that it is stated according to what consolidatesHowever when there comes to be reversal of sex then the male sex disappears owing to powerful unprofitable kamma and the female sex appears owing to weak profitable kammaand the female sex disappears owing to weak unprofitable kamma while the male sex appears owing to powerful profitable kamma  So there is in fact dissimilarity in what is originated by kamma and consequent dissimilarity in what is past etc in accordance with the continuity of these as well But it is not included because it does not happen alwaysThe feeling that accompanies the faith etc occurring in one who sees an image of the Buddha or who hears the Dhamma even for a whole day is presentBhikkhus this saṃsara is without discoverable beginningA first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingSuppose bhikkhus a dog tied up on a leash was bound to a strong post or pillarIf it walks it walks close to that post or pillar If it stands it stands close to that post or pillar If it sits down it sits down close to that post or pillar If it lies down it lies down close to that post or pillarSo too bhikkhus the uninstructed worldling regards form thus This is mine this I am this is my selfHe regards feeling  perception  volitional formations  consciousness thus This is mine this I am this is my selfIf he walks he walks close to those five aggregates subject to clinging If he stands he stands close to those five aggregates subject to clinging If he sits down he sits down close to those five aggregates subject to clinging If he lies down he lies down close to those five aggregates subject to clingingTherefore bhikkhus one should often reflect upon ones own mind thus For a long time this mind has been defiled by lust hatred and delusionThrough the defilements of the mind beings are defiled with the cleansing of the mind beings are purifiedNow at that time scruples arose in the monks as to this and that occasion thinking Now what is permitted by the Lord What is not permittedThey told this matter to the LordHe said Whatever monks has not been objected to by me saying This is not allowable if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable that is not allowable to youWhatever monks has not been objected to by me saying This is not allowable if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable that is allowable to youWhatever monks has not been permitted by me saying This is allowable if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable that is allowable to youAnd whatever monks has not been permitted by me saying This is allowable if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable that is not allowable to youThen it occurred to monks Now is during a watch of the night allowable with during a short period or it is not allowableNow is during seven days allowable with during a short period or is it not allowableNow is during life allowable with during a short period or is it not allowableNow is during seven days allowable with during a watch of the night or is it not allowableNow is during life allowable with during a watch of the night or is it not allowableNow is during life allowable with during seven days or is it not allowableThey told this matter to the LordHe said Monks during a watch of the night with during a short period is allowable at the right time on the day it is accepted it is not allowable at the wrong timeMonks during seven days with during a short period is allowable at the right time on the day it is accepted it is not allowable at the wrong timeMonks during life with during a short period is allowable at the right time on the day it is accepted it is not allowable at the wrong timeMonks during seven days with during a watch of the night is allowable in a watch of the night on the day it is accepted it is not allowable after the watch of the night is endedMonks during life with during a watch of the night is allowable in a watch of the night on the day it is accepted it is not allowable after the watch of the night is endedMonks during life with during seven days is allowable for seven days it is not allowable after the seven days are endedThen the Lord walking on tour in due course arrived at tumāThe Lord stayed there in tumā in the House with the threshingfloorThen he who had gone forth when old having had a quantity of conjey prepared towards the end of that night brought it to the Lord saying Lord may the Lord accept conjey from meNow Truthfinders ask knowing and knowing do not ask they ask knowing the right time  and they do not ask knowing the right time  Truthfinders ask about what belongs to the goal not about what does not belong to the goal there is bridgebreaking for Truthfinders in whatever does not belong to the goal Awakened ones Lords question monks concerning two matters either Shall we preach dhamma or Shall we lay down a rule of training for disciplesThen the Lord spoke thus to him who had gone forth when old Where is this conjey from monkThen he who had gone forth when old told this matter to the LordThe awakened one the Lord rebuked him saying It is not suitable foolish man it is not fitting it is not becoming it is not worthy of a recluse it is not allowable it is not to be doneFor how can you foolish man one who has gone forth cause to take what is not allowableIt is not foolish man for pleasing those who are not pleased  And having rebuked him having given reasoned talk he addressed the monks saying  Monks one who has gone forth should not make take what is not allowable Whoever should make take  there is an offence of wrongdoingNor monks should one who was formerly a barber carry about a barbers equipmentWhoever should carry it about there is an offence of wrongdoingThen the Lord having stayed in Kusinārā for as long as he found suiting set out on tour for tumā together with the large Order of monks with the twelve hundred and fifty monksNow at that time a certain  formerly a barber who had gone forth when old was living in tumāHe had two boys sweetvoiced intelligent skilled accomplished in their craft in the barbers profession their own teachersThen that who had gone forth when old heard They say that the Lord is coming to tumā together with a large Order of monks with twelve hundred and fifty monksThen that who had gone forth when old spoke thus to his boys It is said my dears that the Lord is coming to tumā together with a large Order of monks with twelve hundred and fifty monksDo you go my dears and taking a barbers equipment tour from house to house for nāti measures of offerings and collect salt and oil and husked rice and solid food and when the Lord comes we will make him a conjey drinkVery well father and these boys having answered him who had gone forth when old in assent taking a barbers equipment toured from house to house for nāti measures of offerings collecting salt and oil and husked rice and solid foodThose people who having seen these sweetvoiced intelligent boys but had not wanted to have made even they had them made and having had them made also gave muchSo these boys collected much salt and oil and husked rice and solid foodIn the sense of entirety  In the sense of the jhānas entire objectIt is not made its partial object The sign for the anchoring of mindfullness is the nosetip or upperlip which is the cause and the sign for the anchoring of mindfullness and approves of what is good if a companion exhorts others to do something good without considering the right place and time or without considering the hindrances and other undesired cor sequences arising therefrom he being aware of it approves of is Very good my dear lets do itFor the penetration of the characteristic of foulness for the observation of repulsiveness as the individual essenceHatthasaṅkhalikāthe fingers of a pair of clasped hands a row of fingers With such a person of course he attains absorption But if this bhikkhu does not rest content with just that much and wants to break down the barriers he should next after that develop lovingkindness towards a very dearly loved friend then towards a neutral person as a very dearly loved friend then towards a hostile person as neutralAnd while he does so he should make his mind malleable and wieldy in each instance before passing on to the nextSo he should first as example pervade himself with lovingkindness Next after that in order to proceed easily he can recollect such gifts kind words etc as inspire love and endearment such virtue learning etc as inspire respect and reverence met with in a teacher or his equivalent or a preceptor or his equivalent developing lovingkindness towards him in the way beginning May this good man be happy and free from sufferingAt one time the awakened one the Lord was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels feeding placeNow at that time a rainsresidence for monks had not come to be laid down by the LordSo these monks walked on tour during the cold weather and the hot weather and the rainsPeople looked down upon criticised spread it about saying How can these recluses sons of the Sakyans walk on tour during the cold weather and the hot weather and the rains trampling down the crops and grasses injuring life that is onefacultied and bringing many small creatures to destructionShall it be that those members of other sects whose rules are badly kept cling to and prepare a rainsresidenceshall it be that these birds having made their nests in the treetops cling to and prepare a rainsresidencewhile these recluses sons of the Sakyans walk on a tour during the cold weather and the hot weather and the rains trampling down the crops and grasses injuring life that is onefacultied and bringing many small creatures to destructionMonks heard these people who  spread it aboutThen these monks told this matter to the LordThen the Lord on this occasion in this connection having given reasoned talk addressed the monks saying I allow you monks to enter upon the rainsThen it occurred to these monks Now when should the rains be entered uponThey told this matter to the LordHe said I allow you monks to enter upon the rains in the rainy seasonThen it occurred to these monks Now how many are there for beginning the rainsThey told this matter to the LordHe said Monks there are these two for beginning the rains the earlier and the laterThe earlier may be entered upon the day after sāḷhī the later may be entered upon a month after sāḷhī These monks are the two for beginning the rainsNow at that time the group of six monks having entered upon the rains walked on tour during the rainsPeople  spread it about saying How can these recluses sons of the Sakyans walk on tour during the cold weather and the hot weather and the rains trampling down  as in Kd  bringing many small creatures to destructionMonks heard these people who  spread it aboutThose who were modest monks  spread it about saying How can this group of six monks having entered upon the rains walk on tour during the rainsThen these monks told this matter to the LordThen the Lord on this occasion in this connection having given reasoned talk addressed the monks saying Monks having entered upon the rains but not having kept either the first three months or the last three months one should not set out on tourWhoever should set out there is an offence of wrongdoingNow at that time the group of six monks did not want to enter upon the rainsThey told this matter to the LordHe said Monks one should not not enter upon the rainsWhoever should not enter upon  there is an offence of wrongdoingNow at that time the group of six monks on a day for beginning the rains not desiring to enter upon the rains intentionally passed a residence byThey told this matter to the LordHe said Monks on a day for beginning the rains a residence should not be intentionally passed by one who does not desire to enter upon the rainsWhoever should pass one by there is an offence of wrongdoingTen women protected by the mother protected by the father protected by the parents

she is brought back If anyone makes her his wife she is called flagbroughtThis refers to the teacher RevataIn the Sarvāstivādin school and so onThe Niddesa method is thisHere the Masters possession of vision shows the greatness of understanding and his possession of conduct the greatness of his compassionIt was through understanding that the Blessed One reached the kingdom of the Dhamma and through compassion that he became the bestower of the DhammaIt was through understanding that he felt revulsion for the round of rebirths and through compassion that he bore itIt was through understanding that he fully understood others suffering and through compassion that he undertook to counteract itIt was through understanding that he was brought face to face with Nibbāna and through compassion that he attained itIt was through understanding that he himself crossed over and through compassion that he brought others acrossIt was through understanding that he perfected the Enlightened Ones state and through compassion that he perfected the Enlightened Ones taskOr it was through compassion that he faced the round of rebirths as a Bodhisatta and through understanding that he took no delight in itLikewise it was through compassion that he practiced noncruelty to others and through understanding that he was himself fearless of othersIt was through compassion that he protected others to protect himself and through understanding that he protected himself to protect othersLikewise it was through compassion that he did not torment others and through understanding that he did not torment himselfso of the four types of persons beginning with the one who practices for his own welfare he perfected the fourth and best typeLikewise it was through compassion that he became the worlds helper and through understanding that he became his own helperIt was through compassion that he had humility as a Bodhisatta and through understanding that he had dignity as a BuddhaLikewise it was through compassion that he helped all beings as a father while owing to the understanding associated with it his mind remained detached from them all and it was through understanding that his mind remained detached from all dhammas while owing to the compassion associated with it that he was helpful to all beingsFor just as the Blessed Ones compassion was devoid of sentimental affection or sorrow so his understanding was free from the thoughts of I and mineIs not unobstructed knowledge different from omniscient knowledge  Otherwise the words Six kinds of knowledge unshared by disciples would be contradicted Note The six kinds are knowledge of what faculties prevail in beings knowledge of the inclinations and tendencies of beings knowledge of the Twin Marvel knowledge of the attainment of the great compassion omniscient knowledge and unobstructed knowledge  There is no contradiction because two ways in which a single kind of knowledges objective field occurs are described for the purpose of showing by means of this difference how it is not shared by othersIt is only one kind of knowledge but it is called omniscient knowledge because its objective field consists of formed unformed and conventional ie conceptual dhammas without remainder and it is called unobstructed knowledge because of its unrestricted access to the objective field because of absence of obstructionAnd it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā It knows all the formed and the unformed without remainder thus it is omniscient knowledge It has no obstruction therein thus it is unobstructed knowledge  and so onSo they are not different kinds of knowledge And there must be no reservationotherwise it would follow that omniscient and unobstructed knowledge had obstructions and did not make all dhammas its objectThere is not in fact a minimal obstruction to the Blessed Ones knowledge and if his unobstructed knowledge did not have all dhammas as its object there would be presence of obstruction where it did not occur and so it would not be unobstructedOr alternatively even if we suppose that they are different still it is omniscient knowledge itself that is intended as unhindered since it is that which occurs unhindered universallyAnd it is by his attainment of that that the Blessed One is known as Omniscient Allseer Fully Enlightened not because of awareness of every dhamma at once simultaneously And it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā This is a name derived from the final liberation of the Enlightened Ones the Blessed Ones together with the acquisition of omniscient knowledge at the root of the Enlightenment Tree this name Buddha is a designation based on realization For the ability in the Blessed Ones continuity to penetrate all dhammas without exception was due to his having completely attained to knowledge capable of becoming aware of all dhammasHere it may be asked But how then When this knowledge occurs does it do so with respect to every field simultaneously or successivelyFor firstly if it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field then with the simultaneous appearance of formed dhammas classed as past future and present internal and external etc and of unformed and conventional dhammas there would be no awareness of contrast  as happens in one who looks at a painted canvas from a distance That being so it follows that all dhammas become the objective field of the Blessed Ones knowledge in an undifferentiated form  as they do through the aspect of notself to those who are exercising insight thus All dhammas are notself And those do not escape this difficulty who say that the Enlightened Ones knowledge occurs with the characteristic of presence of all knowable dhammas as its objective field devoid of discriminative thinking  and universal in time and that is why they are called Allseeing and why it is said The Nāga is concentrated walking and he is concentrated standing  They do not escape the difficulty since the Blessed Ones knowledge would then have only a partial objective field because by having the characteristic of presence as its object past future and conventional dhammas which lack that characteristic would be absentSo it is wrong to say that it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective fieldThen secondly if we say that it occurs successively with respect to every objective fieldthat is wrong tooFor when the knowable classed in the many different ways according to birth place individual essence etc and direction place time etc is apprehended successively then penetration without remainder is not effected since the knowable is infiniteAnd those are wrong too who say that the Blessed One is Allseeing owing to his doing his defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning and that such knowledge is not inferential since it is free from doubtbecause it is what is doubtfully discovered that is meant by inferential knowledge in the world And they are wrongbecause there is no such defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning without making all of it actually experienced For then that rest is not actually experiencedand if it were actually experienced it would no longer be the restAll that is no argumentWhy notBecause this is not a field for ratiocinationfor the Blessed One has said this The objective field of Enlightened Ones is unthinkable it cannot be thought outThe agreed explanation here is this Whatever the Blessed One wants to knoweither entirely or partiallythere his knowledge occurs as actual experience because it does so without hindrance And it has constant concentration because of the absence of distractionanyone who tried to think it out would reap madness and frustration And it cannot occur in association with wishing of a kind that is due to absence from the objective field of something that he wants to know There can be no exception to this because of the words All dhammas are available to the adverting of the Enlightened One the Blessed One are available at his wish are available to his attention are available to his thought And the Blessed Ones knowledge that has the past and future as its objective field is entirely actual experience since it is devoid of assumption based on inference tradition or conjectureAnd yet even in that case suppose he wanted to know the whole in its entirety then would his knowledge not occur without differentiation in the whole objective field simultaneously And so there would still be no getting out of that difficultyThat is not so because of its purifiednessBecause the Enlightened Ones objective field is purified and it is unthinkableOtherwise there would be no unthinkableness in the knowledge of the Enlightened One the Blessed One if it occurred in the same way as that of ordinary peopleSo although it occurs with all dhammas as its object it nevertheless does so making those dhammas quite clearly defined as though it had a single dhamma as its object This is what is unthinkable here There is as much knowledge as there is knowablethere is as much knowable as there is knowledgethe knowledge is limited by the knowable the knowable is limited by the knowledge So he is Fully Enlightened because he has rightly and by himself discovered all dhammas together and separately simultaneously and successively according to his wishBecause of the words Also all dhammas of the three planes are sense desires in the sense of being desirable  greed for becoming is sensedesire clingingDevelopment of the recollection comes to success in him who has that not in any other Absolute confidence is the confidence afforded by the noble pathThe thirtysix modes of behaviour of craving are the three craving for sense desires for becoming and for nonbecoming in the cases of each one of the twelve internal external bases or they are those given in the KhuddakavatthuVibhaṅga  leaving out the three periods of timefor with those they come to one hundred and eightThoughts of renunciation etc in the mundane moment they are the three separately that is nongreed loving kindness and compassion they are given as one at the path moment owing to the cutting off of greed ill will and crueltyConsciousness concentration  is the road to power consisting of purity of consciousness they sayThose who hold that there is an Overlord as reason say An Overlord makes the world occur prepares it halts it disposes of itThose who hold that there is a Basic Principle as reason say The world is manifested from out of a Basic Principle  and it is reabsorbed in that againTime it is that creates beings Disposes of this generationTime watches over those who sleep To outstrip Time is hard indeed those who hold the theory of Time sayThose who hold the theory of Nature say The world appears and disappears just because of its nature  like the sharp nature of thorns like the roundness of woodapples  like the variedness of wild beasts birds snakes and so onThe word etc refers to those who preach fatalism and say The occurrence of the world is due to atoms All is due to causes effected in the past The world is determined like drilled gems threaded on an unbroken string There is no doing by a manIt is by chance that they occur By chance as well that they do notPleasure and pain are due to chance This generation lives by chance and to those who preach liberation by chanceTaking final release to be in the immaterial world like that of Rāmudaka ḷāra  etc or in a World Apex  like that of the Nigaṇṭhas And by the word etc are included also the preachers of Nibbāna here and now as the selfs establishment in its own self when it has become dissociated from the qualities owing to the nonoccurrence of the Basic Principle  and being in the same world as in the presence of or in union with BrahmāRight speech has as its individual essence the embracing of associated states through affectionateness because it is the opposite of false speech and the other kinds which being rough owing to their respective functions of deceiving etc do not embraceBodily work originates whatever has to be done And that originating is itself a combining so the abstinence called right action is said to have originating as its individual essenceOr it is the picking up of associated states which is the causing of them to be originated on the part of bodily work like the picking up of a burdenThe purification of a living being or of associated states is cleansingDhammas without condition Unformed dhammas Bhikkhus there is that base where neither earth   This state is very hard to see that is to say the stilling of all formations the relinquishing of all substance of becoming Bhikkhus I shall teach you the unformed and the way leading to the unformed  and so on and in this sutta Bhikkhus there is an unborn   Now in the ultimate sense the existingness of the Nibbānaelement has been demonstrated by the Fully Enlightened One compassionate for the whole world by many sutta passages such as these So even if the wise trust completely in the Dispensation and have no doubts though they may not yet have had direct perception of itnevertheless there are persons who come to understand through anothers guidance  and the intention here is that this logical reasoning under the heading of deduction should be for the purpose of removing their doubtsJust as it is owing to fullunderstanding that from the sense desires and from materiality etc  that have something beyond them there is made known an escape from them that is their opposite and whose individual essence is devoid of them so there must exist an escape that is the opposite of and whose individual essence is devoid of all formed dhammas all of which have the aforesaid individual essence and it is this escape that is the unformed elementBesides insight knowledge which has formed dhammas as its object and also conformity knowledge abandon the defilements with the abandoning consisting in substitution of opposites being unable to abandon them with the abandoning consisting in cutting offLikewise the kind of knowledge that has conventional truth that is concepts as its object in the first jhāna etc abandons the defilements only with the abandoning consisting in suppression not by cutting them offSo because the kind of knowledge that has formed dhammas as its object and that which has conventional truth as its object are both incapable of abandoning defilements by cutting them off there must consequently exist an object for the noblepath knowledge that effects their abandonment by cutting them off which object must be of a kind opposite to both And it is this that is the unformed element Likewise the words Bhikkhus there is an unborn an unbecome an unmade an unformed and so on which demonstrate the existingness of Nibbāna in the ultimate sense are not misleading because they are spoken by the Blessed Onelike the words All formations are impermanent all formations are painful all dhammas are not self   Likewise in certain instances as regards scope the word Nibbāna has the correct ultimate meaningJust as a lion directs his strength against the man who shot the arrow at him not against the arrow so the Buddhas deal with the cause not with the fruitBut just as dogs when struck with a clod snarl and bite the clod and do not attack the striker so the sectarians who want to make suffering cease devote themselves to mutilating the body not to causing cessation of defilementsOn coming to that  on reaching that Nibbāna by making it the objectThe question But why is it suffering means this granted firstly that birth in hell is painful since hell is unalloyed pain and that it is painful in the other unhappy destinies since it is originated by bad kamma but how is it so in the happy destinies since it is there originated by kamma that leads to blissThe answer Because it is the basis for many kinds of suffering etc shows that this birth is not called suffering because of having suffering as its individual essencefor there is no rebirthlinking associated with painful feelingbut rather because it is the foundation for sufferingSince also what does not have suffering as its individual essence is yet called suffering indirectly consequently intrinsic suffering is said particularizing what does have suffering as its individual essence just as in the case of particularizing concrete matter Sickness is not included here because no particular person is meantand there are persons in whom sickness does not arise at alllike the venerable Bakkula  otherwise it may be taken as already included by suffering itselffor in the ultimate sense sickness is bodily pain conditioned by disturbance of elementsMomentary unification of the mind concentration lasting only for a momentFor that too when it occurs uninterruptedly on its object in a single mode and is not overcome by opposition fixes the mind immovably as if in absorptionDelivering secluding separating by means of deliverance consisting in suppression abandoning the hindrances is the meaningAt the actual time of insight at the time of contemplation of dissolutionFor dissolution is the furthest extreme of impermanence So the meditator who is contemplating dissolution by its means sees under the heading of consciousness the whole field of formations as impermanent not as permanentand because of the suffering inherent in what is impermanent and because of the absence of self in what is painful he sees that same whole field of formations as painful not as pleasantand as notself not as selfBut since what is impermanent painful and notself is not something to delight inand what is not something to delight in is not something to be greedy forconsequently he becomes dispassionate towards that whole field of formations when it is seen in the light of dissolution as impermanent painful notself he does not delight in itand his greed for it fades away does not dye himNow as he thus becomes dispassionate and his greed fades away it is firstly by means of mundane knowledge only that he causes greed to cease and does not arouse it The meaning is that he does not bring about its arisingOr alternatively his greed having thus faded away he causes by means of his own knowledge the cessation of the unseen field of formations just as that of the seen he does not arouse itthe meaning is that he brings about only its cessation he does not bring about its arisingHaving entered on this way he relinquishes he does not graspWhat is meantIt is that this contemplation of impermanence etc is called relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into because it gives up defilements along with aggregate producing kammaformations and because by seeing the flaws in what is formed and by inclining towards the opposite of what is formed namely Nibbāna it enters into that NibbānaConsequently the meditator who has that contemplation gives up defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way statedHerein the contemplation of what is impermanent as only impermanent is contemplation of impermanencethis is a name for insight that occurs by taking formations of the three mundane planes and leaving aside the supramundane as impermanentFrom the perception of permanence from the wrong perception that occurs perceiving formed things as permanent eternalalso the various views should be regarded as included under the heading of perceptionLikewise with the perception of pleasure and so onBy means of the contemplation of dispassion by means of the contemplation that occurs in the mode of dispassion for formationsFrom delight from craving accompanied by happinessBy means of the contemplation of fading away by means of the contemplation that occurs similarly in the mode of fading awayBy means of the contemplation of cessation by means of the successive seeing of formations cessationhence delivering from greed is saidOr contemplating cessation is contemplation such that formations cease only and do not arise with future renewalFor this is knowledge of desire for deliverance grown strongHence he said delivering from arousingContemplation that occurs in the mode of relinquishing is contemplation of relinquishmentFrom grasping from taking as permanent etc or the meaning can also here be regarded as from grasping rebirthlinkingWhat is called permanent is what is lasting eternal like Nibbāna What is called impermanent is what is not permanent and is possessed of rise and fall He said The five aggregates are the impermanent signifying that they are formed dhammas as to meaningWhyBecause their essence is rise and fall and change the meaning is that their individual essences have rise and fall and changeHerein formed dhammas arising owing to cause and condition their coming to be after nonexistence their acquisition of an individual self  is riseTheir momentary cessation when arisen is fallDestruction is the vanishing of formations it is the act of those formations fading away their disintegration that is fading away Destruction itself as fading away is fading away as destruction this is momentary cessationFormations fade away absolutely here when this has been reached thus it is absolute fading away this is NibbānaThe act of relinquishing as the act of giving up by means of substituting for what should be abandoned its opposite quality or by cutting it off is relinquishment as giving upLikewise the act of relinquishing of self that takes place in nonformation of kamma which is the relinquishing of all substrata of becoming being the entering into that Nibbāna either by inclination towards it in insight or by having it as object in the path is relinquishment as entering intoThrough substitution of opposite qualities here contemplation of impermanence firstly gives up perception of permanence by abandoning through substitution of the opposite eg substituting perception of impermanence for that of permanence in the case of all formed things And the giving up in this way is in the form of inducing nonoccurrence For all kammaformations that are rooted in defilements due to apprehending as permanent and the kammaresultant aggregates rooted in both which might arise in the future are abandoned by causing their nonoccurrence Likewise in the case of perception of pain and so onThrough seeing the wretchedness of what is formed through seeing the fault of impermanence etc in the formed threeplane field of formationsWhen defilements are given up by the path then kammaformations are called given up through producing in them the nature of not causing result and aggregates rooted in them are called given up through their being rendered fit for nonarising So the path gives up all these is what is meantIt is the opposite of the formed owing to its permanence and so onWith the object under the heading of the object The happiness included in the jhāna that has that object is experienced because of the experiencing of the objectWhat is meantJust as when a man who is looking for a snake discovers its abode the snake is as it were already discovered and caught owing to the ease with which he will then be able to catch it with charms and spells so too when the object which is the abode of the happiness is experienced  then the happiness itself is experienced too owing to the ease with which it will be apprehended in its specific and general characteristicsBy his penetration of its characteristics by penetration of the specific and general characteristics of happinessFor when the specific and general characteristics of anything are experienced then that thing is experienced according to realityThe similes beginning with the cluster of gems are properly the counterpart signBecause of difference in perception because of the difference in the manner of perceiving that occurred before the arising of the signFollowing  is occurring along with  going after  by means of mindfulness through making the breaths the object as they occurHence he said And that is not by following after the beginning middle and endThe navel is the beginning because of their first arising thereFor the notion of a beginning is here in the sense of first arising not in the sense of just arising once onlyFor they actually go on arising throughout the whole length from the navel to the nosetipand wherever they arise there in that same place they dissolve because there is no going of dhammasThe ordinary term motion refers to successive arisings in adjacent locations according to conditionsThe heart is the middle near the heart just above it is the middleThe nose tip is the end the place where the nostrils are is the end that is the limit of the application of the ordinary term inbreaths and out breathsfor it is accordingly that they are called consciousnessoriginated there being no production externally of what is consciousnessoriginatedBuffeted by wind if he gives much attention to the wind that has gone inside that place seems to him as if it were buffeted by the wind as if filled with fatAs a meditation subject for a beginner is said with reference to the serenity meditation subjectbut the insight meditation subject applies to the other tetrads tooThe faint sound itself as a sign is the sign of the faint sounds it has that as its objectWhat is meantOf course the faint sounds have ceased too then but the sign of the sounds has been well apprehended and so consciousness occurs with the sign of fainter sounds as its objectFor as from the outset he ascertains with undistracted consciousness the sign of each sound as it ceases eventually his consciousness occurs in the end with the sign of ultrasubtle sounds too as its objectBodily formation the inbreath and outbreath For although it is consciousnessoriginated it is nevertheless called bodily formation since its existence is bound up with the kammaborn body and it is formed with that as the meansIn the first part of the system in the first part of the system of development in the first two bases is what is intendedOf course arousing of knowledge must be admitted to take place here too because of the presence of awareness of the length and shortness of the breaths as they actually are  and it is not hard to do that for it is merely the taking account of them as they occur That is why it is put in the present tense hereBut what follows is as hard as for a man to walk on a razors edge which is why the future tense is used for the subsequent stages in order to indicate the need for exceptional prior effortZeal arises additional zeal which is profitable and has the characteristic of desire to act arises due to the satisfaction obtained when the meditation has brought progressive improvementMore subtle than before more subtle than before the alreadydescribed zeal arosefor the breaths occur more subtly owing to the meditations influence in tranquilizing the bodys distress and disturbanceGladness arises fresh happiness arises of the kinds classed as minor etc which is the gladness that accompanies the consciousness occupied with the meditation and is due to the fact that the peacefulness of the object increases with the growing subtlety of the breaths and to the fact that the meditation subject keeps to its courseThe mind turns away the mind turns away from the breaths which have reached the point at which their manifestation needs investigating owing to their gradually increasing subtletyBut some say  It is when the inbreaths and out breaths have reached a subtler state owing to the influence of the meditation and the counterpart sign for when that has arisen the mind turns away from the normal breaths Equanimity is established when concentration classed as access and absorption has arisen in that counterpart sign then since there is no need for further interest to achieve jhāna onlooking ensues which is specific neutralityIn these nine ways that occur in the nine ways just describedLong inbreaths and outbreaths are a body the inbreaths and outbreaths which exist as particles though they have the aspect of length constitute a body in the sense of a massAnd here the sign that arises with the breaths as its support is also called inbreath and outbreath The establishment is mindfulness mindfulness is called establishment  since it approaches the object and remains thereThe contemplation is knowledge contemplation of the sign by means of serenity and contemplation of mentalitymateriality by defining with insight the inbreaths and outbreaths and the body which is their support as materiality and the consciousness and the states associated with it as the immaterial  are knowledge in other words awareness of what is actually there The body is the establishment  there is that body and mindfulness approaches it by making it its object and remains there thus it is called establishment And the words the body is the establishment include the other kind of body too since the abovementioned comprehension by insight is needed here tooBut it is not the mindfulness that body is not called mindfulness though it is called the establishmentMindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness being so both in the sense of remembering and in the sense of establishing By means of that mindfulness by means of that mindfulness already mentionedAnd that knowledge and the knowledge already mentionedThat body that inbreathandoutbreath body and that material body which is its supportHe contemplates  he keeps re seeing with jhāna knowledge and with insight knowledgeThat is why Development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said in virtue of that contemplation this is said to be development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body of the kind already statedWhat is meant is this the contemplation of the body as an inbreathandoutbreath body as stated and of the physical body that is its material support which is not contemplation of permanence etc in a body whose individual essence is impermanent etclike the contemplation of a waterless mirage as waterbut which is rather contemplation of its essence as impermanent painful notself and foul according as is appropriateor alternatively which is contemplation of it as a mere body only by not contemplating it as containing anything that can be apprehended as I or mine or woman or man all this is contemplation of the body The mindfulness associated with that contemplation of the body which mindfulness is itself the establishment is the establishment  The development the increase of that is the development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the bodyRegarded as particles as a number of groups In the hot season the forest is favourable in the cold season the root of a tree in the rainy season an empty place For one of phlegmatic humour phlegmatic by nature the forest is favourable for one of bilious humour the root of a tree for one of windy humour an empty place For one of deluded temperament the forest for one of hating temperament the root of a tree for one of greedy temperament an empty placeThe words in all its aspects refer to the sixteen basesfor these are only found in total in this dispensationWhen outsiders know mindfulness of breathing they only know the first four modesSome is said with reference to the inmates of the Uttara monastery in AnurādhapuraSorrow etc have already been established as ignorance but death consciousness itself is devoid of ignorance and formations and is not a condition for the next becoming that is why because it assures sorrow etc is saidThough feeling is condition is said in order to prevent a generalization from the preceding words With feeling as condition to the effect that craving arises in the presence of every condition accompanied by feelingBut is it not impossible to prevent overgeneralization in the absence of any such statements as Feeling accompanied by inherent tendency is a condition for cravingNo for we are dealing with an exposition of the round of rebirthsSince there is no round of rebirths without inherent tendencies so far as the meaning is concerned it may be taken for granted that the condition is accompanied by inherent tendencyOr alternatively it may be recognized that this condition is accompanied by inherent tendency because it follows upon the words With ignorance as conditionAnd with the words With feeling as condition craving the ruling needed is this There is craving only with feeling as condition and not With feeling as condition there is only cravingThis means due to the heat element in the materiality that arose together with the rebirthlinking consciousnessIt is because the heartbasis is arisen only at that very moment that there is weakness of the physical basisIt is that performed next to death or which is conspicuous in the memory then whenever it was performedSign of the kamma is the event by means of which a man accumulates kamma through making it the object at the time of accumulationEven if the kamma was performed as much as a hundred thousand eons ago nevertheless at the time of its ripening it appears as kamma or sign of kammaThe sign of the destiny is one of the visual scenes in the place where rebirth is due to take placeIt consists in the visual appearance of flames of fire etc to one ready to be reborn in hell and so on as already statedOwing to craving being unabandoned and because the previouslyarisen continuity is similarly deflected consciousness occurs inclining leaning and tending towards the place of rebirthlinkingThe conascent formations are the volitions conascent with the impulsion consciousness next to death Or they are all those that begin with contactThey fling consciousness on to that place of rebirthlinking which is the object of the kamma and so onThe meaning is that they occur as the cause for the establishment of consciousness on the object by rebirthlinking as though flinging it thereAs a continuous process consisting of death rebirthlinking and the adjacent consciousnessesBy the words the appearance of the mothers womb etc only visual appearance is given as the sign of destinyHerein in the first place it would be logical that sound has not been given in the Commentaries as a sign of destiny because it is included in the happy destinies as notclungto but the reason for odour etc not having been given will be inquired intoWith the appearance of fire and flames etc in the hells is said owing to likeness to thatappearance of hell and fire does not itself come into focus for him thenUnprofitable resultant eye consciousness etc sometimes arise even in Brahmās when undesirable visible data etc come into focusAs to Ox hair and rams hair etc and the rest ox hair and rams hair are conditions for the unlike dubbā grassa ram should be understood as a red sheep curds sesame flour and molasses are for bhūtiṇaka grassmoss is for the taṇḍuleyyaka plant a she donkey is for a mule and so on in this way as included by the word etchorn is for reeds The assertion of a single cause is undesirablebecause it follows that there would be production of everything all the time and because it follows that there would be a single homogeneous stateAnd Nibbāna does not after being unhelpful by its own absence of existingness to those states that have Nibbāna as their object become helpful to them by obtaining existingness Or alternatively the presence condition which by its nonexistingness is the opposite of helpfulness to those states that are associated with arising etc is helpful to them by its existingness So Nibbāna is not a presence conditionFor a presence condition is that which is unhelpful by its absence of existingness and becomes helpful by obtaining existingness The presence condition is not applicable to NibbānaReviewing changeoflineage applies to streamenterersReviewing cleansing applies to oncereturners and nonreturnersProximity and contiguity conditions are not stated in accordance with the distinction between making occur and giving opportunity as the absence and disappearance conditions are rather they are stated as the causes of the regular order of consciousness in the cognitive seriesThis refers to the Elder Revata tooThe state of proximity condition is the ability to cause arising proximately because there is no interval between the cessation of the preceding and the arising of the subsequentThe state of contiguity condition is the ability to cause arising by being quite proximate through approaching as it were identity with itself owing to absence of any distinction that This is below above or around that which is because of lack of any such copresence as in the case of the components of the material groups and because of lack of any copositionality of the condition and the conditionally arisenAnd in general because of the uninterestedness of all states  when a given state has ceased or is present in a given mode and other states come to be possessed of that particular mode it is that states mode that must be regarded as what is called ability to cause arisingWhich are contingent upon other such states because it is said without distinction of all visibledata bases  and of all mentaldata bases there is consequently no dhamma among the formed unformed and conceptual dhammas classed as sixfold under visible data etc that does not become an object conditionthat is why when rice grains etc are pounded they get scattered and reduced to powder It is called indeterminate to distinguish it from mentality which is profitable etc at different timesMateriality is dispersible since it has in itself nothing beyond the water element to hold it absolutely together so its function is to be dispersedInseparability of its components is owing to their having no separate existence mentality here being feeling perception and formationsMentalitys function is to associate since it joins with consciousness in a state of mutualityConsciousnesss function is to go before since it precedes mentalitymateriality at rebirthlinkingTo accumulate is to heap upFormations accumulate work for the purpose of rebirth So that is their functionNo theory is unknowing about suffering etc wrong theory is perverted perception of what is foul etc as beautiful etcor else no theory is unassociated with false view and wrong theory is associated with itWith the nature of result and so on the words and so on here include neither trainernornontrainer conducive to fetters  and so onMundane resultant and so on the words and so on here include indeterminate  formed  and so onWith rootcause and without rootcause and so on the words and so on here include prompted unprompted and so onThe law is the text of the dependent originationThe meaning is the meaning of thatOr they are the cause and the fruit of the cause here is what is meantOr law is regularity Now some misinterpreting the meaning of the sutta passage Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise there yet remains that element   wrongly describe the regularity of the dependent origination as a permanent dependent origination instead of which it should be described as having the individual essence of a cause  defined according to its own fruit in the way statedAnd some misinterpret the meaning of the dependent origination thus Without cessation without arising instead of taking the unequivocal meaning in the way statedSuch terms as woman man etc are local forms of speech because even wise men instead of saying Fetch the five aggregates or Let the mentalitymateriality come use the current forms woman and man This is how in those who have not fully understood what a physical basis is there comes to be the insistence  This is really a woman this is really a manBut since this is a mere concept which depends on states made to occur in such and such wise one who sees and knows the dependent origination does not insist on it as the ultimate meaningCurrent speech is speech current in the worldNot overriding is not going beyondFor when a being is said instead of making an analysis like this What is the lasting being here Is it materiality Or feeling and so on one who does not override current usage should express a worldly meaning in ordinary language as those in the world do employing the usage current in the worldThe doctrine of eternalism is that beginning The world and self are eternal That of nocause is that beginning There is no cause there is no condition for the defilement of beings That of fictitiouscause holds that the worlds occurrence is due to Primordial Essence  atoms  time  and so onThat of a powerwielder asserts the existence of an Overlord  or of a World soul  or of Pajāpati Also the doctrines of Nature  Fate  and Chance  should be regarded as included here under the doctrine of nocauseSome however say that the doctrine of fictitiouscause is that beginning with The eye is the cause of the eyeand that the doctrine of the powerwielder is that beginning Things occur owing to their own individual essence Patīyamāna  When it is gone to by direct confrontation by means of knowledges going when it is penetrated to  is the meaningSubject to destruction means that its individual essence is the state of being destroyed But since the object is stated with individual essences the breakup of states with individual essences their destruction their fallall that has to do only with states with individual essencesHence the Blessed One said Bhikkhus agingand death is impermanent formed dependently arisen If it cannot reach absorption because of its object being states with individual essences then what about the supramundane jhānas and certain of the immaterial jhānas It was to answer this that he said now with special development the supramundane jhāna and so onWhen consciousness dissolves the world is dead just as in the case of the death consciousness this world is also called dead in the highest sense with the arrival of any consciousness whatever at its dissolution since its cessation has no rebirthlinking Nevertheless though this is so the highest sense this concept will allow the ultimate sense will allow this concept of continuity which is what the expression of common usage Tissa lives Phussa lives refers to and which is based on consciousnesses momentarily existing along with a physical support this belongs to the ultimate sense here since as they say It is not the name and surname that livesPerson is the states other than the alreadymentioned life feeling and consciousnessThe words just these alone mean that it is unmixed with self or permanenceThe word etc includes Nandayakkha Nandamāṇava and othersHerein just as when a pint measure of milk is poured into a number of pints of water though the milk becomes completely mixed up with the water and is present appreciably in all it is nevertheless not the milk that has increased there but only the water And so too although the clungto and unclungto occur mixed up together it is nevertheless not the clungto that is enlarged It should be taken that it is the consciousnessborn matter that is enlarged by the influence of the supernormal power and the temperatureborn is enlarged pari passuThough the clungto and the unclungto occur as it were mixed up in a single continuity they are nevertheless not mixed up in meaningAnd so to take it as enlargement of that is likewise not correct Consequently enlargement should be understood only in the way statedOr alternatively clungto is intended as all matter that is bound up with faculties  tooOnly this is correct because instances of clungto materiality do not arise owing to consciousness or to temperatureThe ramparts of Sineru the girdle of SineruThere are it seems four ramparts that encircle Sineru measuring  leagues in breadth and width They were built to protect the realm of the Thirtythree against nāgas garudas kumbhaṇḍas and yakkhasThey enclose half of Sineru it seemsAt SavatthiSitting to one side King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One Venerable sir for one who has taken birth is there anything other to expect than aging and deathFor one who has taken birth great king there is nothing other to expectthan aging and deathEven in the case of those affluent khattiyasrich with great wealth and property with abundant gold and silver abundant treasures and commodities abundant wealth and grainbecause they have taken birth there is nothing other to expect than aging and deathEven in the case of those affluent brahmins  affluent householders  rich  with abundant wealth and grainbecause they have taken birth there is nothing other to expect than aging and deathEven in the case of those bhikkhus who are arahants whose taints are destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached their own goal utterly destroyed the fetters of existenceand are completely liberated through final knowledge even for them this body is subject to breaking up subject to being laid downThe beautiful chariots of kings wear outThis body too undergoes decayBut the Dhamma of the good does not decaySo the good proclaim along with the goodAt Savatthiin the middle of the day King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one side The Blessed One then asked him Now where are you coming from great king in the middle of the dayJust now venerable sir I have been engaged in those affairs of kingship typical for kings who are intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty who are obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures whohave attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earthWhat do you think great king Suppose a man would come to you from the east one who is trustworthy and reliableand would tell youFor sure great king you should know this I am coming from the eastand there I saw a great mountain high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beingsDo whatever you think should be done great kingThen a second man would come to you from the west a third man from the north  and a fourth man from the south one who is trustworthy and reliableFor sure great king you should know this I am coming from the southand there I saw a great mountain high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beingsDo whatever you think should be done great kingIf great king such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life the human state being so difficult to obtain what should be doneIf venerable sir such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life the human state being so difficult to obtain what else should be done but to live by the Dhamma to live righteously and to do wholesome and meritorious deedsI inform you great king I announce to you great king aging and death are rolling in on youWhen aging and death are rolling in on you great king what should be doneAs aging and death are rolling in on me venerable sir what else should be done but to live by the Dhamma to live righteously and to do wholesome and meritorious deedsVenerable sir kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and rule over a great sphere of territory conquer by means of elephant battles cavalry battles chariot battles and infantry battles but there is no hope of victory by such battles no chance of success when aging and death are rolling inIn this royalcourt venerable sir there are counselors who when the enemies arrive are capable of dividing them by subterfugebut there is no hope of victory by subterfuge no chance of success when aging and death are rolling inIn this royal court venerable sir there exists abundant bullion and gold stored in vaults and lofts and with such wealth we are capable of mollifying the enemies when they comebut there is no hope of victory by wealth no chance of success when aging and death are rolling inAs aging and death are rolling in on me venerable sir what else should I do but live by the Dhamma live righteously and do wholesome and meritorious deedsSo it is great king So it is great kingAs aging and death are rolling in on you what else should you do but live by the Dhamma live righteously and do wholesome and meritorious deedsThis is what the Blessed One said Having said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said thisJust as mountains of solid rock Massive reaching to the skyMight draw together from all sides Crushing all in the four quartersSo aging and death come Rolling over living beingsKhattiyas brahmins vessas suddas Outcasts and scavengersThey spare none along the way But come crushing everythingTheres no hope there for victory By elephant troops chariots and infantryOne cant defeat them by subterfuge Or buy them off by means of wealthTherefore a person of wisdom here Out of regard for his own goodSteadfast should settle faith In the Buddha Dhamma and SahghaWhen one conducts oneself by Dhamma With body speech and mindThey praise one here in the present life And after death one rejoices in heavenThere are monks three divine messengersWhat threeThere is a person of bad conduct in body speech and mindOn the dissolution of the body after death he is reborn in the plane of misery in a bad destination in a lower world in hellThere the wardens of hell seize him by both arms and take him before Yama the Lord of Death saying This man your majesty had no respect for father and mother not for ascetics and brahmins nor did he honor the elders of the familyMay your majesty inflict due punishment on himThen monks King Yama questions that man examines him and addresses him concerning the first divine messenger Didnt you ever see my good man the first divine messenger appearing among humankindAnd he replies No Lord I did not see himThen King Yama says to him But my good man didnt you ever see a woman or a man eighty ninety or a hundred years old frailbent like a roof bracket crooked leaning on a stick shakily going along ailing youth and vigor gone with broken teeth with gray and scanty hair or bald wrinkled with blotched limbsAnd the man replies Yes Lord I have seen thisThen King Yama says to him My good man didnt it ever occur to you an intelligent and mature person I too am subject to old age and cannot escape it Let me now do noble deeds by body speech and mindNo Lord I could not do itI was negligentThen King Yama says Through negligence my good man you have failed to do noble deeds by body speech and mindWell you will be treated as befits your negligenceThat evil action of yours was not done by mother or father brothers sisters friends or companions not by relatives devas ascetics or brahmins But you alone have done that evil deed and you will have to experience the fruitWhen monks King Yama has questioned examined and addressed him thus concerning the first divine messenger he again questions examines and addresses the man about the second one saying Didnt you ever see my good man the second divine messenger appearing among humankindNo Lord I did not see himBut my good man didnt you ever see a woman or a man who was sick and in pain seriously ill lying in his own filth having to be lifted up by some and put to bed by othersYes Lord I have seen thisMy good man didnt it ever occur to you an intelligent and mature person I too am subject to illness and cannot escape it Let me now do noble deeds by body speech and mindNo Lord I could not do itI was negligentThrough negligence my good man you have failed to do noble deeds by body speech and mindWell you will be treated as befits your negligenceThat evil action of yours was not done by mother or father brothers sisters friends or companions nor by relatives devas ascetics or brahmins But you alone have done that evil deedand you will have to experience the fruitWhen monks King Yama has questioned examined and addressed him thus concerning the second divine messenger he again questions examines and addresses the man about the third one saying Didnt you ever see my good man the third divine messenger appearing among humankindNo Lord I did not see himBut my good man didnt you ever see a woman or a man one two or three days dead the corpse swollen discolored and festeringYes Lord I have seen thisThen my good man didnt it ever occur to you an intelligent and mature person I too am subject to death and cannot escape it Let me now do noble deeds by body speech and mindNo Lord I could not do itI was negligentThrough negligence my good man you have failed to do noble deeds by body speech and mindWell you will be treated as befits your negligenceThat evil action of yours was not done by mother or father brothers sisters friends or companions

sorrows grieves and laments he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraughtHe feels two feelingsa bodily one and a mental oneBhikkhus the uninstructed worldling feels a pleasant feeling a painful feeling and a neitherpainfulnotpleasant feelingThe instructed noble disciple too feels a pleasant feeling a painful feeling and a neitherpainfulnotpleasant feelingThere in bhikkhus what is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldlingVenerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One guided by the Blessed One take recourse in the Blessed One It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement Having heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember it Then listen and attend closely bhikkhus I will speak Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied The Blessed one said thisSuppose they were to strike a man with a darthe feels two feelingsa bodily one and a mental oneSo too when the uninstructed worldling is being contacted by a painful feeling For what reasonBeing contacted by painful feeling he seeks delight in sensual pleasureWhen he harbours aversion towards painful feeling the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling lies behind thisBeing contacted by that same painful feeling he harbours aversion towards itBecause the uninstructed worldrldling does not know of any escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasure When he seeks delight in sensual pleasure the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling lies behind thisHe does not understand as it really is the origin and the passing away the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these feelingsWhen he does not understand these things the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling lies behind thisIf he feels a pleasant feeling he feels it attachedIf he feels a painful feeling he feels it attachedIf he feels a neitherpainfulnotpleasant feeling he feels it attachedThis bhkkhus is called an uninstructed worldling who is attached to birth aging and death who is attached to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair who is attached to sufferingI sayso that the man would feel a feeling caused by two dartsand then they would strike him immediately afterwards with a second dartBhikkhus when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful feeling he does not sorrow grieve or lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraughtHe feels one feelinga bodily one not a mental oneFor what reasonSuppose they were to strike a man with a dartbut they would not strike him immediately afterwards with a second dartso that the man would feel a feeling caused by one dart onlyBhikkhus when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful feeling he does not sorrow grieve or lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraughtHe feels one feelinga bodily one not a mental oneBeing contacted by that same painful feeling he harbours no aversion towards itSince he harbours no aversion towards feeling the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling does not lie behind thisBeing contacted by painful feeling he does not seek delight in sensual pleasureBecause the instructed noble disciple knows of an escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasureSince he does not seek delight in sensual pleasure the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling does not lie behind thisHe understands as it really is the origin and the passing away the gatificationthe danger and the escape in the case of these feelingsSince he understands these things the underly ingtendency to ignorance in regard to neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling does not lie behind thisIf he feels a pleasant feeling he feels it detachedIf he feels a painful feeling he feels it detachedIf he feels a neither painfulnorpleasant feeling he feels it detachedThis bhikkhus is called a noble disciple who is detached from birth aging and death who is detached from sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair who is detached from suffering I sayThis bhikkhus is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldlingThe wise one learned does not feelThe pleasant and painful mentalfeelingThis between The wise one and the worldlingis the great differenceFor the learned one who has comprehended DhammaWho clearly sees this world and the nextDesirable things do not provoke his mindTowards the undesired he has no aversionFor him attraction and repulsionno more exist Both have been extinguished brought to an endHaving known the dustfree sorrowless stateThe transcender of existence rightly understandsThese eight worldly conditions monks keep the world turning around and the world turns around these eight worldly conditionsWhat eightGain and loss fame and disrepute praise and blame pleasure and painThese eight worldly conditions monks are encountered by an uninstructed worldlingand they are also encountered by an instructed noble discipleWhat now is the distinction the disparity the difference between an instructed noble disciple and an uninstructed worldlingVenerable sir our knowledge of these things has its roots in the Blessed One it has the Blessed One as guide and resortIt would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would clarify the meaning of that statementHaving heard it from him the monks will bear it in mindListen then monks and attend carefully I shall speakYes venerable sir the monks repliedThe Blessed One then spoke thus When an uninstructed worldling monks comes upon gainThis gain that has come to me is impermanent bound up with suffering subject to changeHe does not know it as it really isAnd when he comes upon loss fame and disrepute praise and blame he does not reflect on them thus All these are impermanent bound up with suffering subject to change He does not know them as they really areWith such a person gain and loss fame anddisrepute praise and blame pleasure and pain keep his mind engrossedWhen gain comes he is elated and when he meets with loss he is dejected When fame comes he is elated and when he meets with disrepute he is dejected When praise comes he is elated and when he meets with blame he is dejected When he experiences pleasure he is elated and when he experiences pain he is dejectedBeing thus involved in likes and dislikes he will not be freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain dejection and despairhe will not be freed from suffering I sayBut monks when an instructed noble disciple comes upon gainhe reflects on it thusThis gain that has come to me is impermanent bound up with suffering subject to changeAnd so he will reflect when loss and so forth come upon himHe understands all these things as they really areand they do not engross his mindHaving thus given up likes and dislikes he will be freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain dejection and despairhe will be freed from suffering I sayThis monks is the distinction the disparity the difference between an instructed noble disciple and an uninstructed worldlingAt SavatthiBhikkhus I will teach you agitation through clinging and nonagitation through nonclingingListen to that and attend closely I will speakYes venerable sir those bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisAnd how bhikkhus is there agitation through clingingHere bhikkhus the uninstructed worldling who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards form as self or self aspossessingform or form as in self or self as in formThat form of his changes and altersWith the change and alteration of form his consciousness becomes preoccupied with the change of formAgitation and a constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of form remain obsessing his mindBecause his mind is obsessed he is frightened distressed and anxious and through clinging he becomes agitatedHe regards feeling as self  regards consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousnessor consciousnessas in self or self as in consciousnessThat consciousness of his changes and altersWith the change and alteration of consciousness his consciousness becomes preoccupied with the change of consciousnessAgitation and a constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of consciousness remain obsessing his mindBecause his mind is obsessed he is frightened distressed and anxious and through clinging he becomes agitatedIt is in such a way bhikkhus that there is agitation through clingingAnd how bhikkhus is there nonagitation through nonclingingHere bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple who is a seer of the noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who is a seerof superior persons and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma does not regard form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in formThat form of his changes and altersDespite the change and alteration of form his consciousness does not become preoccupied with the change of formNo agitation and constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of form remain obsessing his mindBecause his mind is not obsessedbe is not frightened distressed or anxious and through nonclinging he does not become agitatedHe does not regard feeling as selfHe does not regard consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness That consciousness of his changes and altersDespite the change and alteration of consciousness his consciousnessdoes not become preoccupied with the change of consciousnessNo agitation and constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of consciousness remain obsessing his mindBecause his mind is not obsessed he is not frightened distressed or anxious and through nonclinging he does not become agitatedIt is in such a way bhikkhus that there is nonagitation through nonclingingBhikkhus there are these three unwholesome rootsWhat threeThe unwholesome root greed the unwholesome root hatred and the unwholesome root delusionWhatever greed occurs bhikkhus is unwholesome Whatever deed a greedy person performs by body speech and mind is also unwholesome When a greedy person overcome by greed with mind obsessed by it inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretext  by killing imprisonment confiscation censure or banishmentthinking I am powerful I want power that too is unwholesomeThus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of greed caused by greed arisen from greed conditioned by greedWhatever hatred occurs is unwholesome Whatever deed a person full of hate performs by body speech and mind is also unwholesome When a person full of hate overcome by hatred with mind obsessed by it inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretextthinking I am powerful I want power that too is unwholesomeThus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of hatred caused by hatred arisen from hatred conditioned by hatredWhatever delusion occurs is unwholesome Whatever deed a deluded person performs by body speech and mind is also unwholesome When a deluded person overcome by delusion with mind obsessed by it inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretextthinking I am powerful I want power that too is unwholesomeThus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of delusion caused by delusion arisen from delusion conditioned by delusionSuch a person bhikkhus is called one who speaks at an improper time who speaks falsely who speaks what is unbeneficial who speaks nonDhamma who speaks non disciplineAnd why is such a person called one who speaks at an improper time  who speaks nondisciplineTherefore such a person is called one who speaks at an improper time who speaks falsely who speaks what is unbeneficial who speaks nonDhamma who speaks nondisciplineThis person inflicts suffering upon an other under a false pretext by killing imprisonment confiscation censure or banishmentthinking I am powerful I want powerThus when spoken to in accordance with fact he despises the one who reproaches him  he does not admit his faults When spoken to contrary to fact he does not make an effort to unravel what is said to him For such and such a reason this is untrue for such and such a reason this is contrary to factSuch a person overcome by bad unwholesome qualities born of greed Suppose a tree was choked and enveloped by three maluva creepers It would meet with calamity with disasterwith calamity and disaster So too such a person overcome by bad unwholesome qualities born of greedThese are the three unwholesome rootsThere are bhikkhus these three wholesome rootsWhat threeThe wholesome root nongreed the wholesome root nonhatred and thew holesome root nondelusionWhatever nongreed occurs bhikkhus is wholesome Whatever deed one without greed performs by body speech and mind is also wholesome When one without greed not overcome by greed with mind not obsessed by it does not inflict suffering upon another urider a false pretextby killing im prisonment confiscation censure or banishment thinkingI am powerful I want power that too is wholesomeThus numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of nongreed caused by nongreed arisen from nongreed conditioned by nongreedWhatever nonhatred occurs is wholesome Whatever deed one without hate performs by body speech and mind is also wholesome When one without hate not overcome by hatred with mind not obsessed by it does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretextthat too is wholesomeThus numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of nonhatred caused by nonhatred arisen from nonhatred conditioned by nonhatredWhatever nondelusion occurs is wholesome Whatever deed one who is undeluded performs by body speech and mind is also wholesome When one who is undeluded not overcome by delusion with mind not obsessed by it does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretext  that too is wholesomeThus numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of nondelusion caused by nondelusion arisen from nondelusion conditioned by nondelusionSuch a person bhikkhus is called one who speaks at the proper time who speaks in accordance with fact who speaks what is beneficial who speaks Dhamma who speaks disciplineAnd why is such a person called one who speaks at the proper time who speaks disciplineThis person does not inflict suffering upon an other under a false pretext by killing imprisonment confiscation censure or banishment thinking I am powerful I want powerThus when spoken to in accordance with fact he admits his faults he does not despise the one who reproaches him  When spoken to contrary to fact he makes an effort to unravel what is said to him For such and such a reason this is untrue for such and such a reason this is contrary to factTherefore such a person is called one who speaks at the proper time who speaks in accordance with fact who speaks what is beneficial who speaks Dhamma who speaks disciplineSuch a person has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities born of greedHe dwells happily in this very life without distress anguish or feverand in this very life he attains nibbanaSuppose a tree was choked and enveloped by three maluva creepersThen a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basketHe would cut down the creepers at their roots dig them up and pull out the roots even the fine rootlets and rootfiberIn this way those maluva creepers would be cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arisingHe would cut the creepers into pieces split the pieces and reduce them to slivers Then he would dry the slivers in the wind and sun burn them in a firereduce them to ashes and winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried a way by the swift current of a riverSo too bhikkhus such a person has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities born of greedHe dwells happily in this very life without distress anguish or feverand in this very life he attains nibbanaThese are the three wholesome rootsborn of hatred  born of delusioncut them off at the root made them like a palm stump obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arisingborn of hatred  he attains nibbanaborn of delusion  he attains nibbanaHe dwells happily in this very life without distress anguish or feverAnd in this very life he attains nibbanaBhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginningA first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingSuppose bhikkhus a man would cut up whatever grass sticks branches and foliage there are in this Jambudipa and collect them together into a single heap Having done so he would put them down saying for each one This is my mother this my mothers mother The sequence of that mans mothers and grandmothers would not come to an end yet the grass wood branches and foliage in this Jambudipa would be used up and exhaustedFor what reason Because bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginningA first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingFor such a long timebhikkhus you have experienced suffering anguish and disaster and swelled the cemeteryIt is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations enough to become dispassionate towards them enough to be liberated from themBhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginningA first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingSuppose bhikkhus a man would reduce this great earth to balls of clay the size of jujube kernels and put them down saying for each one  This is my father this my fathers father The sequence of that mans fathers and grandfathers would not come to an end yet this great earth would be used up and exhaustedFor what reasonBecause bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginningA first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingFor such a long time bhikkhus you have experienced suffering anguish and disaster and swelled the cemeteryIt is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations enough to become dispassionate towards them enough to be liberated from themAt SavatthiThen a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed Onepaid homage to himsat down to one side and said to him Venerable sir how long is an aeonAn aeon is long bhikkhuIt is not easy to count it and say it is so many years or so many hundreds of years or so many thousands of years or so many hundreds of thousands of yearsThen is it possible to give a simile venerable sirIt is possible bhikkhu the Blessed One saidSupposebhikkhu there was a great stone mountain a yojana long a yojana wide and a yojana high without holes or crevices one solid mass of rockAt the end of every hundred years a man would stroke it once with a piece of Kasian clothThat great stone mountain might by this effort be worn away and eliminated but the aeon would still not have come to an endSo long is an aeon bhikkhuAnd of aeons of such length we have wandered through so many aeons so many hundreds of aeons so many thousands of aeons so many hundreds of thousands of aeonsFor what reason Because bhikkhu this samsara is without discoverable beginningIt is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations enough to become dispassionate towards them enough to be liberated from themOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagahain the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel SanctuaryThen a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one sideand said to him Master Gotama how many aeons have elapsed and gone byBrahmin many aeons have elapsed and gone byIt is not easy to count them and say they are so many aeons or so many hundreds of aeons or so many thousands of aeons or so many hundreds of thousands of aeonsBut is it possible to give a simile Master GotamaIt is possible brahmin the Blessed One saidSuppose brahmin the grains of sand between the point where the river Ganges originates and the point where it enters the great ocean it is not easy to count these and say there are so many grains of sand or so many hundreds of grains or so many thousands of grains or so many hundreds of thousands of grainsBrahmin the aeons that have elapsed and gone by are even more numerous than thatIt is not easy to count them and say that they are so many aeons or so many hundreds of aeons or so many thousands of aeonsor so many hundreds of thousands of aeonsFor what reasonBecause brahmin

bhikkhus when the great ocean dries up and evaporates and no longer exists but still I say there is no making an end of suffering for those beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingThere comes a time bhikkhus when Sineru the king of mountains burns up and perishes and no longer exists but still I say there is no making an end of suffering for those beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fetteredby cravingThere comes a time bhikkhus when the great earth burns up and perishes and no longer exists but still I say there is no making an end of suffering for those beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingSuppose bhikkhus a dog tied up on a leash was bound to a strong post or pillar it would just keep on running and revolving around that same post or pillar So too the uninstructed worldling  regards form as self feeling as self  perception as self volitional formations as self consciousness as selfHe just keeps running and revolving around form around feeling around perception around volitional formations around consciousnessAs he keeps on running and revolving around them he is not freed from form not freed from feelingnot freed from perception not freed from volitional formations not freed from consciousness He is not freed frombirth aging and death not freed from sorrow lamentation

In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverseIf this clansman has a small income but lives luxuriously others would say of him  This clansman eats his wealth just like an eater of figsBut if he has a large income but lives sparingly others would say of him This clansman may even starve him selfBut it is called balanced living when a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life neither too extravagant not too frugal awareIn this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverseThe wealth thus amassed has four sources of

result there is darkandbright kamma with darkandbright result and there is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neitherdark notbright result kamma that leads to the destruction of kammaThese are the four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after I realized them for myself with direct knowledgeMonks do not fear meritorious deedsThis is an expression denoting happiness what is desirable wished for dear and agreeable that is meritorious deedsFor I know full well monks that for a long time I experienced desirable wished for dear and agreeable results from often performing meritorious deedsHaving cultivated for seven years a mind of lovingkindness for seven eons of contraction and expansion I did not return to this worldWhenever the eon contracted I reached the plane of streaming radiance and when the eon expanded I arose in an empty divine mansionAnd there I was Brahma the great Brahma the unvanquished victor the allseeing the allpowerfulThirtysix times I was Sakka ruler of the devas And many hundreds of times I was a wheelturning monarch righteous a king of righteousness conqueror of the four regions of the earth maintaining stability in the land in possession of the seven treasuresWhat need is there to speak of mere local kingshipIt occurred to me monks to wonder Of what kind of deed of mine is this the fruit Of what deeds ripening am I now of such great accomplishment and power Bhikkhus there are these three bases of meritorious activityAnd then it occurred to me It is the fruit of three kinds of deeds of mine the ripening of three kinds of deeds that I am now of

celestial beauty celestial happiness celestial glory and celestial authority and in celestial forms sounds odors tastes and tactile objectsThese bhikkhus are the three bases of meritorious activityThus have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Vesali at the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestAnd at that time a large number of Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were staying at Vesali on some businessAnd they heard say The ascetic Gotama son of the Sakyans who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is staying at Vesali at the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestAnd concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Ara hant a fullyenlightened Buddha perfected in knowledge and conduct a WellFarer Knower of the worlds unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans a Buddha a Blessed LordHe proclaims this world with its gods maras and Brahmas the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and peoples having come to know it by his own knowledgeHe teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and he displays the fullyperfected thoroughly purified holy lifeAnd indeed it is good to see such ArahantsAnd so these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha went to the Great Forest to the Gabled HallAt that time the Venerable Nagita was the Lords personal attendantSo they approached the Venerable NagitaWe would like to see himFriends it is not the right time to see the Lord He is in solitary meditationBut the Brahmins just sat down to one side and said When we have seen the Lord Gotama we will goJust then Otthaddha the Licchavi came to the Gabled Hall with a large company saluted the Venerable Nagita and stood asidesaying Where is the Blessed Lord staying the Ara hant the fullyenlightened Buddha We would like to see himMahali it is not the right time to see the Lord He is in solitary meditationBut Otthaddha just sat down to one side and said When I have seen the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha I will goThen the novice Siha came to the Venerable Nagita stood asideand said Venerable Kassapa these many Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Lord and Otthaddha the Licchavi too has come with a large company to see the Lord It would be well Venerable Kassapa to allow these people to see himWell then Siha you announce them to the LordYes Venerable Sir said Siha Then he went to the Lord saluted him stood asideIt would be well if the Lord were to let these people see himThen Siha prepare a seat in the shade of this dwellingYes Lord said Siha and did soThen the Lord came out of his dwelling place and sat down on the prepared seatThe Brahmins approached the LordHaving exchanged courtesies with him they sat down to one sideBut Otthaddha did obeisance to the Lord and then sat down to one sidesaying Lord not long ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said Soon I shall have been a follower of the Lord for three years I have seen heavenly sights pleasant delightful enticing but I have not heard any heavenly sounds that were pleasant delightful enticingLord are there any such heavenly sounds which Sunakkhatta cannot hear or are there notThere are such sounds MahaliThen Lord what is the reason what is the cause why Sunakkahtta cannot hear themMahali in one case a monk facing east goes into onesided samadhi and sees heavenly sights pleasant delightful enticingBy means of this onesided samadhi he sees heavenly sights but does not hear heavenly soundsWhy is thisBecause this samadhi only leads to the seeing of heavenly sights but not to the hearing of heavenly soundsAgain a monk facing south west north goes into a onesided samadhi and facing upwards downwards or across sees heavenly sights in that directionWhy is thisBecause this samadhi only leads to the seeing of heavenly sights but not to the hearing of heavenly soundsIn another case Mahali a monk facing east hears heavenly sounds but does not see heavenly sightsAgain a monk facing south west north facing upwards downwards or across hears heavenly sounds but does not see heavenly sightsIn another case Mahali a monk facing east goes into twosided samadhi and both sees heavenly sights pleasant delightful enticing and hears heavenly soundsWhy is thisBecause this twosided samadhi leads to both the seeing of heavenly sights and the hearing of heavenly soundsAgain a monk facing south west north facing upwards downwards or across sees heavenly sights and hears heavenly soundsWell Lord is it for the realisation of such samadhi states that monks lead the holy life under the Blessed Lord No Mahali there are other things higher and more perfect than these for the sake of which monks lead the holy life under meWhat are they Lord Mahali in one case a monk having abandoned three fetters becomes a StreamWinner not liable to states of woe firmly set on the path to enlightenmentAgain a monk who has abandoned the three fetters and has reduced his greed hatred and delusion becomes a OnceRetumer who having returned to this world once more will make an end of sufferingAgain a monk who has abandoned the five lower fetters takes a spontaneous rebirth in a higher sphere and without returning from that world gains enlightenmentAgain a monk through the extinction of the corruptions reaches in this very life the uncorrupted deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom which he has realised by his own insightThat is another thing higher and more perfect than these for the sake of which monks lead the holy life under meLord is there a path is there a method for the realisation of these things There is a path Mahali there is a methodAnd Lord what is this path what is this methodIt is the Noble Eightfold Pathnamely Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right ConcentrationThis is the path this is the way to the realisation of these thingsOnce Mahali I was staying at KosambI in the Ghosita ParkAnd two wanderers Mandissa and Jaliya the pupil of the woodenbowl asceticThen they said How is it friend Gotama is the soul the same as the body or is the soul one thing and the body anotherWell now friends you listen pay proper attention and I will explainYes friend they said and I went onFriends a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha remains in the first jhanaNow of one who thus knows and thus sees is it proper to say The soul is the same as the body or The soul is different from the bodyIt is not friendBut I thus know and seeand I do not say that the soul is either the same as or different from the body And the same with the second the third the fourth jhana The mind bends and tends towards knowledge and vision Now of one who thus knows and thus sees is it proper to say The soul is the same as the body or The soul is different from the bodyIt is not friendNow of one who thus knows and thus sees is it proper to say The soul is the same as the body or The soul is different from the bodyIt is not friendBut I thus know and seeBhikkhus there are these four foremost kinds of confidenceWhat fourTo whatever extent there are beings whether footless or with two feet four feet or many feet whether having form or formless whether percipient or

one who gives to the foremost concentrated upon the foremost DhammaO monks if people knew as I know the result of giving and sharing they would not eat without having given nor would they allow the stain of niggardliness to obsess them and take root in their mindsEven if it were their last morsel their last mouthful they would not eat without having shared it if there were someone to share it withBut monks as people do not know as I know the result of giving and sharing they eat without having given and the stain of niggardliness obsesses them and takes root in their mindsWhat eight One gives a gift from desire  One gives a gift from hatred  One gives a gift from delusion  One gives a gift from fear One gives a gift thinking Giving was practiced before by my father and forefathers I should not abandon this ancient family custom One gives a gift thinking Having given this gift with the breakup of the body after death I will be reborn in a good destination in a heavenly world  One gives a gift thinking When I am giving this gift my mind becomes placid and elation and joy a rise One gives a gift for the purpose of ornamenting the mind equipping the mind These are the eight grounds for giving confident in the Buddha the foremost  unsurpassed worthy of offeringsfor those confident in the foremost Sangha the unsurpassed field of meritthe foremost life span beauty and glory good reputation happiness and strengthhaving become a deva or a human being rejoices having attained the foremostBhikkhus there are these eight grounds for givingOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans near the Koliyan town named SajjanelaThen in the morning the Blessed One dressed took his bowl and robe and went to the residence of the Koliyan daughter Suppavasa where he sat down in the prepared seatThen the Koliyan daughter Suppavasa with her own hand served and satisfied the Blessed One with various kinds of delicious foodWhen the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowlThe Blessed One then said to herSuppavasa a female noble disciple who gives food gives the recipients four thingsWhat fourShe gives life beauty happiness and strengthHaving given life she partakes of life whether celestial or humanHaving given beauty she partakes of beauty whether celestial or humanHaving given happiness she partakes of happiness whether celestial or

down to one sideWhen one gives wellprepared food pure delicious and flavorful to the upright ones who are exalted and of excellent conduct that offering which links merit with merit is praised as very fruitful by the worldknowersThose recollecting such generosity dwell in the world inspired by joy Having rem oved the stain of miserliness and its root blameless they go to the heavenly abodeBhikkhus

and householders are very helpful to you They provide you with the requisites of robes almsfood lodgings and medicines in time of sicknessAnd you monks are very helpful to brahmins and householders as you teach them the Dhamma that is good in the beginning the middle and the end with the correct meaning and wording and you proclaim the spiritual life in its fulfillment and complete purityThus monks this spiritual life is lived with mutual support for the purpose of crossing the flood and making a complete end of sufferingBhikkhus there are these eight kinds of rebirth on account of givingWhat eightHere someone gives a gift to an ascetic or abrahm in food and drink clothing and vehicles garlands scents and unguents bedding dwellings and lightingWhatever he gives he expects something in

giving and that is for one who is virtuous I say not for one who is immoral and that is for one who is virtuous I say not for one who is immoralWhatever he gives he expects something in returnand that is for one who is virtuous I say not for one who is immoral and that is for one who is virtuous I say not for one who is immoralfor one without lust not for one with lustand said Reverend Nagita where is the Reverend Gotama now stayingand said Lord these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Lord and Otthaddha the Licchavi likewise with a large companybut does not hear heavenly soundsbut does not hear heavenly soundsThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodhas ParkThen Mahapajapati Gotami took a new pair of cloths and went to the Blessed OneAfter paying homage to him she sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One Venerable sir this new pair of cloths has been spun by me woven by me especially for the Blessed OneVenerable sir let the Blessed One accept it from me out of compassionWhen this was said the Blessed One told her Give it to the Sangha GotamiA second time she said to the Blessed One Venerable sirA second time and a third time the Blessed One told her Give it to the Sangha GotamiWhen you give it to the Sangha the offering will be made both to me and to the SanghaThen the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One Venerable sir let the Blessed One accept the new pair of cloths from Mahapajapati GotamiMahapajapati Gotami has been very helpful to the Blessed One venerable sir As his mothers sister she was his nurse his foster mother the one who gave him milk She suckled the Blessed One when his own mother diedThe Blessed One too has been very helpful to Mahapajapati GotamI venerable sirIt is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati Gotami has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaIt is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati Gotami abstains from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech and from wine liquor and intoxicants which are the basis of negligenceIt is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati Gotami is free from doubt about suffering about the origin of suffering about the cessation of suffering and about the way leading to the cessation of sufferingThe Blessed One has been very helpful to Mahapajapati GotamiThat is so Ananda that is soWhen one person owing to another has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha I say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying homage to him rising up for him according him reverential salutation and polite services and by providing robes almsfood resting places and medicinal requisitesWhen one person owing to another has come to possess perfect confidence in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and to possess the virtues loved by noble ones I say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying homage to himand medicinal requisitesThere are fourteen kinds of personal offerings AnandaOne gives a gift to the Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened this is the first kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to a paccekabuddha this is the second kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to an arahant disciple of the Tathagata this is the third kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of arahantship this is the fourth kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to a nonreturner this is the fifth kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of nonreturn this is the sixth kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to a oncereturner this is the seventh kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of oncereturn this is the eighth kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to a streamenterer this is the ninth kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of streamentry this is the tenth kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to one outside the Dispensation who is free from lust for sensual pleasures  this is the eleventh kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to a virtuous ordinary person this is the twelfth kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to an immoral ordinary person this is the thirteenth kind of personal offeringOne gives a gift to an animal this is the fourteenth kind of personal offeringHerein Ananda by giving a gift to an animal the offeriing may be expected to repay a hundredfold By giving a gift to an immoral ordinary person the offering may be expected to repay a thousandfold By giving a gift to a virtuous ordinary person the offering may be expected to repay a hundredthousandfold By giving a gift to one outside the Dispensation who is free from lust for sensual pleasures the offering may be expected to repay a hundredthousand times a hundredthousandfold By giving a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of streamentry the offering may be expected to repay incalculably immeasurably What then should be said about giving a gift to a streamenterer What should be said about giving a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of oncereturnto a oncereturnerto one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of nonreturnto a nonreturnerto one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of arahantshipto an arahant o a paccekabuddha What should be said about giving a gift to a Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightenedThere are seven kinds of offerings made to the Sangha AnandaOne gives a gift to a Sangha of both bhikkhus and bhikkhunls headed by the Buddha this is the first kind of offering made to the SanghaOne gives a gift to a Sangha of both bhikkhus and bhikkhunls after the Tathagata has attained final Nibbana this is the second kind of offering made to the SanghaOne gives a gift to a Sangha of bhikkhus this is the third kind of offering made to the SanghaOne gives a gift to a Sangha of bhikkhunis this is the fourth kind of offering made to the SanghaOne gives a gift saying Appoint so many bhikkhus and bhikkhunls for me from the Sangha this is the fifth kind of offering made to the SanghaOne gives a gift saying Appoint so many bhikkhus for me from the Sangha this is the sixth kind of offering made to the SanghaOne gives a gift saying Appoint so many bhikkhunls for me from the Sangha this is the seventh kind of offering made to the SanghaIn future times Ananda there will be members of the clan who are yellownecks immoral of evil characterPeople will give gifts to those immoral persons for the sake of the SanghaEven then I say an offering made to the Sangha is incalculable immeasurableAnd I say that in no way does a gift to a person individually ever have greater fruit than an offering made to the SanghaThere are four kinds of purification of offeringWhat fourThere is the offering that is purified by the giver not by the receiverThere is the offering that is purified by the receiver not by the giverThere is the offering that is purified neither by the giver nor by the receiverThere is the offering that is purified both by the giver and by the receiverAnd what is the offering that is purified by the giver not by the receiverHere the giver is virtuous of good character and the receiver is immoral of evil character Thus the offering is purified by the giver not by the receiverAnd what is the offering that is purified by the receiver not by the giverHere the giver is immoral of evil character and the receiver is virtuous of good character Thus the offering is purified by the receiver not by the giverAnd what is the offering that is purified neither by the giver nor by the receiverHere the giver is immoral of evil character and the receiver is immoral of evil character Thus the offering is purified neither by the giver nor by the receiverAnd what is the offering that is purified both by the giver and by the receiverHere the giver is virtuous of good character and the receiver is virtuous of good character Thus the offering is purified both by the giver and by the receiverThese are the four kinds of purification of offeringThat is what the Blessed One saidWhen the Sublime One had said that the Teacher said furtherWhen you give it to the Sangha the offering will be made both to me and to the Sanghaaccept it from me out of compassion and a third timeIt is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati GotamI possesses perfect confidence in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and that she possesses the virtues loved by noble onesWhen one person owing to another has come to abstain from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech and from wine liquor and intoxicants which are the basis of negligence I say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying homage to himand medicinal requisitesWhen one person owing to another has become free from doubt about suffering about the origin of suffering about the cessation of suffering and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering I say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying homage to himand medicinal requisitesWhen a virtuous person to an immoral person givesWith trusting heart a gift righteously obtainedPlacing faith that the fruit of action is greatThe givers virtue purifies the offeringWhen an immoral person to a virtuous person givesWith untrusting heart a gift unrighteously obtainedNor places faith that the fruit of action is greatThe receivers virtue purifies the offeringWhen an immoral person to an immoral person givesWith untrusting heart a gift unrighteously obtainedNor places faith that the fruit of action is greatNeithers virtue purifies the offeringWhen a virtuous person to a virtuous person givesWith trusting heart a gift righteously obtainedPlacing faith that the fruit of action is greatThat gift I say will come to full fruitionWhen a passionless person to a passionless person givesWith trusting heart a gift righteously obtainedPlacing faith that the fruit of action is greatThat gift I say is the best of worldly giftsBoth are endowed with faith charitable and selfcontrolled living their lives righteouslyThen many benefits accrue to them and they dwell at easeHaving practiced the Dhamma here the same in virtuous behavior and observancesMother and father are called Brahma and also first teachers They are worthy of gifts from their children for they have compassion for their offspring Therefore a wise person should revere them and treat themw ith honor One should serve them with food and drink with clothes and bedding by massaging and bathing them  and by washing their feet Because of that service to mother and father the wise praise one in this world and after death one rejoices

future birth all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the liberation of mind by lovingkindness The liberation of mind by lovingkindness surpasses them and shines forth bright and brilliantJust as in

brilliantOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas G rove Anathapindikas ParkThen the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and satdown to one sideThe Blessed One asked himAlms are given in my family Bhante but they consist of broken rice accompanied by rice gruelIf householder one gives alms coarse or excellent and one gives disrespectfully gives inconsiderately does not give with ones own hand gives what would be discarded gives without a view of future consequencesAlso ones children and wives and ones slaves servants and workers do not want to listen to one do not lend an ear and do not apply their minds to understandFor what reasonJust this is the result of actions that are done disrespectfullyIf householder one gives alms whether coarse or excellent and one gives respectfully gives considerately gives with ones own hand gives what would not be discarded gives with a view of future consequencesAlso ones children and wives and ones slaves servants and workers want to listen to one lend an ear and apply their minds to understandFor what reasonJust this is the result of actions that are done respectfullyIn the past householder there was a brahm in named VelamaHe gave such a great alms offering as thiseightyfour thousand golden bowls filled with silver eightyfour thousand silver bowls filled with gold eightyfour thousand bronze bowls filled with bullion eightyfour thousand elephants with golden ornaments golden banners covered with nets of gold thread eightyfour thousand chariots with upholstery of lion skins

eightyfour thousand kotis of cloths made of fine linen fine silk fine wool and fine cotton How much more of food and drink snacks meals refreshments and beverages It seemed to be flowing like riversYou might think householder He was someone else the brahmin Velama who on that occasion gave that great alms offeringBut you should not look at it in such a wayI myself was the brahmin VelamaNow householder at that alms offering there was no one worthy of offerings no one who purified the offeringEven more fruitful than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velama gave would it be to feed one person accomplished in viewEven more fruitful than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velama gave and feeding a hundred persons accomplished in view would it be to feed one oncereturnerEven more fruitful than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velama gave and feeding a hundred oncereturners would it be to feed onenonreturner Even more fruitful thanfeeding a hundred nonreturners would it be to feed one arahant Even more fruitful thanfeeding a hundred arahants would it be to feed one paccekabuddha Even more fruitful thanfeeding a hundred paccekabuddhas would it be to feed the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened Onewould it be to feed the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddhawould it be to build a dwelling dedicated to the Sangha of the four quartersw ould it be for one with a mind of confidence to go for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sanghawould it be for one with a mind of confidence to undertake the five training rules to abstain from the destruction of life to abstain from taking what is not given to abstain from sexual misconduct to abstain from false speech to abstain from liquor wine and intoxicants the basis for heedlessness Even more fruitfulwould it be to develop a mind of lovingkindness even for the time it takes to pull a cows udderEven more fruitful householder than the great alms offering that the brahmin Velama gave and

hundred nonreturners and feeding one arahant and feeding a hundred arahants and feeding one paccekabuddha and feeding a hundred paccekabuddhas and feeding the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One and feeding the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha and building a dwelling dedicated to the Sangha of the four quarters and for one with a mind of confidence to go for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and for one with a mind of confidence to undertake the five training rules to abstain from the destruction of lifeto abstain from liquor wine and intoxicants the basis for heedlessness and for one to develop a mind of lovingkindness even for the time it takes to pull a cows udder would it be to develop the perception of impermanence just for the time of a finger snapAre alms given in your family householder then wherever the result of that gift is produced for one ones mind does not incline toward the enjoyment of superb food nor toward the enjoyment of superb clothing nor toward the enjoyment of superb vehicles nor toward the enjoyment of whatever is superb among the five objects of isensual pleasurethen wherever the result of that gift is produced for one ones mind inclines toward the enjoyment of superb food toward the enjoyment of superb clothing toward the enjoyment of superb vehicles toward the enjoyment of whatever is superb among the five objects of sensual pleasurewho on that occasion gave that great alms offeringcame to me exchanged courtesies with meand sat down to one sideBhikkhus with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened One four astounding and amazing things become manifestWhat fourPeople delight in attachment take delight in attachment rejoice in attachment But when a Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma about nonattachment people wish to listen and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding itThis is the first astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened OnePeople delight in conceit take delight in conceit rejoice in conceitBut when a Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma for the removal of conceit people wish to listen and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding itThis is the second astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened OnePeople delight in excitement take delight in excitement rejoice in excitementBut when a Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma that leads to peace people wish to listen and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding itThis is the third astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened OnePeople are immersed in ignorance become like an egg completely envelopedBut when a Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma for the removal of ignorance people wish to listen and they lend an ear and set their minds on understanding itThis is the fourth astounding and amazing thing that becomes manifest with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened OneThese bhikkhus are the four astounding and amazing things that become manifest with the manifestation of a Tathagata an Arahant a Perfectly Enlightened OneBhikkhus before my enlightenment while I was just a bodhisatta not yet fully enlightened it occurred to me What is the gratification in the world What is the danger in it What is the escape from it Then bhikkhus it occurred to me The pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on the world this is the gratification in the worldThat the world is impermanent suffering and subject to change this is the danger in the worldThe removal and abandonment of desire and lust for the world this is the escape from the worldSo long bhikkhus as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification in the world as gratification the danger as danger and the escape from it as escape I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma in this population with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humansBut when I directly knew as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification the danger as danger and the escape from it as escape then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world withits devas and humansThe knowledge and vision arise in me Unshakable is my liberation of mind this is my last birth now there is no more renewed existenceBhikkhus I set out seeking the gratification in the worldWhatever gratification there is in the world  that I foundI have clearly seeri with wisdom just how far the gratification in the world extendsI set out seeking the danger in the worldWhatever danger there is in the world  that I foundI have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the danger in the world extendsI set out seeking the escape from the worldWhatever escape there is from the world  that I foundI have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the escape from the world extendsSo long bhikkhus as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification in the world as gratification the danger as danger and the escape from it as the escape I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humansBut when I directly knew as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification  the danger as danger and the escape from it as escape then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world withits devas and humansThe knowledge and vision arose in me Unshakable is my liberation of mind this is my last birth now there is no more renewed existenceBhikkhus if there were no gratification in the world beings would not become enamored of itIf there were no danger in the world beings would not become disenchanted with itIf there were no escape from the world beings would not escape from itSo long bhikkhus as beings have not directly known as they really are the gratification in the world as gratification the danger as danger and the escape from it as escape they have not escaped from this world with its devas Mara and Brahma from this population with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and hum ans they have not become detached from it released from it nor do they dwell with a mind rid of barriersBut when beings have directly known as it really is the gratification in the world as gratification the danger as danger and the escape from it as escape then they have escaped from this world withits devas and humans they have become detached from it released from it and they dwell with a mind rid of barriersbut because there is gratification in the world beings become enamored of itbut because there is danger in the world beings become disenchanted with itbut because there is an escape from the world beings escape from itBhikkhus there are three things that give no satiation by indulging in themWhat threeThere is no satiation by indulging in sleepThere is no satiation by indulging in liquor and wineThere is no satiation by indulging in sexual intercourseThese are the three things that give no satiation by indulging in themand I do not say that the soul is either the same as or different from the bodyThus the Lord spokeand Otthaddha the Licchavi rejoiced at his wordsAnd that is the reason why Sunakkhatta comes to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly sounds He knows There is nothing further hereBhikkhus in the past there was a teacher named Araka the founder of a spiritual sect one without lust for sensual pleasuresto whom he taught such a Dhamma as this Brahmins short is the life of human beings limited and fleeting it has much suffering much misery One should wisely understand this One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life for none who are born can escape deathJust as a drop of dew on the tip of a blade of grass will quickly vanish at sunrise and will not last long so too brahmins human life is like a drop of dew It is limited and fleeting it has much suffering much misery One should wisely understand this One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life for none who are born can escape deathJust as when thick drops of rain are pouring down a water bubble will quickly vanish and will not last long so too brahmins human life is like a water bubble It is limitedfor none who are born can escape deathJust as a line drawn on water with a stick will quickly vanish and will not last long so too brahmins human life is like a line drawn on water with a stick It is limitedfor none who are born can escape deathJust as a river flowing down from a mountain going a long distance with a swift current carrying along much flotsam will not stand still for a moment an instant a second but will rush on swirl and flow forward so too brahmins human life is like a mountain stream It is limitedfor none who are born can escape deathJust as a strong man might form a lump of spittle at the tip of his tongue and spit it out without difficulty so too brahmins human life is like a lump of spittle It is limitedfor none who are born can escape deathJust as a piece of meat thrown into an iron pan heated all day will quickly vanish and will not last long so too brahmins human life is like this piece of meat It is limitedfor none who are born can escape deathJust as when a cow to be slaughtered is being led to the slaughterhouse whatever leg she lifts she is close to slaughter close to death so too brahmins human life is like a cow doomed to slaughter It is limited and fleeting it has much suffering much misery One should wisely understand this One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life for none who are born can escape deathBut at that time bhikkhus the human life span was  years and girls were marriageable at the age of five hundredAt that time people had but six afflictions cold heat hunger thirst excrement and urineThough people had such long life spans and lived so long and though their afflictions were so few still the teacher Araka gave his disciples such a teaching Brahmins short is the life of human beingsfor none who are born can escape deathBut nowadays bhikkhus one could rightly say Short is the life of human beings limited and fleeting it has much suffering much misery One should wisely understand this One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life for none who are born can escape deathFor today one who lives long lives for a hundred years or a little moreAnd when living for a hundred years one lives just for three hundred seasons a hundred winters a hundred summers and a hundred rainsWhen living for tree hundred seasons one lives just for twelve hundred months four hundred winter months four hundred summer months and four hundred months of the rainsWhen living for twelve hundred months one lives just for twentyfour hundred fortnights eight hundred fortnights of winter eight hundred fortnights of summer and eight hundred fortnights of the rainsAnd when living for twentyfour hundred fortnights one lives just for  nights  nights of winter  nights of summer and  nights of the rainsAnd when living for  nights one eats just  meals  meals in winter  in summer and  in the rains And this includes the taking of mothers milk and the times when there are obstacles to mealsThese are the obstacles to meals one who is angry does not eat a meal one in pain does not eat a meal one who is ill does not eat a meal one observing the uposatha does not eat a meal and when not obtaining food one does not eat a mealThus bhikkhus for a human being with a life span of a hundred years I have reckoned his life span the limit of his life span the number of seasons years months and fortnights in his life the number of his nights days and meals and the obstacles to mealsWhatever bhikkhus should be done by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples seeking their welfare that I have done for you These are the feet of trees these are empty hutsMeditate bhikkhus do not be heedless Do not have cause to regret it laterThe teacher Araka had many hundreds of disciplesThis is our instruction to youThus have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Kosambi in the Ghosita ParkAnd two wanderers Mandissa and Jaliya the pupil of the woodenbowl ascetic came to him exchanged courtesies with him and sat down to one sideThus the Lord spokeand the two wanderers rejoiced at his wordsBhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen unwholesome qualities arise and arisen unwholesome qualities increase and expand so much as wrong viewFor one of wrong view unarisen unwholesome qualities arise and arisen unwholesome qualities increase and expandBhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities increase and expand so much as right viewFor one of right view unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities increase and expandBhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen wholesome qualities do not arise and arisen wholesome qualities decline so much as wrong view For one of wrong view unarisen wholesome qualities do not arise and arisen wholesome qualities declineBhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen unwholesome qualities do not arise and arisen unwholesome qualities decline so much as right viewFor one of right view unarisen unwholesome qualities do not arise and arisen unwholesome qualities declineBhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen wrong view arises and arisen wrong view increases so much as careless attentionFor one of careless attention unarisen wrong view arises and arisen wrong view increasesBhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen right view arises and arisen right view increases so much as careful attentionFor one of careful attention unarisen right view arises and arisen right view increasesBhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which with the breakup of the body after death  beings are reborn in the plane of misery in a bad destination in the lower world in hell so much as wrong viewPossessing wrong view with the breakup of the body after death beings are reborn in the plane of misery in a bad destination in the lower world in hellBhikkhus I do not see even a single thing on account of which with the breakup of the body after death beings are reborn in a good destination in a heavenly world so much as right viewPossessing right view with the breakup of the body after death beings are reborn in a good destination in a heavenly worldBhikkhus for a person of wrong view whatever bodily kamma verbal kamma and mental kamma he instigates and undertakes in accordance with that view and whatever his volition yearning inclination and volitional activities all lead to what is unwished for undesired and disagreeable to harm and sufferingFor what reasonBecause the view is badSuppose bhikkhus a seed of neem bitter cucumber or bitter gourd were planted in moist soil Whatever nutrients it takes up from the soil and from the water would all lead to its bitter pungent and disagreeable flavorFor what reasonBecause the seed is badSo too for a person of wrong viewall lead to what is unwished for undesired and disagreeable to harm and sufferingFor what reasonBecause the view is badBhikkhus for a person of right view whatever bodily kamma verbal kamma and mental kamma he instigates and undertakes in accordance with that view and whatever his volition yearning inclination and volitional activities all lead to what is wished for desired and agreeable to wellbeing and happinessFor what reasonBecause the view is goodSuppose bhikkhus a seed of sugar cane hill rice or grape were planted in moist soil Whatever nutrients it takes up from the soil and from the water would all lead to its sweet agreeable and delectable flavorFor what reasonBecause the seed is goodSo too for a person of right viewall lead to what is wished for desired and agreeable to welfare and happinessFor what reasonBecause the view is goodOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow at that time a number of ascetics and brahmins wanderers of other sects were living around Savatthi They held various views beliefs and opinions and propagated various viewsThen a number of monks entered Savatthi on almsroundHaving returned after their meal they approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one sideThey do not know what is the Dhamma and what is not the Dhamma and thus they are so quarrelsome and disputatiousFormerly monks there was a king in SavatthiWhen the man had done soTo some of the blind men he presented the head of the elephantto some the earThose who had been shown the head of the elephant replied An elephant your majesty is just like a water jarThose who had been shown the ear replied An elephant is just like a winnowing basketThose who had been shown the tusk replied An elephant is just like a plowshareThose who had been shown the trunk replied An elephant is just like a plow poleThose who had been shown the body replied An elephant is just like a storeroomThen saying An elephant is like this an elephant is not like that An elephant is not like this an elephant is like that  they fought each other with their fistsAnd the king was delightedEven so monks are the wanderers of other sects blind and sightlesswho addressed a man and asked him to round up all the persons in the city who were blind from birthMonks held by two kinds of views some devas and human beings hold back and some overreach only those with vision seeAnd how monks do some hold backDevas and human beings delight in existence are delighted with existence rejoice in existence When the Dhamma is taught to them for the cessation of existence their minds do not enter into it acquire confidence in it settle upon it or resolve upon itThus monks do some hold backAnd how monks do some overreachNow some are troubled ashamed and disgusted by this very same existence and they rejoice in nonexistence saying In as much as this self good sirs is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death this is peaceful this is excellent this is just soThus monks do some overreachAnd how monks do those with vision seeHere a monk sees what has come to be as having come to be Having seen it thus he practices the course for disenchantment for dispassion for the cessation of what has come to beThus monks do those with vision seeBhikkhus there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the worldAnd they were quarrelsome disputatious wrangling wounding each other with verbal darts saying The Dhamma is like this the Dhamma is not like that The Dhamma is not like this the Dhamma is like that and told him what they had seenThe Blessed One said Monks wanderers of other sects are blind and sightless They do not know what is beneficial and harmfulthe king asked the man to show the blind men an elephantWhen he reported to the king what he had donethe king went to the blind men and asked themTell me blind men what is an elephant like to others a tuskthe trunkthe bodya footthe hindquartersthe tailor the tuft at the end of the tail And to each one he said This is an elephantand thus they become quarrelsome disputatious and wrangling wounding each other with verbal dartsWhat four Here bhikkhus secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states some person enters and dwells in the first jhana which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by thought and examinationHe relishes it desires it and finds satisfaction in itIf he is firm in it focused on it often dwells in it and has not lost it when he dies he is reborn in companionship w ith the devas of Brahmas companyThe life span of the devas of Brahmas company is an eonThe worldling remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he goes to hell to the animal realm or to the sphere of afflicted spiritsBut the Blessed Ones disciple remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he attains final nibbana in that very same state of existenceThis is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling that is when there is future destination and rebirthAgain some person with the subsiding of thought and examination enters and dwells in the second jhana which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration without thought and examinationHe relishes it desires it and finds satisfaction in itIf he is firm in it focused on it often dwells in it and has not lost it when he dies he is reborn in companionship with the devas of streaming radianceThe life span of the devas of streaming radiance is two eonsThe worldling remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he goes to hell to the animal realm or to the sphere of afflicted spiritsBut the Blessed Ones disciple remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he attains final nibbana in that very same state of existenceThis is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling that is when there is future destination and rebirthAgain some person with the fading away as well of rapture dwells equanimous and mindful and clearly comprehending he experiences pleasure with the body he enters and dwells in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare He is equanimous mindful one who dwells happilyHe relishes it desires it and finds satisfaction in itIf he is firm in it focused on it often dwells in it and has not lost it when he dies he is reborn in companionship with the devas of refulgent gloryThe life span of the devas of refulgent glory is four eonsThe worldling remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he goes to hell to the animal realm or to the sphere of afflicted spiritsBut the Blessed Ones disciple remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he attains final nibbana in that very same state of existenceThis is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling that is when there is future destination and rebirthAgain some person with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection enters and dwells in the fourth jhana neither painful nor pleasant which has purification of mindfulness by equanimityHe relishes it desires it and finds satisfaction in itIf he is firm in it focused on it often dwells in it and has not lost it when he dies he is reborn in companionship with the devas of great fruitThe life span of the devas of great fruit is five hundred eonsThe worldling remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he goes to hell to the animal realm or to the sphere of afflicted spiritsBut the Blessed Ones disciple remains there all his life and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas he attains final nibbana in that very same state of existenceThis is the distinction the disparity the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling that is when there is future destination and rebirthThese bhikkhus are the four kinds of persons found existing in the worldI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryAnd on that occasion there were many contemplatives brahmans  wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing viewsSome of the contemplatives  brahmans held this doctrine this view The cosmos is eternal Only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThe cosmos is finite Only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessAnd they kept on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like thisThen in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and  carrying their bowls  robes  went into Sāvatthī for almsHaving gone for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideMonks the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyelessThey dont know what is beneficial and what is harmfulThey dont know what is the Dhamma and what is nonDhamma Not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is Dhamma and what is nonDhamma they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like thisOnce monks in this same Sāvatthī there was a certain kingand the king said to a certain man Come my good man Gather together all the people in Sāvatthī who have been blind from birthResponding As you say your majesty to the king the man  having rounded up all the people in Sāvatthī who had been blind from birth  went to the king and on arrival said Your majesty the people in Sāvatthī who have been blind from birth have been gathered togetherVery well then I say show the blind people an elephantResponding As you say your majesty to the king the man showed the blind people an elephantTo some of the blind people he showed the elephants head saying This blind people is what an elephant is likeTo some of them he showed the elephants ear saying This blind people is what an elephant is likeTo some of them he showed the elephants tuskThen having shown the blind people the elephant the man went to the king and on arrival said Your majesty the blind people have seen the elephant May your majesty do what you think it is now time to doThen the king went to the blind people and on arrival asked them Blind people have you seen the elephant Yes your majesty We have seen the elephantNow tell me blind people what the elephant is likeThe blind people who had been shown the elephants head said The elephant your majesty is just like a jarThose who had been shown the elephants ear said The elephant your majesty is just like a winnowing basketThose who had been shown the elephants tusk said The elephant your majesty is just like plowshareThose who had been shown the elephants trunk said The elephant your majesty is just like the pole of a plowThose who had been shown the elephants body said The elephant your majesty is just like a granaryThose who had been shown the elephants foot said The elephant your majesty is just like a postThose who had been shown the elephants hindquarters said The elephant your majesty is just like a mortarThose who had been shown the elephants tail said The elephant your majesty is just like a pestleThose who had been shown the tuft at the end of the elephants tail said The elephant your majesty is just like a broomSaying The elephant is like this its not like that The elephants not like that its like this they struck one another with their fistsThat gratified the kingIn the same way monks the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyelessThey dont know what is beneficial and what is harmfulThey dont know what is the Dhamma and what is nonDhamma Not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is Dhamma and what is nonDhamma they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like thisThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedSome of the contemplatives  brahmans held this doctrine this view The cosmos is not eternalThe cosmos is infiniteThe soul is the same thing as the bodyThe soul is one thing and the body anotherAfter death a Tathāgata existsAfter death a Tathāgata does not existAfter death a Tathāgata both exists  does not existAfter death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not existthe elephants trunkthe elephants bodythe elephants footthe elephants hindquartersthe elephants tailthe tuft at the end of the elephants tail saying This blind people is what an elephant is likeWith regard to these things theyre attached  some contemplatives  brahmanswith differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views And they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like thisLord there are many contemplatives brahmans  wanderers of various sects living around SāvatthīThey quarrel  fight  people seeing one sideAs they were sitting there they said to the Blessed OneAt Savatthi Bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginningA first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingWhat do you think bhikkhus which is more the stream of tears that you have shed as you roamed and wandered on through this long course weeping and wailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable  this or the water in the four great oceans As we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One venerable sir the stream of tears that we have shed as we roamed and wandered through this long course weeping and wailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable  this alone is more than the water in the four great oceansGood good bhikkhus It is good that you understand the Dhamrna taught by me in such a wayThe stream of tears that you have shed as you roamed and wandered through this long course weeping and wailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable  this alone is more than the water in the four great oceansFor a long time bhikkhus you have experienced the death of a mother as you have experienced this weeping and wailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable the stream of tears that you have shed is more than the water in the four great oceansFor a long time bhikkhus you have experienced the death of a father  the death of a brother  the death of a sister  the death of a son  the death of a daughter  the loss of relatives  the loss of wealth  loss through illnessFor what reasonBecause bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning  It is enough to experience revulsion towards all formations enough to become dispassionate towards them enough to be liberated from themas you have experienced this weeping and wailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable the stream of tears that you have shed is more than the water in the four great oceansAt Rajagaha in the Bamboo GroveThen thirty bhikkhus from Pava approached the Blessed One  all forest dwellers almsfood eaters ragrobe wearers triplerobe users yet all were still with fetters Having approached they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one sideThen it occurred to the Blessed One These thirty bhikkhus from Pava are all forest dwellers almsfood eaters ragrobe wearers triplerobe users yet all are still with fettersLet me teach them the Dhamma in such a way that while they are sitting in these very seats their minds will be liberated from the taints by nonclingingThen the Blessed One addressed those bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus The Blessed One said thisA first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingWhat do you think bhikkhus which is more the stream of blood that you have shed when you were beheaded as you roamed and wandered on through this long coursethis or the water in the four great oceans As we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One venerable sir the stream of blood that we have shed when our heads were cut off as we roamed and wandered on through this long coursethis alone is more than the water in the four great oceansGood good bhikkhus It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in such a wayThe stream of blood that you have shed as you roamed and wandered on through this long course this alone is more than the water in the four great oceansFor a long time bhikkhus you have been cows and when as cows you were beheaded the stream of blood that you shed is greater than the waters in the four great oceansFor what reasonBecause bhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginning  It is enough to be liberated from themThis is what the Blessed One saidElated those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed Ones statementVenerable sir  those bhikkhus repliedBhikkhus this samsara is without discoverable beginninghighwaymenFor a long time you have been buffalo sheep goats deer chickens and pigs  For a long time you have been arrested as burglarsand adulterers and when you were beheaded the stream of blood that you shed is greater than the water in the four great oceansAnd while this exposition was being spoken the minds of the thirty bhikkhus from Pava were liberated from the taints by nonclingingAt SavatthiBhikkhus if wanderers of other sects ask you For what purpose friends is the holy life lived under the ascetic Gotama  being asked thus you should answer them thus It is friends

approached he paid homage to the Blessed One sat down to one side and said to him Venerable sir this is half of the holy lifethat is good friendship good companionship good comradeshipNot so Ananda Not so AnandaThis is the entire holy life Ananda that is good friendship good companionship good comradeshipAnd how Ananda does a bhikkhu who has a good friend a good companion a good comrade develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold PathHere Ananda a bhikkhu develops right view which is based upon seclusion dispassion and cessation maturing in release He develops right intention  right speech  right action  right livelihood  right effort right mindfulness  right concentration which is based upon seclusion dispassion and cessation maturing in releaseIt is in this way Ananda that a bhikkhu who has a good friend a good companion a good comrade develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold PathBy this method Ananda it may be understood how the entire holy life is good friendship good companionship good comradeshipWhen a bhikkhu has a good friend a good companion a good comrade it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold PathBy the following method too Ananda it may be understood how the entire holy life is good friendship good companionship good comradeshipby relying upon me as a good friend Ananda beings subject to birth are freed from birth beings subject to aging are freed from aging beings subject to death are freed from death beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair are freed from sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despairBhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when undeveloped is so unwieldy as the mindAn undeveloped mind is unwieldyBhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when developed is so wieldy as the mindA developed mind is wieldyBhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when undeveloped leads to such great harm as the mindAn undeveloped mind leads to great

undeveloped and uncultivated brings sufferingBhikkhus I do not see even one other thing that when developed and cultivated brings such happiness as the mindThe mind when developed and cultivated brings happinessOn one occasion the Venerable Ananda was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas ParkThere the Venerable Ananda addressed the bhikkhus Friends bhikkhus Friend those bhikkhus repliedFriends whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni has declared the attainment of arahantship in my presence has done so by these four paths or by a certain one among themWhat fourHere a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by serenityAs he is developing insight preceded by serenity the path is generatedHe pursues this path develops it and cultivates itAs he is pursuing developing and cultivating this path the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprootedAgain a bhikkhu develops serenity preceded by insightAs he is developing serenity preceded by insight the path is generatedHe pursues this path develops it and cultivates itAs he is pursuing developing and cultivating this path the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprootedAgain a bhikkhu develops serenity and insight in conjunctionAs he is developing serenity and insight in conjunction the path is generatedHe pursues this path develops it and cultivates itAs he is pursuing developing and cultivating this path the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprootedAgain a bhikkhus mind is seized by restlessness about the DhammaBut there comes an occasion when his mind becomes internally steady composed unified and concentratedThen the path is generated in himHe pursues this path develops it and cultivates itAs he is pursuing developing and cultivating this path the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprootedWhatever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni friends has declared the attainment of arahantship in my presence has done so by these four paths or by a certain one among themThe Venerable Ananda said thisBhikkhus there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the worldBhikkhus there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the worldWhat fourHere some person gains internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaSome other person gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mindStill another gains neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaAnd still another gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaBhikkhus the person among these who gains internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomen a should base himself on internal serenity of mind and make an effort to gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaThen some time later he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaThe person who gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind should base himself on the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and make an effort to gain internal serenity of mindThen sometime later he gains both the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and internal serenity of mindThe person who gainsneither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena should put forth extraordinary desire effort zeal enthusiasm indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesom equalitiesJust as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire effort zeal enthusiasm  indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to extinguish the fire on his clothes or head so that person should put forth extraordinary desire effort zeal enthusiasm  indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesome qualitiesThen some time later he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaThe person who gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena should base him self on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taintsThese bhikkhus are the four kinds of persons found existing in the worldWhat fourHere bhikkhus some person gains internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaSome other person gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mindStill another gains neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaAnd still another gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaBhikkhus the person among these who gains internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena should approach one who gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and inquiry of him How friend should conditioned phenomena be seenHow should conditioned phenomena be exploredHow should conditioned phenomena be discerned by insight The other then answers him as he has seen and understood the matter thus Conditioned phenomena should be seen in such a way explored in such a way discerned by insight in such a wayThen some time later he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaThe person who gains the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind should approach one who gains internal serenity of mind and inquire of him How friend should the mind be steadiedHow should the mind be composedHow should the mind be unifiedHow should the mind be concentratedThe other then answers him as he has seen and understood the matter thus The mind should be steadied in such a way composed in such a way unified in such a way concentrated in such a wayThen some time later he gains both the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and internal serenity of mindThe person who gains neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena should approach one who gains both and inquire of him How friend should the mind be steadiedHow should the mind be composedHow should the mind be unifiedHow should the mind be concentratedHow should conditioned phenomena be seenHow should conditioned phenomena be exploredHow should conditioned phenomena be discerned by insight The other then answers him as he has seen and Understood the matter thus The mind should be steadied in such a way composed in such a way unified in such a way concentrated in such a way Conditioned phenomena should be seen in such a way explored in such a way discerned by insight in such a wayThen some time later he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomenaThe person who gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort for the destruction of the taintsThese bhikkhus are the four kinds of persons found existing in the worldAt SavatthiThen the brahmin Sangarava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to oneside and said to the Blessed OneMaster Gotama what is the cause

enlightenment brahmin are nonobstructions nonhindrances noncorruptions of the mind when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberationWhat sevenThe enightenment factor of mindfulness is a nonobstruction  The enlightenment factor of equanimity is a nonobstructionThese seven factors of enlightenment are nonobstructions nonhindrances noncorruptions of the mind when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberationWhen this was said the brahmin Sangarava said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama  From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeBhikkhus there are gross defilements of gold soil grit and gravelNow the soil remover or his apprentice first pours the gold into a trough and washes rinses and cleans itWhen that has been removed and eliminated there still remain middlesize defilements in the gold fine grit and coarse sandThe soil remover or his apprentice washes rinses and cleans it againWhen that has been removed and eliminated there still remain subtle defilements in the gold fine sand and black dustSo the soil remover or his apprentice washes rinses and cleans it againWhen that has been removed and eliminated only grains of gold remainThe goldsmith or his apprentice now pours the gold into a melting pot and fans it melts it and smelts itBut even when this has been done the gold is not yet settled and the dross has not yet been entirely removedThe gold is not yet malleable wieldy and luminous but still brittle and not properly fit for workBut as the goldsmith or his apprentice continues to fan melt and smelt the gold a time comes when the gold is settled and the dross has been entirely removed so that the gold becomes malleable wieldy and luminous pliant and properly fit for workThen whatever kind of ornament the goldsmith wishes to make from it  whether a bracelet earrings a necklace or a golden garland  he can achieve his purposeSo too bhikkhus when a bhikkhu is devoted to the higher mind there are in him gross defilements bodily verbal and mental misconduct An earnest capable bhikkhu abandons dispels terminates and obliterates themWhen this has been done there remain in him middling defilements sensual thoughts thoughts of ill will and thoughts of harming An earnest capable bhikkhu abandons dispels terminates and obliterates themWhen this has been done there remain in him subtle defilements thoughts about his relations thoughts about his country and thoughts about his reputation An earnest capable bhikkhu abandons dispels terminates and obliterates themWhen this has been done then there remain thoughts connected with the DhammaThat concentration is not peaceful and sublime not gained by full tranquilization not attained to unification but is reined in and checked by force fully suppressing the defilementsBut bhikkhus there comes a time when his mind becomes internally steady composed unified and concentratedThat concentration is peaceful and sublime gained by full tranquilization and attained to unification it is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing the defilementsThen there being a suitable basis he is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which he might incline his mindIf he wishes May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency having been one may I become many having been many may I become one may I appear and vanish may I go unhindered through a wall through a rampart through a mountain as though through space may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were water may I walk on w ater with out sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged may I travel in space like a bird with my hand may I touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahma world he is capable of realizing it there being a suitable basisIf he wishes May I with the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human hear both kinds of sounds the divine and human those that are far as well as near he is capable of realizing it there being a suitable basisIf he wishes May I understand the minds of other beings and persons having encompassed them with my own mind May I understand a mind with lust as a mind with lust and a mind without lust as a mind without lust a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted a surpassable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated he is capable of realizing it there being a suitable basisIf he wishes May I recollect my manifold past abodes that is one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many eons of worlddissolution many eons of worldevolution many eons of worlddissolution and worldevolution thus There I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my life span passing away from there I was reborn elsewhere and there too I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my life span passing away from there I was reborn here  may I thus recollect my manifold past abodes with their aspects and details he is capable of realizing it there being a suitable basisIf he wishes May I with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human see beings passing away and being reborn inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and understand how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus These beings who engaged in misconduct by body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong view and undertook kamma based on wrong view with the breakup of the body after death have been reborn in the plane of misery in a bad destination in the lower world in hell but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right view and undertook kamma based on right view with the breakup of the body after death have been reborn in a good destination in the heavenly world  thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human may I see beings passing away and being reborn inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and understand how beings fare in accordance with their kamma he is capable of realizing it there being a suitable basisIf he wishes May I with the destruction of the taints in this very life realize for myself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom and having entered upon it may I dwell in it he is capable of realizing it there being a suitable basisOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree ParkThen

Venerable Ananda saw the Venerable Sariputta coming in the distanceOn one occasion the Venerable Sariputta was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel SanctuaryThen in the morning the Venerable Sariputta dressed and taking bowl and robe entered Rajagaha for alms Then when he had walked for alms on continuous alms round in Rajagaha he ate that almsfood leaning against a certain wallThen the female wanderer Sucimukhi approached the Venerable Sariputta and said to himI dont eat facing downwardssisterThen ascetic do you eat facing upwards I dont eat facing upwards sisterThen asceticdo you eat facing the fourquarters I dont eat facingthe four quarters sisterThen ascetic do you eat facingthe intermediate directions I dont eat facing the intermediate directions sisterWhen you are asked Ascetic do you eat facing downwardsDo you eat facing the intermediate directions you reply I dont eat thus sisterHow then do you eat ascetic Sister those ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by the debased art of geomancy wrong means of livelihood these are called ascetics and brahmins who eat facing downwardsThose ascetics and brahmins who earn their living by the debased art of astrology  a wrong means of livelihood  these are called ascetics and brahmins who eat facing upwardsThose ascetic sand brahmins who earn their living by undertaking to go on errands and run

the debased art of astrology or by undertaking to go on errands and run messages or by the debased art of palmistryI seek almsfood righteously and having sought it I eat my almsfood righteouslyThen the female wanderer Sucimukhi went from street to street and fromsquare to square in Rajagaha announcing The ascetics following the Sakyan son eat righteous food they eat blameless foodGive almsfood to the ascetics following the Sakyan sonAscetic do you eat facing downwards Thus have I heardOnce the Lord was staying at Ujunnaya in the deerpark of KannakatthaleThen he said Friend Gotama I have heard it said The ascetic Gotama disapproves of all austerities and censures and blames all those who lead a harsh life of selfmortificationNow are those who say this telling the truth and do they not slander the Lord Gotama with lies Do they explain the truth about his Dhamma and what pertains to it or does some fellow teacher of a different sect deserve to be blamed for this statementWe would like to see the Lord Gotama refute this chargeKassapa those who say this are not telling the truth they slander me with liesThe situation occurs Kassapa that I see one practiser of mortification and with the divine eye which is purified beyond the sight of humans I see him arising after death at the breakingup of the body in a place of woe a baleful state a place of destruction in hellAgain I see one practiser of mortification arising after death in a good place a heavenly stateSince I can see as it is the arising the destiny the death and rearising of those ascetics how could I disapprove of all austerities and censure and blame all those who lead a harsh life of selfmortificationKassapa there are some ascetics and Brahmins who are wise skilled practised in disputation splitters of hairs acutewho walk deverly along the paths of viewsSometimes their views accord with mine sometimes they do notWhat they sometimes applaud we sometimes applaudWhat they sometimes do not applaud we sometimes do not applaudWhat we sometimes applaud they sometimes applaudOn approaching them I say In these things there is no agreement let us leave them asideIn these things there is agreement there let the wise take up crossquestion and criticise these matters with the teachers or with their followers saying Of those things that are unskilful and reckoned as such censurable to be refrained from unbefitting a Noble One black and reckoned as such who is there who has completely abandoned such things and is free from them the ascetic Gotama or some other venerable teachersIt may be that the wise say Of those things that are unskilledIn this case the wise give us the greatest share of praiseOr the wise may say Of those things that are skilled and reckoned as jsuch blameless to be practised fitting for a Noble One bright and reckoned as suchwho is there who has completely mastered them  the ascetic Gotama or some other reverend teachersOr the wise may say Of these thingsKassapa there is a path there is a course of training whereby one who has followed it will know and see for himself The ascetic Gotama speaks at the proper time what is true to the point  the Dhamma and the disciplineWhat is this path and this course of trainingIt is the Noble Eightfold PathThis is the path whereby one may know and see for oneself The ascetic Gotama speaks at the proper time what is true to the point  the Dhamma and the discipline At this Kassapa said to the Lord Gotama these ascetic practices of certain practisers of selfmortification are considered proper to thema naked ascetic uses

is offered living on filth and addicted to the practice one who drinks no water and is addicted to the practice or he dwells intent on the practice of going to bathe three times before evening but if his morality his heart and his wisdom are not developed and brought to realisationBut Kassapa when a monk develops nonenmity nonillwill and a heart full of lovingkindness and abandoning the corruptions realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom having realised it in this very life by his own insightthen Kassapa that monk is termed an ascetic and a BrahminAt this Kassapa said to the Lord Reverend Gotama it is hard to be an ascetic it is hard to be a BrahminSo they say in the world Kassapa It is hard to be an ascetic it is hard to be a BrahminBut Kassapa because there is a very different kind of asceticism beside this therefore it is right to say It is hard to be an ascetic it is hard to be a BrahminBut Kassapa when a monk develops nonenmity nonillwill and a heart full of loving kindness At this Kaseapa said to the Lord Reverend Gotama it is hard to understand an ascetic it is hard to understand a BrahminSo they say in the world Kassapa It is hard to understand an ascetic it is hard to understand a BrahminIf a naked ascetic were to do all these thingsBut Kassapa because there is a very different kind of asceticism and Brahmanism beside this it is right to say It is hard to understand an ascetic or a BrahminBut Kassapa when a monk develops nonenmity nonillwill and a heart full of lovingkindness and abandoning the corruptions realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom having realised it in this very life by his own insightThen Kassapa said to the Lord Reverend Gotama what then is the development of morality of the heart and of wisdom Kassapa a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fully enlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed He having realised it by his own superknowledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and people He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fully perfected and purified holy life A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities and attains the four jhanas That is the perfection of the heartHe attains various insights and the cessation of the corruptions That is the perfection of wisdomKassapa there are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach moralityThey praise morality in various waysBut as regards the highest Ariyan morality Kassapa I do not see any who have surpassed me in thisI am supreme in this regard in supermoralityThere are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach selfmortification and scrupulous austerityBut as regards the highest Ariyan selfmortification and austerity Kassapa I do not see any who have surpassed me in thisI am supreme in this regard in superausterityThere are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach wisdomThey praise wisdom in various waysBut as regards the highest Ariyan wisdom Kassapa I do not see any who have surpassed me in thisI am supreme in this regard in superwisdomThere are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach liberationThey praise liberation in various waysBut as regards the highest Ariyan liberation Kassapa I do not see any who have surpassed me in thisI am supreme in this regard in superliberationKassapa it may be that wanderers of other sects will say The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar but only in empty places not in companyThey should be told that this is not trueOr they may say The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar and in company but he does so without confidenceThey should be told that this is not trueOr they may say The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar and in company and confidently but they do not question himThey should be told that this is not true The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roarand they question himOr they may say and they question him but he does not answer  Or they may say  he answers but he does not win them over with his answersOr they may say but they dont find it pleasingOr they may say but they are not satisfied with what they have heard  Or they may say  but they dont behave as if they were satisfied  Or they may say  but they are not on the path of truth Or they may say but they are not satisfied with the practiceThey should be told that this is not trueOnce Kassapa I was staying at Rajagaha at the Vultures PeakLord who on hearing Dhamma from you would fail to be delighted beyond all measureI am delighted beyond all measureExcellent Lord excellentIt is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various waysLord may I receive the goingforth at the Lords hands may I receive ordinationKassapa whoever has formerly belonged to another sect and wishes for the goingforth or ordination in this Dhamma and discipline must wait four months and at the end of four months probation the monks who are established in mind will give him the goingforth and the monastic ordinationBut there can be a distinction of persons in thisLord if such is the caseThen Kassapa received the goingforth from the Lord himself and the monastic ordinationAnd the newlyordained Venerable Kassapa alone secluded unwearying zealous and resolute in a short time attained that for which young men of good birth go forth from the household life into homelessness that unexcelled culmination of the holy life having realised it here and now by his own superknowledge and dwelt therein knowing
