Then you must search Jetas Wood
Then those wanderers from other sects after searching Jetas Wood
lifting the body up from the trenchpit where it had been buried
putting it on a bier and entering Sāvatthī
going from road to road from crossroads to crossroads
made people find fault saying
See Masters what the Sakyan ascetics have done
shameless are these Sakyan ascetics lacking in virtue
of bad character speakers of what is false not living the spiritual life
But they will claim that they live by Dhamma live in peace live spiritually
speak the truth are virtuous and are of good character
They have no asceticism they have no spirituality
their asceticism has perished their spirituality has perished
Where is their asceticism Where is their spirituality
They have gone away from asceticism they have gone away from spirituality
For what man having done what a man can do
would deprive a woman of life
That at that time the people in Sāvatthī after seeing the monks
with vulgar and rough words scolded abused annoyed and troubled them saying
Shameless are these Sakyan ascetics lacking in virtue
of bad character speakers of what is false not living the spiritual life
But they will claim that they live by Dhamma live in peace live spiritually
speak the truth are virtuous and are of good character
They have no asceticism they have no spirituality
their asceticism has perished their spirituality has perished
Where is their asceticism Where is their spirituality
They have gone away from asceticism they have gone away from spirituality
For what man having done what a man can do
would deprive a woman of life
Then many monks having dressed in the morning time
after picking up their bowls and robes entered Sāvatthī for alms
and after walking for alms in Sāvatthī while returning from the almsround after the meal
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
At present reverend Sir the people in Sāvatthī after seeing the monks
with vulgar and rough words scold abuse annoy and trouble them saying
Shameless are these Sakyan ascetics lacking in virtue
of bad character speakers of what is false not living the spiritual life
But they will claim that they live by Dhamma live in peace live spiritually
speak the truth are virtuous and are of good character
They have no asceticism they have no spirituality
their asceticism has perished their spirituality has perished
Where is their asceticism Where is their spirituality
They have gone away from asceticism they have gone away from spirituality
For what man having done what a man can do
would deprive a woman of life 
This noise will not last long monks it will last for only seven days
and with the passing of seven days it will disappear
So monks when those people after seeing the monks
with vulgar and rough words scold abuse annoy and trouble them
you should reprove them with this verse
He who speaks what is untrue goes to the nether regions
Also he who says I did not do what he has done
Both of those men who have performed base deeds
Are the same when they have passed away in the other world 
Then those monks having mastered that verse in the presence of the Fortunate One
when those people after seeing the monks
with vulgar and rough words scolded abused annoyed and troubled them
reproved them with this verse
He who speaks what is untrue goes to the nether regions
Also he who says I did not do what he has done
Both of those men who have performed base deeds
Are the same when they have passed away to the other world
Then this occurred to those people These Sakyan ascetics are not the doers
this wasn't done by them these Sakyan ascetics are asserting the truth
That noise did not last long it only lasted for seven days
and with the passing of seven days it disappeared
Then many monks went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
how well spoken that was reverend Sir by the Fortunate One
This noise will not last long monks it will last for only seven days
and with the passing of seven days it will disappear
That noise reverend Sir has disappeared
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Unrestrained the people pierce others with words
Like they pierce an elephant with arrows in a battle
But having heard that rough speech broadcast around
A monk should bear it with an uncorrupt mind
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
in Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels Feeding Place
Then at that time
venerable Sāriputta and venerable Mahāmoggallāna
were living at the Pigeon Vale
Then at that time venerable Sāriputta on a moonlight night
with his hair freshly shaved off was sitting in the open air
having attained a certain concentration
Then at that time two yakkha friends
were going from the Northern region to the Southern region
with some business or other
Those yakkhas saw venerable Sāriputta on that moonlight night
with his hair freshly shaved off sat in the open air
And after seeing him one of those yakkhas said this to the second yakkha
It occurs to me friend to give a blow on this ascetics head
When that was said that yakkha said this to the other yakkha
Enough friend don't strike the ascetic
Eminent is the ascetic friend of great power of great majesty
For a second time that yakkha said this to the other yakkha
It occurs to me friend to give a blow on this ascetics head
For a second time that yakkha said this to the other yakkha
Enough friend don't strike the ascetic
Eminent is the ascetic friend of great power of great majesty
For a third time that yakkha said this to the other yakkha
It occurs to me friend to give a blow on this ascetics head
For a third time that yakkha said this to the other yakkha
Enough friend don't strike the ascetic
Eminent is the ascetic friend of great power of great majesty
Then the yakkha taking no notice of that other yakkha
gave a blow on the elder venerable Sāriputtas head
it was such a great blow that with that blow
a seven or seven and a half cubit Nāga elephant might have been felled
or a great mountain top might have been burst open
Then that yakkha calling out I'm burning I'm burning
right there and then fell into the Great Hell
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna saw
with his divineeye which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
that yakkha giving a blow on venerable Sāriputtas head
And after seeing it he went to venerable Sāriputtā
and after going he said this to venerable Sāriputta
Can you bear up venerable friend Can you carry on
Do you have any pain
I can bear up friend Moggallāna I can carry on friend Moggallāna
but I have a little pain on my head
Wonderful friend Sāriputta marvellous friend Sāriputta
such is the venerable Sāriputtas great power and great majesty
Here friend Sāriputta a certain yakkha gave a blow on your head
it was such a great blow that with that blow
a seven or seven and a half cubit Nāga elephant might have been felled
or a great mountain top might have been burst open
But then venerable Sāriputta said this
I can bear up friend Moggallāna I can carry on friend Moggallāna
but I have a little pain on my head 
Wonderful friend Moggallāna marvellous friend Moggallāna
such is the venerable Mahāmoggallānas great power and great majesty
in as much as he can even see a yakkha
whereas we at present do not even see a muddemon
The Fortunate One heard with his divine earelement
which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
the fitting talk and conversation of these two Great Nāgas
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For he whose mind is like a rock  steady and not wavering
Unexcited by what is exciting  not agitated by what is agitating
For he whose mind is developed thus  from where will pain come upon him
at one time the Fortunate One was walking on walking tour amongst the Kosalans
together with a great Community of monks
Then at that time a great many young brāhmaṇas
were passing by not far from the Fortunate One in a mocking manner
The Fortunate One saw those many young brāhmaṇas
passing by not far away in a mocking manner
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
The forgetful speaking unsuitable words though appearing to be wise
Stretching their mouths as much as they want  are led on by what they don't understand
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time
venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja was sitting not far from the Fortunate One
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
a forestdweller an alms gatherer a ragrober one with only threerobes
with few longings satisfied completely secluded unattached
with energy aroused being one who spoke about the ascetic practices who was applying himself to the higher mind
The Fortunate One saw
venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja who was sitting not far away
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
a forestdweller an alms gatherer a ragrober one with only threerobes
with few longings satisfied completely secluded unattached
with energy aroused being one who spoke about the ascetic practices who was applying himself to the higher mind
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Not finding fault not hurting  and restraint in regard to the Pātimokkha
Knowing the correct measure in food  and living in a remote dwelling place
Being devoted to the higher mind   this is the teaching of the Buddhas
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Mahākaccāyana
was dwelling amongst the Avanti people near Kuraraghara on Pavatta mountain
Then at that time the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa
was venerable Mahākaccāyanas supporter
Then when the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa
had gone into hiding into seclusion this reflection arose in his mind
According to the way Master Mahākaccāyana teaches the Dhamma
it is not easy while dwelling in the home to live the spiritual life
absolutely fulfilled absolutely pure like a polished shell
Well now after shaving off headhair and beard and donning ochre clothes
I could go forth from the home to homelessness
Then the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa
went to venerable Mahākaccāyana
and after going and worshipping venerable Mahākaccāyana
he sat down on one side While sat on one side the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa
said this to venerable Mahākaccāyana
Here reverend Sir having gone into hiding into seclusion
this reflection arose in my mind
According to the way Master Mahākaccāyana teaches the Dhamma
it is not easy while dwelling in the home to live the spiritual life
absolutely fulfilled absolutely pure like a polished shell
Well now after shaving off headhair and beard and donning ochre clothes
I could go forth from the home to homelessness
Reverend Sir may Master Mahākaccāyana give me the going forth
When that was said venerable Mahākaccāyana
said this to the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa
A solitary meal a solitary bed and celibacy Soṇa for as long as life lasts is difficult
come on Soṇa right now while still living as a householder
you should devote yourself to the Buddhas teaching
and at suitable times ie on Observance days have only a solitary meal a solitary bed and celibacy
Then whatever determination the lay follower
Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa had to go forth abated
For a second time when the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa
had gone into hiding into seclusion this reflection arose in his mind
According to the way Master Mahākaccāyana teaches the Dhamma

I could go forth from the home to homelessness
Reverend Sir may Master Mahākaccāyana give me the going forth
Then venerable Mahākaccāyana
gave the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa the going forth
Then at that time there were few monks in the Southern State of Avanti
Then with the passing of three years venerable Mahākaccāyana
having assembled with difficulty and with trouble from here and there a group of ten monks from the Community of monks
gave venerable Soṇa full ordination
Then when venerable Soṇa after residing for the Rains Retreat
had gone into hiding into seclusion this reflection arose in his mind
I have not seen the Fortunate One face to face
but I have heard that the Fortunate One is such and such a one
If my preceptor would allow it I could go
to see the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
Then the venerable Soṇa having risen from seclusion in the evening time
went to venerable Mahākaccāyana
and after going and worshipping venerable Mahākaccāyana
he sat down on one side While sat on one side venerable Soṇa
said this to venerable Mahākaccāyana
Here reverend Sir having gone into hiding into seclusion
this reflection arose in my mind
I have not seen the Fortunate One face to face
but I have heard that the Fortunate One is such and such a one
If my preceptor would allow me I could go
to see the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
Good good Soṇa you must go Soṇa
to see the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
You will see Soṇa that Fortunate One
who is confident inspiring confidence with sense faculties at peace mind at peace
having attained supreme selfcontrol and calm
controlled guarded with restrained faculties a true nāga
Having seen him in my name you should worship the Fortunate Ones feet with your head
ask if he is free from affliction free from sickness in good health strong and living comfortably saying
My Preceptor venerable Mahākaccāyana reverend Sir
worships the Fortunate Ones feet with his head
and asks if you are free from affliction free from sickness
in good health strong and living comfortably 
Yes reverend Sir said venerable Soṇa
and after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of venerable Mahākaccāyana
having worshipped and circumambulated venerable Mahākaccāyana
after putting his dwelling place in order and picking up his robe and bowl
he went on walking tour towards Sāvatthī
Walking gradually on walking tour he went to Sāvatthī
Jetas Wood Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery and the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side venerable Soṇa said this to the Fortunate One
My Preceptor venerable Mahākaccāyana reverend Sir
worships the Fortunate Ones feet with his head
and asks if you are free from affliction free from sickness
in good health strong and living comfortably
Can you bear up monk Can you carry on
Did you come along the road without fatigue
and without going short of alms
I can bear up Fortunate One I can carry on Fortunate One
and I did come along the road without fatigue
and without going short of alms
Then the Fortunate One addressed Venerable nanda saying
Please prepare a dwelling place nanda for this visiting monk
Then it occurred to venerable nanda
When the Fortunate One orders me saying
Please prepare a dwelling place nanda for this visiting monk
the Fortunate One wants to dwell together with that monk in one living quarters
The Fortunate One wants to dwell together with venerable Soṇa in one living quarters
And in the living quarters where the Fortunate One was living
there he prepared a dwelling place for venerable Soṇa
Then the Fortunate One having spent most of the night sitting in the open air
after washing his feet entered the living quarters
Also venerable Soṇa having spent most of the night sitting in the open air
after washing his feet entered the living quarters
Then towards the time of dawn after rising the Fortunate One
requested venerable Soṇa saying
May you be inspired to speak about the Dhamma monk
Yes reverend Sir said venerable Soṇa and after replying to the Fortunate One
he melodiously recited all sixteen discourses of the Chapter of the Eights
Then at the end of venerable Soṇas
melodious recitation the Fortunate One greatly rejoiced saying
Good good monk well learned monk
well remembered well born in mind are the sixteen discourses of the Chapter of the Eights
you are endowed with a good voice
with good enunciation pure articulation which makes the meaning clear
How many Rains do you have monk
I have one Rains Fortunate One
But why monk did it take you so long to ordain
For a long time reverend Sir I have seen the danger in sensual desires
but dwelling in the home there was obstruction with many duties and many things to do
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Having seen the danger in the world  having come to know the state free from cleaving
The Noble One does not delight in bad deeds  the pure one does not delight in bad deeds
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Sāriputta
was instructing rousing enthusing and cheering
venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf in countless ways with a Dhamma talk
Then while venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf was being instructed
roused enthused and cheered by venerable Sāriputta
in countless ways with a Dhamma talk
his mind was freed from the pollutants without attachment
The Fortunate One saw venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf
being instructed roused enthused
and cheered by venerable Sāriputta
in countless ways with a Dhamma talk
and that his mind was being freed from the pollutants without attachment
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Above below everywhere free
Not contemplating the conceit this I am
Free like this having crossed over the flood
Not crossed before with no continuation in existence
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Cullapanthaka
was sitting not far away from the Fortunate One
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
and attending to mindfulness at the front
The Fortunate One saw venerable Cullapanthaka
sat not far away after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
and attending to mindfulness at the front
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
With steady body with steady mind
Whether standing sitting or lying down
The monk who is thus determined on mindfulness
Can gain the earlier and following distinctions
Having gained the earlier and following distinctions
He can go beyond sight of the King of Death
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
in Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels Feeding Place
Then at that time venerable Pilindivaccha
accosted monks with words of contempt
Then many monks went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Venerable Pilindivaccha reverend Sir accosts monks with words of contempt
Then the Fortunate One addressed a certain monk saying
Please go monk
and with my word address the monk Pilindivaccha saying
The Teacher friend Pilindivaccha calls you 
Yes reverend Sir said that monk and after replying to the Fortunate One
he went to venerable Pilindivaccha
and after going he said this to venerable Pilindivaccha
The Teacher venerable friend calls you
Yes friend said venerable Pilindivaccha and after replying to that monk
he went to the Fortunate One
after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side
the Fortunate One said this to venerable Pilindivaccha
Is it true as it seems Vaccha that you accost monks with words of contempt
Yes reverend Sir
Then the Fortunate One after applying his mind
to venerable Pilindivacchas previous lives addressed the monks saying
You should not be offended monks at the monk Vaccha
it is not with hatred on the inside monks that Vaccha accosts the monks with words of contempt
For the monk Vaccha monks for five hundred lives has
been reborn in a brāhmaṇa family without interruption
for a long time he has been one who has accosted others with words of contempt
because of this Vaccha accosted the monks with words of contempt
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
In whom dwells no deceit and no conceit
He who is free from lust unselfish not yearning
Who has dispelled anger who is himself completely emancipated
He is a brāhmaṇa he is an ascetic he is a monk
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Sāriputta
thinking that venerable Bhaddiya the dwarf was still a trainee
was instructing rousing enthusing and cheering him
in abundant and countless ways with a Dhamma talk
The Fortunate One saw venerable Sāriputta
who was thinking that venerable Bhaddiya the dwarf was still a trainee
instructing rousing enthusing and cheering him
in abundant and countless ways with a Dhamma talk
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
He has cut off the cycle gone to the desireless
Dried up the stream no longer flows
Cut off the cycle no longer rolls on
Just this is the end of suffering
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was sitting reflecting on his own giving up of signs of conceptual diversification
Then the Fortunate One having understood his own giving up of signs of conceptual diversification
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
He for whom there is no diversification and persistance
Who has transcended the tether and the obstacle
The sage who lives without craving
Is not despised by the world and its devas
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Uruvelā
on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the root of the Awakening tree in the first period after attaining Awakening
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was sitting in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedom
Then with the passing of those seven days the Fortunate One
after arising from that concentration for the middle watch of the night
applied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in reverse order
This not being so that is not from the ceasing of this that ceases
that is to say from the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of volitional processes
from the cessation of volitional processes the cessation of consciousness
from the cessation of consciousness the cessation of mind and bodily form
from the cessation of mind and bodily form the cessation of the six sense spheres
from the cessation of the six sense spheres the cessation of contact
from the cessation of contact the cessation of feeling
from the cessation of feeling the cessation of craving
from the cessation of craving the cessation of attachment
from the cessation of attachment the cessation of continuation
from the cessation of continuation the cessation of birth
from the cessation of birth old age death
grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all cease
and so there is a cessation of this whole mass of suffering
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
When the nature of things becomes really manifest
To the ardent meditating brāhmaṇa
Then all his doubts disappear
Since the destruction of causes has been understood
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Pāvā
near the Flock of Goats Shrine at the domicile of the Flock of Goats yakkha
Then at that time the Fortunate One
in the darkness of the night was sitting in the open air
and the skygod was raining lightly drop by drop
Then the Flock of Goats yakkha
desiring to give rise to fear terror and horror in the Fortunate One
went to the Fortunate One
and after going not far away from the Fortunate One three times he called out
Confusion great confusion and he made a great confusion
This is a demon for you ascetic
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
He is a brāhmaṇa when he has gone beyond in regard to his own things
Then has he transcended this demon and the great confusion
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the Kosalan King Pasenadi
had gone to the top of the royal palace with Queen Mallikā
Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi said this to Queen Mallikā
Is there anyone Mallikā you love more than yourself
There is no one Great King I love more than myself
But is there Great King anyone you love more than yourself
For me also Mallikā there is no one I love more than myself
Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi having come down from the palace
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side
the Kosalan King Pasenadi said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir having gone to the top of the royal palace with Queen Mallikā
I said this to Queen Mallikā
Is there anyone Mallikā you love more than yourself
When that was said Queen Mallikā said this to me
There is no one Great King I love more than myself
But is there Great King anyone you love more than yourself
When that was said reverend Sir I said this to Queen Mallikā
For me also Mallikā there is no one I love more than myself 
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Having gone around in all directions with the mind
There is surely no one found who is loved more than oneself
In the same way others each love themselves
Therefore one who cares for himself should not harm another
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time
five hundred monks with Yasoja at their head
had arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Fortunate One
Then those visiting monks
while exchanging greetings with the resident monks
having the dwelling places assigned putting the bowls and robes in order
made a loud noise a great noise
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Who are these making a loud noise a great noise
One would think it is fishermen with their haul of fish
These reverend Sir are five hundred monks with Yasoja at their head
who have arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Fortunate One
These visiting monks while exchanging greetings
with the resident monks
having the dwelling places assigned putting the bowls and robes in order
make a loud noise a great noise
Now then nanda with my word address those monks saying
The Teacher calls the venerable ones 
Yes reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
he went to those monks
and after going he said this to those monks
The Teacher calls the venerable ones
Yes friend said those monks and after replying to venerable nanda
they went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side the Fortunate One said this to those monks
Why monks are you making a loud noise a great noise
so one would think it is fishermen with their haul of fish
After that was said venerable Yasoja said this to the Fortunate One
These reverend Sir are five hundred monks
who have arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Fortunate One
These visiting monks while exchanging greetings
with the resident monks
having the dwelling places assigned putting the bowls and robes in order
make a loud noise a great noise
Please go monks I am dismissing you
You should not live in my presence
Yes reverend Sir said those monks and after replying to the Fortunate One
rising from their seats worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One
putting their dwelling places in order picking up their robes and bowls
they went on walking tour towards Vajji
While walking gradually through Vajji on walking tour
they went to the river Vaggumudā
and after going and making leafhuts on the bank of the river Vaggumudā
they entered upon the Rains Retreat
Then venerable Yasoja having entered upon the Rains Retreat addressed those monks saying
We were dismissed friends by the Fortunate One who desires our welfare who seeks our benefit
who is compassionate out of compassion for us
Well now venerable friends we must live
in such a way that the Fortunate One will be pleased with our living
Yes friend those monks replied to venerable Yasoja
Then those monks
while dwelling secluded heedful ardent and resolute
within the Rains Retreat all realized the three deep understandings
Then the Fortunate One having dwelt at Sāvatthī for as long as he wished
went on walking tour towards Vesālī
and while walking gradually on walking tour he arrived at Vesālī
There the Fortunate One dwelt near Vesālī
in the Great Wood at the Gabled Hall
Then the Fortunate One having applied his mind and with his mind fully encompassed
the minds of the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā addressed venerable nanda saying
It is as though something light has arisen for me nanda in this direction
It is as though something splendid has arisen for me nanda in this direction
To go to that direction where the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā dwell
and to apply my mind is not disagreeable
Please send nanda
a messenger into the presence of the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā to say
The Teacher venerable friends calls you the Teacher desires to see the venerable ones 
Yes reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
he went to a certain monk
and after going he said this to that monk
Come venerable friend you should go to the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā
and after going please say this to the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā
The Teacher venerable friends calls you the Teacher desires to see the venerable ones 
Yes friend said that monk and after replying to venerable nanda
just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm
or bend in an outstretched arm
in the same way did he disappear from the Gabled Hall in Great Wood
and reappear in front of those monks on the bank of the river Vaggumudā
Then that monk said this to the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā
The Teacher venerable friends calls you the Teacher desires to see the venerable ones
Yes friend said those monks and after replying to that monk
setting their dwelling places in order and picking up their bowls and robes
just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm
or bend in an outstretched arm
in the same way did they disappear from the bank of the river Vaggumudā
and reappear in front of the Fortunate One in the Gabled Hall in Great Wood
Then at that time the Fortunate One was sitting in imperturbable concentration
Then it occured to those monks
Now in what state is the Fortunate One dwelling at the present time
Then it occured to those monks
The Fortunate One is dwelling in a state of imperturbability at the present time
and they all sat in imperturbable concentration
Then venerable nanda when the night had passed
when the first watch of the night had gone after rising from his seat arranging his robe on one shoulder
and raising his hands in respectful salutation said this to the Fortunate One
The night has passed reverend Sir the first watch of the night has gone
for a long time these visiting monks have been sitting
let the Fortunate One exchange greetings reverend Sir with the visiting monks
When that was said the Fortunate One was silent
For a second time venerable nanda when the night had passed
when the middle watch of the night had gone after rising from his seat arranging his robe on one shoulder
and raising his hands in respectful salutation said this to the Fortunate One
The night has passed reverend Sir the middle watch of the night has gone
for a long time these visiting monks have been sitting
let the Fortunate One exchange greetings reverend Sir with the visiting monks
For a second time the Fortunate One was silent
For a third time venerable nanda when the night had passed
when the last watch of the night had gone when dawn had risen when the night had a joyful appearance
after rising from his seat arranging his robe on one shoulder
and raising his hands in respectful salutation said this to the Fortunate One
The night has passed reverend Sir the last watch of the night has gone
dawn has risen the night has a joyful appearance for a long time these visiting monks have been sitting
let the Fortunate One exchange greetings reverend Sir with the visiting monks
Then the Fortunate One after rising from that concentration
addressed venerable nanda saying
If you knew nanda you would not say even this much about them
I and these five hundred monks nanda
have all been sat in imperturbable concentration
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
He who is victorious over the thorn of sense desire
Scolding slaying and other bonds
He who stands unmoved like a mountain
That monk does not shake in regard to pleasure and pain
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
in Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels Feeding Place
Then at that time venerable Mahākassapa
was dwelling in the Pepper Cave and was sitting in one crosslegged posture for seven days
having attained a certain concentration
Then venerable Mahākassapa with the passing of those seven days
arose from that concentration
Then it occured to venerable Mahākassapa
after arising from that concentration
Well now I should enter Rājagaha for alms
Then at that time
five hundred devatās were ready and eager
to offer almsfood to venerable Mahākassapa
But venerable Mahākassapa
after refusing those five hundred devatās
having dressed in the morning time after picking up his bowl and robe
entered Rājagaha for alms
Then at that time the lord of the devas Sakka
having a desire to give almsfood to venerable Mahākassapa
having created the appearance of a weaver for himself
was weaving thread while the Asura maiden Sujā was filling the shuttle
Then venerable Mahākassapa
while walking systematically for alms in Rājagaha
went to the residence of the lord of the devas Sakka
The lord of the devas Sakka saw
venerable Mahākassapa coming while still far away
After seeing him leaving the house going to meet him taking the bowl from his hand
entering the house taking up the rice from the pot and filling the bowl
he gave it to venerable Mahākassapa
and that almsfood had many sauces many curries many sauces and tasty curries
Then this occured to venerable Mahākassapa
Now who is this being who has such power and majesty
Then it occured to venerable Mahākassapa
This is the lord of the devas Sakka
Having understood it was so he said this to the lord of the devas Sakka
This is your doing Kosiya you must not do such a thing again
We also have a need for merit reverend Kassapa
we also have a duty to make merit
Then the lord of the devas Sakka
after worshipping and circumambulating venerable Mahākassapa
after going up into the sky while in the air in the firmament three times uttered an exalted utterance
Ah giving The best gift  is well established on Kassapa
Ah giving The best gift  is well established on Kassapa
The Fortunate One heard with his divine earelement
which is purified and surpasses that of normal men the lord of the devas Sakka
after going up into the sky while in the air in the firmament
three times uttering an exalted utterance
Ah giving The best gift  is well established on Kassapa
Ah giving The best gift  is well established on Kassapa
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
The almsgathering monk
Selfsupporting not nourishing another
Such a one the devas envy
A peaceful one one who is always mindful
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the Fortunate One was instructing rousing enthusing and cheering
the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Emancipation
Those monks after making it their goal applying their minds
considering it with all their mind were listening to Dhamma with an attentive ear
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
What is called the uninclined Emancipation is hard to see  for it is not easy to see the truth
For the one who knows who has penetrated craving  for the one who sees there is nothing no defilements
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Kusinārā
at Upavattana in the Mallas Sāl Wood
Then at that time many monks
were dwelling in a little forest hut not far from the Fortunate One
agitated arrogant fickle garrulous of loose speech
unmindful not fully understanding uncomposed with minds very unsteady and with faculties uncontrolled
The Fortunate One saw those many monks
dwelling in a little forest hut not far away
agitated arrogant fickle garrulous of loose speech
unmindful not fully understanding uncomposed with minds very unsteady and with faculties uncontrolled
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Through unprotected body and through attainment of wrong view
Through being overcome by sloth and torpor  one goes under the power of Māra
Therefore one should be of protected mind  one whose resort is right thought
Devoted to right view  having come to know rise and fall
The monk who overcomes sloth and torpor  will give up all bad destinies
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
Then at that time venerable Mahākassapa
was dwelling in the Pepper Cave and was afflicted suffering and very sick
Then venerable Mahākassapa at another time
arose from that affliction
Then this occured to venerable Mahākassapa
when he arose from that affliction
Well now I should enter Rājagaha for alms
Then at that time
five hundred devatās were ready and eager
to offer almsfood to venerable Mahākassapa
But venerable Mahākassapa
after refusing those five hundred devatās
having dressed in the morning time after picking up his bowl and robe
entered Rājagaha for alms
going to the poor streets to the wretched streets to the weavers streets
The Fortunate One saw venerable Mahākassapa
walking for alms in Rājagaha
going to the poor streets to the wretched streets to the weavers streets
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
With pollutants destroyed rid of faults  him I call a brāhmaṇa
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Anupiyā in the Mango Wood
Then at that time venerable Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son
having gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree to an empty place
was frequently uttering this exclamation Ah happiness Ah happiness
Many monks heard that
when venerable Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son
had gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree to an empty place
was frequently uttering this exclamation Ah happiness Ah happiness
And after hearing this it occured to them
Undoubtedly friends venerable Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son
has no great delight living the spiritual life
and remembering the royal happiness he had formerly in the home life
having gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree to an empty place
he is frequently uttering this exclamation Ah happiness Ah happiness 
Then many monks went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Venerable Bhaddiya reverend Sir Kāḷigodhās son
having gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree to an empty place
is frequently uttering this exclamation Ah happiness Ah happiness
Undoubtedly reverend Sir venerable Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son
has no great delight living the spiritual life
and remembering the royal happiness he had formerly in the home life
having gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree to an empty place
he is frequently uttering this exclamation Ah happiness Ah happiness 
Then the Fortunate One addressed a certain monk saying
Please go monk and with my word address the monk Bhaddiya saying
The Teacher friend Bhaddiya calls you 
Yes reverend Sir said that monk and after replying to the Fortunate One
he went to venerable Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son
and after going he said this to venerable Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son
The Teacher friend Bhaddiya calls you
Yes friend said venerable Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son
and after replying to that monk he went to the Fortunate One
after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side the Fortunate One said this
to venerable Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son Is it true as it seems Bhaddiya that you
having gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree to an empty place
frequently utter this exclamation Ah happiness Ah happiness
Yes reverend Sir But Bhaddiya seeing what reason did you
having gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree to an empty place
frequently utter this exclamation Ah happiness Ah happiness 
Formerly Reverend Sir while I was in the home life ruling the country
the inside of the inner quarters was well appointed with guards
and the outside of the inner quarters was well appointed with guards
and inside the city it was well appointed with guards
and outside the city it was well appointed with guards
and inside the country it was well appointed with guards
and outside the country it was well appointed with guards
Although reverend Sir I was being guarded and protected in this way
I lived fearful anxious distrustful and afraid
But at present reverend Sir
having gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree to an empty place
I live solitary fearless unanxious trusting unafraid
unconcerned not horrified quite secure with a mind that has become confident like a freeborn animal
It is seeing this reason reverend Sir that I
having gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree to an empty place
am frequently uttering this exclamation Ah happiness Ah happiness 
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For he who has no agitations inside the mind
Who has thus completely transcended continuity of existence
The devas are unable to see
He who is without fear happy and griefless
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time a certain wanderers
young brāhmaṇa wife was pregnant and about to give birth
Then that female wanderer said this to that wanderer
Please go brāhmaṇa and bring oil which can be used for my delivery
When that was said that wanderer said this to that female wanderer
But from where dear lady can I bring oil
Then for a second time that female wanderer said this to that wanderer
Please go brāhmaṇa and bring oil which can be used for my delivery
For a second time that wanderer said this to that female wanderer
But from where dear lady can I bring oil
Then for a third time that female wanderer said this to that wanderer
Please go brāhmaṇa and bring oil which can be used for my delivery
Then at that time at the Kosalan King Pasenadis storehouse
to an ascetic or brāhmaṇa as much ghee or oil as was necessary
was being given to drink but not to carry away
Then it occured to that wanderer
At the Kosalan King Pasenadis storehouse
to an ascetic or brāhmaṇa as much ghee or oil as is necessary
is being given to drink but not to carry away
Well now after going to the Kosalan King Pasenadis storehouse
drinking as much of the oil as is necessary returning to the house
and throwing it up I could give it to her and that can be used for her delivery
Then that wanderer
after going to the Kosalan King Pasenadis storehouse
drinking as much of the oil as was necessary returning to the house
was not able to get it up nor down
and he was affected by painful sharp harsh and bitter feelings
and he rolled around forwards and backwards
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe was entering Sāvatthī for alms
The Fortunate One saw that wanderer
affected by painful sharp harsh and bitter feelings
and rolling around forwards and backwards
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Happy indeed are those who have nothing
The Perfect Ones are people who surely have nothing
See how one who has something is troubled
He is a person who is in a state of bondage in regard to other people
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time many and various sectarians
ascetics brāhmaṇas and wanderers were living at Sāvatthī
having various views various likings various tendencies subject to dependence on various views such as
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are not eternal

The self and the world are neither eternal nor not eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are made by oneself
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are made by another
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are made by oneself and by another
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are neither made by oneself nor by another but have arisen fortuitously
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
Pleasure and pain the self and the world are eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
Pleasure and pain the self and the world are not eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish

Pleasure and pain the self and the world are neither made by oneself nor by another
but have arisen fortuitously
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
They lived contending quarelling disputing
attacking each other with sharp tongues saying
Such is Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is Dhamma
Then many monks having dressed in the morning time
after picking up their bowls and robes entered Sāvatthī for alms
And after walking for alms in Sāvatthī while returning from the almsround after the meal
they went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir many and various sectarians
ascetics brāhmaṇas and wanderers are living at Sāvatthī
having various views various likings various tendencies subject to dependence on various views such as
There are some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who are of this argument this view

 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
They live contending quarelling disputing
attacking each other with sharp tongues saying
Such is Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is Dhamma
Wanderers from other sects monks are blind without vision
they do not know what is good they do not know what is not good
they do not know what is Dhamma they do not know what is not Dhamma
They not knowing what is good not knowing what is not good
not knowing what is Dhamma not knowing what is not Dhamma
live contending quarelling disputing
attacking each other with sharp tongues saying
Such is Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is Dhamma
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
This generation is intent on the Imaker connected to the othermaker
Some did not know that  and did not see this is a dart
But seeing that dart is the cause
There is no more I am the maker for him
There is no more Another is the maker for him
This generation is possessed by conceit  tied by conceit bound by conceit
Talking impetuously in regard to their views  Sasāra has not been transcended
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was walking on walking tour amongst the Magadhans
with a great Community of monks and arrived at Pāṭaligāma
The lay followers of Pāṭaligāma heard
The Fortunate One it seems is walking on walking tour amongst the Magadhans
with a great Community of monks and has arrived at Pāṭaligāma
Then the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side
the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma said this to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to stay in our rest house
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma having understood the Fortunate Ones consent
after rising from their seats worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One
went to their rest house
and after going and spreading the mats so that the rest house was spread all over
and preparing the seats setting up the waterpot
and lighting the oillamp they went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they stood on one side
While stood on one side
the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma said this to the Fortunate One
The rest house is spread with mats all over reverend Sir
the seats are prepared the waterpot is set up and the oillamp is lit
now is the time for whatever the Fortunate One is thinking reverend Sir
Then the Fortunate One having dressed after picking up his bowl and robe
together with the Community of monks went to the rest house
and after going washing his feet and entering the rest house
he sat down near to the middle pillar facing the East
and the Community of monks having washed their feet and entering the rest house
sat down near the West wall facing the East
having the Fortunate One at the front
Also the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma having washed their feet
entered the rest house sat down near the East wall
facing the West having the Fortunate One at the front
Then the Fortunate One addressed the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma saying
There are these five dangers householders for one lacking in virtue for one who has lost his virtue
What are the five
Here householders one lacking in virtue one who has lost his virtue
because of being heedless undergoes a great loss of riches
This is the first danger for one lacking in virtue for one who has lost his virtue
Furthermore householders for one lacking in virtue for one who has lost his virtue

This is the second danger for one lacking in virtue for one who has lost his virtue
Furthermore householders one lacking in virtue one who has lost his virtue
whatever assembly he goes to
whether an assembly of nobles or an assembly of brāhmaṇas
or an assembly of householders or an assembly of ascetics
he goes without confidence with confusion
This is the third danger for one lacking in virtue for one who has lost his virtue
Furthermore householders one lacking in virtue one who has lost his virtue
dies bewildered
This is the fourth danger for one lacking in virtue for one who has lost his virtue
Furthermore householders one lacking in virtue one who has lost his virtue
at the break up of the body after death
arises in the lower world in an unhappy destiny in the fall in the nether regions
This is the fifth danger for one lacking in virtue for one who has lost his virtue
These are the five dangers householders for one lacking in virtue for one who has lost his virtue
There are these five advantages householders for one who is virtuous for one accomplished in virtue
What are the five
Here householders one who is virtuous one accomplished in virtue
because of being heedful obtains a great mass of riches
This is the first advantage for one who is virtuous for one accomplished in virtue
Furthermore householders of one who is virtuous of one accomplished in virtue
a good report goes round
This is the second advantage for one who is virtuous for one accomplished in virtue
Furthermore householders one who is virtuous one accomplished in virtue
whatever assembly he goes to

or an assembly of householders or an assembly of ascetics
goes with confidence without confusion
This is the third advantage for one who is virtuous for one accomplished in virtue
Furthermore householders one who is virtuous one accomplished in virtue
dies without being bewildered
This is the fourth advantage for one who is virtuous for one accomplished in virtue
Furthermore householders one who is virtuous one accomplished in virtue
at the break up of the body after death arises in a happy destiny in a heavenly world
This is the fifth advantage for one who is virtuous for one accomplished in virtue
These are the five advantages householders for one who is virtuous for one accomplished in virtue
Then the Fortunate One after instructing rousing
enthusing and cheering the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma
for most of the night with a Dhamma talk dismissed them saying
The night has passed householders
now is the time for whatever you are thinking
Then the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma
after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Fortunate One rising from their seats
worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One went away
Then the Fortunate One not long after the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma had gone
entered an empty place
Then at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
were building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians
Then at that time a great many devatās thousands upon thousands
were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma
In that place where the great devatās took possession of grounds
there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers'
minds inclined to building up residences
In that place where the middling devatās took possession of grounds
there the middling rulers and middling royal ministers'
minds inclined to building up residences
In that place where the lower devatās took possession of grounds
there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers'
minds inclined to building up residences
The Fortunate One saw with his divineeye
which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
that those devatās thousands upon thousands were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma
In that place where the great devatās took possession of grounds
there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers'
minds inclined to building up residences
In that place where the middling devatās took possession of grounds
there the middling rulers and middling royal ministers'
minds inclined to building up residences
In that place where the lower devatās took possession of grounds
there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers'
minds inclined to building up residences
Then towards the time of dawn having risen from his seat the Fortunate One
addressed venerable nanda saying
Now who nanda is building a city at Pāṭaligāma
The Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra reverend Sir
are building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians
It is just as though nanda after consulting with the Tāvatisa devas
in the same way nanda the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
are building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians
Here nanda I saw with my divineeye
which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
that a great many devatās thousands upon thousands
were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma
In that place where the great devatās took possession of grounds
there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers'
minds inclined to building up residences
In that place where the middling devatās took possession of grounds
there the middling rulers and middling royal ministers'
minds inclined to building up residences
In that place where the lower devatās took possession of grounds
there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers'
minds inclined to building up residences
For as long nanda as there is an Ariyan sphere of influence for as long as there is trade
this basketopening Pāṭaliputta will be the chief city
For Pāṭaliputta nanda there will be three dangers
from fire and from water and from the breaking of an alliance
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
went to the Fortunate One
and after going they exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One
and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings they stood on one side
While stood on one side the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
said this to the Fortunate One
May Gotama consent dear Sir to us
offering him a meal today together with the Community of monks
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
having understood the Fortunate Ones consent went to their own dwelling
and after going in their own dwellings
having had excellent comestibles and edibles made ready
announced the time to the Fortunate One saying It is time dear Gotama the meal is ready
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe together with the Community of monks
went to the dwelling of the Magadhan chief ministers
Sunīdha and Vassakāra and after going he sat down on the prepared seat
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
with their own hands served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head
with excellent comestibles and edibles
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl
having taken a low seat sat down on one side
While sat on one side the Fortunate One rejoiced the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
with these verses
In that place where he makes his dwelling having entertained
The wise and virtuous here  the restrained who live the spiritual life
He should dedicate a gift to the devatās who are in that place
Honoured they pay honour   revered they revere him
Thereafter they have compassion on him  as a mother on her own son
A man whom the devatās have compassion on  always sees what is auspicious
Then the Fortunate One after rejoicing the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
with these verses and rising from his seat went away
Then at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
were following close behind the Fortunate One thinking
That gate by which the ascetic Gotama leaves
will get the name the Gotama Gate
and that ford by which he crosses the river Gaṅgā
will get the name the Gotama Ford
Then that gate by which the Fortunate One left
got the name the Gotama Gate
then the Fortunate One went to the river Gaṅgā
Then at that time the river Gaṅgā was full to the brim and could be drunk from by crows perched on the bank
Some of the people were seeking boats
some were seeking floats
and some were binding rafts desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond
Then the Fortunate One just as a strong man
might stretch out a bent arm or bend in an outstretched arm
so did he vanish from the near bank of the river Gaṅgā
and reappeared on the far bank together with the Community of monks
The Fortunate One saw those people some seeking boats
some seeking floats
and some binding rafts desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Those who cross over a sea or a lake
Do so after making a bridge and leaving the pond behind
While people are still binding together a raft
Intelligent people have crossed over
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Mahāmoggallāna
was sitting not far away from the Fortunate One
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
and was attending well to mindfulness related to his own body
The Fortunate One saw
venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far away
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
and was attending well to mindfulness related to his own body
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Attending to mindfulness related to the body
Restrained in regard to the six spheres of contact
The monk who is continually concentrated
Can know nibbāna for himself
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Kosambī in Ghositas Monastery
Then at that time when King Udena had gone to the pleasure park
the inner quarters of the palace were burnt down
and five hundred women died with Queen Sāmāvatī at their head
Then many monks having dressed in the morning time
after picking up their bowls and robes entered Kosambī for alms
and after walking for alms in Kosambī while returning from the almsround after the meal
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir when King Udena had gone to the pleasure park the inner quarters of the palace were burnt down
and five hundred women died with Queen Sāmāvatī at their head
What is the destination of the female lay followers reverend Sir what is their future state
There are in this female lay followers who are streamenterers monks
there are oncereturners there are nonreturners
 none of those female lay followers died monks without having attained some result
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
The world in bondage to delusion  is looked on as being beautiful
The fool in bondage to cleaving  is surrounded by darkness
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time many and various sectarians
ascetics brāhmaṇas and wanderers were living at Sāvatthī
having various views various likings various tendencies subject to dependence on various views such as
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The world is eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The world is not eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view

The world is infinite
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
That which is soul that is also the body
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The soul is one thing the body is another thing
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The individual exists after death
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The individual does not exist after death
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The individual exists and does not exist after death
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The individual neither exists nor does not exist after death
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
They lived contending quarelling disputing
attacking each other with sharp tongues saying
Such is Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is Dhamma
Then many monks having dressed in the morning time
after picking up their bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
After walking for alms in Sāvatthī while returning from the almsround after the meal
they went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir many and various sectarians
ascetics brāhmaṇas and wanderers are living at Sāvatthī
having various views various likings various tendencies subject to dependence on various views such as
There are some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who are of this argument this view
Such is Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is Dhamma 
Wanderers from other sects monks are blind without vision
they do not know what is good they do not know what is not good
they do not know what is Dhamma they do not know what is not Dhamma
They not knowing what is good not knowing what is not good
not knowing what is Dhamma not knowing what is not Dhamma
live contending quarelling disputing
attacking each other with sharp tongues saying
Such is Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is Dhamma
Formerly monks in this Sāvatthī there was a certain King
Then that King monks addressed a certain man saying
Please go dear Sir and as many of those congenitally blind as there are in Sāvatthī
assemble them in one place
Yes your Majesty said that man monks and after replying to the King
and after taking hold of all of those congenitally blind in Sāvatthī
he went to the King and after going he said this to the King
As many of those congenitally blind as there are in Sāvatthī your Majesty have assembled
Then show an elephant I say to those congenitally blind
Yes your Majesty said that man monks and after replying to the King
he showed an elephant to those congenitally blind saying
Such is an elephant blind men
To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephants head saying
Such is an elephant blind men
To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephants ear saying
Such is an elephant blind men
To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephants tusk saying
Such is an elephant blind men
To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephants trunk saying
Such is an elephant blind men
To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephants body saying
Such is an elephant blind men
To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephants leg saying
Such is an elephant blind men
To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephants thigh saying
Such is an elephant blind men
To some of those congenitally blind he showed the top of the elephants tail saying
Such is an elephant blind men
To some of those congenitally blind he showed the tip of the elephants tail saying
Such is an elephant blind men
Then monks that man having shown the elephant to those congenitally blind
went to the King and after going he said this to the King
Those congenitally blind have seen the elephant your Majesty
now is the time for whatever you are thinking your Majesty
Then that King monks went to the congenitally blind
and after going he said this to those congenitally blind
Did you see the elephant blind men
Yes your Majesty we did see the elephant
Speak blind men and say Such is an elephant 
Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephants head monks
said this Such is an elephant your Majesty he is like a pot
Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephants ear monks
said this Such is an elephant your Majesty he is like a winnowing fan
Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephants tusk monks
said this Such is an elephant your Majesty he is like a ploughshare
Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephants trunk monks
said this Such is an elephant your Majesty he is like a ploughpole
Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephants body monks
said this Such is an elephant your Majesty he is like a storehouse
Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephants leg monks
said this Such is an elephant your Majesty he is like a pillar
Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephants thighs monks
said this Such is an elephant your Majesty he is like a mortar
Those congenitally blind who had seen the top of the elephants tail monks
said this Such is an elephant your Majesty he is like a pestle
Those congenitally blind who had seen the tip of the elephants tail monks
said this Such is an elephant your Majesty he is like a broom
and they saying Such is an elephant such is not an elephant such is not an elephant such is an elephant
hit each other with their fists
and with that monks the King was pleased
Just so monks wanderers from other sects
are blind without vision they do not know what is good they do not know what is not good
Such is Dhamma such is not Dhamma  such is not Dhamma such is Dhamma 
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Some ascetics and brāhmaṇas it seems are attached to these views
Having grasped ahold of it they dispute  like people who see only one side
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time almost all the people in Sāvatthī
Then the Auspicious One having dressed in the morning time
The Auspicious One saw that almost all the people in Sāvatthī
clung to sense pleasures delighted greedy tied infatuated indulgent and blinded
and dwelt having become completely intoxicated with sense pleasures
Then the Auspicious One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Blinded by sense pleasure covered with a net   covered over with the covering of craving
Bound by Māra the heedless ones kin   like fish in the mouth of a trap
They go to old age and death  like a suckling calf to its mother
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Mahākaccāna
was sitting not far away from the Fortunate One
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
and was attending well to mindfulness related to his own body
The Fortunate One saw venerable Mahākaccāna was sitting not far away
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
and was attending well to mindfulness related to his own body
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For he who will be always and continually
Attending to mindfulness relating to the body thinking
There might not be and there might not be for me
There will not be and there will not be for me
He who dwells in those gradual stages in that place
Can surely at the right time cross over clinging
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Gayā on Gayā Peak
Then at that time many knottedhaired ascetics
in the Gayā river were plunging out and plunging in
were plunging out and in
were sprinkling water and were offering the fire sacrifice thinking Through this there is purity
The Fortunate One saw that those many knottedhaired ascetics
in the Winter nights in between the eights at the time of the snowfall
in the Gayā river were plunging out and plunging in
were plunging out and in
were sprinkling water and were offering the fire sacrifice thinking Through this there is purity
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Not through water is there purity   many people bathe here
In whom there is truth and Dhamma  he is pure and he is a brāhmaṇa
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time amongst many monks
after returning from the almsround after the meal
assembling together and sitting in the Kareri Round Hall
this conversation arose
An almsgathering monk venerable friends while walking for alms
gets the opportunity from time to time to see appealing forms with the eye
gets the opportunity from time to time to hear appealing sounds with the ear
gets the opportunity from time to time to smell appealing smells with the nose
gets the opportunity from time to time to taste appealing flavours with the tongue
gets the opportunity from time to time to touch appealing tangibles with the body
An almsgathering monk venerable friends
walking for alms is venerated respected revered honoured and esteemed
Now venerable friends we too should be almsgatherers
and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to see appealing forms with the eye
and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to touch appealing tangibles with the body
and we also will walk for alms being venerated respected revered honoured and esteemed
Now this conversation that arose amongst those monks was left unfinished
Then the Fortunate One having risen from seclusion in the evening time
went to the Kareri Round Hall
and after going he sat down on the prepared seat
Having sat down the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
What is the talk about monks amongst those who have assembled at present
and what is the conversation that you left unfinished
Here reverend Sir after returning from the almsround after the meal
assembling together and sitting in the Kareri Round Hall
this conversation arose
An almsgathering monk venerable friends while walking for alms
gets the opportunity from time to time to see appealing forms with the eye
gets the opportunity from time to time to hear appealing sounds with the ear
gets the opportunity from time to time to smell appealing smells with the nose
gets the opportunity from time to time to taste appealing flavours with the tongue
gets the opportunity from time to time to touch appealing tangibles with the body
An almsgathering monk venerable friends
walking for alms is venerated respected revered honoured and esteemed
Now venerable friends we too should be almsgatherers
and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to see appealing forms with the eye
and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to hear appealing sounds with the ear
and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to smell appealing smells with the nose
and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to taste appealing flavours with the tongue
and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to touch appealing tangibles with the body
and walking for alms we also will be venerated respected revered honoured and esteemed
This is the conversation reverend Sir that was left unfinished
then the Fortunate One arrived
This is certainly not suitable monks for you
sons of good family who through faith have gone forth from the home to homelessness
that you should talk such talk
When you have assembled together monks there are two things that you ought to do
talk about the Dhamma or maintain noble silence
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
The almsgathering monk
Selfsupporting not nourishing another
Such a one the devas envy
But not if he is dependent on becoming famous
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the Fortunate One in the darkness and dullness of the night
was sitting in the open air while the oillamps were burning
Then at that time many moths
rushing and falling down into those oil lamps
were coming to grief were coming to ruin
The Fortunate One saw those many moths
who rushing and falling down into those oil lamps
were coming to grief were coming to ruin
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
They run beyond not coming to the essential
They cause new and fresh bonds to increase
Like moths that fall into the lamp
Some have settled thus on what is seen or heard
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There it was that the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Monks Reverend Sir those monks replied to the Fortunate One
and the Fortunate One said this
While venerable Dabba Mallaputta monks
 after going up into the sky and sitting in crosslegged posture in the air in the firmament
entering the fireelement and emerging 
was attaining Complete Emancipation his body burning and being consumed
there was no charcoal and no ash evident
Just as while ghee or oil
is burning and being consumed there is no charcoal and no ash evident
so also while venerable Dabba Mallaputta
 after going up into the sky and sitting in crosslegged posture in the air in the firmament
entering the fireelement and emerging 
was attaining Complete Emancipation his body burning and being consumed
there was no charcoal and no ash evident
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Just as for an iron bar  which is struck by fire and heat
And gradually cooling  the destiny of that heat is not known
So it is for those perfectly free   who have crossed over the flood of bondage to sense pleasures
There is no known destiny  for those who have attained unagitated happiness
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
in Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels Feeding Place
Then at that time venerable nanda
on the Observance day having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for alms
Devadatta saw venerable nanda walking for alms in Rājagaha
and after seeing him he went to venerable nanda
and after going he said this to venerable nanda
From today forward friend nanda apart from the Fortunate One
apart from the Community of monks I will hold the Observance and perform Legal Acts of the Community
Then venerable nanda after walking for alms in Rājagaha
while returning from the almsround after the meal went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
Here I reverend Sir having dressed in the morning time
after picking up my bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for alms
Devadatta saw me reverend Sir walking for alms in Rājagaha
and after seeing me he came to me and after coming he said this to me
From today forward friend nanda apart from the Fortunate One
apart from the Community of monks I will hold the Observance and perform Legal Acts of the Community
Today reverend Sir Devadatta will split the Order
and will hold the Observance and perform Legal Acts of the Community apart
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Done with ease by the good is good  good by the bad is done only with difficulty
Bad by the bad is done with ease  bad by the Noble Ones is done only with difficulty
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was walking on walking tour amongst the Mallas
with a great Community of monks and arrived at Pāva
There the Fortunate One dwelt near Pāva
in Cunda the smiths mango wood
Cunda the smith heard
The Fortunate One it seems is walking on walking tour amongst the Mallas
with a great Community of monks and has arrived at Pāva
and is dwelling near Pāva in my mango wood
Then Cunda the smith went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While Cunda the smith sat on one side the Fortunate One
instructed roused enthused and cheered him with a Dhamma talk
Then Cunda the smith having been instructed
roused enthused and cheered by the Fortunate One with a Dhamma talk
said to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to me
offering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then Cunda the smith having understood the Fortunate Ones consent
after rising from his seat worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One went away
Then with the passing of that night Cunda the smith
in his own residence having had excellent comestibles and edibles made ready
and an abundance of tender pork
had the time announced to the Fortunate One saying It is time reverend Sir the meal is ready
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe together with the Community of monks
went to Cunda the smiths residence
and after going he sat down on the prepared seat
Having sat down the Fortunate One addressed Cunda the smith saying
Serve me with the tender pork you have prepared Cunda
but serve the Community of monks with the other comestibles and edibles
which have been prepared
Yes reverend Sir said Cunda the smith and after replying to the Fortunate One
he served the Fortunate One with the tender pork that had been prepared
but served the Community of monks with the other comestibles and edibles
which had been prepared
Then the Fortunate One addressed Cunda the smith saying
Throw that left over tender pork into a pit Cunda
for I do not see Cunda
in the world with its devas Māra and Brahmā
in this generation with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas princes and men
one who having eaten it could completely digest it
except for a Realised One
Yes reverend Sir said Cunda the smith and after replying to the Fortunate One
and throwing what was left over of that tender pork into a pit
he went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side the Fortunate One
after instructing rousing enthusing and cheering
Cunda the smith with a Dhamma talk having risen from the seat went away
Then for the Fortunate One after eating Cunda the smiths food
a painful affliction arose dysentery
and strong feelings occurred such as end in death
There the Fortunate One mindfully with full awareness bore those pains without being troubled
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us go to Kusināra
Yes reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Having eaten Cunda the smiths food so I have heard
The Firm One experienced a very strong affliction such as ends in death
For the Teacher who had eaten tender pork
A very strong sickness arose
While still purging the Fortunate One said
I will go to the city of Kusināra 
Then the Fortunate One having gone down from the road
went to the root of a certain tree
and after going he addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda prepare the outer robe folded in four for me
I am weary nanda and will sit down
Yes reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
he prepared the outer robe folded in four and the Fortunate One sat down on the prepared seat
While sat the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda bring drinking water
I am thirsty nanda and will drink
After that was said venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
Just now reverend Sir five hundred wagons have passed by
and the little water that flows having been churned by the wheels is stirred up and disturbed
The Kukutthā river is not far away
with transparent water agreeable water cool water pure water with beautiful banks a delightful place
there the Fortunate One can drink drinking water and can cool his limbs
For a second time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda bring drinking water
I am thirsty nanda and will drink
For a second time venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
there the Fortunate One can drink drinking water and can cool his limbs
For a third time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda bring drinking water
I am thirsty nanda and will drink
Yes reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
and taking the bowl he went to the river
Then that little river that was flowing which had been churned by the wheels and was stirred up and disturbed
as venerable nanda was going flowed transparent clear and undisturbed
Then it occurred to venerable nanda
Surely it is wonderful surely it is marvellous
the Realised Ones great power and great majesty
in that that little river that is flowing which has been churned by wheels and is stirred up and disturbed
as I was going flowed transparent clear and undisturbed
After taking a bowl of drinking water he went to the Fortunate One
and after going he said this to the Fortunate One
It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
the Realised Ones great power and great majesty
in that that little river that is flowing which has been churned by wheels and is stirred up and disturbed
as I was going flowed transparent clear and undisturbed
Please drink the drinking water Fortunate One Please drink the drinking water Happy One
Then the Fortunate One drank the drinking water
Then the Fortunate One with a great Community of monks
went to the river Kukutthā
and after going and entering into the river Kukutthā
bathing and drinking and coming back out went to the mango wood
and after going he addressed venerable Cundaka saying
Come now Cundaka prepare the outer robe folded in four for me
I am weary Cundaka and will lie down
Yes reverend Sir said venerable Cundaka and after replying to the Fortunate One
he prepared the outer robe folded in four
Then the Fortunate One lay down on his right side in the lions posture
after placing one foot on the top of the other mindfully with full awareness having applied his mind to the thought of rising
And venerable Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Fortunate One
The Awakened One having gone to the little river Kukutthā
Which had water that was transparent pleasant and clear
The Teacher very weary entered the river
the Realised One who is unmatched here in the world
After washing and drinking the Teacher came out
And in the middle of the group of monks at the front
The Teacher the Fortunate One having taught the Dhamma here
The Great Sage went to the mango wood
He addressed the monk called Cundaka saying
Spread out the lying robe folded in four for me
Cunda urged by the One with Developed Mind
Very quickly spread the robe folded in four
The Teacher very weary lay down
With Cunda sat right there at the front
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
It may be nanda
that someone might cause remorse for the smith Cunda saying
There is no gain for you friend Cunda it is a poor gain for you friend Cunda
in that the Realised One after eating his last almsfood from you attained Complete Emancipation
If there is remorse for Cunda the smith nanda drive it out in this way saying
There is a gain for you friend Cunda it is a good gain for you friend Cunda
in that the Realised One after eating his last almsfood from you attained Complete Emancipation
I heard this face to face with the Fortunate One friend Cunda
I learned it face to face
There are these two almsfoods which have the same fruit have the same result
that is a greater fruit a greater result than other almsfood
Which two
That almsfood which after eating the Realised One
awakens to the unsurpassed Complete Awakening
and that almsfood which after eating the Realised One
attains Complete Emancipation in the Emancipationelement which has no basis for attachment remaining
These are the two almsfoods which have the same excellent fruit have the same excellent result
that is a greater fruit a greater result than other almsfood
Friend Cunda the smith has accumulated
a good deed that is conducive to long life
friend Cunda the smith has accumulated
a good deed that is conducive to beauty
friend Cunda the smith has accumulated
a good deed that is conducive to happiness
friend Cunda the smith has accumulated
a good deed that is conducive to fame
friend Cunda the smith has accumulated
a good deed that is conducive to heaven
friend Cunda the smith has accumulated
a good deed that is conducive to sovereignty
If there is remorse for Cunda the smith nanda
you should drive it out in this way
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For the one who gives merit is increased
From restraint hatred is not accumulated
The skilful one gives up what is bad
Through the destruction of passion hatred and delusion he is emancipated
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Cālikā on the Cālikā mountain
Then at that time venerable Meghiya was the Fortunate Ones attendant
Then venerable Meghiya went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he stood on one side
While stood on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Fortunate One
Reverend Sir I want to enter Jantugāma for alms
Now is the time for whatever you are thinking Meghiya
Then venerable Meghiya
having dressed in the morning time after picking up his bowl and robe
entered Jantugāma for alms Having walked for alms in Jantugāma
while returning from the almsround after the meal
he went to the bank of the river Kimikālā BlackWorm River
and after going to the bank of the river Kimikālā
while wandering around and strolling around on a walk
he saw a pleasing and delightful mango grove
Having seen it this occured to him This is surely a pleasing and delightful mango grove
For a son of a good family who needs to strive this is surely enough for striving
If the Fortunate One would allow me
I could come to this mango grove for striving
Then venerable Meghiya went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir having dressed in the morning time after picking up my bowl and robe
I entered Jantugāma for alms Having walked for alms in Jantugāma
while returning from the almsround after the meal
I went to the bank of the river Kimikālā
and after going to the bank of the river Kimikālā
while wandering around and strolling around on a walk
I saw a pleasing and delightful mango grove
Having seen it this occured to me This is surely a pleasing and delightful mango grove
For a son of a good family who needs to strive this is surely enough for striving
If the Fortunate One would allow me
I could come to this mango grove for striving
If the Fortunate One would allow me reverend Sir
I could go to that mango grove for striving
When that was said the Fortunate One said this to venerable Meghiya
You should wait for as long as I am alone Meghiya until some other monk arrives
For a second time venerable Meghiya said this to the Fortunate One
There is nothing further for the Fortunate One to do reverend Sir
there is nothing to add to what has been done
But for me reverend Sir there is something further to do there is something to add to what has been done
If the Fortunate One would allow me reverend Sir
I could go to that mango grove for striving
For a second time the Fortunate One said this to venerable Meghiya
You should wait for as long as I am alone Meghiya until some other monk arrives
For a third time venerable Meghiya said this to the Fortunate One
There is nothing further for the Fortunate One to do reverend Sir
there is nothing to add to what has been done
But for me reverend Sir there is something further to do there is something to add to what has been done
If the Fortunate One would allow me reverend Sir
I could go to that mango grove for striving
When you are talking about striving Meghiya what can we say
Now is the time for whatever you are thinking Meghiya
Then venerable Meghiya after rising from his seat
worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One
went to that mango grove
and after going and entering that mango grove
he sat down to dwell for the day at the root of a certain tree
Then to venerable Meghiya as he was dwelling in that mango grove
for the most part only three bad unwholesome thoughts occured
that is to say the thought of sensual pleasure the thought of illwill the thought of harming
Then it occured to venerable Meghiya
Surely it is wonderful surely it is marvellous
that I who out of faith have gone forth from the home to homelessness
should then be ensnared by these three bad unwholesome thoughts
that is to say by the thought of sensual pleasure by the thought of illwill by the thought of harming
Then venerable Meghiya having risen from seclusion in the evening time
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir as I was dwelling in that mango grove
for the most part only three bad unwholesome thoughts occured
Then reverend Sir it occured to me
Surely it is wonderful surely it is marvellous
that I who out of faith have gone forth from the home to homelessness
should then be ensnared by these three bad unwholesome thoughts
that is to say by the thought of sensual pleasure by the thought of illwill by the thought of harming 
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature Meghiya
there are five things that lead to maturity What five
Here Meghiya a monk has a good friend
a good companion a good comrade
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature Meghiya
this is the first thing that leads to maturity
Furthermore Meghiya a monk is virtuous
he lives restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint and is endowed with suitable conduct and resort
seeing danger in the slightest faults
he trains in the training rules he has undertaken
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature Meghiya
this is the second thing that leads to maturity
Furthermore Meghiya a monk has talk about what is very austere
that is suitable for opening up the mind and that leads to absolute disenchantment dispassion cessation
peace deep knowledge complete Awakening and Emancipation
such as talk on wanting little talk on being satisfied talk on complete seclusion
talk on disassociation talk on arousing energy talk on virtue talk on concentration
talk on wisdom talk on freedom talk on knowing and seeing freedom
Such talk as this he gains as he desires he gains without difficulty gains without trouble
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature Meghiya
this is the third thing that leads to maturity
Furthermore Meghiya a monk dwells with energy aroused
for the giving up of unwholesome things
for the taking up of wholesome things
steadfast of firm endeavour one who has not thrown off the burden in regard to wholesome things
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature Meghiya
this is the fourth thing that leads to maturity
Furthermore Meghiya a monk is wise
he is endowed with wisdom that leads to seeing rise and disappearance
with noble penetration that leads to the complete destruction of suffering
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature Meghiya
this is the fifth thing that leads to maturity
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature Meghiya
these five things leads to maturity
It can be expected Meghiya that for a monk who has a good friend
a good companion a good comrade that he will be virtuous
that he will live restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint
and will be endowed with suitable conduct and resort seeing danger in the slightest fault
and will train in the training rules he has undertaken
It can be expected Meghiya that for a monk who has a good friend
a good companion a good comrade that he will have talk that is very austere
that is suitable for opening up the mind and that leads to absolute disenchantment dispassion cessation
peace deep knowledge complete Awakening and Emancipation
such as talk on wanting little talk on being satisfied talk on complete seclusion
talk on disassociation talk on stirring up energy talk on virtue talk on concentration
talk on wisdom talk on freedom talk on knowing and seeing freedom
Such talk as this he gains as he desires he gains without difficulty gains without trouble
It can be expected Meghiya that for a monk who has a good friend
a good companion a good comrade that he will be a monk with energy aroused
for the giving up of unwholesome things
for the taking up of wholesome things
steadfast of firm endeavour one who has not thrown off the burden in regard to wholesome things
It can be expected Meghiya that for a monk who has a good friend
a good companion a good comrade that he will be wise
endowed with wisdom that leads to seeing rise and disappearance
with noble penetration that leads to the complete destruction of suffering
Then Meghiya with a monk who is established in these five things
four further things ought to be developed
The meditation on the unattractive should be developed for the giving up of passion
friendliness meditation should be developed for the giving up of illwill
mindfulness of breathing should be developed for the cutting off of thoughts
the perception of impermanence should be developed for the complete uprooting of the conceit I am
To one who has the perception of impermanence Meghiya the perception of nonself is established
one who perceives nonself reaches the complete uprooting of the conceit I am
in this very life reaches Emancipation
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
There are low thoughts fine thoughts
Together with elation in the mind
Not having understood these thoughts of the mind
The unsteady mind runs here and there
Having understood these thoughts of the mind
He who is ardent mindful restrains them
Also elations that have not arisen in the mind 
An Awakened one has given these up completely
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then venerable nanda having risen from seclusion in the evening time
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side the venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
just how shortlived reverend Sir the Fortunate Ones mother was
seven days after the Fortunate One was born the Fortunate Ones mother died
and arose among the Tusita hosts
It is just so nanda the mothers of AwakeningOnes are indeed shortlived
seven days after the AwakeningOnes are born the mothers of AwakeningOnes die
and arise among the Tusita hosts
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Whatsoever beings there are or ever will be
They will all go on after giving up the body
The one who is skilful having understood all that deprivation
Should live the spiritual life ardently
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
in Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels Feeding Place
Then venerable Dabba Mallaputta went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side venerable Dabba Mallaputta said this
to the Fortunate One
Now is the time for my Complete Emancipation Happy One
Now is the time for whatever you are thinking Dabba
Then venerable Dabba Mallaputta after rising from his seat
worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One
after going up into the sky and sitting in crosslegged posture in the air in the firmament
entering the fireelement and emerging attained Complete Emancipation
Then while venerable Dabba Mallaputta
 after going up into the sky and sitting in crosslegged posture in the air in the firmament
entering the fireelement and emerging 
was attaining Complete Emancipation his body burning and being consumed
there was no charcoal and no ash evident
Just as while ghee or oil
is burning and being consumed there is no charcoal and no ash evident
so also while venerable Dabba Mallaputta
 after going up into the sky and sitting in crosslegged posture in the air in the firmament
entering the fireelement and emerging 
was attaining Complete Emancipation his body burning and being consumed
there was no charcoal and no ash evident
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
The body broke up perception ceased
All feelings became cool
Mental processes were pacified  consciousness came to rest
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
in Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels Feeding Place
Then when venerable Upasena Vaṅgantaputta
had gone into hiding into seclusion this reflection arose in his mind
There are certainly gains for me it is certainly a good gain for me
that my teacher is the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
and that I have gone forth from the home to homelessness in such a well explained Dhamma and Discipline
and that my companions in the spiritual life are virtuous of good character
and that I have fulfilled the virtuous precepts and that I am composed and that my mind is one pointed
and that I am a Worthy One pollutantfree and that I am of great power of great majesty
My life has been fortunate and my death will be fortunate
Then the Fortunate One knowing with his mind the reflection
in venerable Upasena Vaṅgantaputtas mind
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
He whom life does not torment  who does not grieve at the end in death
If that firm one is one who has seen the state of peace  in the midst of grief he does not grieve
For the monk who has cut off the craving for continuity whose mind is at peace
Having totally destroyed the round of births  for him there is no continuation in existence
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was going along the high road amongst the Kosalans
with venerable Nāgasamāla as the attendant ascetic who followed behind him
The venerable Nāgasamāla saw two paths on the road
and having seen that he said this to the Fortunate One
This is the path reverend Sir let us go by this one Fortunate One
After that was said the Fortunate One said this to venerable Nāgasamāla
This is the path Nāgasamāla let us go by this one
For a second time venerable Nāgasamāla said this to the Fortunate One
For a third time venerable Nāgasamāla said this to the Fortunate One
This is the path reverend Sir let us go by this one Fortunate One
After that was said the Fortunate One said this to venerable Nāgasamāla
This is the path Nāgasamāla let us go by this one
Then venerable Nāgasamāla
having put the Fortunate Ones bowl and robe on the floor right there and then went away saying
This is the Fortunate Ones bowl and robe reverend Sir
Then as venerable Nāgasamāla was going along by that path
thieves who had gone along the road attacked him with their hands and feet
broke his bowl and tore his doublerobe
Then venerable Nāgasamāla with his broken bowl and torn doublerobe
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side venerable Nāgasamāla said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir as I was going along by that path
thieves who had gone along the path attacked me with their hands and feet
broke my bowl and tore my doublerobe
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Walking together dwelling as one
The Perfect One mixes with ignorant people
Having understood that he abandons bad deeds
As the milkdrinking heron abandons water
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf
close behind many monks
went to the Fortunate One
The Fortunate One saw venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf
coming while still far away close behind many monks
ugly unsightly and deformed
whom almost all of the monks ignored
Having seen that he addressed the monks saying
Do you see monks that monk
coming while still far away close behind many monks
ugly unsightly and deformed
whom almost all of the monks ignore
Yes reverend Sir
That monk monks is one of great power and great majesty
There is no wellgained attainment which has not been already attained by that monk
including that good for which sons of good family rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
and he dwells having known directly experienced and attained it himself in this very life
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
With faultless wheel with a white covering  the onespoked chariot rolls on
See the untroubled one coming  who has cut off the stream who is unbound
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Sāriputta
was sitting not far away from the Fortunate One
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
reflecting on his own peacefulness
The Fortunate One saw that venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far away
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
was reflecting on his own peacefulness
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For the monk whose peaceful mind is full of peace for the one who has cut off what leads to rebirth
Having totally destroyed the round of births  he is free from the bonds of Māra
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Kosambī in Ghositas Monastery
Then at that time the Fortunate One was living beset
by monks and nuns and male lay followers and female lay followers
and kings and kings ministers and sectarians and sectarians disciples
he lived beset unhappy and uncomfortable
Then it occured to the Fortunate One
At present I am living beset
by monks and nuns and male lay followers and female lay followers
and kings and kings ministers and sectarians and sectarians disciples
I am living beset unhappy and uncomfortable
Well now I could dwell solitary secluded from the group
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe entered Kosambī for alms
After walking for alms in Kosambī when he had returned from the almsround after the meal
after putting the dwelling place in order by himself picking up his robe and bowl
without having addressed his attendants without having taken leave of the Community of monks
solitary without a companion went away on a walk towards Pārileyyaka
While walking gradually on walking tour he arrived at Pārileyyaka
There the Fortunate One dwelt near Pārileyyaka
in the Protected Jungle at the root of the auspicious Sāltree
Now also a certain Nāga elephant was living beset
by male elephants by female elephants by young elephants by baby elephants
He ate grass that had the tips broken off
while they ate what he had broken down from the branches
He drank water that had been disturbed
and when he arose from the bathing place female elephants went along jostling his body
he lived beset unhappy and uncomfortable
Then it occurred to that Nāga elephant
At present I am living beset
by male elephants by female elephants by young elephants by baby elephants
I eat grass that has the tips broken off
while they eat what I have broken down from the branches
I drink water that has been disturbed
and when I arise from the bathing place female elephants go along jostling my body
I am living beset unhappy and uncomfortable
Well now I could dwell solitary secluded from the group
Then that Nāga elephant having gone away from the herd
went to Pārileyyaka the Protected Jungle the root of the auspicious Sāltree
and to the Fortunate One
There in that place where the Fortunate One dwelt that Nāga elephant
cleared that place of grass
and with his trunk provided the Fortunate One with drinking water and washing water
Then when the Fortunate One had gone into hiding into seclusion
this reflection arose in his mind
Formerly I was living beset
by monks and nuns and male lay followers and female lay followers
and kings and kings ministers and sectarians and sectarians disciples
I was living beset unhappy and uncomfortable
However at present I am living unbeset
by monks and nuns and male lay followers and female lay followers
and kings and kings ministers and sectarians and sectarians disciples
I am living unbeset happily and comfortable
Also to that Nāga elephant this reflection arose in his mind
Formerly I was living beset
by male elephants by female elephants by young elephants by baby elephants
I ate grass that had the tips broken off
while they ate what I had broken down from the branches
I drank water that has been disturbed
and when I arose from my bathing place female elephants proceded to jostle me with their bodies
I was living beset unhappy uncomfortable
However at present I am living unbeset
by male elephants by female elephants by young elephants by baby elephants
I eat the unbroken tips of grass
while they do not eat what I have broken down from the branches
I drink water that has not been disturbed
and when I arise from my bathing place female elephants do not proceed to jostle me with their bodies
I am living unbeset happily and comfortable
Then the Fortunate One having understood his own complete seclusion
and knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in that Nāga elephants mind
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
This poletoothed elephant Nāgas mind agrees
with the Buddha Nāgas mind  that a Nāga delights in being solitary in the wood
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time almost all the people in Sāvatthī
clung exceedingly to sense pleasures delighted greedy tied infatuated and indulgent
they dwelt having become completely intoxicated with sense pleasures
Then many monks having dressed in the morning time
after picking up their bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
and after walking for alms in Sāvatthī while returning from the almsround after the meal
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir almost all the people in Sāvatthī
cling exceedingly to sense pleasures delighted greedy tied infatuated and indulgent
they dwell having become completely intoxicated with sense pleasures
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Clinging to sense pleasures clinging to the shackle of sense pleasures
Not seeing the fault in the fetters
For sure those clinging to the shackle of the fetters
Cannot cross over the wide and great flood
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at the Eastern Monastery in Migāras mothers mansion
Then at that time Migāras mother Visākhā
was bound up in some matter or other with the Kosalan King Pasenadi
but the Kosalan King Pasenadi would not conclude it according to her desire
Then Migāras mother Visākhā in the middle of the day
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One she sat down on one side
While sat on one side
the Fortunate One said this to Migāras mother Visākhā
Well now Visākhā where have you come from in the middle of the day
Here reverend Sir I am bound up
in some affair or other with the Kosalan King Pasenadi
but the Kosalan King Pasenadi does not conclude it according to my desire
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
All that is in anothers power is painful  all that is mastered is pleasing
What is shared is troubling  for yokes are difficult to transcend
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Vesālī
in the Great Wood at the Gabled Hall
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe entered Vesālī for alms
After walking for alms in Vesālī when he had returned from the almsround after the meal
he addressed venerable nanda saying
Take up the sitting mat nanda
we will go to the Cāpāla shrine to dwell for the day
Yes reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
and taking the sitting mat he followed along close behind the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One went to the Cāpāla shrine
and after going he sat down on the prepared seat
While sat the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Delightful nanda is Vesālī delightful is the Udena shrine
delightful is the Gotamaka shrine delightful is the Sattamba shrine
delightful is the Bahuputta shrine delightful is the Sārandada shrine
delightful is the Cāpāla shrine
Whoever has developed nanda made much of carried on established
maintained augmented and properly instigated the four paths to power
could if he wanted remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
The Realised One has developed nanda made much of carried on established
maintained augmented and properly instigated the four paths to power
If he wanted nanda the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
But venerable nanda despite such a gross hint being made by the Fortunate One
such a gross suggestion being made was unable to penetrate it
and did not beg the Fortunate One saying
May the Fortunate One remain reverend Sir for the lifespan may the Happy One remain for the lifespan
for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of devas and men
like one whose mind was possessed by Māra
For a second time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Delightful nanda is Vesālī delightful is the Udena shrine
If he wanted nanda  the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
But venerable nanda despite such a gross hint being made by the Fortunate One
like one whose mind was possessed by Māra
If he wanted nanda  the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
But venerable nanda despite such a gross hint being made by the Fortunate One
like one whose mind was possessed by Māra
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Go nanda now is the time for whatever you are thinking
Yes reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
rising from his seat worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One
he sat down not far away at the root of a certain tree
Then the Wicked Māra not long after the venerable nanda had gone
went to the Fortunate One and after going he stood on one side
While stood on one side the Wicked Māra said this to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One attain Complete Emancipation reverend Sir may the Happy One attain Complete Emancipation
now is the time reverend Sir for the Fortunate Ones Complete Emancipation
For the Fortunate One reverend Sir has said these words
I will not attain Complete Emancipation Wicked One
for as long as my monks are not true disciples
accomplished disciplined confident secure learned
bearers of Dhamma practicing in conformity with the Dhamma
correct in their practice living in conformity with the Dhamma
and having learned it from their own teacher

and teach the wonderful Dhamma
But at present reverend Sir the Fortunate Ones monks are true disciples
accomplished disciplined confident secure learned
bearers of Dhamma practicing in conformity with the Dhamma
correct in their practice living in conformity with the Dhamma
and having learned it from their own teacher
do declare reveal make known set forth
open up analyse make plain
 after giving a good rebuke with reason to the arguments of others that have arisen 
and teach the wonderful Dhamma
May the Fortunate One attain Complete Emancipation reverend Sir may the Happy One attain Complete Emancipation
now is the time reverend Sir for the Fortunate Ones Complete Emancipation
For the Fortunate One has said these words
I will not attain Complete Emancipation Wicked One
for as long as my nuns are not true disciples
accomplished disciplined confident secure learned
correct in their practice  living in conformity with the Dhamma
and teach the wonderful Dhamma
But at present reverend Sir the Fortunate Ones nuns are true disciples
accomplished disciplined confident secure learned
and teach the wonderful Dhamma
May the Fortunate One  attain Complete Emancipation reverend Sir may the Happy One attain Complete Emancipation
For the Fortunate One has said these words
I will not attain Complete Emancipation Wicked One
for as long as my male lay followers are not true disciples
accomplished disciplined confident secure learned
and teach the wonderful Dhamma
But at present reverend Sir the Fortunate Ones male lay followers are true disciples
accomplished disciplined confident secure learned
and teach the wonderful Dhamma
May the Fortunate One  attain Complete Emancipation reverend Sir may the Happy One attain Complete Emancipation
For the Fortunate One has said these words
I will not attain Complete Emancipation Wicked One
for as long as my female lay followers are not true disciples
accomplished disciplined confident secure learned
correct in their practice living in conformity with the Dhamma
and teach the wonderful Dhamma
But at present reverend Sir the Fortunate Ones female lay followers are true disciples
accomplished disciplined confident secure learned
correct in their practice  living in conformity with the Dhamma
and teach the wonderful Dhamma
May the Fortunate One  attain Complete Emancipation reverend Sir may the Happy One attain Complete Emancipation
For the Fortunate One has said these words
I will not attain Complete Emancipation Wicked One
for as long as this spiritual life of mine has not become successful and prosperous
well spread out possessed by many become great
until it is well explained amongst devas and men
But at present reverend Sir the Fortunate Ones spiritual life
is successful and prosperous well spread out possessed by many become great
it is well explained amongst devas and men
May the Fortunate One attain Complete Emancipation reverend Sir may the Happy One attain Complete Emancipation
now is the time reverend Sir for the Fortunate Ones Complete Emancipation
When that was said the Fortunate One said this to the Wicked Māra
You should have little concern Wicked One
in no long time the Realised One will become completely emancipated
after three months have passed from now the Realised One will attain Complete Emancipation
Then at the Cāpāla shrine the Fortunate One mindfully with full awareness relinquished the life process
With the relinquishment of the life process by the Fortunate One there was a great earthquake
and a fearful horrifying crash of the devas thunder drum
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Measurable and immeasurable continuity
And the continuationprocess the Sage relinquished
Content in himself and concentrated
He broke continuity of self like a coat of mail
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at the Eastern Monastery in Migāras mothers mansion
Then at that time Migāras mother Visākhās
granddaughter who was beloved and dear had died
Then Migāras mother Visākhā with wet clothes and hair
in the middle of the day went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One she sat down on one side
While sat on one side
the Fortunate One said this to Migāras mother Visākhā
Now where have you come from Visākhā with wet clothes and hair
and why are you coming here in the middle of the day
My granddaughter who was beloved and dear reverend Sir has died
That is why with wet clothes and hair I am coming here in the middle of the day
Would you like Visākhā
as many children and grandchildren as there are people in Sāvatthī
I would like Fortunate One
as many children and grandchildren as there are people in Sāvatthī
But how many people Visākhā die every day in Sāvatthī
Ten people reverend Sir die every day in Sāvatthī
nine people reverend Sir die every day in Sāvatthī
eight people reverend Sir die every day in Sāvatthī
seven people reverend Sir die every day in Sāvatthī
six people reverend Sir die every day in Sāvatthī
five people reverend Sir die every day in Sāvatthī
four people reverend Sir die every day in Sāvatthī
three people reverend Sir die every day in Sāvatthī
two people reverend Sir die every day in Sāvatthī
one person reverend Sir dies every day in Sāvatthī
Sāvatthī is never secluded from people who are dying
Now what do you think Visākhā
would you ever be without wet clothes and hair
Surely not reverend Sir I have had enough reverend Sir
with so many children and grandchildren
For those who have a hundred loves Visākhā they have a hundred sufferings
for those who have ninety loves they have ninety sufferings
for those who have eighty loves they have eighty sufferings
for those who have seventy loves they have seventy sufferings
for those who have sixty loves they have sixty sufferings
for those who have fifty loves they have fifty sufferings
for those who have forty loves they have forty sufferings
for those who have thirty loves they have thirty sufferings
for those who have twenty loves they have twenty sufferings
for those who have ten loves they have ten sufferings
for those who have nine loves they have nine sufferings
for those who have eight loves they have eight sufferings
for those who have seven loves they have seven sufferings
for those who have six loves they have six sufferings
for those who have five loves they have five sufferings
for those who have four loves they have four sufferings
for those who have three loves they have three sufferings
for those who have two loves they have two sufferings
for those who have one love they have one suffering
for those who love nothing they have no sorrow
They are griefless dustfree and without despair I say
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Whatever griefs or lamentations there are
And the many kinds of suffering in the world
These all arise because of love
Without loves these do not originate
Therefore they are happy and free from grief
Who are without love for anything in the world
Therefore those wanting what is griefless dustfree
Should not have love for anything in the world
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the Fortunate One was instructing rousing enthusing and cheering
the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Emancipation
Those monks after making it their goal applying their minds
considering it with all their mind were listening to Dhamma with an attentive ear
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For the dependent there is agitation for the independent there is no agitation
When there is no agitation there is calm when there is calm there is no inclining
When there is no inclining there is no coming or going
When there is no coming or going there is no passing away and rebirth
When there is no passing away and rebirth there is no here or hereafter or in between the two
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Uruvelā
on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the root of the Awakening tree in the first period after attaining Awakening
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was sitting in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedom
Then with the passing of those seven days the Fortunate One
after arising from that concentration for the last watch of the night
applied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in forward and reverse order
This being so that is from the arising of this that arises
this not being so that is not from the ceasing of this that ceases
that is to say with ignorance as condition there are volitional processes
with volitional processes as condition consciousness
with consciousness as condition mind and bodily form
with mind and bodily form as condition the six sense spheres
with the six sense spheres as condition contact
with contact as condition feeling
with feeling as condition craving
with craving as condition attachment
with attachment as condition continuation
with continuation as condition birth
with birth as condition old age death
grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all arise
and so there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering
But from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of volitional processes
from the cessation of volitional processes the cessation of consciousness
from the cessation of consciousness the cessation of mind and bodily form
from the cessation of mind and bodily form the cessation of the six sense spheres
from the cessation of the six sense spheres the cessation of contact
from the cessation of contact the cessation of feeling
from the cessation of feeling the cessation of craving
from the cessation of craving the cessation of attachment
from the cessation of attachment the cessation of continuation
from the cessation of continuation the cessation of birth
from the cessation of birth old age death
grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all cease
and so there is a cessation of this whole mass of suffering
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
When the nature of things becomes really manifest
To the ardent meditating brāhmaṇa
He dwells dispelling Māras army
As the sun dwells lighting up the firmament
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time many and various sectarians
ascetics brāhmaṇas and wanderers were living at Sāvatthī
having various views various likings various tendencies subject to dependence on various views such as
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are not eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view

The self and the world are neither eternal nor not eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are made by oneself

But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are made by another
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are made by oneself and by another
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
The self and the world are neither made by oneself nor by another but have arisen fortuitously
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
Pleasure and pain the self and the world are eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
Pleasure and pain the self and the world are not eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
Pleasure and pain the self and the world are eternal and not eternal

But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument this view
Pleasure and pain the self and the world are neither made by oneself nor by another
but have arisen fortuitously
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
They lived contending quarelling disputing
attacking each other with sharp tongues saying
Such is Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is Dhamma
Then many monks having dressed in the morning time
after picking up their bowls and robes entered Sāvatthī for alms
And after walking for alms in Sāvatthī while returning from the almsround after the meal
they went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir many and various sectarians
ascetics brāhmaṇas and wanderers are living at Sāvatthī
having various views various likings various tendencies subject to dependence on various views such as
There are some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who are of this argument this view
The self and the world are eternal
 this alone is the truth all else is foolish
Such is Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is Dhamma
Wanderers from other sects monks are blind without vision
they do not know what is good they do not know what is not good
they do not know what is Dhamma they do not know what is not Dhamma
They not knowing what is good not knowing what is not good
not knowing what is Dhamma not knowing what is not Dhamma
live contending quarelling disputing
attacking each other with sharp tongues saying
Such is Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is not Dhamma such is Dhamma
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Some ascetics and brāhmaṇas it seems are attached to these views
Midterm they sink back depressed   not having attained a firm footing
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at the Eastern Monastery in Migāras mothers mansion
Then at that time the Fortunate One
having risen from seclusion in the evening time was sitting outside the doorway
Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
Then at that time seven knottedhaired ascetics seven of those knotfree ie Jainas
seven naked ascetics seven onecloakers and seven wanderers
with their nails armpithair and body hair grown long having taken up their various requisites
were passing by not far away from the Fortunate One
The Kosalan King Pasenadi saw those seven knottedhaired ascetics seven of those knotfree
seven naked ascetics seven onecloakers and seven wanderers
with their nails armpithair and body hair grown long who having taken up their various requisites
were passing by not far away from the Fortunate One
Having seen them after rising from his seat arranging his outer robe on one shoulder
placing his right kneecap on the ground
towards the place where those seven knottedhaired ascetics seven of those knotfree seven naked ascetics
seven onecloakers and seven wanderers were
raising his hands in respectful salutation he three times announced his name saying
Reverend Sirs I am the Kosalan King Pasenadi
Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side the Kosalan King Pasenadi
said this to the Fortunate One Among those in the world reverend Sir who are Worthy Ones
or have entered the path to Worthiness these are some of them
But this is hard to know Great King by you a householder partaking of sense pleasures
by one dwelling in a sleeping place crowded with sons
by one enjoying sandalwood from Kāsi
by one wearing garlands scents and creams
by one delighting in gold and silver
These are Worthy Ones or these have entered the path to Worthiness
Through living together Great King one can understand a persons virtue
and that after a long time and not after a short time
by one applying the mind not by one not applying the mind by one with wisdom not by one with poor wisdom
Through having dealings together Great King one can understand a persons purity
and that after a long time and not after a short time
by one applying the mind not by one not applying the mind by one with wisdom  not by one with poor wisdom
Through misfortunes Great King one can understand a persons stamina
and that after a long time and not after a short time
by one applying the mind not by one not applying the mind  by one with wisdom not by one with poor wisdom
Through discussion Great King one can understand a persons wisdom
and that after a long time and not after a short time
by one applying the mind not by one not applying the mind  by one with wisdom not by one with poor wisdom
It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
how well spoken that was reverend Sir by the Fortunate One
But this is hard to know Great King by you a householder partaking of sense pleasures
These are Worthy or these  have entered the path to Worthiness
Through living together Great King one can understand a persons virtue
by one applying the mind not by one not applying the mind by one with wisdom  not by one with poor wisdom
These reverend Sir are my men imposters and spies who are returning after spying on the country
for first they have gone down to the country and afterwards I will go down
Now these reverend Sir having removed dust and dirt
being bathed well annointed with trimmed hair and beards dressed in clean clothes
and provided with and possessing the five strands of sensual pleasures will amuse themselves
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
One should not endeavour in all circumstances   one should not be anothers man
One should not live depending on another  one should not live trading in Dhamma
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
in Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels Feeding Place
Then at that time in Rājagaha there were two gangs
who were impassioned with a certain courtesan whose minds were bound
Contending quarelling and disputing
they attacked each other with their hands attacked with clods of earth
attacked with sticks attacked with swords
and there and then they underwent death and pain like unto death
Then many monks having dressed in the morning time
after picking up their bowls and robes entered Rājagaha for alms
and after walking for alms in Rājagaha while returning from the almsround after the meal
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Here reverend Sir in Rājagaha there are two gangs
who are impassioned with a certain courtesan whose minds are bound
Contending quarelling and disputing
they attack each other with their hands attack with clods of earth
attack with sticks attack with swords
and there and then they undergo death and pain like unto death
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
What has been attained and what can be attained 
these two are strewn with dust for that miserable one in wrong training
Those who hold the training rules as the essence or virtue and practices right livelihood celibacy and attendance as the essence 
this is one end
Those who say this There is no fault in sense pleasures 
this is the second end
Thus these two ends promote the cemetery grounds and the cemetery grounds promote wrong view
Not having understood these two ends some get stuck some go too far
But for those who have understood these who were not in that and because of that do not conceive a conceit 
there is no Cycle of Sasāra to be assigned for them
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable nanda
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
For as long as the Realised Ones reverend Sir do not arise in the world
the Worthy Ones the Perfect Sambuddhas
for that long the wanderers from other sects are venerated
respected revered honoured esteemed and in receipt
of robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
But when the Realised Ones reverend Sir do arise in the world
the Worthy Ones the Perfect Sambuddhas
then the wanderers from other sects are not venerated
not respected not revered not honoured not esteemed and are not in receipt
of robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
Now reverend Sir the Fortunate One is venerated respected revered honoured esteemed
and in receipt of robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
and so is the Community of monks
Just so nanda for as long as the Realised Ones nanda do not arise in the world
the Worthy Ones the Perfect Sambuddhas
for that long the wanderers from other sects are venerated
respected revered honoured esteemed and in receipt
of robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
But when the Realised Ones nanda do arise in the world
the Worthy Ones the Perfect Sambuddhas
then the wanderers from other sects are not venerated
not respected not revered not honoured not esteemed and are not in receipt
of robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
Now the Realised One is venerated respected revered honoured esteemed and in receipt
of robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
and so is the Community of monks
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
The glow worm shines forth
for as long as the lightmaker the sun does not rise
But when the brilliant one the sun has risen
The glow worms light is destroyed and does not shine forth
In the same way the reasoners shine forth
for as long as the Perfect Sambuddhas do not arise in the world
The reasoners are not purified nor are their disciples
of wrong view they are not released from suffering
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was walking on walking tour amongst the Mallas
with a great Community of monks
and arrived at the brāhmaṇa village of the Mallas called Thūna
The ascetic Gotama the son of the Sakyans
who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan is walking on walking tour amongst the Mallas
with a great Community of monks and has arrived at Thūna
and they completely filled the well to the top with grass and chaff thinking
May these shaveling ascetics not drink our drinking water
Then the Fortunate One having gone down from the road
went to the root of a certain tree
and after going he sat down on the prepared seat
While sat the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda bring drinking water from that well
After that was said venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
Now the well reverend Sir has been filled to the top with grass and chaff
by the brāhmaṇa householders of Thūna thinking
May these shaveling ascetics not drink our drinking water 
For a second time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda bring drinking water from that well
May these shaveling ascetics not drink  our drinking water 
For a third time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda bring drinking water from that well
Yes reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
and taking the bowl he went to the well
Then as venerable nanda was going to that well
all the grass and chaff was thrown away from the top of the well
and it stood full of transparent undisturbed clear water
to the top so that one might think it was overflowing
Then it occurred to venerable nanda
Surely it is wonderful surely it is marvellous
the Realised Ones great power and great majesty
in that as I was going to that well
all the grass and chaff was thrown away from the top of the well
and it stood full of transparent undisturbed clear water
to the top so that one might think it was overflowing
After taking drinking water with a bowl he went to the Fortunate One
and after going he said this to the Fortunate One
It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
the Realised Ones great power and great majesty
in that as I was going to that well
all the grass and chaff was thrown away from the top of the well
and it stood full of transparent undisturbed clear water
to the top so that one might think it was overflowing
Please drink the drinking water Fortunate One Please drink the drinking water Happy One
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
What will he do with a well  if there will be water at all times
Having cut off craving at the root  who will go about seeking
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time amongst many monks
after returning from the almsround after the meal
assembling together and sitting in the attendance hall
this conversation arose
Now venerable friends which of these two kings has
the greater wealth the greater riches
the greater treasury the greater realm
the greater vehicles the greater strength
the greater power the greater majesty 
the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra or the Kosalan King Pasenadi
Now this conversation amongst those monks was left unfinished
Then the Fortunate One having risen from seclusion in the evening time
went to the assembly hall
and after going he sat down on the prepared seat
Having sat down the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
What is the talk about monks amongst those who have assembled together and are sitting here at present
and what is the conversation that you left unfinished
Here reverend Sir after returning from the almsround after the meal
assembling together and sitting in the attendance hall
this conversation arose
Now venerable friends which of these two kings has
the greater wealth the greater riches
the greater treasury the greater realm
the greater vehicles the greater strength
the greater power the greater majesty 
the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra or the Kosalan King Pasenadi
This is the conversation reverend Sir that we left unfinished
then the Fortunate One arrived
This is certainly not suitable monks for you
sons of good family who through faith have gone forth from the home to homelessness
that you should talk such talk
When you have assembled together monks there are two things that you ought to do
talk about the Dhamma or maintain noble silence
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
That which is sensual happiness in the world   and that happiness which is divine
To the happiness of the destruction of craving these  are not worth a sixteenth part
When a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understanding
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangle 
This was said But why was it said While the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī it seems a certain deity came to him in the night and in order to do away with his doubts
The inner tangle and the outer tangle This generation is entangled in a tangle
And so I ask of Gotama this question Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle  
he asked this question 
Here is the meaning in brief Tangle is a term for the network of craving
For that is a tangle in the sense of lacing together like the tangle called network of branches in bamboo thickets etc because it goes on arising again and again up and down among the objects of consciousness beginning with what is visible But it is called the inner tangle and the outer tangle because it arises as craving for ones own requisites and anothers for ones own person and anothers and for the internal and external bases for consciousness
Since it arises in this way this generation is entangled in a tangle
As the bamboos etc are entangled by the bamboo tangle etc so too this generation in other words this order of living beings is all entangled by the tangle of cravingthe meaning is that it is intertwined interlaced by it
And because it is entangled like this
so I ask of Gotama this question that is why I ask this
He addressed the Blessed One by his clan name as Gotama
Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle who may disentangle this tangle that keeps the three kinds of existence entangled in this way What he asks is who is capable of disentangling it
However when questioned thus the Blessed One whose knowledge of all things is unimpeded deity of deities excelling Sakka  excelling Brahmā fearless in the possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence wielder of the ten powers allseer with unobstructed knowledge in reply to explain the meaning
When a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understanding
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangle
uttered this stanza 
 Of this same verse composed by the Great Sage
My task is now to set out the true sense Divided into virtue and the rest
Right hard to find  There are here in the Victors Dispensation Seekers gone forth from home to homelessness
of the sure straight way Comprising virtue and the other two that leads to purity
Have no right knowledge And who although desiring purity
Who though they strive here gain no purity
To them pure in expositions
Relying on the teaching of the dwellers In the Great Monastery let all those
I shall expound the comforting Path Of Purification
Good men who do desire purity Listen intently to my exposition
Herein purification should be understood as Nibbāna which being devoid of all stains is utterly pure
The path of purification is the path to that purification
it is the means of approach that is called the path
The meaning is I shall expound that path of purification
In some instances this path of purification is taught by insight alone
according as it is said
Formations are all impermanent When he sees thus with understanding
And turns away from what is ill That is the path to purity 
And in some instances by jhāna and understanding
according as it is said
He is near unto Nibbāna In whom are jhāna and understanding 
And in some instances by deeds  etc
according as it is said
By deeds vision and righteousness By virtue the sublimest life
By these are mortals purified And not by lineage and wealth 
And in some instances by virtue etc according as it is said
He who is possessed of constant virtue
Who has understanding and is concentrated
Who is strenuous and diligent as well
Will cross the flood so difficult to cross 
And in some instances by the foundations of mindfulness etc according as it is said Bhikkhus this path is the only way for the purification of beings  for the realization of Nibbāna that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness 
and similarly in the case of the right efforts and so on
But in the answer to this question it is taught by virtue and the other two
Here is a brief commentary on the stanza Established well in virtue standing on virtue It is only one actually fulfilling virtue who is here said to stand on virtue
So the meaning here is this being established well in virtue by fulfilling virtue
A man a living being
Wise possessing the kind of understanding that is born of kamma by means of a rebirthlinking with triple rootcause
Develops consciousness and understanding develops both concentration and insight For it is concentration that is described here under the heading of consciousness
and insight under that of understanding
Ardent  possessing energy
For it is energy that is called ardour in the sense of burning up and consuming defilements
He has that thus he is ardent
Sagacious it is understanding that is called sagacity possessing that is the meaning
This word shows protective understanding
For understanding is mentioned three times in the reply to the question
Herein the first is nave understanding the second is understanding consisting in insight while the third is the protective understanding that guides all affairs
He sees fear in the round of rebirths thus he is a bhikkhu
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle this bhikkhu who possesses the six things namely this virtue and this concentration described under the heading of consciousness and this threefold understanding and this ardour
Just as a man standing on the ground and taking up a wellsharpened knife might disentangle a great tangle of bamboos so too hestanding on the ground of virtue and taking up with the hand of protectiveunderstanding exerted by the power of energy the knife of insightunderstanding wellsharpened on the stone of concentration might disentangle cut away and demolish all the tangle of craving that had overgrown his own lifes continuity
But it is at the moment of the path that he is said to be disentangling that tangle
at the moment of fruition he has disentangled the tangle and is worthy of the highest offerings in the world with its deities
That is why the Blessed One said
When a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understanding
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangle
 Herein there is nothing for him to do about the nave understanding on account of which he is called wise
for that has been established in him simply by the influence of previous kamma
But the words ardent and sagacious mean that by persevering with energy of the kind here described and by acting in full awareness with understanding he should having become well established in virtue develop the serenity and insight that are described as concentration and understanding This is how the Blessed One shows the path of purification under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding there
What has been shown so far is the three trainings the dispensation that is good in three ways the necessary condition for the threefold clearvision etc the avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way the means to surmounting the states of loss etc the abandoning of defilements in three aspects prevention of transgression etc purification from the three kinds of defilements and the reason for the states of streamentry and so on
How
Here the training of higher virtue is shown by virtue the training of higher consciousness by concentration and the training of higher understanding by understanding
The dispensations goodness in the beginning is shown by virtue
Because of the passage And what is the beginning of profitable things Virtue that is quite purified  and because of the passage beginning The not doing of any evil  virtue is the beginning of the dispensation And that is good because it brings about the special qualities of nonremorse and so on
Its goodness in the middle is shown by concentration
Because of the passage beginning Entering upon the profitable  concentration is the middle of the dispensation And that is good because it brings about the special qualities of supernormal power and so on
Its goodness in the end is shown by understanding
Because of the passage The purifying of ones own mindthis is the Buddhas dispensation  and because understanding is its culmination understanding is the end of the dispensation And that is good because it brings about equipoise with respect to the desired and the undesired
Just as a solid massive rock Remains unshaken by the wind
So too in face of blame and praise The wise remain immovable 
For this is said 
Likewise the necessary condition for the triple clearvision is shown by virtue
For with the support of perfected virtue one arrives at the three kinds of clear vision but nothing besides that
The necessary condition for the six kinds of direct knowledge is shown by concentration
For with the support of perfected concentration one arrives at the six kinds of directknowledge but nothing besides that
The necessary condition for the categories of discrimination is shown by understanding
For with the support of perfected understanding one arrives at the four kinds of discrimination but not for any other reason
And the avoidance of the extreme called devotion to indulgence of sense desires is shown by virtue The avoidance of the extreme called devotion to mortification of self is shown by concentration
The cultivation of the middle way is shown by understanding
Likewise the means for surmounting the states of loss is shown by virtue the means for surmounting the element of sense desires by concentration and the means for surmounting all becoming by understanding
And the abandoning of defilements by substitution of opposites is shown by virtue that by suppression is shown by concentration and that by cutting off is shown by understanding
Likewise prevention of defilements transgression is shown by virtue prevention of obsession is shown by concentration prevention of inherent tendencies is shown by understanding
And purification from the defilement of misconduct is shown by virtue purification from the defilement of craving by concentration and purification from the defilement of views by understanding
Likewise the reason for the states of streamentry and oncereturn is shown by virtue that for the state of nonreturn by concentration that for Arahantship by understanding
For the streamenterer is called perfected in the kinds of virtue and likewise the oncereturner
But the nonreturner is called perfected in concentration
And the Arahant is called perfected in understanding 
So thus far these nine and other like triads of special qualities have been shown that is the three trainings the dispensation that is good in three ways the necessary condition for the threefold clearvision the avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way the means for surmounting the states of loss etc the abandoning of defilements in three aspects prevention of transgression etc purification from the three kinds of defilements and the reason for the states of streamentry and so on
However even when this path of purification is shown in this way under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding each comprising various special qualities it is still only shown extremely briefly
And so since that is insufficient to help all there is in order to show it in detail the following set of questions dealing in the first place with virtue
 What is virtue In what sense is it virtue What are its characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause What are the benefits of virtue How many kinds of virtue are there What is the defiling of it What is the cleansing of it
Here are the answers
 WHAT IS VIRTUE It is the states beginning with volition present in one who abstains from killing living things etc or in one who fulfils the practice of the duties
For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā What is virtue There is virtue as volition virtue as consciousnessconcomitant virtue as restraint virtue as non transgression 
Herein virtue as volition is the volition present in one who abstains from killing living things etc or in one who fulfils the practice of the duties
Virtue as consciousness concomitant is the abstinence in one who abstains from killing living things and so on
Furthermore virtue as volition is the seven volitions that accompany the first seven of the ten courses of action in one who abandons the killing of living things and so on
Virtue as consciousnessconcomitant is the three remaining states consisting of noncovetousness nonill will and right view stated in the way beginning Abandoning covetousness he dwells with a mind free from covetousness 
Virtue as restraint should be understood here as restraint in five ways restraint by the rules of the community  restraint by mindfulness restraint by knowledge restraint by patience and restraint by energy
Herein restraint by the Pātimokkha is this He is furnished fully furnished with this Pātimokkha restraint
Restraint by mindfulness is this He guards the eye faculty enters upon restraint of the eye faculty 
The currents in the world that flow Ajita said the Blessed One
Are stemmed by means of mindfulness
Restraint of currents I proclaim By understanding they are dammed 
Restraint by knowledge is this 
and use of requisites is here combined with this
But what is called restraint by patience is that given in the way beginning He is one who bears cold and heat 
And what is called restraint by energy is that given in the way beginning He does not endure a thought of sense desires when it arises 
purification of livelihood is here combined with this
So this fivefold restraint and the abstinence in clansmen who dread evil from any chance of transgression met with should all be understood to be virtue as restraint
Virtue as nontransgression is the nontransgression by body or speech of precepts of virtue that have been undertaken
This in the first place is the answer to the question What is virtue
 Now as to the rest IN WHAT SENSE IS IT VIRTUE It is virtue in the sense of composing 
What is this composing
It is either a coordinating  meaning non inconsistency of bodily action etc due to virtuousness
or it is an upholding  meaning a state of basis owing to its serving as foundation for profitable states
For those who understand etymology admit only these two meanings
Others however comment on the meaning here in the way beginning The meaning of virtue is the meaning of head  the meaning of virtue is the meaning of cool 
 Now WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION MANIFESTATION AND PROXIMATE CAUSE Here
The characteristic of it is composing Even when analyzed in various ways
As visibility is of visible data Even when analyzed in various ways
Just as visibleness is the characteristic of the visibledata base even when analyzed into the various categories of blue yellow etc because even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed visibleness
so also this same composing described above as the coordinating of bodily action etc and as the foundation of profitable states is the characteristic of virtue even when analyzed into the various categories of volition etc because even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed the state of coordination and foundation
While such is its characteristic
Action to stop misconduct then Of blamelessness in virtuous men
Achievement as the quality Its function has a double sense
So what is called virtue should be understood to have the function of stopping misconduct as its function in the sense of action and a blameless function as its function in the sense of achievement
For under these headings of characteristic etc it is action or it is achievement that is called function 
 Now virtue so say those who know Itself as purity will show
And for its proximate cause they tell The pair conscience and shame as well
This virtue is manifested as the kinds of purity stated thus Bodily purity verbal purity mental purity  it is manifested comes to be apprehended as a pure state
But conscience and shame are said by those who know to be its proximate cause its near reason is the meaning
For when conscience and shame are in existence virtue arises and persists
and when they are not it neither arises nor persists
This is how virtues characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause should be understood
 WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF VIRTUE Its benefits are the acquisition of the several special qualities beginning with nonremorse
For this is said nanda profitable habits have nonremorse as their aim and nonremorse as their benefit 
Also it is said further Householder there are these five benefits for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue
What five
Here householder one who is virtuous possessed of virtue obtains a large fortune as a consequence of diligence this is the first benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue
Again of one who is virtuous possessed of virtue a fair name is spread abroad this is the second benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue
Again whenever one who is virtuous possessed of virtue enters an assembly whether of khattiyas or brahmans or householders or ascetics he does so without fear or hesitation this is the third benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue
Again one who is virtuous possessed of virtue dies unconfused this is the fourth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue
Again one who is virtuous possessed of virtue on the breakup of the body after death reappears in a happy destiny in the heavenly world this is the fifth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue 
There are also the many benefits of virtue beginning with being dear and loved and ending with destruction of cankers described in the passage beginning If a bhikkhu should wish May I be dear to my fellows in the life of purity and loved by them held in respect and honoured by them let him perfect the virtues 
This is how virtue has as its benefits the several special qualities beginning with nonremorse
Furthermore
Without which virtue clansmen find No footing in the dispensation
Dare anyone a limit place On benefits that virtue brings
No Ganges and no Yamunā No Sarabhū Sarassathī
Or flowing Aciravatī Or noble River of Mahī
Is able to wash out the stain In things that breathe here in the world
For only virtues water can Wash out the stain in living things
No breezes that come bringing rain No balm of yellow sandalwood
No necklaces beside or gems Or soft effulgence of moonbeams
Can here avail to calm and soothe Mens fevers in this world whereas
This noble this supremely cool Wellguarded virtue quells the flame
Where is there to be found the scent That can with virtues scent compare
And that is borne against the wind As easily as with it
Where Can such another stair be found That climbs as virtue does to heaven
Or yet another door that gives Onto the City of Nibbāna
Shine as they may there are no kings Adorned with jewellery and pearls
That shine as does a man restrained Adorned with virtues ornament
Virtue entirely does away With dread of selfblame and the like
Their virtue to the virtuous Gives gladness always by its fame
This root of all good qualities Robs of its power every fault
From this brief sketch it may be known How virtue brings reward and how
 Now here is the answer to the question HOW MANY KINDS OF VIRTUE ARE THERE
Firstly all this virtue is of one kind by reason of its own characteristic of composing
It is of two kinds as keeping and avoiding
Likewise as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of purity As abstinence and nonabstinence As dependent and independent As temporary and lifelong As limited and unlimited As mundane and supramundane
It is of three kinds as inferior medium and superior
Likewise as giving precedence to self giving precedence to the world and giving precedence to the Dhamma As adhered to not adhered to and tranquillized As purified unpurified and dubious As that of the trainer that of the nontrainer and that of the neithertrainer nornontrainer
It is of four kinds as partaking of diminution of stagnation of distinction of penetration
Likewise as that of bhikkhus of bhikkhunīs of the notfullyadmitted of the laity As natural customary necessary due to previous causes As virtue of Pātimokkha restraint of restraint of sense faculties of purification of livelihood and that concerning requisites
It is of five kinds as virtue consisting in limited purification etc
for this is said in the Paṭisambhidā Five kinds of virtue virtue consisting in limited purification virtue consisting in unlimited purification virtue consisting in fulfilled purification virtue consisting in unadheredto purification virtue consisting in tranquillized purification 
Likewise as abandoning refraining volition restraint and nontransgression
 Herein in the section dealing with that of one kind the meaning should be understood as already stated
 In the section dealing with that of two kinds fulfilling a training precept announced by the Blessed One thus This should be done is keeping
not doing what is prohibited by him thus This should not be done is avoiding
Herein the word meaning is this
they keep within that they proceed as people who fulfil the virtues thus it is keeping 
they preserve they protect they avoid thus it is avoiding
Herein keeping is accomplished by faith and energy avoiding by faith and mindfulness
This is how it is of two kinds as keeping and avoiding
 In the second dyad good behaviour is the best kind of behaviour
Good behaviour itself is that of good behaviour
or what is announced for the sake of good behaviour is that of good behaviour
This is a term for virtue other than that which has livelihood as eighth It is the initial stage of the life of purity consisting in the path thus it is that of the beginning of the life of purity This is a term for the virtue that has livelihood as eighth
It is the initial stage of the path because it has actually to be purified in the prior stage too
Hence it is said But his bodily action his verbal action and his livelihood have already been purified earlier 
Or the training precepts called lesser and minor are that of good behaviour
the rest are that of the beginning of the life of purity
Or what is included in the Double Code is that of the beginning of the life of purity
and that included in the duties set out in the Khandhakas of Vinaya is that of good behaviour
Through its perfection that of the beginning of the life of purity comes to be perfected
Hence it is said also that this bhikkhu shall fulfil the state consisting in the beginning of the life of purity without having fulfilled the state consisting in good behaviourthat is not possible 
So it is of two kinds as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of purity
In the third dyad virtue as abstinence is simply abstention from killing living things etc
the other kinds consisting in volition etc are virtue as nonabstinence So it is of two kinds as abstinence and nonabstinence
In the fourth dyad there are two kinds of dependence dependence through craving and dependence through false views
Herein that produced by one who wishes for a fortunate kind of becoming thus Through this virtuous conduct rite I shall become a great deity or some minor deity  is dependent through craving
That produced through such false view about purification as Purification is through virtuous conduct is dependent through false view
But the supramundane and the mundane that is the prerequisite for the aforesaid supramundane are independent So it is of two kinds as dependent and independent
 In the fifth dyad temporary virtue is that undertaken after deciding on a time limit
Lifelong virtue is that practiced in the same way but undertaking it for as long as life lasts So it is of two kinds as temporary and lifelong
In the sixth dyad the limited is that seen to be limited by gain fame relatives limbs or life
The opposite is unlimited
And this is said in the Paṭisambhidā What is the virtue that has a limit
There is virtue that has gain as its limit there is virtue that has fame as its limit there is virtue that has relatives as its limit there is virtue that has limbs as its limit there is virtue that has life as its limit
What is virtue that has gain as its limit
Here someone with gain as cause with gain as condition with gain as reason transgresses a training precept as undertaken that virtue has gain as its limit 
and the rest should be elaborated in the same way
Also in the answer dealing with the unlimited it is said What is virtue that does not have gain as its limit
Here someone does not with gain as cause with gain as condition with gain as reason even arouse the thought of transgressing a training precept as undertaken how then shall he actually transgress it That virtue does not have gain as its limit 
and the rest should be elaborated in the same way
So it is of two kinds as limited and unlimited
In the seventh dyad all virtue subject to cankers is mundane
that not subject to cankers is supramundane
Herein the mundane brings about improvement in future becoming and is a prerequisite for the escape from becoming
according as it is said Discipline is for the purpose of restraint restraint is for the purpose of non remorse nonremorse is for the purpose of gladdening gladdening is for the purpose of happiness happiness is for the purpose of tranquillity tranquillity is for the purpose of bliss bliss is for the purpose of concentration concentration is for the purpose of correct knowledge and vision correct knowledge and vision is for the purpose of dispassion dispassion is for the purpose of fading away of greed fading away is for the purpose of deliverance deliverance is for the purpose of knowledge and vision of deliverance knowledge and vision of deliverance is for the purpose of complete extinction of craving etc through not clinging Talk has that purpose counsel has that purpose support has that purpose giving ear has that purpose that is to say the liberation of the mind through not clinging 
The supramundane brings about the escape from becoming and is the plane of reviewing knowledge So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane
 In the first of the triads the inferior is produced by inferior zeal purity of consciousness energy or inquiry
the medium is produced by medium zeal etc
the superior by superior 
That undertaken out of desire for fame is inferior
that undertaken out of desire for the fruits of merit is medium
that undertaken for the sake of the noble state thus This has to be done is superior
Or again that defiled by selfpraise and disparagement of others etc thus I am possessed of virtue but these other bhikkhus are illconducted and evilnatured  is inferior
undefiled mundane virtue is medium
supramundane is superior
Or again that motivated by craving the purpose of which is to enjoy continued existence is inferior
that practiced for the purpose of ones own deliverance is medium
the virtue of the perfections practiced for the deliverance of all beings is superior So it is of three kinds as inferior medium and superior
 In the second triad that practiced out of selfregard by one who regards self and desires to abandon what is unbecoming to self is virtue giving precedence to self
That practiced out of regard for the world and out of desire to ward off the censure of the world is virtue giving precedence to the world
That practiced out of regard for the Dhamma and out of desire to honour the majesty of the Dhamma is virtue giving precedence to the Dhamma So it is of three kinds as giving precedence to self and so on
 In the third triad the virtue that in the dyads was called dependent is adheredto because it is adheredto through craving and false view
That practiced by the magnanimous ordinary man as the prerequisite of the path and that associated with the path in trainers are notadheredto
That associated with trainers and nontrainers fruition is tranquillized So it is of three kinds as adheredto and so on
 In the fourth triad that fulfilled by one who has committed no offence or has made amends after committing one is pure
So long as he has not made amends after committing an offence it is impure
Virtue in one who is dubious about whether a thing constitutes an offence or about what grade of offence has been committed or about whether he has committed an offence is dubious
Herein the meditator should purify impure virtue If dubious he should avoid cases about which he is doubtful and should get his doubts cleared up In this way his mind will be kept at rest So it is of three kinds as pure and so on
 In the fifth triad the virtue associated with the four paths and with the first three fruitions is that of the trainer
That associated with the fruition of Arahantship is that of the nontrainer
The remaining kinds are that of the neither trainernornontrainer So it is of three kinds as that of the trainer and so on
But in the world the nature of such and such beings is called their habit of which they say This one is of happy habit  this one is of unhappy habit this one is of quarrelsome habit this one is of dandified habit Because of that it is said in the Paṭisambhidā figuratively Three kinds of virtue  profitable virtue unprofitable virtue indeterminate virtue 
So it is also called of three kinds as profitable and so on
Of these the unprofitable is not included here since it has nothing whatever to do with the headings beginning with the characteristic which define virtue in the sense intended in this chapter So the threefoldness should be understood only in the way already stated
 In the first of the tetrads
The unvirtuous he cultivates He visits not the virtuous
And in his ignorance he sees No fault in a transgression here
With wrong thoughts often in his mind His faculties he will not guard
Virtue in such a constitution Comes to partake of diminution
But he whose mind is satisfied With virtue that has been achieved
Who never thinks to stir himself And take a meditation subject up
Contented with mere virtuousness Nor striving for a higher state
His virtue bears the appellation Of that partaking of stagnation
But who possessed of virtue strives With concentration for his aim
That bhikkhus virtue in its function Is called partaking of distinction
Who finds mere virtue not enough But has dispassion for his goal
His virtue through such aspiration Comes to partake of penetration
So it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution and so on
 In the second tetrad there are training precepts announced for bhikkhus to keep irrespective of what is announced for bhikkhunīs This is the virtue of bhikkhus
There are training precepts announced for bhikkhunīs to keep irrespective of what is announced for bhikkhus This is the virtue of bhikkhunīs
The ten precepts of virtue for male and female novices are the virtue of the not fully admitted
The five training preceptsten when possibleas a permanent undertaking and eight as the factors of the Uposatha Day for male and female lay followers are the virtue of the laity So it is of four kinds as the virtue of bhikkhus and so on
 In the third tetrad the nontransgression on the part of Uttarakuru human beings is natural virtue
Each clans or localitys or sects own rules of conduct are customary virtue
The virtue of the Bodhisattas mother described thus It is the necessary rule nanda that when the Bodhisatta has descended into his mothers womb no thought of men that is connected with the cords of sense desire comes to her  is necessary virtue
But the virtue of such pure beings as Mahā Kassapa etc and of the Bodhisatta in his various births is virtue due to previous causes So it is of four kinds as natural virtue and so on
 In the fourth tetrad The virtue described by the Blessed One thus Here a bhikkhu dwells restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint possessed of the proper conduct and resort and seeing fear in the slightest fault he trains himself by undertaking the precepts of training  is virtue of Pātimokkha restraint
 That described thus On seeing a visible object with the eye he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which if he left the eye faculty unguarded evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might invade him he enters upon the way of its restraint he guards the eye faculty undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty
On hearing a sound with the ear  On smelling an odour with the nose  On tasting a flavour with the tongue  On touching a tangible object with the body  On cognizing a mental object with the mind he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which if he left the mind faculty unguarded evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might invade him he enters upon the way of its restraint he guards the mind faculty undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty  is virtue of restraint of the sense faculties
 Abstinence from such wrong livelihood as entails transgression of the six training precepts announced with respect to livelihood and entails the evil states beginning with Scheming talking hinting belittling pursuing gain with gain is virtue of livelihood purification
 Use of the four requisites that is purified by the reflection stated in the way beginning Reflecting wisely he uses the robe only for protection from cold is called virtue concerning requisites
Here is an explanatory exposition together with a word commentary starting from the beginning
 Here in this dispensation
A bhikkhu a clansman who has gone forth out of faith and is so styled because he sees fear in the round of rebirths or because he wears cloth garments that are torn and pieced together and so on
Restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint here Pātimokkha is the virtue of the training precepts
for it frees him who protects it guards it it sets him free from the pains of the states of loss etc that is why it is called Pātimokkha
Restraint is restraining this is a term for bodily and verbal nontransgression
The Pātimokkha itself as restraint is Pātimokkha restraint
Restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint is restrained by means of the restraint consisting in that Pātimokkha he has it possesses it is the meaning
Dwells bears himself in one of the postures
 The meaning of possessed of the proper conduct and resort etc should be understood in the way in which it is given in the text
For this is said
Possessed of the proper conduct and resort there is proper conduct and improper conduct
Herein what is improper conduct
Bodily transgression verbal transgression bodily and verbal transgressionthis is called improper conduct
Also all unvirtuousness is improper conduct
Here someone makes a livelihood by gifts of bamboos or by gifts of leaves or by gifts of flowers fruits bathing powder and tooth sticks or by flattery or by beansoupery or by fondling or by going on errands on foot or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhasthis is called improper conduct
Herein what is proper conduct
Bodily nontransgression verbal nontransgression bodily and verbal nontransgression this is called proper conduct
Also all restraint through virtue is proper conduct
Here someone does not make a livelihood by gifts of bamboos or by gifts of leaves or by gifts of flowers fruits bathing powder and tooth sticks or by flattery or by beansoupery or by fondling or by going on errands on foot or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhasthis is called proper conduct
Proper resort there is proper resort and improper resort
Herein what is improper resort
Here someone has prostitutes as resort or he has widows old maids eunuchs bhikkhunīs or taverns as resort or he dwells associated with kings kings ministers sectarians sectarians disciples in unbecoming association with laymen or he cultivates frequents honours such families as are faithless untrusting abusive and rude who wish harm wish ill wish woe wish no surcease of bondage for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs for male and female devotees this is called improper resort
Herein what is proper resort
Here someone does not have prostitutes as resort  or taverns as resort he does not dwell associated with kings  sectarians disciples in unbecoming association with laymen he cultivates frequents honours such families as are faithful and trusting who are a solace where the yellow cloth glows where the breeze of sages blows who wish good wish well wish joy wish surcease of bondage for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs for male and female devoteesthis is called proper resort
Thus he is furnished with fully furnished with provided with fully provided with supplied with possessed of endowed with this proper conduct and this proper resort Hence it is said Possessed of the proper conduct and resort 
Furthermore proper conduct and resort should also be understood here in the following way
for improper conduct is twofold as bodily and verbal
Herein what is bodily improper conduct
Here someone acts disrespectfully before the Community and he stands jostling elder bhikkhus sits jostling them stands in front of them sits in front of them sits on a high seat sits with his head covered talks standing up talks waving his arms  walks with sandals while elder bhikkhus walk without sandals walks on a high walk while they walk on a low walk walks on a walk while they walk on the ground  stands pushing elder bhikkhus sits pushing them prevents new bhikkhus from getting a seat  and in the bath house  without asking elder bhikkhus he puts wood on the stove  bolts the door  and at the bathing place he enters the water jostling elder bhikkhus enters it in front of them bathes jostling them bathes in front of them comes out jostling them comes out in front of them  and entering inside a house he goes jostling elder bhikkhus goes in front of them pushing forward he goes in front of them  and where families have inner private screened rooms in which the women of the family  the girls of the family sit there he enters abruptly and he strokes a childs head  This is called bodily improper conduct
Herein what is verbal improper conduct
Here someone acts disrespectfully before the Community Without asking elder bhikkhus he talks on the Dhamma
answers questions recites the Pātimokkha talks standing up talks waving his arms  having entered inside a house he speaks to a woman or a girl thus You so andso of suchandsuch a clan what is there Is there rice gruel Is there cooked rice Is there any hard food to eat What shall we drink What hard food shall we eat What soft food shall we eat
Or what will you give me he chatters like this  This is called verbal improper conduct
 Proper conduct should be understood in the opposite sense to that
Furthermore a bhikkhu is respectful deferential possessed of conscience and shame wears his inner robe properly wears his upper robe properly his manner inspires confidence whether in moving forwards or backwards looking ahead or aside bending or stretching his eyes are downcast he has deportment he guards the doors of his sense faculties knows the right measure in eating is devoted to wakefulness possesses mindfulness and full awareness wants little is contented is strenuous is a careful observer of good behaviour and treats the teachers with great respect This is called conduct
This firstly is how conduct should be understood
 resort is of three kinds resort as support resort as guarding and resort as anchoring
Herein what is resort as support
A good friend who exhibits the instances of talk in whose presence one hears what has not been heard corrects what has been heard gets rid of doubt rectifies ones view and gains confidence
or by training under whom one grows in faith virtue learning generosity and understandingthis is called resort as support
What is resort as guarding
Here A bhikkhu having entered inside a house having gone into a street goes with downcast eyes seeing the length of a plough yoke restrained not looking at an elephant not looking at a horse a carriage a pedestrian a woman a man not looking up not looking down not staring this way and that  This is called resort as guarding
What is resort as anchoring
It is the four foundations of mindfulness on which the mind is anchored
for this is said by the Blessed One Bhikkhus what is a bhikkhus resort his own native place
It is these four foundations of mindfulness  This is called resort as anchoring
Being thus furnished with  endowed with this conduct and this resort
he is also on that account called one possessed of conduct and resort
Seeing fear in the slightest fault  one who has the habit of seeing fear in faults of the minutest measure of such kinds as unintentional contravening of a minor training rule of the Pātimokkha or the arising of unprofitable thoughts
He trains himself by undertaking the precepts of training whatever there is among the precepts of training to be trained in in all that he trains by taking it up rightly 
And here as far as the words one restrained by the Pātimokkha restraint virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is shown by discourse in terms of persons
But all that beginning with the words possessed of proper conduct and resort should be understood as said in order to show the way of practice that perfects that virtue in him who so practices it
 Now as regards the virtue of restraint of faculties shown next to that in the way beginning on seeing a visible object with the eye herein he is a bhikkhu established in the virtue of Pātimokkha restraint
On seeing a visible object with the eye on seeing a visible object with the eyeconsciousness that is capable of seeing visible objects and has borrowed the name eye from its instrument
But the Ancients said The eye does not see a visible object because it has no mind The mind does not see because it has no eyes But when there is the impingement of door and object he sees by means of the consciousness that has eyesensitivity as its physical basis
Now such as this is called an accessory locution  like He shot him with his bow and so onSo the meaning here is this On seeing a visible object with eyeconsciousness
Apprehends neither the signs he does not apprehend the sign of woman or man or any sign that is a basis for defilement such as the sign of beauty etc he stops at what is merely seen
Nor the particulars he does not apprehend any aspect classed as hand foot smile laughter talk looking ahead looking aside etc which has acquired the name particular because of its particularizing defilements because of its making them manifest themselves He only apprehends what is really there Like the Elder Mahā Tissa who dwelt at Cetiyapabbata
It seems that as the elder was on his way from Cetiyapabbata to Anurādhapura for alms a certain daughterinlaw of a clan who had quarrelled with her husband and had set out early from Anurādhapura all dressed up and tricked out like a celestial nymph to go to her relatives home saw him on the road and being low minded she laughed a loud laugh
Wondering What is that the elder looked up and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness  he reached Arahantship
Hence it was said
He saw the bones that were her teeth And kept in mind his first perception
And standing on that very spot The elder became an Arahant
But her husband who was going after her saw the elder and asked Venerable sir did you by any chance see a woman
 The elder told him
Whether it was a man or woman That went by I noticed not
But only that on this high road There goes a group of bones
As to the words through which etc the meaning is by reason of which because of which nonrestraint of the eye faculty if he if that person left the eye faculty unguarded remained with the eye door unclosed by the doorpanel of mindfulness these states of covetousness etc might invade might pursue might threaten him
He enters upon the way of its restraint he enters upon the way of closing that eye faculty by the doorpanel of mindfulness
It is the same one of whom it is said he guards the eye faculty undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty
Herein there is neither restraint nor nonrestraint in the actual eye faculty
since neither mindfulness nor forgetfulness arises in dependence on eyesensitivity
On the contrary when a visible datum as object comes into the eyes focus then after the lifecontinuum has arisen twice and ceased the functional mindelement accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceases
After that eye consciousness with the function of seeing
after that resultant mindelement with the function of receiving
after that resultant rootcauseless mindconsciousness element with the function of investigating
after that functional rootcauseless mindconsciousnesselement accomplishing the function of determining arises and ceases Next to that impulsion impels
Herein there is neither restraint nor non restraint on the occasion of the lifecontinuum or on any of the occasions beginning with adverting
But there is nonrestraint if unvirtuousness or forgetfulness or unknowing or impatience or idleness arises at the moment of impulsion
When this happens it is called nonrestraint in the eye faculty
Why is that
Because when this happens the door is not guarded nor are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series
Like what
Just as when a citys four gates are not secured although inside the city house doors storehouses rooms etc are secured yet all property inside the city is unguarded and unprotected
since robbers coming in by the city gates can do as they please so too when unvirtuousness etc arise in impulsion in which there is no restraint then the door too is unguarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting
But when virtue etc has arisen in it then the door too is guarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting
Like what
Just as when the city gates are secured although inside the city the houses etc are not secured yet all property inside the city is well guarded well protected
since when the city gates are shut there is no ingress for robbers so too when virtue etc have arisen in impulsion the door too is guarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting
Thus although it actually arises at the moment of impulsion it is nevertheless called restraint in the eye faculty
So also as regards the phrases on hearing a sound with the ear and so on
So it is this virtue which in brief has the characteristic of avoiding apprehension of signs entailing defilement with respect to visible objects etc that should be understood as virtue of restraint of faculties
 Now as regards the virtue of livelihood purification mentioned above next to the virtue of restraint of the faculties  the words of the six precepts announced on account of livelihood mean of the following six training precepts announced thus With livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason one of evil wishes a prey to wishes lays claim to a higher than human state that is nonexistent not a fact the contravention of which is defeat 
with livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason he acts as gobetween the contravention of which is an offence entailing a meeting of the Order
with livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason he says A bhikkhu who lives in your monastery is an Arahant the contravention of which is a serious offence in one who is aware of it
with livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason a bhikkhu who is not sick eats superior food that he has ordered for his own use the contravention of which is an offence requiring expiation
With livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason a bhikkhunī who is not sick eats superior food that she has ordered for her own use the contravention of which is an offence requiring confession
with livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason one who is not sick eats curry or boiled rice that he has ordered for his own use the contravention of which is an offence of wrongdoing  Of these six precepts
As regards scheming etc  this is the text Herein what is scheming
It is the grimacing grimacery scheming schemery schemedness by what is called rejection of requisites or by indirect talk or it is the disposing posing composing of the deportment on the part of one bent on gain honour and renown of one of evil wishes a prey to wishesthis is called scheming
Herein what is talking

Seeking seeking for seeking out going in search of searching for searching out material goods by means of material goods such as carrying there goods that have been got from here
or carrying here goods that have been got from there by one bent on gain honour and renown by one of evil wishes a prey to wishesthis is called pursuing gain with gain
The meaning of this text should be understood as follows
Firstly as regards description of scheming on the part of one bent on gain honour and renown is on the part of one who is bent on gain on honour and on reputation on the part of one who longs for them is the meaning
Of one of evil wishes of one who wants to show qualities that he has not got
A prey to wishes the meaning is of one who is attacked by them
And after this the passage beginning or by what is called rejection of requisites is given in order to show the three instances of scheming given in the Mahāniddesa as rejection of requisites indirect talk and that based on deportment
Herein a bhikkhu is invited to accept robes etc and precisely because he wants them he refuses them out of evil wishes And then since he knows that those householders believe in him implicitly when they think Oh how few are our lords wishes He will not accept a thing  and they put fine robes etc before him by various means he then accepts making a show that he wants to be compassionate towards themit is this hypocrisy of his which becomes the cause of their subsequently bringing them even by cartloads that should be understood as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites
For this is said in the Mahāniddesa
What is the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites
Here householders invite bhikkhus to accept robes alms food resting place and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick
One who is of evil wishes a prey to wishes wanting robes  alms food  resting place  the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick refuses robes 
alms food  resting place 
the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick because he wants more
He says What has an ascetic to do with expensive robes It is proper for an ascetic to gather rags from a charnel ground or from a rubbish heap or from a shop and make them into a patchwork cloak to wear
What has an ascetic to do with expensive alms food It is proper for an ascetic to get his living by the dropping of lumps of food into his bowl while he wanders for gleanings
What has an ascetic to do with an expensive resting place It is proper for an ascetic to be a treerootdweller or an openairdweller
What has an ascetic to do with an expensive requisite of medicine as cure for the sick It is proper for an ascetic to cure himself with putrid urine and broken gallnuts
Accordingly he wears a coarse robe eats coarse alms food uses a coarse resting place uses a coarse requisite of medicine as cure for the sick Then householders think This ascetic has few wishes is content is secluded keeps aloof from company is strenuous is a preacher of asceticism
and they invite him more and more to accept robes alms food resting places and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick
He says With three things present a faithful clansman produces much merit
with faith present a faithful clansman produces much merit
with goods to be given present a faithful clansman produces much merit with those worthy to receive present a faithful clansman produces much merit
You have faith the goods to be given are here and I am here to accept If I do not accept then you will be deprived of the merit That is no good to me
Rather will I accept out of compassion for you
Accordingly he accepts many robes
he accepts much alms food he accepts many resting places he accepts many requisites of medicine as cure for the sick
Such grimacing grimacery scheming schemery schemedness is known as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites 
It is hypocrisy on the part of one of evil wishes who gives it to be understood verbally in some way or other that he has attained a higher than human state that should be understood as the instance of scheming called indirect talk
according as it is said
What is the instance of scheming called indirect talk
Here someone of evil wishes a prey to wishes eager to be admired thinking Thus people will admire me speaks words about the noble state He says He who wears such a robe is a very important ascetic
He says He who carries such a bowl
 metal cup water filler water strainer key wears such a waist band sandals is a very important ascetic
He says He who has such a preceptor  teacher  who has the same preceptor who has the same teacher who has such a friend associate intimate companion
he who lives in such a monastery leanto mansion villa cave grotto hut pavilion watch tower hall barn meeting hall room at such a tree root is a very important ascetic
Or alternatively allgushing allgrimacing allscheming alltalkative with an expression of admiration he utters such deep mysterious cunning obscure supramundane talk suggestive of voidness as This ascetic is an obtainer of peaceful abidings and attainments such as these
Such grimacing grimacery scheming schemery schemedness is known as the instance of scheming called indirect talk 
It is hypocrisy on the part of one of evil wishes which takes the form of deportment influenced by eagerness to be admired that should be understood as the instance of scheming dependent on deportment
according as it is said What is the instance of scheming called deportment
Here someone of evil wishes a prey to wishes eager to be admired thinking Thus people will admire me composes his way of walking composes his way of lying down he walks studiedly stands studiedly sits studiedly lies down studiedly he walks as though concentrated stands sits lies down as though concentrated and he is one who meditates in public Such disposing posing composing of deportment grimacing grimacery scheming schemery schemedness is known as the instance of scheming called deportment 
Herein the words by what is called rejection of requisites mean by what is called thus rejection of requisites or they mean by means of the rejection of requisites that is so called
By indirect talk means by talking near to the subject
Of deportment means of the four modes of deportment 
Disposing is initial posing or careful posing
Posing is the manner of posing
Composing is prearranging assuming a trustinspiring attitude is what is meant
Grimacing is making grimaces by showing great intenseness facial contraction is what is meant
One who has the habit of making grimaces is a grimacer
The grimacers state is grimacery
Scheming is hypocrisy
The way of a schemer is schemery 
The state of what is schemed is schemedness
In the description of talking talking at is talking thus on seeing people coming to the monastery What have you come for good people What to invite bhikkhus If it is that then go along and I shall come later with my bowl etc
or alternatively talking at is talking by advertising oneself thus I am Tissa the king trusts me such and such kings ministers trust me
Talking is the same kind of talking on being asked a question
Talking round is roundly talking by one who is afraid of householders displeasure because he has given occasion for it
Talking up is talking by extolling people thus He is a great landowner a great shipowner a great lord of giving
Continual talking up is talking by extolling people in all ways
Persuading is progressively involving people thus Lay followers formerly you used to give firstfruit alms at such a time why do you not do so now  until they say We shall give venerable sir we have had no opportunity etc entangling is what is meant
Or alternatively seeing someone with sugarcane in his hand he asks Where are you coming from lay follower
From the sugarcane field venerable sir
Is the sugarcane sweet there
One can find out by eating venerable sir
It is not allowed lay follower for bhikkhus to say Give me some sugarcane
 Such entangling talk from such an entangler is persuading
Persuading again and again in all ways is continual persuading
Suggesting is insinuating by specifying thus That family alone understands me
if there is anything to be given there they give it to me only pointing to is what is meant
And here the story of the oilseller should be told
Suggesting in all ways again and again is continual suggesting
Ingratiating chatter is endearing chatter repeated again and again without regard to whether it is in conformity with truth and Dhamma
Flattery is speaking humbly always maintaining an attitude of inferiority
Beansoupery is resemblance to bean soup
for just as when beans are being cooked only a few do not get cooked the rest get cooked so too the person in whose speech only a little is true the rest being false is called a bean soup
his state is beansoupery
 Fondling is the state of the act of fondling
For when a man fondles children on his lap or on his shoulder like a nursehe nurses is the meaning
that fondlers act is the act of fondling
The state of the act of fondling is fondling
In the description of hinting  a sign is any bodily or verbal act that gets others to give requisites
Giving a sign is making a sign such as What have you got to eat  etc on seeing people going along with food
Indication is talk that alludes to requisites
Giving indication on seeing cowboys he asks Are these milk cows calves or buttermilk cows calves  and when it is said They are milk cows calves venerable sir he remarks They are not milk cows calves If they were milk cows calves the bhikkhus would be getting milk etc and his getting it to the knowledge of the boys parents in this way and so making them give milk is giving indication
Indirect talk is talk that keeps near to the subject
And here there should be told the story of the bhikkhu supported by a family
A bhikkhu it seems who was supported by a family went into the house wanting to eat and sat down
The mistress of the house was unwilling to give On seeing him she said There is no rice and she went to a neighbours house as though to get rice
The bhikkhu went into the storeroom Looking round he saw sugarcane in the corner behind the door sugar in a bowl a string of salt fish in a basket rice in a jar and ghee in a pot He came out and sat down
When the housewife came back she said I did not get any rice
The bhikkhu said Lay follower I saw a sign just now that alms will not be easy to get today
What venerable sir
 I saw a snake that was like sugarcane put in the corner behind the door looking for something to hit it with I saw a stone like a lump of sugar in a bowl When the snake had been hit with the clod it spread out a hood like a string of salt fish in a basket and its teeth as it tried to bite the clod were like rice grains in a jar Then the saliva mixed with poison that came out to its mouth in its fury was like ghee put in a pot
She thought There is no hoodwinking the shaveling so she gave him the sugarcane and she cooked the rice and gave it all to him with the ghee the sugar and the fish
Such talk that keeps near to the subject should be understood as indirect talk
Roundabout talk is talking round and round the subject as much as is allowed
In the description of belittling abusing is abusing by means of the ten instances of abuse
Disparaging is contemptuous talk
Reproaching is enumeration of faults such as He is faithless he is an unbeliever
Snubbing is taking up verbally thus Dont say that here
Snubbing in all ways giving grounds and reasons is continual snubbing
Or alternatively when someone does not give taking him up thus Oh the prince of givers is snubbing
and the thorough snubbing thus A mighty prince of givers  is continual snubbing
Ridicule is making fun of someone thus What sort of a life has this man who eats up his seed grain
Continual ridicule is making fun of him more thoroughly thus What you say this man is not a giver who always gives the words There is nothing to everyone 
Denigration is denigrating someone by saying that he is not a giver or by censuring him
Allround denigration is continual denigration
Talebearing is bearing tales from house to house from village to village from district to district thinking So they will give to me out of fear of my bearing tales
Backbiting is speaking censoriously behind anothers back after speaking kindly to his face
for this is like biting the flesh of anothers back when he is not looking on the part of one who is unable to look him in the face therefore it is called backbiting
This is called belittling because it scrapes off  wipes off the virtuous qualities of others as a bamboo scraper does unguent or because it is a pursuit of gain by grinding and pulverizing others virtuous qualities like the pursuit of perfume by grinding perfumed substances that is why it is called belittling
In the description of pursuing gain with gain pursuing is hunting after
Got from here is got from this house
There is into that house
Seeking is wanting
Seeking for is hunting after
Seeking out is hunting after again and again
The story of the bhikkhu who went round giving away the alms he had got at first to children of families here and there and in the end got milk and gruel should be told here
Searching etc are synonyms for seeking etc going in search of is seeking
searching for is seeking for searching out is seeking out
and so the construction here should be understood thus 
This is the meaning of scheming and so on
Now as regards the words The evil states beginning with  here the words beginning with should be understood to include the many evil states given in the Brahmajāla Sutta in the way beginning Or just as some worthy ascetics while eating the food given by the faithful make a living by wrong livelihood by such low arts as these
that is to say by palmistry by fortunetelling by divining omens by interpreting dreams marks on the body holes gnawed by mice by fire sacrifice by spoon oblation  
So this wrong livelihood entails the transgression of these six training precepts announced on account of livelihood and it entails the evil states beginning with Scheming talking hinting belittling pursuing gain with gain And so it is the abstinence from all sorts of wrong livelihood that is virtue of livelihood purification
the wordmeaning of which is this
on account of it they live thus it is livelihood
What is that It is the effort consisting in the search for requisites
Purification is purifiedness
Livelihood purification is purification of livelihood
 As regards the next kind called virtue concerning requisites Herein reflecting wisely is reflecting as the means and as the way by knowing by reviewing is the meaning
And here it is the reviewing stated in the way beginning For protection from cold that should be understood as reflecting wisely
 Herein the robe is any one of those beginning with the inner cloth
He uses he employs dresses in as inner cloth or puts on as upper garment
Only is a phrase signifying invariability in the definition of a limit of a purpose the purpose in the meditators making use of the robes is that much only namely protection from cold etc not more than that
From cold from any kind of cold arisen either through disturbance of elements internally or through change in temperature externally
For protection for the purpose of warding off
for the purpose of eliminating it so that it may not arouse affliction in the body
For when the body is afflicted by cold the distracted mind cannot be wisely exerted That is why the Blessed One permitted the robe to be used for protection from cold
So in each instance
except that from heat means from the heat of fire
the origin of which should be understood as forest fires and so on
From contact with gadflies and flies wind and burning and creeping things here gadflies are flies that bite they are also called blind flies
Flies are just flies
Wind is distinguished as that with dust and that without dust
Burning is burning of the sun
Creeping things are any long creatures such as snakes and so on that move by crawling Contact with them is of two kinds contact by being bitten and contact by being touched And that does not worry him who sits with a robe on So he uses it for the purpose of protection from such things
Only the word is repeated in order to define a subdivision of the invariable purpose for the concealment of the private parts is an invariable purpose the others are purposes periodically
Herein private parts are any parts of the pudendum
For when a member is disclosed conscience is disturbed  offended It is called private parts because of the disturbance of conscience 
For the purpose of concealing the private parts for the purpose of the concealment of those private parts
As well as the reading hirikopīnapaṭicchādanatthaṃ there is a reading hirikopīnaṃ paṭicchādanatthaṃ 
Alms food is any sort of food
For any sort of nutriment is called alms food because of its having been dropped into a bhikkhus bowl during his alms round 
Or alms food is the dropping of the lumps  it is the concurrence  the collection of alms obtained here and there is what is meant
Neither for amusement neither for the purpose of amusement as with village boys etc for the sake of sport is what is meant
Nor for intoxication not for the purpose of intoxication as with boxers etc for the sake of intoxication with strength and for the sake of intoxication with manhood is what is meant
Nor for smartening not for the purpose of smartening as with royal concubines courtesans etc for the sake of plumpness in all the limbs is what is meant
Nor for embellishment not for the purpose of embellishment as with actors dancers etc for the sake of a clear skin and complexion is what is meant
 And here the clause neither for amusement is stated for the purpose of abandoning support for delusion
nor for intoxication is said for the purpose of abandoning support for hate
nor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the purpose of abandoning support for greed
And neither for amusement nor for intoxication is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for oneself
Nor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for another
And the abandoning of both unwise practice and devotion to indulgence of sense pleasures should be understood as stated by these four
Only has the meaning already stated
Of this body of this material body consisting of the four great primaries
For the endurance for the purpose of continued endurance
And continuance for the purpose of not interrupting lifes continued occurrence or for the purpose of endurance for a long time
He makes use of the alms food for the purpose of the endurance for the purpose of the continuance of the body as the owner of an old house uses props for his house and as a carter uses axle grease not for the purpose of amusement intoxication smartening and embellishment
Furthermore endurance is a term for the life faculty So what has been said as far as the words for the endurance and continuance of this body can be understood to mean for the purpose of maintaining the occurrence of the life faculty in this body
 For the ending of discomfort hunger is called discomfort in the sense of afflicting
He makes use of alms food for the purpose of ending that like anointing a wound like counteracting heat with cold and so on
For assisting the life of purity for the purpose of assisting the life of purity consisting in the whole dispensation and the life of purity consisting in the path
For while this bhikkhu is engaged in crossing the desert of existence by means of devotion to the three trainings depending on bodily strength whose necessary condition is the use of alms food he makes use of it to assist the life of purity just as those seeking to cross the desert used their childs flesh just as those seeking to cross a river use a raft and just as those seeking to cross the ocean use a ship
Thus I shall put a stop to old feelings and shall not arouse new feelings thus as a sick man uses medicine he uses alms food thinking By use of this alms food I shall put a stop to the old feeling of hunger and I shall not arouse a new feeling by immoderate eating like one of the proverbial brahmans that is one who eats till he has to be helped up by hand or till his clothes will not meet or till he rolls there on the ground or till crows can peck from his mouth or until he vomits what he has eaten
Or alternatively there is that which is called old feelings because being conditioned by former kamma it arises now in dependence on unsuitable immoderate eating
I shall put a stop to that old feeling forestalling its condition by suitable moderate eating
And there is that which is called new feeling because it will arise in the future in dependence on the accumulation of kamma consisting in making improper use of the requisite of alms food now
I shall also not arouse that new feeling avoiding by means of proper use the production of its root This is how the meaning should be understood here
What has been shown so far can be understood to include proper use of requisites abandoning of devotion to selfmortification and not giving up lawful bliss 
And I shall be healthy In this body which exists in dependence on requisites I shall by moderate eating have health called long endurance since there will be no danger of severing the life faculty or interrupting the continuity of the postures  Reflecting in this way he makes use of the alms food as a sufferer from a chronic disease does of his medicine
And blameless and live in comfort  he makes use of them thinking I shall have blamelessness by avoiding improper search acceptance and eating and I shall have a comfortable abiding by moderate eating
Or he does so thinking I shall have blamelessness due to absence of such faults as boredom sloth sleepiness blame by the wise etc that have unseemly immoderate eating as their condition and I shall have a comfortable abiding by producing bodily strength that has seemly moderate eating as its condition
Or he does so thinking I shall have blamelessness by abandoning the pleasure of lying down lolling and torpor through refraining from eating as much as possible to stuff the belly and I shall have a comfortable abiding by controlling the four postures through eating four or five mouthfuls less than the maximum
For this is said
With four or five lumps still to eat Let him then end by drinking water
For energetic bhikkhus needs This should suffice to live in comfort 
Now what has been shown at this point can be understood as discernment of purpose and practice of the middle way
Resting place  this is the bed and seat 
For wherever one sleeps  whether in a monastery or in a leanto etc that is the bed 
wherever one seats oneself  sits  that is the seat 
Both together are called restingplace 
For the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and enjoying retreat the climate itself in the sense of imperilling is perils of climate 
Unsuitable climatic conditions that cause mental distraction due to bodily affliction can be warded off by making use of the resting place it is for the purpose of warding off these and for the purpose of the pleasure of solitude is what is meant
Of course the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by the phrase protection from cold etc too
but just as in the case of making use of the robes the concealment of the private parts is stated as an invariable purpose while the others are periodical purposes so here also this last should be understood as mentioned with reference to the invariable warding off of the perils of climate
Or alternatively this climate of the kind stated is just climate
but perils are of two kinds evident perils and concealed perils 
Herein evident perils are lions tigers etc
while concealed perils are greed hate and so on
When a bhikkhu knows and reflects thus in making use of the kind of resting place where these perils do not owing to unguarded doors and sight of unsuitable visible objects etc cause affliction he can be understood as one who reflecting wisely makes use of the resting place for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate
The requisite of medicine as cure for the sick here cure is in the sense of going against illness in the sense of countering is the meaning
This is a term for any suitable remedy
It is the medical mans work because it is permitted by him thus it is medicine 
Or the cure for the sick itself as medicine is medicine as cure for the sick  Any work of a medical man such as oil honey ghee etc that is suitable for one who is sick is what is meant
A requisite  however in such passages as It is well supplied with the requisites of a city is equipment
in such passages as The chariot has the requisite of virtue the axle of jhāna the wheel of energy it is an ornament
in such passages as The requisites for the life of one who has gone into homelessness that should be available  it is an accessory
But here both equipment and accessory are applicable
For that medicine as a cure for the sick is equipment for maintaining life because it protects by preventing the arising of affliction destructive to life
and it is an accessory too because it is an instrument for prolonging life That is why it is called requisite
So it is medicine as cure for the sick and that is a requisite thus it is a requisite of medicine as cure for the sick
He makes use of that requisite of medicine as cure for the sick
any requisite for life consisting of oil honey molasses ghee etc that is allowed by a medical man as suitable for the sick is what is meant
From arisen from born become produced
Hurtful here hurt  is a disturbance of elements and it is the leprosy tumours boils etc originated by that disturbance
Hurtful because arisen in the form of hurt 
Feelings painful feelings feelings resulting from unprofitable kamma
from those hurtful feelings
For complete immunity from affliction for complete freedom from pain
so that all that is painful is abandoned is the meaning
This is how this virtue concerning requisites should be understood In brief its characteristic is the use of requisites after wise reflection
The wordmeaning here is this because breathing things go  move proceed using what they use in dependence on these robes etc these robes etc are therefore called requisites 
concerning requisites is concerning those requisites
 So in this fourfold virtue Pātimokkha restraint has to be undertaken by means of faith
For that is accomplished by faith since the announcing of training precepts is outside the disciples province
and the evidence here is the refusal of the request to allow disciples to announce training precepts 
Having therefore undertaken through faith the training precepts without exception as announced one should completely perfect them without regard for life
For this is said
As a hen guards her eggs Or as a yak her tail
Or like a darling child Or like an only eye
So you who are engaged Your virtue to protect
Be prudent at all times And ever scrupulous
Also it is said further So too sire when a training precept for disciples is announced by me my disciples do not transgress it even for the sake of life 
And the story of the elders bound by robbers in the forest should be understood in this sense
It seems that robbers in the Mahāvaṭṭanī Forest bound an elder with black creepers and made him lie down
While he lay there for seven days he augmented his insight and after reaching the fruition of nonreturn he died there and was reborn in the Brahmāworld
Also they bound another elder in Tambapaṇṇi Island with string creepers and made him lie down
When a forest fire came and the creepers were not cut he established insight and attained Nibbāna simultaneously with his death
When the Elder Abhaya a preacher of the Dīgha Nikāya passed by with five hundred bhikkhus he saw what had happened and he had the elders body cremated and a shrine built
Therefore let other clansmen also
Maintain the rules of conduct pure Renouncing life if there be need
Rather than break virtues restraint By the Worlds Saviour decreed
 And as Pātimokkha restraint is undertaken out of faith so restraint of the sense faculties should be undertaken with mindfulness
For that is accomplished by mindfulness because when the sense faculties functions are founded on mindfulness there is no liability to invasion by covetousness and the rest
So recollecting the Fire Discourse which begins thus Better bhikkhus the extirpation of the eye faculty by a redhot burning blazing glowing iron spike than the apprehension of signs in the particulars of visible objects cognizable by the eye  this restraint should be properly undertaken by preventing with unremitting mindfulness any apprehension in the objective fields consisting of visible data etc of any signs etc likely to encourage covetousness etc to invade consciousness occurring in connection with the eye door and so on
 When not undertaken thus virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is unenduring it does not last like a crop not fenced in with branches
And it is raided by the robber defilements as a village with open gates is by thieves
And lust leaks into his mind as rain does into a badlyroofed house
For this is said
Among the visible objects sounds and smells
And tastes and tangibles guard the faculties
For when these doors are open and unguarded
Then thieves will come and raid as twere a village 
And just as with an illroofed house The rain comes leaking in so too
Will lust come leaking in for sure Upon an undeveloped mind 
 When it is undertaken thus virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is enduring it lasts like a crop well fenced in with branches
And it is not raided by the robber defilements as a village with wellguarded gates is not by thieves
And lust does not leak into his mind as rain does not into a wellroofed house
For this is said
Among the visible objects sounds and smells
And tastes and tangibles guard the faculties
For when these doors are closed and truly guarded
Thieves will not come and raid as twere a village 
And just as with a wellroofed house No rain comes leaking in so too
No lust comes leaking in for sure Upon a welldeveloped mind 
 This however is the teaching at its very highest
This mind is called quickly transformed  so restraint of the faculties should be undertaken by removing arisen lust with the contemplation of foulness as was done by the Elder Vaṅgīsa soon after he had gone forth
As the elder was wandering for alms it seems soon after going forth lust arose in him on seeing a woman
Thereupon he said to the venerable nanda
I am afire with sensual lust And burning flames consume my mind
In pity tell me Gotama How to extinguish it for good 
The elder said
You do perceive mistakenly That burning flames consume your mind
Look for no sign of beauty there For that it is which leads to lust
See foulness there and keep your mind Harmoniously concentrated
Formations see as alien As ill not self so this great lust
May be extinguished and no more Take fire thus ever and again 
The elder expelled his lust and then went on with his alms round
Moreover a bhikkhu who is fulfilling restraint of the faculties should be like the Elder Cittagutta resident in the Great Cave at Kuraṇḍaka and like the Elder Mahā Mitta resident at the Great Monastery of Coraka
In the Great Cave of Kuraṇḍaka it seems there was a lovely painting of the Renunciation of the Seven Buddhas A number of bhikkhus wandering about among the dwellings saw the painting and said What a lovely painting venerable sir
 The elder said For more than sixty years friends I have lived in the cave and I did not know whether there was any painting there or not
Now today I know it through those who have eyes The elder it seems though he had lived there for so long had never raised his eyes and looked up at the cave
And at the door of his cave there was a great ironwood tree
And the elder had never looked up at that either
He knew it was in flower when he saw its petals on the ground each year
 The king heard of the elders great virtues and he sent for him three times desiring to pay homage to him When the elder did not go he had the breasts of all the women with infants in the town bound and sealed off saying As long as the elder does not come let the children go without milk
Out of compassion for the children the elder went to Mahāgāma
When the king heard that he had come he said Go and bring the elder in I shall take the precepts Having had him brought up into the inner palace he paid homage to him and provided him with a meal Then saying Today venerable sir there is no opportunity I shall take the precepts tomorrow he took the elders bowl After following him for a little he paid homage with the queen and turned back
whether it was the king who paid homage or whether it was the queen the elder said May the king be happy
As seven days went by thus 
 Bhikkhus asked Why is it venerable sir that whether it is the king who pays the homage or the queen you say May the king be happy
 The elder replied Friends I do not notice whether it is the king or the queen At the end of seven days when it was found that the elder was not happy living there he was dismissed by the king He went back to the Great Cave at Kuraṇḍaka When it was night he went out onto his walk
A deity who dwelt in the ironwood tree stood by with a torch of sticks
Then his meditation subject became quite clear and plain
The elder thinking How clear my meditation subject is today  was glad and immediately after the middle watch he reached Arahantship making the whole rock resound
 So when another clansman seeks his own good
Let him not be hungryeyed Like a monkey in the groves
Like a wild deer in the woods Like a nervous little child
Let him go with eyes downcast Seeing a plough yokes length before
That he fall not in the power Of the forestmonkey mind
 The Elder Mahā Mittas mother was sick with a poisoned tumour She told her daughter who as a bhikkhunī had also gone forth
plienmatchesvisudhijson        en Lady go to your brother Tell him my trouble and bring back some medicine
 She went and told him
The elder said I do not know how to gather root medicines and such things and concoct a medicine from them But rather I will tell you a medicine since I went forth I have not broken my virtue of restraint of the sense faculties by looking at the bodily form of the opposite sex with a lustful mind By this declaration of truth may my mother get well Go and tell the lay devotee and rub her body
She went and told her what had happened and then did as she had been instructed
At that very moment the lay devotees tumour vanished shrinking away like a lump of froth She got up and uttered a cry of joy If the Fully Enlightened One were still alive why should he not stroke with his netadorned hand the head of a bhikkhu like my son
So
 Let another noble clansman Gone forth in the Dispensation
Keep as did the Elder Mitta Perfect faculty restraint
 As restraint of the faculties is to be undertaken by means of mindfulness so livelihood purification is to be undertaken by means of energy
For that is accomplished by energy because the abandoning of wrong livelihood is effected in one who has rightly applied energy
Abandoning therefore unbefitting wrong search this should be undertaken with energy by means of the right kind of search consisting in going on alms round etc avoiding what is of impure origin as though it were a poisonous snake and using only requisites of pure origin
Herein for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices any requisites obtained from the Community from a group of bhikkhus or from laymen who have confidence in his special qualities of teaching the Dhamma etc are called of pure origin
But those obtained on alms round etc are of extremely pure origin
For one who has taken up the ascetic practices those obtained on alms round etc andas long as this is in accordance with the rules of the ascetic practicesfrom people who have confidence in his special qualities of asceticism are called of pure origin
And if he has got putrid urine with mixed gall nuts and foursweets for the purpose of curing a certain affliction and he eats only the broken gall nuts thinking Other companions in the life of purity will eat the foursweets his undertaking of the ascetic practices is befitting
for he is then called a bhikkhu who is supreme in the Noble Ones heritages 
 As to the robe and the other requisites no hint indication roundabout talk or intimation about robes and alms food is allowable for a bhikkhu who is purifying his livelihood
But a hint indication or roundabout talk about a resting place is allowable for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices
 Herein a hint is when one who is getting the preparing of the ground etc done for the purpose of making a resting place is asked What is being done venerable sir Who is having it done  and he replies No one or any other such giving of hints
An indication is saying Lay follower where do you live
In a mansion venerable sir
But lay follower a mansion is not allowed for bhikkhus Or any other such giving of indication
Roundabout talk is saying The resting place for the Community of Bhikkhus is crowded or any other such oblique talk
 All however is allowed in the case of medicine
But when the disease is cured is it or is it not allowed to use the medicine obtained in this way
Herein the Vinaya specialists say that the opening has been given by the Blessed One therefore it is allowable
But the Suttanta specialists say that though there is no offence nevertheless the livelihood is sullied therefore it is not allowable
 But one who does not use hints indications roundabout talk or intimation though these are permitted by the Blessed One and who depends only on the special qualities of fewness of wishes etc and makes use only of requisites obtained otherwise than by indication etc even when he thus risks his life is called supreme in living in effacement like the venerable Sāriputta
 It seems that the venerable one was cultivating seclusion at one time living in a certain forest with the Elder Mahā Moggallāna One day an affliction of colic arose in him causing him great pain
In the evening the Elder Mahā Moggallāna went to attend upon him Seeing him lying down he asked what the reason was And then he asked What used to make you better formerly friend
The elder said When I was a layman friend my mother used to mix ghee honey sugar and so on and give me rice gruel with pure milk That used to make me better
Then the other said So be it friend If either you or I have merit perhaps tomorrow we shall get some
 Now a deity who dwelt in a tree at the end of the walk overheard their conversation Thinking I will find rice gruel for the lord tomorrow he went meanwhile to the family who was supporting the elder and entered into the body of the eldest son causing him discomfort
Then he told the assembled relatives the price of the cure If you prepare rice gruel of such a kind tomorrow for the elder I will set this one free
They said Even without being told by you we regularly supply the elders needs and on the following day they prepared rice gruel of the kind needed
The Elder Mahā Moggallāna came in the morning and said Stay here friend till I come back from the alms round Then he went into the village
Those people met him They took his bowl filled it with the stipulated kind of rice gruel and gave it back to him
The elder made as though to go
but they said Eat venerable sir we shall give you more When the elder had eaten they gave him another bowlful
The elder left Bringing the alms food to the venerable Sāriputta he said Here friend Sāriputta eat
When the elder saw it he thought The gruel is very nice How was it got  and seeing how it had been obtained he said Friend the alms food cannot be used
 Instead of thinking He does not eat alms food brought by the likes of me the other at once took the bowl by the rim and turned it over on one side
As the rice gruel fell on the ground the elders affliction vanished From then on it did not appear again during fortyfive years
Then he said to the venerable Mahā Moggallāna Friend even if ones bowels come out and trail on the ground it is not fitting to eat gruel got by verbal intimation
and he uttered this exclamation
The honey and the gruel obtained By influence of verbal hints
If I were to consent to eat My livelihood might well be blamed
And even if my bowels obtrude And trail outside and even though
My life is to be jeopardized I will not blot my livelihood 
For I will satisfy my heart By shunning all wrong kinds of search
And never will I undertake The search the Buddhas have condemned
 And here too should be told the story of the Elder Mahā Tissa the Mango eater who lived at Cīragumba 
So in all respects
And seeing clearly give no thought To any search that is not good
A man who has gone forth in faith Should purify his livelihood
 And as livelihood purification is to be undertaken by means of energy so virtue dependent on requisites is to be undertaken by means of understanding
For that is accomplished by understanding because one who possesses understanding is able to see the advantages and the dangers in requisites
So one should abandon greed for requisites and undertake that virtue by using requisites obtained lawfully and properly after reviewing them with understanding in the way aforesaid
 Herein reviewing is of two kinds at the time of receiving requisites and at the time of using them
For use is blameless in one who at the time of receiving robes etc reviews them either as mere elements or as repulsive and puts them aside for later use and in one who reviews them thus at the time of using them
 Here is an explanation to settle the matter
There are four kinds of use use as theft use as a debt  use as an inheritance use as a master
Herein use by one who is unvirtuous and makes use of requisites even sitting in the midst of the Community is called use as theft
Use without reviewing by one who is virtuous is use as a debt
therefore the robe should be reviewed every time it is used and the alms food lump by lump One who cannot do this should review it before the meal after the meal in the first watch in the middle watch and in the last watch
If dawn breaks on him without his having reviewed it he finds himself in the position of one who has used it as a debt
Also the resting place should be reviewed each time it is used
Recourse to mindfulness both in the accepting and the use of medicine is proper
but while this is so though there is an offence for one who uses it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance there is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness
 Purification is of four kinds purification by the Teaching purification by restraint purification by search and purification by reviewing
Herein virtue of the Pātimokkha restraint is called purification by the Teaching
 for that is so called because it purifies by means of teaching
Virtue of restraint of faculties is called purification by restraint
for that is so called because it purifies by means of the restraint in the mental resolution I shall not do so again
Virtue of livelihood purification is called purification by search
for that is so called because search is purified in one who abandons wrong search and gets requisites lawfully and properly
Virtue dependent on requisites is called purification by reviewing
for that is so called because it purifies by the reviewing of the kind already described
Hence it was said above  There is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness
 Use of the requisites by the seven kinds of trainers is called use as an inheritance
for they are the Buddhas sons therefore they make use of the requisites as the heirs of requisites belonging to their father
But how then is it the Blessed Ones requisites or the laitys requisites that are used
Although given by the laity they actually belong to the Blessed One because it is by the Blessed One that they are permitted That is why it should be understood that the Blessed Ones requisites are used
The confirmation here is in the Dhammadāyāda Sutta 
Use by those whose cankers are destroyed is called use as a master
for they make use of them as masters because they have escaped the slavery of craving
 As regards these kinds of use use as a master and use as an inheritance are allowable for all
Use as a debt is not allowable
to say nothing of use as theft
But this use of what is reviewed by one who is virtuous is use freed from debt because it is the opposite of use as a debt or is included in use as an inheritance too
For one possessed of virtue is called a trainer too because of possessing this training
 As regards these three kinds of use since use as a master is best when a bhikkhu undertakes virtue dependent on requisites he should aspire to that and use them after reviewing them in the way described
And this is said
Of alms food and of dwelling And of a resting place
And also of the water For washing dirt from robes
Who listens to the Dhamma As taught by the Sublime One
The truly wise disciple Makes use after reviewing 
By alms food and by dwelling And by a resting place
And also by the water For washing dirt from robes
unsullied By any of these matters
A bhikkhu is like a drop of water Lying on leaves of lotus
Since aid it is and timely Procured from another
In chewing and in eating In tasting food besides
The right amount he reckons Mindful without remitting
He treats it as an ointment Applied upon a wound
So like the childs flesh in the desert Like the greasing for the axle
He should eat without delusion Nutriment to keep alive
 And in connection with the fulfilling of this virtue dependent on requisites there should be told the story of the novice Saṅgharakkhita the Nephew
For he made use of requisites after reviewing
according as it is said
Seeing me eat a dish of rice Quite cold my preceptor observed
Novice if you are not restrained Be careful not to burn your tongue
On hearing my Preceptors words I then and there felt urged to act
And sitting in a single session I reached the goal of Arahantship
Since I am now waxed full in thought Like the full moon of the fifteenth 
And all my cankers are destroyed There is no more becoming now
And so should any other man Aspiring to end suffering
Make use of all the requisites Wisely after reviewing them
So virtue is of four kinds as virtue of Pātimokkha restraint and so on
 In the first pentad in the fivefold section the meaning should be understood in accordance with the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order and so on
For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā
 What is virtue consisting in limited purification
That of the training precepts for those not fully admitted to the Order such is virtue consisting in limited purification
 What is virtue consisting in unlimited purification
That of the training precepts for those fully admitted to the Order such is virtue consisting in unlimited purification
 What is virtue consisting in fulfilled purification
That of magnanimous ordinary men devoted to profitable things who are perfecting the course that ends in trainership regardless of the physical body and life having given up attachment to life such is virtue of fulfilled purification
 What is virtue consisting in purification not adhered to
That of the seven kinds of trainer such is virtue consisting in purification not adhered to
 What is virtue consisting in tranquillized purification
That of the Perfect Ones disciples with cankers destroyed of the Paccekabuddhas of the Perfect Ones accomplished and fully enlightened such is virtue consisting in tranquillized purification 
 Herein the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order should be understood as virtue consisting in limited purification because it is limited by the number of training precepts that is five or eight or ten
 That of those fully admitted to the Order is describable thus
Nine thousand millions and a hundred And eighty millions then as well
And fifty plus a hundred thousand And thirtysix again to swell
The total restraint disciplines These rules the Enlightened One explains
Told under heads for filling out Which the Discipline restraint contains
So although limited in number it should yet be understood as virtue consisting in unlimited purification since it is undertaken without reserve and has no obvious limit such as gain fame relatives limbs or life Like the virtue of the Elder Mahā Tissa the Mangoeater who lived at Cīragumba 
 For that venerable one never abandoned the following good mans recollection
Wealth for a sound limbs sake should be renounced And one who guards his life gives up his limbs
And wealth and limbs and life each one of these A man gives up who practices the Dhamma
And he never transgressed a training precept even when his life was in the balance and in this way he reached Arahantship with that same virtue of unlimited purification as his support while he was being carried on a lay devotees back
According to as it is said
Nor your mother nor your father Nor your relatives and kin
Have done as much as this for you Because you are possessed of virtue
So stirred with urgency and wisely Comprehending with insight
While carried on his helpers back He reached the goal of Arahantship
 The magnanimous ordinary mans virtue which from the time of admission to the Order is devoid even of the stain of a wrong thought because of its extreme purity like a gem of purest water like wellrefined gold becomes the proximate cause for Arahantship itself which is why it is called consisting of fulfilled purification like that of the lders Saṅgharakkhita the Great and Saṅgharakkhita the Nephew
 The Elder Saṅgharakkhita the Great  aged over sixty was lying it seems on his deathbed The Order of Bhikkhus questioned him about attainment of the supramundane state
The elder said I have no supramundane state
Then the young bhikkhu who was attending on him said Venerable sir people have come as much as twelve leagues thinking that you have reached Nibbāna It will be a disappointment for many if you die as an ordinary man
 Friend thinking to see the Blessed One Metteyya I did not try for insight
So help me to sit up and give me the chance
He helped the elder to sit up and went out
As he went out the elder reached Arahantship and he gave a sign by snapping his fingers
The Order assembled and said to him Venerable sir you have done a difficult thing in achieving the supramundane state in the hour of death
That was not difficult friends But rather I will tell you what is difficult Friends I see no action done by me without mindfulness and unknowingly since the time I went forth
His nephew also reached Arahantship in the same way at the age of fifty years
 Now if a man has little learning And he is careless of his virtue
They censure him on both accounts For lack of virtue and of learning
But if he is of little learning Yet he is careful of his virtue
They praise him for his virtue so It is as though he too had learning
And if he is of ample learning Yet he is careless of his virtue
They blame him for his virtue so It is as though he had no learning
But if he is of ample learning And he is careful of his virtue
They give him praise on both accounts For virtue and as well for learning
The Buddhas pupil of much learning Who keeps the Law with understanding
A jewel of Jambu River gold Who is here fit to censure him
Deities praise him constantly By Brahmā also is he praised 
 What should be understood as virtue consisting in purification not adhered to is trainers virtue because it is not adhered to by false view and ordinary mens virtue when not adhered to by greed Like the virtue of the Elder Tissa the Landowners Son 
Wanting to become established in Arahantship in dependence on such virtue this venerable one told his enemies
I broke the bones of both my legs To give the pledge you asked from me
I am revolted and ashamed At death accompanied by greed
And after I had thought on this And wisely then applied insight
When the sun rose and shone on me I had become an Arahant 
 Also there was a certain senior elder who was very ill and unable to eat with his own hand He was writhing smeared with his own urine and excrement Seeing him a certain young bhikkhu said Oh what a painful process life is
The senior elder told him If I were to die now friend I should obtain the bliss of heaven I have no doubt of that But the bliss obtained by breaking this virtue would be like the lay state obtained by disavowing the training and he added I shall die together with my virtue As he lay there he comprehended that same illness with insight and he reached Arahantship Having done so he pronounced these verses to the Order of Bhikkhus
I am victim of a sickening disease
That racks me with its burden of cruel pain
So this my corpse will soon have withered up
As flowers in the dust burnt by the sun
Unbeautiful called beautiful Unclean while reckoned as if clean
Though full of ordure seeming fair To him that cannot see it clear
So out upon this ailing rotting body Fetid and filthy punished with affliction
Doting on which this silly generation Has lost the way to be reborn in heaven 
 It is the virtue of the Arahants etc that should be understood as tranquillized purification because of tranquillization of all disturbance and because of purifiedness
So it is of five kinds as consisting in limited purification and so on
 In the second pentad the meaning should be understood as the abandoning etc of killing living things etc
for this is said in the Paṭisambhidā
Five kinds of virtue In the case of killing living things abandoning is virtue abstention is virtue volition is virtue restraint is virtue non transgression is virtue
 In the case of taking what is not given  In the case of sexual misconduct  In the case of false speech  In the case of malicious speech  In the case of harsh speech  In the case of gossip  In the case of covetousness  In the case of ill will  In the case of wrong view  Through renunciation in the case of lust abandoning is virtue  Through nonillwill in the case of illwill  Through perception of light in the case of stiffnessandtorpor  Through nondistraction  agitation  Through definition of states  uncertainty  Through knowledge  ignorance  Through gladdening in the case of boredom  Through the first jhāna in the case of the hindrances abandoning is virtue  Through the second jhāna  applied and sustained thought  Through the third jhāna  happiness  Through the fourth jhāna in the case of pleasure and pain abandoning is virtue  Through the attainment of the base consisting of boundless space in the case of perceptions of matter perceptions of resistance and perceptions of variety abandoning is virtue  Through the attainment of the base consisting of boundless consciousness in the case of the perception of the base consisting of boundless space  Through the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness in the case of the perception of the base consisting of boundless consciousness  Through the attainment of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception in the case of the perception of the base consisting of nothingness  Through the contemplation of impermanence in the case of the perception of permanence abandoning is virtue  Through the contemplation of pain in the case of the perception of pleasure  Through the contemplation of notself in the case of the perception of self  Through the contemplation of dispassion in the case of the perception of delighting  Through the contemplation of fading away in the case of greed  Through the contemplation of cessation in the case of originating  Through the contemplation of relinquishment in the case of grasping  Through the contemplation of destruction in the case of the perception of compactness abandoning is virtue  Through the contemplation of fall of formations in the case of accumulating kamma  Through the contemplation of change in the case of the perception of lastingness  Through the contemplation of the signless in the case of a sign  Through the contemplation of the desireless in the case of desire  Through the contemplation of voidness in the case of misinterpreting  Through insight into states that is higher understanding in the case of misinterpreting due to grasping  Through correct knowledge and vision in the case of misinterpreting due to confusion  Through the contemplation of danger in the case of misinterpreting due to reliance on formations  Through reflection in the case of nonreflection  Through the contemplation of turning away in the case of misinterpreting due to bondage 
 Through the path of streamentry in the case of defilements coefficient with false view abandoning is virtue  Through the path of oncereturn in the case of gross defilements  Through the path of nonreturn in the case of residual defilements  Through the path of Arahantship in the case of all defilements abandoning is virtue abstention is virtue volition is virtue restraint is virtue nontransgression is virtue Such virtues lead to nonremorse in the mind to gladdening to happiness to tranquillity to joy to repetition to development to cultivation to embellishment to the requisite for concentration to the equipment of concentration to fulfilment to complete dispassion to fading away to cessation to peace to directknowledge to enlightenment to Nibbāna
And here there is no state called abandoning other than the mere nonarising of the killing of living things etc as stated
But the abandoning of a given unprofitable state upholds a given profitable state in the sense of providing a foundation for it and concentrates it by preventing wavering
so it is called virtue in the sense of composing  reckoned as upholding and concentrating as stated earlier 
The other four things mentioned refer to the presence of occurrence of will as abstention from such and such as restraint of such and such as the volition associated with both of these and as nontransgression in one who does not transgress such and such
But their meaning of virtue has been explained already
So it is of five kinds as virtue consisting in abandoning and so on
 At this point What is virtue
In what sense is it virtue
What are its characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause
What are the benefits of virtue
How many kinds of virtue are there
the answers to the questions are complete
 However it was also asked WHAT IS THE DEFILING OF IT and WHAT IS THE CLEANSING OF IT
We answer that virtues tornness etc is its defiling and that its untornness etc is its cleansing
Now that tornness etc are comprised under the breach that has gain fame etc as its cause and under the seven bonds of sexuality
When a man has broken the training course at the beginning or at the end in any instance of the seven classes of offences his virtue is called torn like a cloth that is cut at the edge
But when he has broken it in the middle it is called rent like a cloth that is rent in the middle
When he has broken it twice or thrice in succession it is called blotched like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with a discrepant colour appearing on the back or the belly
When he has broken it all over at intervals it is called mottled like a cow speckled all over with discrepant coloured spots at intervals
This in the first place is how there comes to be tornness with the breach that has gain etc as its cause
And likewise with the seven bonds of sexuality
for this is said by the Blessed One
Here brahman some ascetic or brahman claims to lead the life of purity rightly for he does not enter into actual sexual intercourse with women Yet he agrees to massage manipulation bathing and rubbing down by women He enjoys it desires it and takes satisfaction in it This is what is torn rent blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of purity
This man is said to lead a life of purity that is unclean As one who is bound by the bond of sexuality he will not be released from birth
ageing and death  he will not be released from suffering I say
 Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these things
yet he jokes plays and amuses himself with women 
 Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these things
yet he gazes and stares at women eye to eye 
 Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these things
yet he listens to the sound of women through a wall or through a fence as they laugh or talk or sing or weep 
 Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these things yet he
recalls laughs and talks and games that he formerly had with women 
 Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these things
yet he sees a householder or a householders son possessed of endowed with and indulging in the five cords of sense desire 
 Furthermore brahman while he does not agree to these things
yet he leads the life of purity aspiring to some order of deities thinking Through this rite or this ritual or this asceticism I shall become a great deity or some lesser deity
He enjoys it desires it and takes satisfaction in it
This brahman is what is torn rent blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of purity This man  will not be released from suffering I say 
This is how tornness etc should be understood as included under the breach that has gain etc as its cause and under the seven bonds of sexuality
Untornness however is accomplished by the complete nonbreaking of the training precepts by making amends for those broken for which amends should be made by the absence of the seven bonds of sexuality and as well by the non arising of such evil things as anger enmity contempt domineering envy avarice deceit fraud obduracy presumption pride  haughtiness conceit  and negligence  and by the arising of such qualities as fewness of wishes contentment and effacement 
 Virtues not broken for the purpose of gain etc and rectified by making amends after being broken by the faults of negligence etc and not damaged by the bonds of sexuality and by such evil things as anger and enmity are called entirely untorn unrent unblotched and unmottled
And those same virtues are liberating since they bring about the state of a freeman and praised by the wise since it is by the wise that they are praised and unadheredto since they are not adhered to by means of craving and views and conducive to concentration since they conduce to access concentration or to absorption concentration
That is why their untornness etc should be understood as cleansing 
This cleansing comes about in two ways through seeing the danger of failure in virtue and through seeing the benefit of perfected virtue
Herein the danger of failure in virtue can be seen in accordance with such suttas as that beginning Bhikkhus there are these five dangers for the unvirtuous in the failure of virtue 
 Furthermore on account of his unvirtuousness an unvirtuous person is displeasing to deities and human beings is uninstructable by his fellows in the life of purity suffers when unvirtuousness is censured and is remorseful when the virtuous are praised Owing to that unvirtuousness he is as ugly as hemp cloth
Contact with him is painful because those who fall in with his views are brought to longlasting suffering in the states of loss
He is worthless because he causes no great fruit to accrue to those who give him gifts
He is as hard to purify as a cesspit many years old
He is like a log from a pyre  for he is outside both recluseship and the lay state
Though claiming the bhikkhu state he is no bhikkhu so he is like a donkey following a herd of cattle
He is always nervous like a man who is everyones enemy
He is as unfit to live with as a dead carcase
Though he may have the qualities of learning etc he is as unfit for the homage of his fellows in the life of purity as a charnelground fire is for that of brahmans
He is as incapable of reaching the distinction of attainment as a blind man is of seeing a visible object
He is as careless of the Good Law as a guttersnipe is of a kingdom
Though he fancies he is happy yet he suffers because he reaps suffering as told in the Discourse on the Mass of Fire 
Now the Blessed One has shown that when the unvirtuous have their minds captured by pleasure and satisfaction in the indulgence of the five cords of sense desires in receiving salutation in being honoured etc the result of that kamma directly visible in all ways is very violent pain with that kamma as its condition capable of producing a gush of hot blood by causing agony of heart with the mere recollection of it
Here is the text Bhikkhus do you see that great mass of fire burning blazing and glowing
 Yes venerable sir
What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one gone forth should sit down or lie down embracing that mass of fire burning blazing and glowing or that he should sit down or lie down embracing a warriornoble maiden or a brahman maiden or a maiden of householder family with soft delicate hands and feet
It would be better venerable sir that he should sit down or lie down embracing a warriornoble maiden 
It would be painful venerable sir if he sat down or lay down embracing that great mass of fire burning blazing and glowing
 I say to you bhikkhus I declare to you bhikkhus that it would be better for one gone forth who is unvirtuous who is evilnatured of unclean and suspect habits secretive of his acts who is not an ascetic and claims to be one who does not lead the life of purity and claims to do so who is rotten within lecherous and full of corruption to sit down or lie down embracing that great mass of fire burning blazing and glowing
Why is that
By his doing so bhikkhus he might come to death or deadly suffering yet he would not on that account on the breakup of the body after death reappear in states of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell But if one who is unvirtuous evilnatured  and full of corruption should sit down or lie down embracing a warriornoble maiden  that would be long for his harm and suffering on the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in states of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell 
Having thus shown by means of the analogy of the mass of fire the suffering that is bound up with women and has as its condition the indulgence of the five cords of sense desires by the unvirtuous
What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong horse hair rope twisted round both legs by a strong man and tightened so that it cut through the outer skin and having cut through the outer skin it cut through the inner skin and having cut through the inner skin it cut through the flesh and having cut through the flesh it cut through the sinews and having cut through the sinews it cut through the bones and having cut through the bones it remained crushing the bone marrowor that he should consent to the homage of great warriornobles great brahmans great householders  
And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong man wound ones breast with a sharp spear tempered in oilor that he should consent to the reverential salutation of great warriornobles great brahmans great householders  
And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that ones body should be wrapped by a strong man in a redhot iron sheet burning blazing and glowing or that he should use robes given out of faith by great warriornobles great brahmans great householders  
And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that ones mouth should be prised open by a strong man with redhot iron tongs burning blazing and glowing and that into his mouth should be put a redhot iron ball burning blazing and glowing which burns his lips and burns his mouth and tongue and throat and belly and passes out below carrying with it his bowels and entrailsor that he should use alms food given out of faith by great warriornobles   
And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong man seize him by the head or seize him by the shoulders and seat him or lay him on a redhot iron bed or iron chair burning blazing and glowingor that he should use a bed or chair given out of faith by great warriornobles   
And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong man take him feet up and head down and plunge him into a redhot metal cauldron burning blazing and glowing to be boiled there in a swirl of froth and as he boils in the swirl of froth to be swept now up now down and now acrossor that he should use a dwelling given out of faith by great warriornobles   
to the same intent he showed by the following similes of the horsehair rope the sharp spear the iron sheet the iron ball the iron bed the iron chair and the iron cauldron the pain that has as its condition acceptance of homage and reverential salutation and the use of robes alms food bed and chair and dwelling by unvirtuous bhikkhus 
 Of pain more violent even than the pain In the embracing of a mass of fire
What pleasure has a man of broken virtue Forsaking not sense pleasures which bear fruit
What pleasure has he in accepting homage Who having failed in virtue must partake
Of pain that will excel in agony The crushing of his legs with horsehair ropes
What pleasure has a man devoid of virtue Accepting salutations of the faithful
Which is the cause of pain acuter still Than pain produced by stabbing with a spear
What is the pleasure in the use of garments For one without restraint whereby in hell
He will for long be forced to undergo The contact of the blazing iron sheet
Although to him his alms food may seem tasty Who has no virtue it is direst poison
Because of which he surely will be made For long to swallow burning iron balls
And when the virtueless make use of couches And chairs though reckoned pleasing it is pain
Because they will be tortured long indeed On redhot blazing iron beds and chairs
Then what delight is there for one unvirtuous Inhabiting a dwelling given in faith
Since for that reason he will have to dwell Shut up inside a blazing iron pan
Described him in these terms Of suspect habits Full of corruption lecherous as well By nature evil
rotten too within The Teacher of the world in him condemning 
So out upon the life of him abiding Without restraint of him that wears the guise
Of the ascetic that he will not be And damages and undermines himself
Avoids it here as those that would look well Keep far away from dung or from a corpse
What is the life he leads since any person No matter who with virtue to his credit
He is not free from any sort of terror Though free enough from pleasure of attainment
While heavens door is bolted fast against him He is well set upon the road to hell
Who else if not one destitute of virtue More fit to be the object of compassion
Many indeed and grave are the defects That brand a man neglectful of his virtue
Seeing danger in the failure of virtue should be understood as reviewing in such ways as these And seeing benefits in perfected virtue should be understood in the opposite sense
 Furthermore
His virtue is immaculate His wearing of the bowl and robes
Gives pleasure and inspires trust His going forth will bear its fruit
A bhikkhu in his virtue pure Has never fear that selfreproach
Will enter in his heart indeed There is no darkness in the sun
A bhikkhu in his virtue bright Shines forth in the Ascetics Wood
As by the brightness of his beams The moon lights up the firmament
Now if the bodily perfume Of virtuous bhikkhus can succeed
In pleasing even deities What of the perfume of his virtue
It is more perfect far than all The other perfumes in the world
Because the perfume virtue gives Is borne unchecked in all directions
The deeds done for a virtuous man Though they be few will bear much fruit
And so the virtuous man becomes A vessel of honour and renown
There are no cankers here and now To plague the virtuous man at all
The virtuous man digs out the root Of suffering in lives to come
Perfection among human kind And even among deities
If wished for is not hard to gain For him whose virtue is perfected
Than the perfection of Nibbāna The state where utter peace prevails
But once his virtue is perfected His mind then seeks no other kind
So let a wise man know it well This root of all perfections branches
Such is the blessed fruit of virtue Showing full many a varied form
 The mind of one who understands thus shudders at failure in virtue and reaches out towards the perfecting of virtue
So virtue should be cleansed with all care seeing this danger of failure in virtue and this benefit of the perfection of virtue in the way stated
And at this point in the Path of Purification which is shown under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding by the stanza When a wise man established well in virtue  virtue firstly has been fully illustrated
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
The first chapter called The Description of Virtue
Now while a meditator is engaged in the pursuit of virtue he should set about undertaking the ascetic practices in order to perfect those special qualities of fewness of wishes contentment etc by which the virtue of the kind already described is cleansed
For when his virtue is thus washed clean of stains by the waters of such special qualities as fewness of wishes contentment effacement seclusion dispersal energy and modest needs it will become quite purified and his vows will succeed as well
And so when his whole behaviour has been purified by the special quality of blameless virtue and vows and he has become established in the first three of the ancient Noble Ones heritages he may become worthy to attain to the fourth called delight in development 
We shall therefore begin the explanation of the ascetic practices
Thirteen kinds of ascetic practices have been allowed by the Blessed One to clansmen who have given up the things of the flesh and regardless of body and life are desirous of undertaking a practice in conformity with their aim
Herein
 As to meaning characteristic et cetera The undertaking and directions
And then the grade and breach as well And benefits of each besides
 As to the profitable triad Ascetic and so on distinguished
 And as to groups and also singly The exposition should be known
 Herein as to meaning in the first place It is refuse since owing to its being found on refuse in any such place as a street a charnel ground or a midden it belongs as it were to the refuse in the sense of being dumped in anyone of these places Or alternatively like refuse it gets to a vile state  thus it is refuse  it goes to a vile state is what is meant
The wearing of a refuserag which has acquired its derivative name in this way is refuserag wearing  That is his habit thus he is a refuseragwearer 
The practice of the refuseragwearer is the refuserag wearers practice 
It is the action that is called the practice
Therefore it should be understood as a term for that by undertaking which one becomes a refuseragwearer
ii In the same way he has the habit of wearing the triple robe in other words the cloak of patches the upper garment and the inner clothing thus he is a triplerobewearer 
His practice is called the triple robewearers practice
iii The dropping of the lumps of material sustenance called alms is alms food  the falling into the bowl of lumps given by others is what is meant
He gleans that alms food  he seeks it by approaching such and such a family thus he is called an almsfood eater 
Or his vow is to gather the lump  thus he is a lumpgatherer  To gather is to wander for A lumpgatherer is the same as an almsfoodeater 
The practice of the almsfoodeater is the almsfoodeaters practice
iv It is a hiatus that is called a gap  It is removed from a gap thus it is called gapless  the meaning is it is without hiatus
It is together with what is gapless  thus it is with the gapless  devoid of hiatusfrom house to houseis what is meant
His habit is to wander on whatiswiththegapless thus he is a gapless wanderer  A gapless wanderer is the same as a housetohouseseeker 
His practice is the housetohouseseekers practice
v Eating in one session is onesession He has that habit thus he is a one sessioner
His practice is the onesessioners practice
vi Alms in one bowl only because of refusing a second vessel is bowlalms 
Now making bowl alms the name for the taking of alms food in the bowl bowlalmsfood is his habit thus he is a bowl foodeater 
His practice is the bowlfoodeaters practice
vii No is a particle in the sense of refusing
Food obtained later by one who has shown that he is satisfied is called laterfood  The eating of that later food is laterfoodeating Making laterfood the name for that laterfoodeating laterfood is his habit thus he is a later foodeater 
Not a laterfoodeater is a nolaterfoodeater  that is a laterfoodrefuser
This is the name for one who as an undertaking refuses extra food
But it is said in the commentary Khalu is a certain kind of bird
When it has taken a fruit into its beak and that drops it does not eat any more
This bhikkhu is like that Thus he is a laterfoodrefuser 
His practice is the laterfoodrefusers practice
viii His habit is dwelling in the forest thus he is a forestdweller
His practice is the forestdwellers practice
ix Dwelling at the root of a tree is treerootdwelling He has that habit thus he is a treerootdweller
The practice of the treerootdweller is the treeroot dwellers practice
x xi Likewise with the openairdweller and the charnelgrounddweller
 xii Only what has been distributed is as distributed  This is a term for the resting place first allotted thus This one falls to you
He has the habit of dwelling in that as distributed thus he is an as distributeduser  that is an anybeduser
His practice is the anybedusers practice
xiii He has the habit of keeping to the sitting posture when resting refusing to lie down thus he is a sitter
His practice is the sitters practice
All these however are the practices of a bhikkhu who is ascetic because he has shaken off defilement by undertaking one or other of them Or the knowledge that has got the name ascetic because it shakes off defilement is a practice belonging to these thus they are ascetic practices 
Or alternatively they are ascetic because they shake off opposition and they are practices because they are a way 
This firstly is how the exposition should be known here as to meaning
All of them have as their characteristic the volition of undertaking
For this is said in the commentary He who does the undertaking is a person
That whereby he does the undertaking is states of consciousness and consciousness concomitants
The volition of the act of undertaking is the ascetic practice
What it rejects is the instance
All have the function of eliminating cupidity and they manifest themselves with the production of noncupidity For their proximate cause they have the noble states consisting of fewness of wishes and so on
This is how the exposition should be known as to characteristic etc here
 As regards the five beginning with the undertaking and directions during the Blessed Ones lifetime all ascetic practices should be undertaken in the Blessed Ones presence
After his attainment of Nibbāna this should be done in the presence of a principal disciple
When he is not available it should be done in the presence of one whose cankers are destroyed of a nonreturner of a oncereturner of a streamenterer of one who knows the three Piṭakas of one who knows two of the Piṭakas of one who knows one of the Piṭakas of one who knows one Collection of a teacher of the Commentaries
When he is not available it should be done in the presence of an observer of an ascetic practice When he is not available then after one has swept out the shrine terrace they can be undertaken seated in a reverential posture as though pronouncing them in the Fully Enlightened Ones presence Also it is permitted to undertake them by oneself
And here should be told the story of the senior of the two brothers who were elders at Cetiyapabbata and their fewness of wishes with respect to the ascetic practices 
This firstly is what applies to all the practices
Now we shall proceed to comment on the undertaking directions grade breach and benefits of each one separately
i First the refuseragwearers practice is undertaken with one of these two statements I refuse robes given by householders or I undertake the refuserag wearers practice
This firstly is the undertaking
One who has done this should get a robe of one of the following kinds one from a charnel ground one from a shop a cloth from a street a cloth from a midden one from a childbed an ablution cloth a cloth from a washing place one worn going to and returning from the charnel ground one scorched by fire one gnawed by cattle one gnawed by ants one gnawed by rats one cut at the end one cut at the edge one carried as a flag a robe from a shrine an ascetics robe one from a consecration one produced by supernormal power one from a highway one borne by the wind one presented by deities one from the sea Taking one of these robe cloths he should tear off and throw away the weak parts and then wash the sound parts and make up a robe He can use it after getting rid of his old robe given by householders
Herein one from a charnel ground is one dropped on a charnel ground
One from a shop is one dropped at the door of a shop
A cloth from a street is a cloth thrown into a street from inside a window by those who seek merit
A cloth from a midden is a cloth thrown onto a place for rubbish
One from a childbed is a cloth thrown away after wiping up the stains of childbirth with it
The mother of Tissa the Minister it seems had the stains of childbirth wiped up with a cloth worth a hundred pieces and thinking The refuserag wearers will take it she had it thrown onto the Tālaveli Road
Bhikkhus took it for the purpose of mending worn places
 An ablution cloth is one that people who are made by devil doctors to bathe themselves including their heads are accustomed to throw away as a cloth of ill luck
A cloth from washing place is rags thrown away at a washing place where bathing is done
One worn going to and coming from is one that people throw away after they have gone to a charnel ground and returned and bathed
One scorched by fire is one partly scorched by fire
for people throw that away
One gnawed by cattle etc are obvious
for people throw away such as these too
One carried as a flag Those who board a ship do so after hoisting a flag
It is allowable to take this when they have gone out of sight
Also it is allowable when the two armies have gone away to take a flag that has been hoisted on a battlefield
 A robe from a shrine is an offering made by draping a termitemound in cloth
An ascetics robe is one belonging to a bhikkhu
One from a consecration is one thrown away at the kings consecration place
One produced by supernormal power is a comebhikkhu robe
One from a highway is one dropped in the middle of a road
But one dropped by the owners negligence should be taken only after waiting a while
One borne by the wind is one that falls a long way off having been carried by the wind It is allowable to take it if the owners are not in sight
One presented by deities is one given by deities like that given to the Elder Anuruddha 
One from the sea is one washed up on dry land by the sea waves
One given thus We give it to the Order or got by those who go out for alms cloth is not a refuserag
And in the case of one presented by a bhikkhu one given after it has been got at a presentation of robes by householders at the end of the Rains or a restingplace robe that is one automatically supplied by a householder to the occupant of a certain resting place is not a refuserag
It is a refuserag only when given after not having been so obtained
And herein that placed by the donors at a bhikkhus feet but given by that bhikkhu to the refuserag wearer by placing it in his hand is called pure in one way
That given to a bhikkhu by placing it in his hand but placed by him at the refuserag wearers feet is also pure in one way
That which is both placed at a bhikkhus feet and then given by him in the same way is pure in both ways
One obtained by being placed in the hand and given by being placed in the hand too is not a strict mans robe
So a refuserag wearer should use the robe after getting to know about the kinds of refuserags These are the directions for it in this instance
The grades are these There are three kinds of refuserag wearers the strict the medium and the mild
Herein one who takes it only from a charnel ground is strict
One who takes one left by someone thinking One gone forth will take it is medium
One who takes one given by being placed at his feet by a bhikkhu is mild
The moment anyone of these of his own choice or inclination agrees to accept a robe given by a householder his ascetic practice is broken
This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these He actually practices in conformity with the dependence because of the words The going forth by depending on the refuserag robe  he is established in the first of the Noble Ones heritages  there is no suffering due to protecting he exists independent of others there is no fear of robbers there is no craving connected with use of robes it is a requisite suitable for an ascetic it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus valueless easy to get and blameless  it inspires confidence it produces the fruits of fewness of wishes etc the right way is cultivated a good example is set to later generations
 While striving for Deaths armys rout The ascetic clad in ragrobe clout
Got from a rubbish heap shines bright As mailclad warrior in the fight
Leaving rare Kāsi cloth and more This robe wore
the worlds great teacher Of rags from off a rubbish heap Who would not have a robe to keep
Minding the words he did profess When he went into homelessness
Let him to wear such rags delight As one in seemly garb bedight
This firstly is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the refuseragwearers practice
ii Next there is the triplerobewearers practice This is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a fourth robe or I undertake the triple robewearers practice
When a triplerobe wearer has got cloth for a robe he can put it by for as long as owing to illhealth he is unable to make it up or for as long as he does not find a helper or lacks a needle etc
and there is no fault in his putting it by
But it is not allowed to put it by once it has been dyed That is called cheating the ascetic practice
These are the directions for it
This too has three grades
Herein one who is strict should at the time of dyeing first dye either the inner cloth or the upper garment and having dyed it he should wear that round the waist and dye the other
Then he can put that on over the shoulder and dye the cloak of patches
But he is not allowed to wear the cloak of patches round the waist
This is the duty when in an abode inside a village
But it is allowable for him in the forest to wash and dye two together
However he should sit in a place near to the robes so that if he sees anyone he can pull a yellow cloth over himself
But for the medium one there is a yellow cloth in the dyeing room for use while dyeing and it is allowable for him to wear that as an inner cloth or to put it on as an upper garment in order to do the work of dyeing
For the mild one it is allowable to wear or put on the robes of bhikkhus who are in communion in order to do the work of dyeing
A bedspread that remains where it is is also allowable for him
but he must not take it about him
And it is allowed for him to use from time to time the robes of bhikkhus who are in communion
It is allowed to one who wears the triple robe as an ascetic practice to have a yellow shouldercloth too as a fourth
but it must be only a span wide and three hands long
The moment anyone of these three agrees to accept a fourth robe his ascetic practice is broken
This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these The bhikkhu who is a triplerobe wearer is content with the robe as a protection for the body
Hence he goes taking it with him as a bird does its wings  and such special qualities as having few undertakings avoidance of storage of cloth a frugal existence the abandoning of greed for many robes living in effacement by observing moderation even in what is permitted production of the fruits of fewness of wishes etc are perfected
 No risk of hoarding haunts the man of wit Who wants no extra cloth for requisite
Using the triple robe whereer he goes The pleasant relish of content he knows
So would the adept wander undeterred With naught else but his robes as flies the bird
With its own wings then let him too rejoice That frugalness in garments be his choice
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the triplerobewearers practice
 iii The almsfoodeaters practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a supplementary food supply or I undertake the alms foodeaters practice
Now this almsfood eater should not accept the following fourteen kinds of meal a meal offered to the Order a meal offered to specified bhikkhus an invitation a meal given by a ticket one each halfmoon day one each Uposatha day one each first of the halfmoon a meal given for visitors a meal for travellers a meal for the sick a meal for sicknurses a meal supplied to a particular residence a meal given in a principal house a meal given in turn
If instead of saying Take a meal given to the Order meals are given saying The Order is taking alms in our house you may take alms too it is allowable to consent
Tickets from the Order that are not for actual food and also a meal cooked in a monastery are allowable as well These are the directions for it
This too has three grades
Herein one who is strict takes alms brought both from before and from behind and he gives the bowl to those who take it while he stands outside a door He also takes alms brought to the refectory and given there But he does not take alms by sitting and waiting for it to be brought later that day
The medium one takes it as well by sitting and waiting for it to be brought later that day but he does not consent to its being brought the next day
The mild one consents to alms being brought on the next day and on the day after
Both these last miss the joy of an independent life
There is perhaps a preaching on the Noble Ones heritages in some village The strict one says to the others Let us go friends and listen to the Dhamma
One of them says I have been made to sit and wait by a man venerable sir
and the other I have consented to receive alms tomorrow venerable sir
So they are both losers
The other wanders for alms in the morning and then he goes and savours the taste of the Dhamma
The moment anyone of these three agrees to the extra gain consisting of a meal given to the Order etc his ascetic practice is broken
This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these He actually practices in conformity with the dependence because of the words The going forth by depending on the eating of lumps of alms food  he is established in the second of the Noble Ones heritages his existence is independent of others it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus Valueless easy to get blameless  idleness is eliminated livelihood is purified the practice of the minor training rule of the Pātimokkha is fulfilled he is not maintained by another he helps others pride is abandoned craving for tastes is checked the training precepts about eating as a group substituting one meal invitation for another  and good behaviour are not contravened his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes he cultivates the right way he has compassion for later generations
 The monk content with alms for food Has independent livelihood
And greed in him no footing finds He is as free as the four winds
He never need be indolent His livelihood is innocent
So let a wise man not disdain Almsgathering for his domain
Since it is said
If a bhikkhu can support himself on alms
And live without anothers maintenance
The very gods indeed might envy him
And pay no heed as well to gain and fame 
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the almsfoodeaters practice
iv The housetohouse seekers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a greedy alms round or I undertake the housetohouse seekers practice
Now the housetohouse seeker should stop at the village gate and make sure that there is no danger
If there is danger in any street or village it is allowable to leave it out and wander for alms elsewhere
When there is a house door or a street or a village where he regularly gets nothing at all he can go past it not counting it as a village
But wherever he gets anything at all it is not allowed subsequently to go past there and leave it out
This bhikkhu should enter the village early so that he will be able to leave out any inconvenient place and go elsewhere
But if people who are giving a gift of a meal in a monastery or who are coming along the road take his bowl and give alms food it is allowable
And as this bhikkhu is going along the road he should when it is the time wander for alms in any village he comes to and not pass it by
If he gets nothing there or only a little he should wander for alms in the next village in order
These are the directions for it This too has three grades
Herein one who is strict does not take alms brought from before or brought from behind or brought to the refectory and given there He hands over his bowl at a door however
for in this ascetic practice there is none equal to the Elder Mahā Kassapa
yet an instance in which even he handed over his bowl is mentioned 
The medium one takes what is brought from before and from behind and what is brought to the refectory and he hands over his bowl at a door But he does not sit waiting for alms
Thus he conforms to the rule of the strict almsfood eater
The mild one sits waiting for alms to be brought that day
The ascetic practice of these three is broken as soon as the greedy alms round starts by going only to the houses where good alms food is given
This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these He is always a stranger among families and is like the moon  he abandons avarice about families he is compassionate impartially he avoids the dangers in being supported by a family he does not delight in invitations he does not hope for meals to be brought his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes and so on
 Is moonlike ever new to families
Nor does he grudge to help all equally
Free from the risks of housedependency
The monk who at each house his begging plies
Who would the selfindulgent round forsake
His downcast eyes range a yokelength before
And roam the world at will the while to make
Then let him wisely seek from door to door
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the housetohouseseekers practice
v The onesessioners practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse eating in several sessions or I undertake the onesessioners practice
When the onesessioner sits down in the sitting hall instead of sitting on an elders seat he should notice which seat is likely to fall to him and sit down on that
If his teacher or preceptor arrives while the meal is still unfinished it is allowable for him to get up and do the duties
But the Elder Tipiṭaka CūlaAbhaya said He should either keep his seat and finish his meal or if he gets up he should leave the rest of his meal in order not to break the ascetic practice And this is one whose meal is still unfinished therefore let him do the duties but in that case let him not eat the rest of the meal
These are the directions
This too has three grades
Herein one who is strict may not take anything more than the food that he has laid his hand on whether it is little or much
And if people bring him ghee etc thinking The elder has eaten nothing while these are allowable for the purpose of medicine they are not so for the purpose of food
The medium one may take more as long as the meal in the bowl is not exhausted
for he is called one who stops when the food is finished
The mild one may eat as long as he does not get up from his seat
He is either one who stops with the water because he eats until he takes water for washing the bowl or one who stops with the session because he eats until he gets up
The ascetic practice of these three is broken at the moment when food has been eaten at more than one session
This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these He has little affliction and little sickness he has lightness strength and a happy life there is no contravening rules about food that is not what is left over from a meal craving for tastes is eliminated his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes and so on
 Who gladly in one session takes his meal
No illness due to eating shall he feel
No longing to indulge his sense of taste
Tempts him to leave his work to go to waste
His own true happiness a monk may find
In eating in one session pure in mind
Purity and effacement wait on this
For it gives reason to abide in bliss
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the onesessioners practice
vi The bowlfoodeaters practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a second vessel or I undertake the bowlfoodeaters practice
When at the time of drinking rice gruel the bowlfood eater gets curry that is put in a dish he can first either eat the curry or drink the rice gruel
If he puts it in the rice gruel the rice gruel becomes repulsive when a curry made with cured fish etc is put into it So it is allowable to do this only in order to use it without making it repulsive
Consequently this is said with reference to such curry as that
But what is unrepulsive such as honey sugar etc should be put into it
And in taking it he should take the right amount
It is allowable to take green vegetables with the hand and eat them
But unless he does that they should be put into the bowl
Because a second vessel has been refused it is not allowable to use anything else not even the leaf of a tree These are its directions
This too has three grades
Herein for one who is strict except at the time of eating sugarcane it is not allowed while eating to throw rubbish away
and it is not allowed while eating to break up ricelumps fish meat and cakes The rubbish should be thrown away and the ricelumps etc broken up before starting to eat
The medium one is allowed to break them up with one hand while eating and he is called a hand ascetic
The mild one is called a bowl ascetic anything that can be put into his bowl he is allowed while eating to break up that is rice lumps etc with his hand or such things as palm sugar ginger etc with his teeth
The moment anyone of these three agrees to a second vessel his ascetic practice is broken
This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these Craving for variety of tastes is eliminated
excessiveness of wishes is abandoned he sees the purpose and the right amount in nutriment he is not bothered with carrying saucers etc about his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes and so on
 He baffles doubts that might arise With extra dishes downcast eyes
The true devotedness imply Of one uprooting gluttony
Wearing content as if twere part Of his own nature glad at heart
None but a bowlfood eater may Consume his food in such a way
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the bowlfoodeaters practice
vii The laterfoodrefusers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse additional food or I undertake the laterfoodrefusers practice
Now when that laterfood refuser has shown that he is satisfied he should not again have the food made allowable by having it put into his hands according to the rule for bhikkhus and eat it
These are the directions for it
This too has three grades
Herein there is no showing that he has had enough with respect to the first lump but there is when he refuses more while that is being swallowed So when one who is strict has thus shown that he has had enough with respect to the second lump he does not eat the second lump after swallowing the first
The medium one eats also that food with respect to which he has shown that he has had enough
But the mild one goes on eating until he gets up from his seat
The moment any one of these three has eaten what has been made allowable again after he has shown that he has had enough his ascetic practice is broken
This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these One is far from committing an offence concerned with extra food there is no overloading of the stomach there is no keeping food back there is no renewed search for food he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so on
 He needs no extra search in weary mood Nor stores up food till later in the day
Nor overloads his stomach in this way When a wise man refuses later food
Praised by the Blessed One which will augment The special qualities such as content
So would the adept from such faults abstain Let him assume this practice for his gain
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the laterfoodrefusers practice
 viii The forestdwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse an abode in a village or I undertake the forestdwellers practice
Now that forest dweller must leave an abode in a village in order to meet the dawn in the forest
Herein a village abode is the village itself with its precincts
A village may consist of one cottage or several cottages it may be enclosed by a wall or not have human inhabitants or not and it can also be a caravan that is inhabited for more than four months
The village precincts cover the range of a stone thrown by a man of medium stature standing between the gateposts of a walled village if there are two gateposts as at Anurādhapura 
The Vinaya experts say that this stones throw is characterized as up to the place where a thrown stone falls as for instance when young men exercise their arms and throw stones in order to show off their strength
But the Suttanta experts say that it is up to where one thrown to scare crows normally falls
In the case of an unwalled village the house precinct is where the water falls when a woman standing in the door of the outermost house of all throws water from a basin
Within a stones throw of the kind already described from that point is the village Within a second stones throw is the village precinct
Forest according to the Vinaya method firstly is described thus Except the village and its precincts all is forest 
According to the Abhidhamma method it is described thus Having gone out beyond the boundary post all that is forest 
But according to the Suttanta method its characteristic is this A forest abode is five hundred bowlengths distant 
That should be defined by measuring it with a strung instructors bow from the gatepost of a walled village or from the range of the first stones throw from an unwalled one up to the monastery wall
But if the monastery is not walled it is said in the Vinaya commentaries it should be measured by making the first dwelling of all the limit or else the refectory or regular meeting place or Bodhi Tree or shrine even if that is far from a dwelling belonging to the monastery
But in the Majjhima commentary it is said that omitting the precincts of the monastery and the village the distance to be measured is that between where the two stones fall
This is the measure here
Even if the village is close by and the sounds of men are audible to people in the monastery still if it is not possible to go straight to it because of rocks rivers etc
in between the five hundred bowlengths can be reckoned by that road even if one has to go by boat
But anyone who blocks the path to the village here and there for the purpose of lengthening it so as to be able to say that he is taking up the practice is cheating the ascetic practice
If a forestdwelling bhikkhus preceptor or teacher is ill and does not get what he needs in the forest he should take him to a village abode and attend him there
But he should leave in time to meet the dawn in a place proper for the practice
If the affliction increases towards the time of dawn he must attend him
and not bother about the purity of his ascetic practice These are the directions
This too has three grades
Herein one who is strict must always meet the dawn in the forest
The medium one is allowed to live in a village for the four months of the Rains
And the mild one for the winter months too
If in the period defined any one of these three goes from the forest and hears the Dhamma in a village abode his ascetic practice is not broken if he meets the dawn there
nor is it broken if he meets it as he is on his way back after hearing the Dhamma
But if when the preacher has got up he thinks We shall go after lying down awhile and he meets the dawn while asleep or if of his own choice he meets the dawn while in a village abode then his ascetic practice is broken This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these A forestdwelling bhikkhu who has given attention to the perception of forest can obtain hitherto unobtained concentration or preserve that already obtained And the Master is pleased with him
according as it is said So Nāgita I am pleased with that bhikkhus dwelling in the forest 
And when he lives in a remote abode his mind is not distracted by unsuitable visible objects and so on He is free from anxiety he abandons attachment to life he enjoys the taste of the bliss of seclusion and the state of the refuserag wearer etc becomes him
 He lives secluded and apart Remote abodes delight his heart
The Saviour of the world besides He gladdens that in groves abides
The hermit that in woods can dwell Alone may gain the bliss as well
Whose savour is beyond the price Of royal bliss in paradise
Wearing the robe of rags he may Go forth into the forest fray
Such is his mail for weapons too The other practices will do
One so equipped can be assured Of routing Māra and his horde
So let the forest glades delight A wise man for his dwellings site
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the forestdwellers practice
 ix The treerootdwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a roof or I undertake the treerootdwellers practice
The treeroot dweller should avoid such trees as a tree near a frontier a shrine tree a gum tree a fruit tree a bats tree a hollow tree or a tree standing in the middle of a monastery He can choose a tree standing on the outskirts of a monastery These are the directions
This has three grades too
Herein one who is strict is not allowed to have a tree that he has chosen tidied up
He can move the fallen leaves with his foot while dwelling there
The medium one is allowed to get it tidied up by those who happen to come along
The mild one can take up residence there after summoning monastery attendants and novices and getting them to clear it up level it strew sand and make a fence round with a gate fixed in it
On a special day a treeroot dweller should sit in some concealed place elsewhere rather than there
The moment any one of these three makes his abode under a roof his ascetic practice is broken
The reciters of the Aṅguttara say that it is broken as soon as he knowingly meets the dawn under a roof
This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these He practices in conformity with the dependence because of the words The going forth by depending on the root of a tree as an abode  it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus Valueless easy to get and blameless  perception of impermanence is aroused through seeing the continual alteration of young leaves avarice about abodes and love of building work are absent he dwells in the company of deities he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so on
 The Blessed One praised roots of trees As one of the dependencies 
Can he that loves secludedness Find such another dwelling place
Secluded at the roots of trees And guarded well by deities
He lives in true devotedness Nor covets any dwelling place
And when the tender leaves are seen Bright red at first then turning green
And then to yellow as they fall He sheds belief once and for all In permanence
No wise man will disdain at all For contemplating rise and fall
Tree roots have been Bequeathed by him secluded scene
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the treerootdwellers practice
 x The openairdwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a roof and a tree root or I undertake the openairdwellers practice
An openair dweller is allowed to enter the Uposathahouse for the purpose of hearing the Dhamma or for the purpose of the Uposatha
If it rains while he is inside he can go out when the rain is over instead of going out while it is still raining
He is allowed to enter the eating hall or the fire room in order to do the duties or to go under a roof in order to ask elder bhikkhus in the eating hall about a meal or when teaching and taking lessons or to take beds chairs etc inside that have been wrongly left outside
If he is going along a road with a requisite belonging to a senior and it rains he is allowed to go into a wayside rest house
If he has nothing with him he is not allowed to hurry in order to get to a rest house
but he can go at his normal pace and enter it and stay there as long as it rains These are the directions for it
And the same rule applies to the treeroot dweller too
This has three grades too
Herein one who is strict is not allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a house
He should make a robetent right out in the open and live in that
The medium one is allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a house so long as he is not covered by them
The mild one is allowed these a rock overhang without a dripledge cut in it a hut of branches cloth stiffened with paste and a tent treated as a fixture that has been left by field watchers and so on
The moment any one of these three goes under a roof or to a tree root to dwell there his ascetic practice is broken
The reciters of the Aṅguttara say that it is broken as soon as he knowingly meets the dawn there
This is the breach in this case
The benefits are these the impediment of dwellings is severed stiffness and torpor are expelled his conduct deserves the praise Like deer the bhikkhus live unattached and homeless  he is detached he is free to go in any direction he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so on
 That aids the homeless bhikkhus strife Easy to get
The moon and sun furnish his light Under the starbejewelled vault
The open air provides a life and leaves his mind Alert as a deer so he shall find
Stiffness and torpor brought to halt And concentration his delight
The joy seclusions savour gives He shall discover soon who lives
In open air and that is why The wise prefer the open sky
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the openairdwellers practice
xi The charnelgrounddwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse what is not a charnel ground or I undertake the charnel grounddwellers practice
Now the charnelground dweller should not live in some place just because the people who built the village have called it the charnel ground
for it is not a charnel ground unless a dead body has been burnt on it But as soon as one has been burnt on it it becomes a charnel ground And even if it has been neglected for a dozen years it is so still
 One who dwells there should not be the sort of person who gets walks pavilions etc built has beds and chairs set out and drinking and washing water kept ready and preaches Dhamma
for this ascetic practice is a momentous thing Whoever goes to live there should be diligent And he should first inform the senior elder of the Order or the kings local representative in order to prevent trouble
When he walks up and down he should do so looking at the pyre with half an eye
On his way to the charnel ground he should avoid the main roads and take a bypath
He should define all the objects there while it is day
so that they will not assume frightening shapes for him at night Even if nonhuman beings wander about screeching he must not hit them with anything
It is not allowed to miss going to the charnel ground even for a single day
The reciters of the Aṅguttara say that after spending the middle watch in the charnel ground he is allowed to leave in the last watch
He should not take such foods as sesame flour pease pudding fish meat milk oil sugar etc which are liked by nonhuman beings
He should not enter the homes of families These are the directions for it
This has three grades too
Herein one who is strict should live where there are always burnings and corpses and mourning
The medium one is allowed to live where there is one of these three
The mild one is allowed to live in a place that possesses the bare characteristics of a charnel ground already stated
When any one of these three makes his abode in some place not a charnel ground his ascetic practice is broken
It is on the day on which he does not go to the charnel ground the Aṅguttara reciters say
This is the breach in this case
The benefits are these He acquires mindfulness of death he lives diligently the sign of foulness is available  greed for sense desires is removed he constantly sees the bodys true nature he has a great sense of urgency he abandons vanity of health etc he vanquishes fear and dread  nonhuman beings respect and honour him he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so on
 the dweller in a charnel ground for death is ever present to his thought
Even in sleep shows naught Of negligence
with many corpses present to his gaze
He may be sure there is no lust after sense pleasure preys Upon his mind
Rightly he strives because he gains a sense of urgency
While in his search for final peace he curbs all vanity
Embrace this practice for it has rare virtues to impart
Let him that feels a leaning to Nibbāna in his heart
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the charnelground dwellers practice
 xii The anybedusers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse greed for resting places or I undertake the anybedusers practice
The anybed user should be content with whatever resting place he gets thus This falls to your lot He must not make anyone else shift from his bed
These are the directions
This has three grades too
Herein one who is strict is not allowed to ask about the resting place that has fallen to his lot Is it far  or Is it too near  or Is it infested by nonhuman beings snakes and so on  or Is it hot  or Is it cold 
The medium one is allowed to ask
but not to go and inspect it
The mild one is allowed to inspect it and if he does not like it to choose another
As soon as greed for resting places arises in any one of these three his ascetic practice is broken This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these The advice He should be content with what he gets is carried out he regards the welfare of his fellows in the life of purity he gives up caring about inferiority and superiority approval and disapproval are abandoned the door is closed against excessive wishes he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so on
 One vowed to any bed will be Content with what he gets and he
Can sleep in bliss without dismay On nothing but a spread of hay
He is not eager for the best No lowly couch does he detest
He aids his young companions too That to the monks good life are new
So for a wise man to delight In any kind of bed is right
A Noble One this custom loves As one the sages Lord approves
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the anybedusers practice
xiii The sitters practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse lying down or I undertake the sitters practice
The sitter can get up in any one of three watches of the night and walk up and down
for lying down is the only posture not allowed
These are the directions
This has three grades too
Herein one who is strict is not allowed a backrest or cloth band or bindingstrap to prevent falling while asleep
The medium one is allowed any one of these three
The mild one is allowed a backrest a cloth band a bindingstrap a cushion a fivelimb and a sevenlimb
A fivelimb is a chair made with four legs and a support for the back
A sevenlimb is one made with four legs a support for the back and an arm support on each side
They made that it seems for the Elder Pīṭhābhaya 
The elder became a nonreturner and then attained Nibbāna
As soon as any one of these three lies down his ascetic practice is broken
This is the breach in this instance
The benefits are these The mental shackle described thus He dwells indulging in the pleasure of lying prone the pleasure of lolling the pleasure of torpor  is severed his state is suitable for devotion to any meditation subject his deportment inspires confidence his state favours the application of energy he develops the right practice
 The adept that can place crosswise His feet to rest upon his thighs
And sit with back erect shall make Foul Māras evil heart to quake
No more in supine joys to plump And wallow in lethargic dump
Who sits for rest and finds it good Shines forth in the Ascetics Wood
The happiness and bliss it brings Has naught to do with worldly things
So must the sitters vow befit The manners of a man of wit
This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the sitters practice

 As to the profitable triad Ascetic and so on distinguished
 As to groups and also singly The exposition should be known 
Now there is the commentary according to the stanza 
 Herein as to the profitable triad all the ascetic practices that is to say those of trainers ordinary men and men whose cankers have been destroyed may be either profitable or in the Arahants case indeterminate No ascetic practice is unprofitable
But if someone should say There is also an unprofitable ascetic practice because of the words One of evil wishes a prey to wishes becomes a forest dweller  etc
he should be told We have not said that he does not live in the forest with unprofitable consciousness
Whoever has his dwelling in the forest is a forest dweller
and he may be one of evil wishes or of few wishes
But as it was said above  they are the practices of a bhikkhu who is ascetic because he has shaken off defilement by undertaking one or other of them Or the knowledge that has got the name ascetic because it shakes off defilement is a practice belonging to these thus they are ascetic practices 
Or alternatively they are ascetic because they shake off opposition and they are practices because they are a way 
Now no one called ascetic on account of what is unprofitable could have these as his practices nor does what is unprofitable shake off anything so that those things to which it belonged as a practice could be called ascetic practices
And what is unprofitable does not both shake off cupidity for robes etc and become the practice of the way
Consequently it was rightly said that no ascetic practice is unprofitable
And those who hold that an ascetic practice is outside the profitable triad have no ascetic practice as regards meaning
Owing to the shaking off of what is nonexistent could it be called an ascetic practice
Also there are the words Proceeded to undertake the ascetic qualities  and it follows that those words are contradicted So that should not be accepted This in the first place is the commentary on the profitable triad
 As to ascetic and so on distinguished the following things should be understood that is to say ascetic
a preacher of asceticism
ascetic states
ascetic practices
and for whom the cultivation of ascetic practices is suitable
 Herein ascetic means either a person whose defilements are shaken off or a state that entails shaking off defilements
A preacher of asceticism one is ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism another is not ascetic but a preacher of asceticism another is neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticism and another is both ascetic and a preacher of asceticism
Herein one who has shaken off his defilements with an ascetic practice but does not advise and instruct another in an ascetic practice like the Elder Bakkula is ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism
according as it is said Now the venerable Bakkula was ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism
One who has not shaken off his own defilements but only advises and instructs another in an ascetic practice like the Elder Upananda is not ascetic but a preacher of asceticism
according as it is said Now the venerable Upananda son of the Sakyans was not ascetic but a preacher of asceticism
One who has failed in both like Lāḷudāyin is neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticism
according as it is said Now the venerable Lāḷudāyin was neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticism
One who has succeeded in both like the General of the Dhamma is both ascetic and a preacher of asceticism
according as it is said Now the venerable Sāriputta was ascetic and a preacher of asceticism
Ascetic states the five states that go with the volition of an ascetic practice that is to say fewness of wishes contentment effacement seclusion and that specific quality are called ascetic states because of the words Depending on fewness of wishes  and so on Herein fewness of wishes and contentment are nongreed
Effacement and seclusion belong to the two states nongreed and nondelusion
That specific quality is knowledge
Herein by means of nongreed a man shakes off greed for things that are forbidden By means of nondelusion he shakes off the delusion that hides the dangers in those same things
And by means of nongreed he shakes off indulgence in pleasure due to sense desires that occurs under the heading of using what is allowed And by means of nondelusion he shakes off indulgence in self mortification that occurs under the heading of excessive effacement in the ascetic practices
That is why these states should be understood as ascetic states
Ascetic practices these should be understood as the thirteen that is to say the refuseragwearers practice  the sitters practice
which have already been described as to meaning and as to characteristic and so forth
For whom the cultivation of ascetic practices is suitable they are suitable for one of greedy temperament and for one of deluded temperament
Why
Because the cultivation of ascetic practices is both a difficult progress and an abiding in effacement
and greed subsides with the difficult progress
while delusion is got rid of in those diligent by effacement
Or the cultivation of the forestdwellers practice and the treerootdwellers practice here are suitable for one of hating temperament
for hate too subsides in one who dwells there without coming into conflict This is the commentary as to ascetic and so on distinguished
 and As to groups and also singly Now as to groups these ascetic practices are in fact only eight that is to say three principal and five individual practices
Herein the three namely the housetohouseseekers practice the onesessioners practice and the openairdwellers practice are principal practices
For one who keeps the housetohouseseekers practice will keep the almsfoodeaters practice
and the bowlfoodeaters practice and the laterfoodrefusers practice will be well kept by one who keeps the onesessioners practice
And what need has one who keeps the openairdwellers practice to keep the treerootdwellers practice or the anybedusers practice
So there are these three principal practices that together with the five individual practices that is to say the forestdwellers practice the refuseragwearers practice the triplerobewearers practice the sitters practice and the charnelgrounddwellers practice come to eight only
Again they come to four that is to say two connected with robes five connected with alms food five connected with the resting place and one connected with energy
Herein it is the sitters practice that is connected with energy
the rest are obvious
Again they all amount to two only since twelve are dependent on requisites and one on energy
Also they are two according to what is and what is not to be cultivated
For when one cultivating an ascetic practice finds that his meditation subject improves he should cultivate it
but when he is cultivating one and finds that his meditation subject deteriorates he should not cultivate it
But when he finds that whether he cultivates one or not his meditation subject only improves and does not deteriorate he should cultivate them out of compassion for later generations
And when he finds that whether he cultivates them or not his meditation subject does not improve he should still cultivate them for the sake of acquiring the habit for the future
So they are of two kinds as what is and what is not to be cultivated And all are of one kind as volition
For there is only one ascetic practice namely that consisting in the volition of undertaking
Also it is said in the Commentary It is the volition that is the ascetic practice they say
 Singly with thirteen for bhikkhus eight for bhikkhunīs twelve for novices seven for female probationers and female novices and two for male and female lay followers there are thus fortytwo
If there is a charnel ground in the open that complies with the forestdwellers practice one bhikkhu is able to put all the ascetic practices into effect simultaneously
But the two namely the forestdwellers practice and the laterfoodrefusers practice are forbidden to bhikkhunīs by training precept And it is hard for them to observe the three namely the openairdwellers practice the treeroot dwellers practice and the charnelgrounddwellers practice
because a bhikkhunī is not allowed to live without a companion
and it is hard to find a female companion with like desire for such a place
and even if available she would not escape having to live in company
This being so the purpose of cultivating the ascetic practice would scarcely be served
It is because they are reduced by five owing to this inability to make use of certain of them that they are to be understood as eight only for bhikkhunīs
Except for the triplerobewearers practice all the other twelve as stated should be understood to be for novices and all the other seven for female probationers and female novices
The two namely the onesessioners practice and the bowlfoodeaters practice are proper for male and female lay followers to employ In this way there are two ascetic practices This is the commentary as to groups and also singly
And this is the end of the treatise on the ascetic practices to be undertaken for the purpose of perfecting those special qualities of fewness of wishes contentment etc by means of which there comes about the cleansing of virtue as described in the Path of Purification which is shown under the three headings of virtue concentration and understanding contained in the stanza When a wise man established well in virtue 
 in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
The second chapter called The Description of the Ascetic Practices
Now concentration is described under the heading of consciousness in the phrase develops consciousness and understanding  It should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that has been purified by means of the special qualities of fewness of wishes etc and perfected by observance of the ascetic practices
But that concentration has been shown only very briefly and so it is not even easy to understand much less to develop There is therefore the following set of questions the purpose of which is to show the method of its development in detail
 What is concentration
 In what sense is it concentration
 What are its characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause
 How many kinds of concentration are there
 What is its defilement
 What is its cleansing
 How should it be developed
 What are the benefits of the development of concentration
Here are the answers
 WHAT IS CONCENTRATION Concentration is of many sorts and has various aspects
An answer that attempted to cover it all would accomplish neither its intention nor its purpose and would besides lead to distraction so we shall confine ourselves to the kind intended here calling concentration profitable unification of mind
 IN WHAT SENSE IS IT CONCENTRATION It is concentration in the sense of concentrating 
What is this concentrating
It is the centring of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants evenly and rightly on a single object placing is what is meant
So it is the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object undistracted and unscattered that should be understood as concentrating
 WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION MANIFESTATION AND PROXIMATE CAUSE Concentration has nondistraction as its characteristic Its function is to eliminate distraction It is manifested as nonwavering
Because of the words Being blissful his mind becomes concentrated  its proximate cause is bliss
 HOW MANY KINDS OF CONCENTRATION ARE THERE First of all it is of one kind with the characteristic of nondistraction
 Then it is of two kinds as access and absorption likewise as mundane and supramundane as with happiness and without happiness and as accompanied by bliss and accompanied by equanimity
It is of three kinds as inferior medium and superior likewise as with applied thought and sustained thought etc as accompanied by happiness etc and as limited exalted and measureless
It is of four kinds as of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge etc likewise as limited with limited object etc according to the factors of the four jhānas as partaking of diminution etc as of the sense sphere etc and as predominance and so on
 It is of five kinds according to the factors of the five jhānas reckoned by the fivefold method
Herein the section dealing with that of one kind is evident in meaning
 In the section dealing with that of two kinds access concentration is the unification of mind obtained by the following that is to say the six recollections mindfulness of death the recollection of peace the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment and the defining of the four elements and it is the unification that precedes absorption concentration
Absorption concentration is the unification that follows immediately upon the preliminarywork because of the words The firstjhāna preliminarywork is a condition as proximity condition for the first jhāna  So it is of two kinds as access and absorption
In the second dyad mundane concentration is profitable unification of mind in the three planes
Supramundane concentration is the unification associated with the noble paths So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane
In the third dyad concentration with happiness is the unification of mind in two jhānas in the fourfold reckoning and in three jhānas in the fivefold reckoning
Concentration without happiness is the unification in the remaining two jhānas
But access concentration may be with happiness or without happiness So it is of two kinds as with happiness and without happiness
In the fourth dyad concentration accompanied by bliss is the unification in three jhānas in the fourfold and four in the fivefold reckoning
That accompanied by equanimity is that in the remaining jhāna
Access concentration may be accompanied by bliss or accompanied by equanimity So it is of two kinds as accompanied by bliss and accompanied by equanimity
 In the first of the triads what has only just been acquired is inferior What is not very well developed is medium What is well developed and has reached mastery is superior So it is of three kinds as inferior medium and superior
In the second triad that with applied thought and sustained thought is the concentration of the first jhāna together with access concentration
That without applied thought with sustained thought only is the concentration of the second jhāna in the fivefold reckoning
For when a man sees danger only in applied thought and not in sustained thought he aspires only to abandon applied thought when he passes beyond the first jhāna and so he obtains concentration without applied thought and with sustained thought only
This is said with reference to him
Concentration without applied thought and sustained thought is the unification in the three jhānas beginning with the second in the fourfold reckoning and with the third in the fivefold reckoning  So it is of three kinds as with applied thought and sustained thought and so on
 In the third triad concentration accompanied by happiness is the unification in the two first jhānas in the fourfold reckoning and in the three first jhānas in the fivefold reckoning
Concentration accompanied by bliss is the unification in those same jhānas and in the third and the fourth respectively in the two reckonings
That accompanied by equanimity is that in the remaining jhāna
Access concentration may be accompanied by bliss and happiness or accompanied by equanimity So it is of three kinds as accompanied by happiness and so on
In the fourth triad limited concentration is unification on the plane of access
Exalted concentration is unification in profitable consciousness etc of the fine material sphere and immaterial sphere
Measureless concentration is unification associated with the noble paths So it is of three kinds as limited exalted and measureless
 In the first of the tetrads there is concentration of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge There is that of difficult progress and swift direct knowledge There is that of easy progress and sluggish directknowledge And there is that of easy progress and swift directknowledge
Herein the development of concentration that occurs from the time of the first conscious reaction up to the arising of the access of a given jhāna is called progress
And the understanding that occurs from the time of access until absorption is called directknowledge
That progress is difficult for some being troublesome owing to the tenacious resistance of the inimical states beginning with the hindrances The meaning is that it is cultivated without ease
It is easy for others because of the absence of those difficulties
Also the directknowledge is sluggish in some and occurs slowly not quickly
In others it is swift and occurs rapidly not slowly
Herein we shall comment below upon the suitable and unsuitable  the preparatory tasks consisting in the severing of impediments  etc and skill in absorption  When a man cultivates what is unsuitable his progress is difficult and his directknowledge sluggish
When he cultivates what is suitable his progress is easy and his directknowledge swift
But if he cultivates the unsuitable in the earlier stage and the suitable in the later stage or if he cultivates the suitable in the earlier stage and the unsuitable in the later stage then it should be understood as mixed in his case
Likewise if he devotes himself to development without carrying out the preparatory tasks of severing impediments etc his progress is difficult
It is easy in the opposite case
And if he is not accomplished in skill in absorption his direct knowledge is sluggish
It is swift if he is so accomplished
 Besides they should be understood as classed according to craving and ignorance and according to whether one has had practice in serenity and insight
For if a man is overwhelmed by craving his progress is difficult
If not it is easy
And if he is overwhelmed by ignorance his directknowledge is sluggish
If not it is swift
And if he has had no practice in serenity his progress is difficult
If he has it is easy
And if he has had no practice in insight his directknowledge is sluggish If he has it is swift
Also they should be understood as classed according to defilements and faculties
For if a mans defilements are sharp and his faculties dull then his progress is difficult and his directknowledge sluggish but if his faculties are keen his directknowledge is swift
And if his defilements are blunt and his faculties dull then his progress is easy and his directknowledge sluggish
but if his faculties are keen his directknowledge is swift
So as regards this progress and this directknowledge when a person reaches concentration with difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge his concentration is called concentration of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge
similarly in the cases of the remaining three So it is of four kinds as of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge and so on
 In the second tetrad there is limited concentration with a limited object there is limited concentration with a measureless object there is measureless concentration with a limited object and there is measureless concentration with a measureless object
Herein concentration that is unfamiliar and incapable of being a condition for a higher jhāna is limited
When it occurs with an unextended object  it is with a limited object
When it is familiar well developed and capable of being a condition for a higher jhāna it is measureless
And when it occurs with an extended object it is with a measureless object
The mixed method can be understood as the mixture of the characteristics already stated
So it is of four kinds as limited with limited object and so on
 In the third tetrad the first jhāna has five factors that is to say applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss and concentration following suppression of the hindrances The second has the three factors remaining after the elimination of applied and sustained thought The third has two factors with the fading away of happiness The fourth where bliss is abandoned has two factors with concentration and the equanimous feeling that accompanies it
Thus there are four kinds of concentration according to the factors of these four jhānas
So it is of four kinds according to the factors of the four jhānas
 In the fourth tetrad there is concentration partaking of diminution there is concentration partaking of stagnation there is concentration partaking of distinction and there is concentration partaking of penetration
Herein it should be understood that the state of partaking of diminution is accessibility to opposition the state of partaking of stagnation is stationariness of the mindfulness that is in conformity with that concentration the state of partaking of distinction is the attaining of higher distinction and the state of partaking of penetration is accessibility to perception and attention accompanied by dispassion
according as it is said When a man has attained the first jhāna and he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire then his understanding partakes of diminution
When his mindfulness that is in conformity with that stagnates then his understanding partakes of stagnation
When he is accessible to perception and attention unaccompanied by applied thought then his understanding partakes of distinction
When he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by dispassion and directed to fading away then his understanding partakes of penetration 
The kinds of concentration associated with that fourfold understanding are also four in number
So it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution and so on
 In the fifth tetrad there are the following four kinds of concentration that is to say sensesphere concentration finematerialsphere concentration immaterial sphere concentration and unincluded that is path concentration
Herein sense sphere concentration is all kinds of access unification
Likewise the other three are respectively profitable unification of mind associated with finematerial immaterial and path jhāna So it is of four kinds as of the sensesphere and so on
 In the sixth tetrad If a bhikkhu obtains concentration obtains unification of mind by making zeal predominant this is called concentration due to zeal If  by making energy predominant  If  by making natural purity of consciousness predominant If  by making inquiry predominant this is called concentration due to inquiry  So it is of four kinds as predominance
 In the pentad there are five jhānas by dividing in two what is called the second jhāna in the fourfold reckoning  taking the second jhāna to be due to the surmounting of only applied thought and the third jhāna to be due to the surmounting of both applied and sustained thought There are five kinds of concentration according to the factors of these five jhānas
So its fivefoldness should be understood according to the five sets of jhāna factors
 What is its defilement What is its cleansing
Here the answer is given in the Vibhaṅga Defilement is the state partaking of diminution
cleansing is the state partaking of distinction 
Herein the state partaking of diminution should be understood in this way When a man has attained the first jhāna and he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire then his understanding partakes of diminution 
And the state partaking of distinction should be understood in this way When he is accessible to perception and attention unaccompanied by applied thought then his understanding partakes of distinction 
 How should it be developed The method of developing the kind of concentration associated with the noble paths mentioned under that of two kinds as mundane and supramundane etc is included in the method of developing understanding
for in developing path understanding that is developed too
So we shall say nothing separately here about how that is to be developed
But mundane concentration should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that is quite purified in the way already stated He should sever any of the ten impediments that he may have He should then approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and
The detail is this Firstly it was said above he should sever any of the ten impediments that he may have
A dwelling family and gain A class and building too as fifth
And travel kin affliction books And supernormal powers ten
Now the ten impediments are 
Herein the dwelling itself is the impediment due to the dwelling
So too with the family and so on
 Herein a single inner room or a single hut or a whole monastery for the Community is called a dwelling
This is not an impediment for everyone
It is an impediment only for anyone whose mind is exercised about the building etc that goes on there or who has many belongings stored there or whose mind is caught up by some business connected with it For any other it is not an impediment
 Here is a relevant story Two clansmen left Anurādhapura it seems and eventually went forth at the Thūpārāma
One of them made himself familiar with the Two Codes and when he had acquired five years seniority he took part in the Pavāraṇā and then left for the place called Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī
The other stayed on where he was
Now when the one who had gone to Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī had lived there a long time and had become an elder he thought This place is good for retreat suppose I told my friend about it
So he set out and in due course he entered the Thūpārāma
As he entered the elder of the same seniority saw him went to meet him took his bowl and robe and did the duties
The visiting elder went into his lodging He thought Now my friend will be sending me ghee or molasses or a drink
for he has lived long in this city
He got nothing that night and in the morning he thought Now he will be sending me rice gruel and solid food sent by his supporters
When he saw none he thought There is no one to bring it No doubt they will give it when we go into the town Early in the morning they went into the town together
When they had wandered through one street and had got only a ladleful of gruel they sat down in a sitting hall to drink it
Then the visitor thought Perhaps there is no individual giving of gruel But as soon as it is the time for the meal people will give special food But when it was time for the meal they ate what they had got by wandering for alms Then the visitor said Venerable sir how is this Do you live in this way all the time
 Yes friend
Venerable sir Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī is comfortable let us go there
Now as the elder came out from the city by the southern gate he took the Kumbhakāragāma road which leads to Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī
The visitor asked But venerable sir why do you take this road
Did you not recommend Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī friend
But how is this venerable sir have you no extra belongings in the place you have lived in for so long
That is so friend The bed and chair belong to the Community and they are put away as usual There is nothing else
But venerable sir I have left my staff and my oil tube and my sandal bag there
Have you already collected so much friend living there for just one day
Yes venerable sir
He was glad in his heart and he paid homage to the elder For those like you venerable sir everywhere is a forest dwelling
The Thūpārāma is a place where the relics of four Buddhas are deposited there is suitable hearing of the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace there is the Great Shrine to be seen and one can visit elders It is like the time of the Buddha
It is here that you should live On the following day he took his bowl and outer robe and went away by himself
It is no impediment for one like that
 Family means a family consisting of relatives or of supporters
For even a family consisting of supporters is an impediment for someone who lives in close association with it in the way beginning He is pleased when they are pleased  and who does not even go to a neighbouring monastery to hear the Dhamma without members of the family
But even mother and father are not an impediment for another as in the case of the young bhikkhu the nephew of the elder who lived at the Koraṇḍaka Monastery
He went to Rohaṇa for instruction it seems
The elders sister who was a lay devotee was always asking the elder how her son was getting on
One day the elder set out for Rohaṇa to fetch him back
The young bhikkhu too thought I have lived here for a long time Now I might go and visit my preceptor and find out how the lay devotee is and he left Rohaṇa
The two met on the banks of the Mahaveli River
He did the duties to the elder at the foot of a tree When asked Where are you going  he told him his purpose
The elder said You have done well The lay devotee is always asking after you That was why I came You may go but I shall stay here for the Rains and he dismissed him
He arrived at the monastery on the actual day for taking up residence for the Rains
The lodging allotted to him happened to be the one for which his father had undertaken responsibility
His father came on the following day and asked To whom was our lodging allotted venerable sirs  When he heard that it had fallen to a young visitor he went to him After paying homage to him he said Venerable sir there is an obligation for him who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging
 What is it lay follower
It is to take alms food only in our house for the three months and to let us know the time of departure after the Pavāraṇā ceremony
He consented in silence
The lay devotee went home and told his wife There is a visiting lord who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging He must be carefully looked after
and she agreed She prepared good food of various kinds for him
Though the youth went to his relatives home at the time of the meal
no one recognized him
 When he had eaten alms food there during the three months and had completed the residence for the Rains he announced his departure
Then his relatives said Let it be tomorrow venerable sir and on the following day when they had fed him in their house and filled his oil tube and given him a lump of sugar and a ninecubit length of cloth they said Now you are leaving venerable sir
He gave his blessing and set out for Rohaṇa
His preceptor had completed the Pavāraṇā ceremony and was on his way back They met at the same place as before
He did the duties to the elder at the foot of a tree
The elder asked him How was it my dear did you see the good woman lay devotee
 He replied Yes venerable sir and he told him all that had happened He then anointed the elders feet with the oil made him a drink with the sugar and presented him with the length of cloth He then after paying homage to the elder told him Venerable sir only Rohaṇa suits me and he departed
The elder too arrived back at his monastery and next day he went into the village of Koraṇḍaka
The lay devotee his sister had always kept looking down the road thinking My brother is now coming with my son
When she saw him coming alone she thought My son must be dead that is why the elder is coming alone and she fell at the elders feet lamenting and weeping
Suspecting that it must have been out of fewness of wishes that the youth had gone away without announcing himself the elder comforted her and told her all that had happened and he took the length of cloth out of his bag and showed it to her
She was appeased She prostrated herself in the direction taken by her son and she said Surely the Blessed One taught the way of the Rathavinīta the way of the Nālaka the way of the Tuvaṭaka and the way of the great Noble Ones heritages showing contentment with the four requisites and delight in development making a bhikkhu such as my son a bodywitness
So although for three months he ate in the house of the mother who bore him yet he never said I am your son you are my mother Oh admirable man
 Even mother and father are no impediment for one such as him so how much less any other family that supports him
 Gain is the four requisites
How are they an impediment
Wherever a meritorious bhikkhu goes people give him a large supply of requisites
With giving blessings to them and teaching them the Dhamma he gets no chance to do the ascetics duties
From sunrise till the first watch of the night he never breaks his association with people
Again even at dawn almsfood eaters fond of opulence come and say Venerable sir such and such a man lay follower woman lay follower friend friends daughter wants to see you and being ready to go he replies Take the bowl and robe friend So he is always on the alert Thus these requisites are an impediment for him
He should leave his group and wander by himself where he is not known
This is the way his impediment is severed
 Class is a class of students of suttas or students of Abhidhamma If with the groups instruction and questioning he gets no opportunity for the ascetics duties then that group is an impediment for him He should sever that impediment in this way
if those bhikkhus have already acquired the main part and little still remains he should finish that off and then go to the forest
If they have only acquired little and much still remains he should without travelling more than a league approach another instructor of a class within the radius of a league and say Help those venerable ones with instruction etc
If he does not find anyone in this way he should take leave of the class saying I have a task to see to friends go where it suits you and he should do his own work
 Building is new building work 
Since one engaged in this must know about what material has and has not been got by carpenters etc and must see about what has and has not been done it is always an impediment
It should be severed in this way If little remains it should be completed
If much remains it should be handed over to the Community or to bhikkhus who are entrusted with the Communitys affairs if it is a new building for the Community
or if it is for himself it should be handed over to those whom he entrusts with his own affairs
but if these are not available he should relinquish it to the Community and depart
 Travel is going on a journey
If someone is expected to give the going forth somewhere else or if some requisite is obtainable there
and he cannot rest content without getting it that will be an impediment for even if he goes into the forest to do the ascetics duties he will find it hard to get rid of thoughts about the journey So one in this position should apply himself to the ascetics duties after he has done the journey and transacted the business
 Kin in the case of the monastery means teacher preceptor coresident pupil those with the same preceptor as oneself and those with the same teacher as oneself and in the case of the house it means mother father brother and so on
When they are sick they are an impediment for him Therefore that impediment should be severed by curing them with nursing
Herein when the preceptor is sick he must be cared for as long as life lasts if the sickness does not soon depart
Likewise the teacher at the going forth the teacher at the admission the coresident the pupils to whom one has given the admission and the going forth and those who have the same preceptor
But the teacher from whom one takes the dependence the teacher who gives one instruction the pupil to whom one has given the dependence the pupil to whom one is giving instruction and those who have that same teacher as oneself should be looked after as long as the dependence or the instruction has not been terminated
If one is able to do so one should look after them even beyond that period
Mother and father should be treated like the preceptor
if they live within the kingdom and look to their son for help it should be given
Also if they have no medicine he should give them his own
If he has none he should go in search of it as alms and give that
But in the case of brothers or sisters one should only give them what is theirs
If they have none then one should give ones own temporarily and later get it back
but one should not complain if one does not get it back
It is not allowed either to make medicine for or to give it to a sisters husband who is not related by blood
but one can give it to ones sister saying Give it to your husband
The same applies to ones brothers wife
But it is allowed to make it for their children since they are blood relatives
 Affliction is any kind of illness
It is an impediment when it is actually afflicting therefore it should be severed by treatment with medicine
But if it is not cured after taking medicine for a few days then the ascetics duties should be done after apostrophizing ones person in this way I am not your slave or your hireling I have come to suffering through maintaining you through the beginningless round of rebirths
 Books means responsibility for the scriptures
That is an impediment only for one who is constantly busy with recitations etc but not for others
Here are relevant stories
The Elder Revata it seems the Majjhima reciter went to the Elder Revata the dweller in Malaya  and asked him for a meditation subject
The elder asked him How are you in the scriptures friend
I am studying the Majjhima Nikāya venerable sir
The Majjhima is a hard responsibility friend When a man is still learning the First Fifty by heart he is faced with the Middle Fifty and when he is still learning that by heart he is faced with the Last Fifty
How can you take up a meditation subject
Venerable sir when I have taken a meditation subject from you I shall not look at the scriptures again He took the meditation subject and doing no recitation for nineteen years he reached Arahantship in the twentieth year He told bhikkhus who came for recitation I have not looked at the scriptures for twenty years friends yet I am familiar with them You may begin And from beginning to end he had no hesitation even over a single syllable
The Elder MahāNāga too who lived at Karuliyagiri put aside the scriptures for eighteen years and then he recited the Dhātukathā to the bhikkhus
When they checked this with the towndwelling elders of Anurādha pura not a single question was found out of its order
In the Great Monastery too the Elder TipiṭakaCūḷaAbhaya had the golden drum struck saying I shall expound the three Piṭakas in the circle of experts in the Five Collections of discourses and this was before he had learnt the commentaries
The Community of Bhikkhus said Which teachers teaching is it Unless you give only the teaching of our own teachers we shall not let you speak
Also his preceptor asked him when he went to wait on him Did you have the drum beaten friend
Yes venerable sir
For what reason
I shall expound the scriptures venerable sir
Friend Abhaya how do the teachers explain this passage
They explain it in this way venerable sir
The elder dissented saying Hum
Again three times each time in a different way he said They explain it in this way venerable sir
The elder always dissented saying Hum Then he said Friend your first explanation was the way of the teachers But it is because you have not actually learnt it from the teachers lips that you are unable to maintain that the teachers say such and such
Go and learn it from our own teachers
Where shall I go venerable sir
There is an elder named Mahā Dhammarakkhita living in the Tulādhārapabbata Monastery in the Rohaṇa country beyond the Mahaveli River He knows all the scriptures Go to him
Saying Good venerable sir he paid homage to the elder He went with five hundred bhikkhus to the Elder MahāDhammarakkhita and when he had paid homage to him he sat down
The elder asked Why have you come
To hear the Dhamma venerable sir
Friend Abhaya they ask me about the Dīgha and the Majjhima from time to time
but I have not looked at the others for thirty years
Still you may repeat them in my presence by night
and I shall explain them to you by day
He said Good venerable sir and he acted accordingly
The inhabitants of the village had a large pavilion built at the door of his dwelling and they came daily to hear the Dhamma
what had been repeated by night
explaining by day the Elder Dhammarakkhita eventually completed the instruction Then he sat down on a mat on the ground before the Elder Abhaya and said Friend explain a meditation subject to me
What are you saying venerable sir have I not heard it all from you
What can I explain to you that you do not already know
 The senior elder said This path is different for one who has actually travelled by
The Elder Abhaya was then it seems a streamenterer
When the Elder Abhaya had given his teacher a meditation subject he returned to Anurādhapura Later while he was expounding the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace he heard that the elder had attained Nibbāna
On hearing this he said Bring me my robe friends Then he put on the robe and said The Arahant path befits our teacher friends
Our teacher was a true thoroughbred
He sat down on a mat before his own Dhamma pupil and said Explain a meditation subject to me
The Arahant path befits our teacher friends
For such as these books are no impediment
 Supernormal powers are the supernormal powers of the ordinary man
They are hard to maintain like a prone infant or like young corn
and the slightest thing breaks them
But they are an impediment for insight not for concentration since they are obtainable through concentration
So the supernormal powers are an impediment that should be severed by one who seeks insight the others are impediments to be severed by one who seeks concentration This in the first place is the detailed explanation of the impediments
Approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject  meditation subjects are of two kinds that is generally useful meditation subjects and special meditation subjects
Herein lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus etc and also mindfulness of death are what are called generally useful meditation subjects
Some say perception of foulness too
 When a bhikkhu takes up a meditation subject he should first develop lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus within the boundary limiting it at first to all bhikkhus in this monastery in this way May they be happy and free from affliction
Then he should develop it towards all deities within the boundary
Then towards all the principal people in the village that is his alms resort
then to all human beings there and to all living beings dependent on the human beings
With lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus he produces kindliness in his coresidents
then they are easy for him to live with
With lovingkindness towards the deities within the boundary he is protected by kindly deities with lawful protection
With loving kindness towards the principal people in the village that is his alms resort his requisites are protected by welldisposed principal people with lawful protection
With lovingkindness to all human beings there he goes about without incurring their dislike since they trust him
With lovingkindness to all living beings he can wander unhindered everywhere
With mindfulness of death thinking I have got to die he gives up improper search  and with a growing sense of urgency he comes to live without attachment
When his mind is familiar with the perception of foulness then even divine objects do not tempt his mind to greed
So these are called generally useful and they are called meditation subjects since they are needed generally and desirable owing to their great helpfulness and since they are subjects for the meditation work intended
What is called a special meditation subject is that one from among the forty meditation subjects that is suitable to a mans own temperament It is special because he must carry it constantly about with him and because it is the proximate cause for each higher stage of development
So it is the one who gives this twofold meditation subject that is called the giver of a meditation subject
The good friend
He is revered and dearly loved And one who speaks and suffers speech
The speech he utters is profound He does not urge without a reason and so on
 is one who possesses such special qualities as these  He is wholly solicitous of welfare and partial to progress
Because of the words beginning nanda it is owing to my being a good friend to them that living beings subject to birth are freed from birth  it is only the Fully Enlightened One who possesses all the aspects of the good friend
Since that is so while he is available only a meditation subject taken in the Blessed Ones presence is well taken
But after his final attainment of Nibbāna it is proper to take it from anyone of the eighty great disciples still living
When they are no more available one who wants to take a particular meditation subject should take it from someone with cankers destroyed who has by means of that particular meditation subject produced the fourfold and fivefold jhāna and has reached the destruction of cankers by augmenting insight that had that jhāna as its proximate cause
But how then does someone with cankers destroyed declare himself thus I am one whose cankers are destroyed
 Why not He declares himself when he knows that his instructions will be carried out
Did not the Elder Assagutta spread out his leather mat in the air and sitting crosslegged on it explain a meditation subject to a bhikkhu who was starting his meditation subject because he knew that that bhikkhu was one who would carry out his instructions for the meditation subject
So if someone with cankers destroyed is available that is good If not then one should take it from a nonreturner a oncereturner a streamenterer an ordinary man who has obtained jhāna one who knows three Piṭakas one who knows two Piṭakas one who knows one Piṭaka in descending order according as available
If not even one who knows one Piṭaka is available then it should be taken from one who is familiar with one Collection together with its commentary and one who is himself conscientious
For a teacher such as this who knows the texts guards the heritage and protects the tradition will follow the teachers opinion rather than his own
Hence the Ancient Elders said three times One who is conscientious will guard it
Now those beginning with one whose cankers are destroyed mentioned above will describe only the path they have themselves reached
But with a learned man his instructions and his answers to questions are purified by his having approached such and such teachers and so he will explain a meditation subject showing a broad track like a big elephant going through a stretch of jungle and he will select suttas and reasons from here and there adding explanations of what is suitable and unsuitable
So a meditation subject should be taken by approaching the good friend such as this the giver of a meditation subject and by doing all the duties to him
If he is available in the same monastery it is good If not one should go to where he lives
When a bhikkhu goes to him he should not do so with feet washed and anointed wearing sandals with an umbrella surrounded by pupils and bringing oil tube honey molasses etc
he should do so fulfilling the duties of a bhikkhu setting out on a journey carrying his bowl and robes himself doing all the duties in each monastery on the way with few belongings and living in the greatest effacement
When entering that monastery he should do so expecting nothing and even provided with a toothstick that he has had made allowable on the way according to the rules And he should not enter some other room thinking I shall go to the teacher after resting awhile and after washing and anointing my feet and so on
Why
If there are bhikkhus there who are hostile to the teacher they might ask him the reason for his coming and speak dispraise of the teacher saying You are done for if you go to him they might make him regret his coming and turn him back So he should ask for the teachers dwelling and go straight there
If the teacher is junior he should not consent to the teachers receiving his bowl and robe and so on
If the teacher is senior then he should go and pay homage to him and remain standing
When told Put down the bowl and robe friend he may put them down
When told Have some water to drink he can drink if he wants to
When told You may wash your feet he should not do so at once
for if the water has been brought by the teacher himself it would be improper
But when told Wash friend it was not brought by me it was brought by others then he can wash his feet sitting in a screened place out of sight of the teacher or in the open to one side of the dwelling
If the teacher brings an oil tube he should get up and take it carefully with both hands
If he did not take it it might make the teacher wonder Does this bhikkhu resent sharing so soon
 but having taken it he should not anoint his feet at once
For if it were oil for anointing the teachers limbs it would not be proper
So he should first anoint his head then his shoulders etc
but when told This is meant for all the limbs friend anoint your feet he should put a little on his head and then anoint his feet Then he should give it back saying when the teacher takes it May I return this oil tube venerable sir 
He should not say Explain a meditation subject to me venerable sir on the very day he arrives
But starting from the next day he can if the teacher has a habitual attendant ask his permission to do the duties
If he does not allow it when asked they can be done when the opportunity offers
When he does them three toothsticks should be brought a small a medium and a big one
and two kinds of mouthwashing water and bathing water that is hot and cold should be set out
Whichever of these the teacher uses for three days should then be brought regularly
If the teacher uses either kind indiscriminately he can bring whatever is available
Why so many words
as by the Blessed One  Bhikkhus a pupil should perform the duties to the teacher rightly
Herein this is the right performance of duties He should rise early removing his sandals and arranging his robe on one shoulder he should give the toothsticks and the mouthwashing water and he should prepare the seat
If there is rice gruel he should wash the dish and bring the rice gruel  All should be done as prescribed in the Khandhakas as the right duties in the passage beginning 
To please the teacher by perfection in the duties he should pay homage in the evening and he should leave when dismissed with the words You may go When the teacher asks him Why have you come he can explain the reason for his coming
If he does not ask but agrees to the duties being done then after ten days or a fortnight have gone by he should make an opportunity by staying back one day at the time of his dismissal and announcing the reason for his coming
or he should go at an unaccustomed time and when asked What have you come for  he can announce it
If the teacher says Come in the morning he should do so
But if his stomach burns with a bile affliction at that hour or if his food does not get digested owing to sluggish digestive heat or if some other ailment afflicts him he should let it be known and proposing a time that suits himself he should come at that time
For if a meditation subject is expounded at an inconvenient time one cannot give attention
This is the detailed explanation of the words approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject
Now as to the words one that suits his temperament  there are six kinds of temperament that is greedy temperament hating temperament deluded temperament faithful temperament intelligent temperament and speculative temperament
Some would have fourteen taking these six single ones together with the four made up of the three double combinations and one triple combination with the greed triad and likewise with the faith triad
But if this classification is admitted there are many more kinds of temperament possible by combining greed etc with faith etc therefore the kinds of temperament should be understood briefly as only six
As to meaning the temperaments are one that is to say personal nature idiosyncrasy
According to these there are only six types of persons that is one of greedy temperament one of hating temperament one of deluded temperament one of faithful temperament one of intelligent temperament and one of speculative temperament
Herein one of faithful temperament is parallel to one of greedy temperament because faith is strong when profitable kamma occurs in one of greedy temperament owing to its special qualities being near to those of greed
For in an unprofitable way greed is affectionate and not overaustere and so in a profitable way is faith
Greed seeks out sense desires as object while faith seeks out the special qualities of virtue and so on
And greed does not give up what is harmful while faith does not give up what is beneficial
One of intelligent temperament is parallel to one of hating temperament because understanding is strong when profitable kamma occurs in one of hating temperament owing to its special qualities being near to those of hate
For in an unprofitable way hate is disaffected and does not hold to its object and so in a profitable way is understanding
Hate seeks out only unreal faults while understanding seeks out only real faults
And hate occurs in the mode of condemning living beings while understanding occurs in the mode of condemning formations
One of speculative temperament is parallel to one of deluded temperament because obstructive applied thoughts arise often in one of deluded temperament who is striving to arouse unarisen profitable states owing to their special qualities being near to those of delusion
For just as delusion is restless owing to perplexity so are applied thoughts that are due to thinking over various aspects
And just as delusion vacillates owing to superficiality
so do applied thoughts that are due to facile conjecturing
Others say that there are three more kinds of temperament with craving pride and views
Herein craving is simply greed and pride is associated with that so neither of them exceeds greed
And since views have their source in delusion the temperament of views falls within the deluded temperament
What is the source of these temperaments
And how is it to be known that such a person is of greedy temperament that such a person is of one of those beginning with hating temperament
What suits one of what kind of temperament
Herein as some say the first three kinds of temperament to begin with have their source in previous habit and they have their source in elements and humours
Apparently one of greedy temperament has formerly had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying work to do or has reappeared here after dying in a heaven
And one of hating temperament has formerly had plenty of stabbing and torturing and brutal work to do or has reappeared here after dying in one of the hells or the nāga existences
And one of deluded temperament has formerly drunk a lot of intoxicants and neglected learning and questioning or has reappeared here after dying in the animal existence It is in this way that they have their source in previous habit they say
 Then a person is of deluded temperament because two elements are prominent that is to say the earth element and the water element
He is of hating temperament because the other two elements are prominent
But he is of greedy temperament because all four are equal
And as regards the humours one of greedy temperament has phlegm in excess
and one of deluded temperament has wind in excess
Or one of deluded temperament has phlegm in excess
and one of greedy temperament has wind in excess So they have their source in the elements and the humours they say
Now it can rightly be objected that not all of those who have had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying work to do and who have reappeared here after dying in a heaven are of greedy temperament or the others respectively of hating and deluded temperament
and there is no such law of prominence of elements as that asserted
and only the pair greed and delusion are given in the law of humours and even that subsequently contradicts itself
and no source for even one among those beginning with one of faithful temperament is given
Consequently this definition is indecisive
The following is the exposition according to the opinion of the teachers of the commentaries or this is said in the explanation of prominence The fact that these beings have prominence of greed prominence of hate prominence of delusion is governed by previous rootcause
For when in one man at the moment of his accumulating rebirthproducing kamma greed is strong and nongreed is weak nonhate and nondelusion are strong and hate and delusion are weak then his weak nongreed is unable to prevail over his greed
but his nonhate and nondelusion being strong are able to prevail over his hate and delusion
That is why on being reborn through rebirthlinking given by that kamma he has greed is goodnatured and unangry and possesses understanding with knowledge like a lightning flash
When at the moment of anothers accumulating kamma greed and hate are strong and nongreed and nonhate weak and nondelusion is strong and delusion weak then in the way already stated he has both greed and hate
but possesses understanding with knowledge like a lightning flash like the Elder DattaAbhaya
When at the moment of his accumulating kamma greed nonhate and delusion are strong and the others are weak then in the way already stated he both has greed and is dull but is goodtempered and unangry like the Elder Bahula
Likewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma the three namely greed hate and delusion are strong and nongreed etc are weak then in the way already stated he has both greed and hate and is deluded
 When at the moment of his accumulating kamma nongreed hate and delusion are strong and the others are weak then in the way already stated he has little defilement and is unshakable even on seeing a heavenly object but he has hate and is slow in understanding
When at the moment of his accumulating kamma nongreed nonhate and nondelusion are strong and the rest weak then in the way already stated he has no greed and no hate and is goodtempered but slow in understanding
Likewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma nongreed hate and nondelusion are strong and the rest weak then in the way already stated he both has no greed and possesses understanding but has hate and is irascible
Likewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma the three that is nonhate nongreed and nondelusion are strong and greed etc are weak then in the way already stated he has no greed and no hate and possesses understanding like the Elder MahāSaṅgharakkhita 
One who as it is said here has greed is one of greedy temperament
one who has hate and one who is dull are respectively of hating temperament and deluded temperament
One who possesses understanding is one of intelligent temperament
One who has no greed and one who has no hate are of faithful temperament because they are naturally trustful
Or just as one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by nondelusion is of intelligent temperament so one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by strong faith is of faithful temperament
one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by thoughts of sense desire is of speculative temperament
and one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by mixed greed etc is of mixed temperament
So it is the kamma productive of rebirthlinking and accompanied by someone among the things beginning with greed that should be understood as the source of the temperaments
 But it was asked and how is it to be known that This person is of greedy temperament   and so on
This is explained as follows
By the posture by the action By eating seeing and so on
By the kind of states occurring May temperament be recognized
 Herein by the posture when one of greedy temperament is walking in his usual manner he walks carefully puts his foot down slowly puts it down evenly lifts it up evenly and his step is springy
One of hating temperament walks as though he were digging with the points of his feet puts his foot down quickly lifts it up quickly and his step is dragged along
One of deluded temperament walks with a perplexed gait puts his foot down hesitantly lifts it up hesitantly and his step is pressed down suddenly
And this is said in the account of the origin of the Māgandiya Sutta
The step of one of greedy nature will be springy
The step of one of hating nature dragged along
Deluded he will suddenly press down his step
And one without defilement has a step like this
The stance of one of greedy temperament is confident and graceful That of one of hating temperament is rigid That of one of deluded temperament is muddled
likewise in sitting
And one of greedy temperament spreads his bed unhurriedly lies down slowly composing his limbs and he sleeps in a confident manner When woken instead of getting up quickly he gives his answer slowly as though doubtful
One of hating temperament spreads his bed hastily anyhow with his body flung down he sleeps with a scowl When woken he gets up quickly and answers as though annoyed
One of deluded temperament spreads his bed all awry and sleeps mostly face downwards with his body sprawling When woken he gets up slowly saying Hum 
 Since those of faithful temperament etc are parallel to those of greedy temperament etc their postures are therefore like those described above
This firstly is how the temperaments may be recognized by the posture
By the action also in the acts of sweeping etc one of greedy temperament grasps the broom well and he sweeps cleanly and evenly without hurrying or scattering the sand as if he were strewing sinduvāra flowers
One of hating temperament grasps the broom tightly and he sweeps uncleanly and unevenly with a harsh noise hurriedly throwing up the sand on each side
One of deluded temperament grasps the broom loosely and he sweeps neither cleanly nor evenly mixing the sand up and turning it over
As with sweeping so too with any action such as washing and dyeing robes and so on One of greedy temperament acts skilfully gently evenly and carefully
One of hating temperament acts tensely stiffly and unevenly
One of deluded temperament acts unskilfully as if muddled unevenly and indecisively
Also one of greedy temperament wears his robe neither too tightly nor too loosely confidently and level all round
One of hating temperament wears it too tight and not level all round
One of deluded temperament wears it loosely and in a muddled way
Those of faithful temperament etc should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallel
This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the actions
By eating One of greedy temperament likes eating rich sweet food When eating he makes a round lump not too big and eats unhurriedly savouring the various tastes He enjoys getting something good
One of hating temperament likes eating rough sour food When eating he makes a lump that fills his mouth and he eats hurriedly without savouring the taste He is aggrieved when he gets something not good
One of deluded temperament has no settled choice When eating he makes a small unrounded lump and as he eats he drops bits into his dish smearing his face with his mind astray thinking of this and that
Also those of faithful temperament etc should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallel
This is how the temperament may be recognized by eating
And by seeing and so on when one of greedy temperament sees even a slightly pleasing visible object he looks long as if surprised he seizes on trivial virtues discounts genuine faults and when departing he does so with regret as if unwilling to leave
When one of hating temperament sees even a slightly unpleasing visible object he avoids looking long as if he were tired he picks out trivial faults discounts genuine virtues and when departing he does so without regret as if anxious to leave
When one of deluded temperament sees any sort of visible object he copies what others do if he hears others criticizing he criticizes if he hears others praising he praises but actually he feels equanimity in himselfthe equanimity of unknowing
So too with sounds and so on
And those of faithful temperament etc should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallel
This is how the temperaments may be recognized by seeing and so on
By the kind of states occurring in one of greedy temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as deceit fraud pride evilness of wishes greatness of wishes discontent foppery and personal vanity
In one of hating temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as anger enmity disparaging domineering envy and avarice
In one of deluded temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as stiffness torpor agitation worry uncertainty and holding on tenaciously with refusal to relinquish
In one of faithful temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as free generosity desire to see Noble Ones desire to hear the Good Dhamma great gladness ingenuousness honesty and trust in things that inspire trust
In one of intelligent temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as readiness to be spoken to possession of good friends knowledge of the right amount in eating mindfulness and full awareness devotion to wakefulness a sense of urgency about things that should inspire a sense of urgency and wisely directed endeavour
In one of speculative temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as talkativeness sociability boredom with devotion to the profitable failure to finish undertakings smoking by night and flaming by day  and mental running hither and thither 
This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the kind of states occurring
However these directions for recognizing the temperaments have not been handed down in their entirety in either the texts or the commentaries they are only expressed according to the opinion of the teachers and cannot therefore be treated as authentic
For even those of hating temperament can exhibit postures etc ascribed to the greedy temperament when they try diligently
And postures etc never arise with distinct characteristics in a person of mixed temperament
Only such directions for recognizing temperament as are given in the commentaries should be treated as authentic
for this is said A teacher who has acquired penetration of minds will know the temperament and will explain a meditation subject accordingly one who has not should question the pupil
So it is by penetration of minds or by questioning the person that it can be known
whether he is one of greedy temperament or one of those beginning with hating temperament
What suits one of what kind of temperament A suitable lodging for one of greedy temperament has an unwashed sill and stands level with the ground and it can be either an overhanging rock with an unprepared dripledge  a grass hut or a leaf house etc It ought to be spattered with dirt full of bats dilapidated too high or too low in bleak surroundings threatened by lions tigers etc with a muddy uneven path where even the bed and chair are full of bugs And it should be ugly and unsightly exciting loathing as soon as looked at
Suitable inner and outer garments are those that have tornoff edges with threads hanging down all round like a net cake harsh to the touch like hemp soiled heavy and hard to wear
And the right kind of bowl for him is an ugly clay bowl disfigured by stoppings and joints or a heavy and misshapen iron bowl as unappetizing as a skull
The right kind of road for him on which to wander for alms is disagreeable with no village near and uneven
The right kind of village for him in which to wander for alms is where people wander about as if oblivious of him where as he is about to leave without getting alms even from a single family people call him into the sitting hall saying Come venerable sir and give him gruel and rice but do so as casually as if they were putting a cow in a pen
Suitable people to serve him are slaves or workmen who are unsightly illfavoured with dirty clothes illsmelling and disgusting who serve him his gruel and rice as if they were throwing it rudely at him
The right kind of gruel and rice and hard food is poor unsightly made up of millet kudusaka broken rice etc stale buttermilk sour gruel curry of old vegetables or anything at all that is merely for filling the stomach
The right kind of posture for him is either standing or walking
The object of his contemplation should be any of the colour kasiṇas beginning with the blue whose colour is not pure This is what suits one of greedy temperament
A suitable resting place for one of hating temperament is not too high or too low provided with shade and water with wellproportioned walls posts and steps with wellprepared frieze work and lattice work brightened with various kinds of painting with an even smooth soft floor adorned with festoons of flowers and a canopy of manycoloured cloth like a Brahmāgods divine palace with bed and chair covered with wellspread clean pretty covers smelling sweetly of flowers and perfumes and scents set about for homely comfort which makes one happy and glad at the mere sight of it
The right kind of road to his lodging is free from any sort of danger traverses clean even ground and has been properly prepared
And here it is best that the lodgings furnishings are not too many in order to avoid hidingplaces for insects bugs snakes and rats even a single bed and chair only
The right kind of inner and outer garments for him are of any superior stuff such as China cloth Somāra cloth silk fine cotton fine linen of either single or double thickness quite light and well dyed quite pure in colour to befit an ascetic
The right kind of bowl is made of iron as well shaped as a water bubble as polished as a gem spotless and of quite pure colour to befit an ascetic
The right kind of road on which to wander for alms is free from dangers level agreeable with the village neither too far nor too near
The right kind of village in which to wander for alms is where people thinking Now our lord is coming prepare a seat in a sprinkled swept place and going out to meet him take his bowl lead him to the house seat him on a prepared seat and serve him carefully with their own hands
 Suitable people to serve him are handsome pleasing well bathed well anointed scented with the perfume of incense and the smell of flowers adorned with apparel made of variouslydyed clean pretty cloth who do their work carefully
The right kind of gruel rice and hard food has colour smell and taste possesses nutritive essence and is inviting superior in every way and enough for his wants
The right kind of posture for him is lying down or sitting The object of his contemplation should be anyone of the colour kasiṇas beginning with the blue whose colour is quite pure This is what suits one of hating temperament
The right lodging for one of deluded temperament has a view and is not shut in where the four quarters are visible to him as he sits there As to the postures walking is right
The right kind of object for his contemplation is not small that is to say the size of a winnowing basket or the size of a saucer
for his mind becomes more confused in a confined space so the right kind is an amply large kasiṇa
The rest is as stated for one of hating temperament This is what suits one of deluded temperament
 For one of faithful temperament all the directions given for one of hating temperament are suitable
As to the object of his contemplation one of the recollections is right as well
For one of intelligent temperament there is nothing unsuitable as far as concerns the lodging and so on
For one of speculative temperament an open lodging with a view where gardens groves and ponds pleasant prospects panoramas of villages towns and countryside and the blue gleam of mountains are visible to him as he sits there is not right for that is a condition for the running hither and thither of applied thought So he should live in a lodging such as a deep cavern screened by woods like the Overhanging Rock of the Elephants Belly  or Mahindas Cave
Also an amplesized object of contemplation is not suitable for him
for one like that is a condition for the running hither and thither of applied thought
A small one is right
The rest is as stated for one of greedy temperament This is what suits one of speculative temperament
These are the details with definition of the kind source recognition and what is suitable as regards the various temperaments handed down here with the words that suits his own temperament 
 However the meditation subject that is suitable to the temperament has not been cleared up in all its aspects yet
This will become clear automatically when those in the following list are treated in detail 
Now it was said above and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament  Here the exposition of the meditation subject should be first understood in these ten ways as to enumeration as to which bring only access and which absorption at to the kinds of jhāna as to surmounting as to extension and nonextension as to object as to plane as to apprehending as to condition as to suitability to temperament
 Herein as to enumeration it was said above from among the forty meditation subjects  Herein the forty meditation subjects are these ten kasiṇas  ten kinds of foulness ten recollections four divine abidings four immaterial states one perception one defining
 Herein the ten kasiṇas are these earth kasiṇa water kasiṇa fire kasiṇa air kasiṇa blue kasiṇa yellow kasiṇa red kasiṇa white kasiṇa light kasiṇa and limitedspace kasiṇa
The ten kinds of foulness are these the bloated the livid the festering the cut up the gnawed the scattered the hacked and scattered the bleeding the worm infested and a skeleton
The ten kinds of recollection are these recollection of the Buddha  recollection of the Dhamma  recollection of the Sangha  recollection of virtue recollection of generosity recollection of deities recollection of death mindfulness occupied with the body mindfulness of breathing and recollection of peace
The four divine abidings are these lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity
The four immaterial states are these the base consisting of boundless space the base consisting of boundless consciousness the base consisting of nothingness and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception
The one perception is the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment
The one defining is the defining of the four elements This is how the exposition should be understood as to enumeration 
 As to which bring access only and which absorption the eight recollections excepting mindfulness occupied with the body and mindfulness of breathing the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment and the defining of the four elements are ten meditation subjects that bring access only
The others bring absorption
This is as to which bring access only and which absorption 
 As to the kind of jhāna among those that bring absorption the ten kasiṇas together with mindfulness of breathing bring all four jhānas
The ten kinds of foulness together with mindfulness occupied with the body bring the first jhāna
The first three divine abidings bring three jhānas
The fourth divine abiding and the four immaterial states bring the fourth jhāna This is as to the kind of jhāna 
 As to surmounting there are two kinds of surmounting that is to say surmounting of factors and surmounting of object
Herein there is surmounting of factors in the case of all meditation subjects that bring three and four jhānas because the second jhāna etc have to be reached in those same objects by surmounting the jhāna factors of applied thought and sustained thought and so on
Likewise in the case of the fourth divine abiding
for that has to be reached by surmounting joy in the same object as that of lovingkindness and so on
But in the case of the four immaterial states there is surmounting of the object
for the base consisting of boundless space has to be reached by surmounting one or other of the first nine kasiṇas
and the base consisting of boundless consciousness etc have respectively to be reached by surmounting space and so on
With the rest there is no surmounting This is as to surmounting 
 As to extension and nonextension only the ten kasiṇas among these forty meditation subjects need be extended
For it is within just so much space as one is intent upon with the kasiṇa that one can hear sounds with the divine ear element see visible objects with the divine eye and know the minds of other beings with the mind
Mindfulness occupied with the body and the ten kinds of foulness need not be extended
Why
Because they have a definite location and because there is no benefit in it
The definiteness of their location will become clear in explaining the method of development 
If the latter are extended it is only a quantity of corpses that is extended and there is no benefit
And this is said in answer to the question of Sopāka Perception of visible forms is quite clear Blessed One perception of bones is not clear 
for here the perception of visible forms is called quite clear in the sense of extension of the sign
while the perception of bones is called not quite clear in the sense of its nonextension
 But the words I was intent upon this whole earth with the perception of a skeleton are said of the manner of appearance to one who has acquired that perception
For just as in the Emperor Dhammāsokas time the Karavīka bird uttered a sweet song when it saw its own reflection in the looking glass walls all round and perceived Karavīkas in every direction so the Elder Siṅgāla Pitar thought when he saw the sign appearing in all directions through his acquisition of the perception of a skeleton that the whole earth was covered with bones
 If that is so then is what is called the measurelessness of the object of jhāna produced on foulness contradicted
It is not contradicted
For one man apprehends the sign in a large bloated corpse or skeleton
another in a small one
In this way the jhāna of the one has a limited object
and of the other a measureless object
Or alternatively With a measureless object is said of it referring to one who extends it seeing no disadvantage in doing so
But it need not be extended because no benefit results
 The rest need not be extended likewise
Why
When a man extends the sign of inbreaths and outbreaths only a quantity of wind is extended and it has a definite location the nosetip
So it need not be extended because of the disadvantage and because of the definiteness of the location
And the divine abidings have living beings as their object When a man extends the sign of these only the quantity of living beings would be extended and there is no purpose in that So that also need not be extended
When it is said Intent upon one quarter with his heart endued with loving kindness  etc that is said for the sake of comprehensive inclusion
For it is when a man develops it progressively by including living beings in one direction by one house by two houses etc that he is said to be intent upon one direction
not when he extends the sign
And there is no counterpart sign here that he might extend
Also the state of having a limited or measureless object can be understood here according to the way of inclusion too
 As regards the immaterial states as object space need not be extended since it is the mere removal of the kasiṇa materiality
for that should be brought to mind only as the disappearance of the kasiṇa materiality
if he extends it nothing further happens
And consciousness need not be extended since it is a state consisting in an individual essence and it is not possible to extend a state consisting in an individual essence
The disappearance of consciousness need not be extended since it is mere nonexistence of consciousness
And the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception as object need not be extended since it too is a state consisting in an individual essence
 The rest need not be extended because they have no sign
For it is the counterpart sign that would be extendable
and the object of the recollection of the Buddha etc is not a counterpart sign Consequently there is no need for extension there This is as to extension and nonextension 
 As to object of these forty meditation subjects twentytwo have counterpart signs as object that is to say the ten kasiṇas the ten kinds of foulness mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied with the body
the rest do not have counterpart signs as object
Then twelve have states consisting in individual essences as object that is to say eight of the ten recollectionsexcept mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied with the bodythe perception of repulsiveness in nutriment the defining of the elements the base consisting of boundless consciousness and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception and twentytwo have counterpart signs as object
that is to say the ten kasiṇas the ten kinds of foulness mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied with the body
while the remaining six have notso classifiable objects
Then eight have mobile objects in the early stage though the counterpart is stationary that is to say the festering the bleeding the worminfested mindfulness of breathing the water kasiṇa the fire kasiṇa the air kasiṇa and in the case of the light kasiṇa the object consisting of a circle of sunlight etc
the rest have immobile objects This is as to object
 As to plane here the twelve namely the ten kinds of foulness mindfulness occupied with the body and perception of repulsiveness in nutriment do not occur among deities
These twelve and mindfulness of breathing do not occur in the Brahmāworld
But none except the four immaterial states occur in the immaterial becoming
All occur among human beings This is as to plane 
 As to apprehending here the exposition should be understood according to the seen the touched and the heard
Herein these nineteen that is to say nine kasiṇas omitting the air kasiṇa and the ten kinds of foulness must be apprehended by the seen
The meaning is that in the early stage their sign must be apprehended by constantly looking with the eye
In the case of mindfulness occupied with the body the five parts ending with skin must be apprehended by the seen and the rest by the heard so its object must be apprehended by the seen and the heard
Mindfulness of breathing must be apprehended by the touched the air kasiṇa by the seen and the touched the remaining eighteen by the heard
The divine abiding of equanimity and the four immaterial states are not apprehendable by a beginner
but the remaining thirtyfive are This is as to apprehending 
 As to condition of these meditation subjects nine kasiṇas omitting the space kasiṇa are conditions for the immaterial states The ten kasiṇas are conditions for the kinds of directknowledge Three divine abidings are conditions for the fourth divine abiding Each lower immaterial state is a condition for each higher one The base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is a condition for the attainment of cessation All are conditions for living in bliss for insight and for the fortunate kinds of becoming This is as to condition 
 As to suitability to temperament here the exposition should be understood according to what is suitable to the temperaments
That is to say first the ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness occupied with the body are eleven meditation subjects suitable for one of greedy temperament
The four divine abidings and four colour kasiṇas are eight suitable for one of hating temperament
Mindfulness of breathing is the one recollection as a meditation subject suitable for one of deluded temperament and for one of speculative temperament
The first six recollections are suitable for one of faithful temperament
Mindfulness of death the recollection of peace the defining of the four elements and the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment are four suitable for one of intelligent temperament
The remaining kasiṇas and the immaterial states are suitable for all kinds of temperament
And anyone of the kasiṇas should be limited for one of speculative temperament and measureless for one of deluded temperament
This is how the exposition should be understood here as to suitability to temperament  All this has been stated in the form of direct opposition and complete suitability
But there is actually no profitable development that does not suppress greed etc and help faith and so on
And this is said in the Meghiya Sutta
One should in addition develop these four things
foulness should be developed for the purpose of abandoning greed 
Lovingkindness should be developed for the purpose of abandoning ill will
Mindfulness of breathing should be developed for the purpose of cutting off applied thought
Perception of impermanence should be cultivated for the purpose of eliminating the conceit I am 
Also in the Rāhula Sutta in the passage beginning Develop lovingkindness Rāhula  seven meditation subjects are given for a single temperament
So instead of insisting on the mere letter the intention should be sought in each instance This is the explanatory exposition of the meditation subject referred to by the words he should apprehendone meditation subject 
 Now the words and he should apprehend are illustrated as follows
After approaching the good friend of the kind described in the explanation of the words then approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject  the meditator should dedicate himself to the Blessed One the Enlightened One or to a teacher and he should ask for the meditation subject with a sincere inclination of the heart and sincere resolution
Herein he should dedicate himself to the Blessed One the Enlightened One in this way Blessed One I relinquish this my person to you
For without having thus dedicated himself when living in a remote abode he might be unable to stand fast if a frightening object made its appearance and he might return to a village abode become associated with laymen take up improper search and come to ruin
But when he has dedicated himself in this way no fear arises in him if a frightening object makes its appearance
in fact only joy arises in him as he reflects Have you not wisely already dedicated yourself to the Enlightened One
 Suppose a man had a fine piece of Kāsi cloth He would feel grief if it were eaten by rats or moths
but if he gave it to a bhikkhu needing robes he would feel only joy if he saw the bhikkhu tearing it up to make his patched cloak
And so it is with this
 When he dedicates himself to a teacher he should say I relinquish this my person to you venerable sir
For one who has not dedicated his person thus becomes unresponsive to correction hard to speak to and unamenable to advice or he goes where he likes without asking the teacher Consequently the teacher does not help him with either material things or the Dhamma and he does not train him in the cryptic books
Failing to get these two kinds of help he finds no footing in the Dispensation and he soon comes down to misconducting himself or to the lay state
But if he has dedicated his person he is not unresponsive to correction does not go about as he likes is easy to speak to and lives only in dependence on the teacher
He gets the twofold help from the teacher and attains growth increase and fulfilment in the Dispensation Like the Elder Cūḷa PiṇḍapātikaTissas pupils
Three bhikkhus came to the elder it seems
One of them said Venerable sir I am ready to fall from a cliff the height of one hundred men if it is said to be to your advantage
The second said Venerable sir I am ready to grind away this body from the heels up without remainder on a flat stone if it is said to be to your advantage
The third said Venerable sir I am ready to die by stopping breathing if it is said to be to your advantage
Observing These bhikkhus are certainly capable of progress the elder expounded a meditation subject to them
Following his advice the three attained Arahantship This is the benefit in selfdedication
Hence it was said above dedicating himself to the Blessed One the Enlightened One or to a teacher 
 With a sincere inclination of the heart and sincere resolution  the meditators inclination should be sincere in the six modes beginning with non greed
For it is one of such sincere inclination who arrives at one of the three kinds of enlightenment
according as it is said Six kinds of inclination lead to the maturing of the enlightenment of the Bodhisattas With the inclination to non greed Bodhisattas see the fault in greed With the inclination to nonhate Bodhisattas see the fault in hate With the inclination to nondelusion Bodhisattas see the fault in delusion With the inclination to renunciation Bodhisattas see the fault in house life With the inclination to seclusion Bodhisattas see the fault in society With the inclination to relinquishment Bodhisattas see the fault in all kinds of becoming and destiny 
For streamenterers oncereturners nonreturners those with cankers destroyed  Paccekabuddhas and Fully Enlightened Ones whether past future or present all arrive at the distinction peculiar to each by means of these same six modes
That is why he should have sincerity of inclination in these six modes
 He should be wholeheartedly resolved on that
The meaning is that he should be resolved upon concentration respect concentration incline to concentration be resolved upon Nibbāna respect Nibbāna incline to Nibbāna
When with sincerity of inclination and wholehearted resolution in this way he asks for a meditation subject then a teacher who has acquired the penetration of minds can know his temperament by surveying his mental conduct and a teacher who has not can know it by putting such questions to him as
What is your temperament
or What states are usually present in you
or What do you like bringing to mind
or What meditation subject does your mind favour 
When he knows he can expound a meditation subject suitable to that temperament
And in doing so he can expound it in three ways
it can be expounded to one who has already learnt the meditation subject by having him recite it at one or two sessions
it can be expounded to one who lives in the same place each time he comes
and to one who wants to learn it and then go elsewhere it can be expounded in such a manner that it is neither too brief nor too long
 Herein when first he is explaining the earth kasiṇa there are nine aspects that he should explain They are the four faults of the kasiṇa the making of a kasiṇa the method of development for one who has made it the two kinds of sign the two kinds of concentration the seven kinds of suitable and unsuitable the ten kinds of skill in absorption evenness of energy and the directions for absorption
In the case of the other meditation subjects each should be expounded in the way appropriate to it
All this will be made clear in the directions for development
But when the meditation subject is being expounded in this way the meditator must apprehend the sign as he listens
 Apprehend the sign means that he must connect each aspect thus This is the preceding clause this is the subsequent clause this is its meaning this is its intention this is the simile
When he listens attentively apprehending the sign in this way his meditation subject is well apprehended
Then and because of that he successfully attains distinction but not otherwise This clarifies the meaning of the words and he must apprehend 
At this point the clauses approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament have been expounded in detail in all their aspects
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the Treatise on the Development of Concentration
called The Description of Taking a Meditation Subject
The third chapter
If it is inconvenient there he can live in another monastery a suitable onea quarter or a half or even a whole league distant
In that case when he finds he is in doubt about or has forgotten some passage in the meditation subject then he should do the duties in the monastery in good time and set out afterwards going for alms on the way and arriving at the teachers dwelling place after his meal He should make certain about the meditation subject that day in the teachers presence Next day after paying homage to the teacher he should go for alms on his way back and so he can return to his own dwelling place without fatigue
But one who finds no convenient place within even a league should clarify all difficulties about the meditation subject and make quite sure it has been properly attended to Then he can even go far away and avoiding a monastery unfavourable to development of concentration live in one that is favourable
Herein one that is unfavourable has anyone of eighteen faults
These are largeness newness dilapidatedness a nearby road a pond edible leaves flowers fruits famousness a nearby city nearby timber trees nearby arable fields presence of incompatible persons a nearby port of entry nearness to the border countries nearness to the frontier of a kingdom unsuitability lack of good friends One with any of these faults is not favourable
He should not live there
Why
Firstly people with varying aims collect in a large monastery They conflict with each other and so neglect the duties
The Enlightenmenttree terrace etc remain unswept
the water for drinking and washing is not set out
So if he thinks I shall go to the almsresort village for alms and takes his bowl and robe and sets out perhaps he sees that the duties have not been done or that a drinkingwater pot is empty and so the duty has to be done by him unexpectedly Drinking water must be maintained
By not doing it he would commit a wrongdoing in the breach of a duty
But if he does it he loses time He arrives too late at the village and gets nothing because the alms giving is finished
Also when he goes into retreat he is distracted by the loud noises of novices and young bhikkhus and by acts of the Community being carried out
However he can live in a large monastery where all the duties are done and where there are none of the other disturbances
 In a new monastery there is much new building activity People criticize someone who takes no part in it
But he can live in such a monastery where the bhikkhus say Let the venerable one do the ascetics duties as much as he likes We shall see to the building work 
 In a dilapidated monastery there is much that needs repair People criticize someone who does not see about the repairing of at least his own lodging When he sees to the repairs his meditation subject suffers
 In a monastery with a nearby road by a main street visitors keep arriving night and day
He has to give up his own lodging to those who come late and he has to go and live at the root of a tree or on top of a rock
And next day it is the same So there is no opportunity to practice his meditation subject
But he can live in one where there is no such disturbance by visitors
 A pond is a rock pool Numbers of people come there for drinking water Pupils of citydwelling elders supported by the royal family come to do dyeing work When they ask for vessels wood tubs etc they must be shown where these things are So he is kept all the time on the alert
 If he goes with his meditation subject to sit by day where there are many sorts of edible leaves then women vegetablegatherers singing as they pick leaves nearby endanger his meditation subject by disturbing it with sounds of the opposite sex
 And where there are many sorts of flowering shrubs in bloom there is the same danger too
 Where there are many sorts of fruits such as mangoes roseapples and jakfruits people who want fruits come and ask for them and they get angry if he does not give them any or they take them by force When walking in the monastery in the evening he sees them and asks Why do you do so lay followers  they abuse him as they please
and even try to evict him
 When he lives in a monastery that is famous and renowned in the world like Dakkhiṇagiri Hatthikucchi Cetiyagiri or Cittalapabbata there are always people coming who want to pay homage to him supposing that he is an Arahant which inconveniences him But if it suits him he can live there at night and go elsewhere by day
 In one with a nearby city objects of the opposite sex come into focus Womenpot carriers go by bumping into him with their jars and giving no room to pass Also important people spread out carpets in the middle of the monastery and sit down
 One with nearby timber trees where there are timber trees and osiers useful for making framework is inconvenient because of the woodgatherers there like the gatherers of branches and fruits already mentioned
If there are trees in a monastery people come and cut them down to build houses with When he has come out of his meditation room in the evening and is walking up and down in the monastery if he sees them and asks Why do you do so lay followers  they abuse him as they please and even try to evict him
 People make use of one with nearby arable fields quite surrounded by fields They make a threshing floor in the middle of the monastery itself They thresh corn there dry it in the forecourts and cause great inconvenience
And where there is extensive property belonging to the Community the monastery attendants impound cattle belonging to families and deny the water supply to their crops Then people bring an ear of paddy and show it to the Community saying Look at your monastery attendants work
For one reason or another he has to go to the portals of the king or the kings ministers This matter of property belonging to the Community is included by a monastery that is near arable fields
 Presence of incompatible persons where there are bhikkhus living who are incompatible and mutually hostile when they clash and it is protested Venerable sirs do not do so they exclaim We no longer count now that this refuserag wearer has come 
 One with a nearby water port of entry or land port of entry is made inconvenient by people constantly arriving respectively by ship or by caravan and crowding round asking for space or for drinking water or salt
 In the case of one near the border countries people have no trust in the Buddha etc there
 In one near the frontier of a kingdom there is fear of kings
For perhaps one king attacks that place thinking It does not submit to my rule and the other does likewise thinking It does not submit to my rule
A bhikkhu lives there when it is conquered by one king and when it is conquered by the other
Then they suspect him of spying and they bring about his undoing
 Unsuitability is that due to the risk of encountering visible data etc of the opposite sex as objects or to haunting by nonhuman beings
Here is a story
An elder lived in a forest it seems
Then an ogress stood in the door of his leaf hut and sang
The elder came out and stood in the door She went to the end of the walk and sang
The elder went to the end of the walk
She stood in a chasm a hundred fathoms deep and sang
The elder recoiled
Then she suddenly grabbed him saying Venerable sir it is not just one or two of the likes of you I have eaten 
 Lack of good friends where it is not possible to find a good friend as a teacher or the equivalent of a teacher or a preceptor or the equivalent of a preceptor
the lack of good friends there is a serious fault One that has any of those eighteen faults should be understood as unfavourable
And this is said in the commentaries
A large abode a new abode One tumbling down one near a road
One with a pond or leaves or flowers Or fruits or one that people seek
In cities among timber fields Where people quarrel in a port
In border lands on frontiers Unsuitableness and no good friend
These are the eighteen instances A wise man needs to recognize
And give them full as wide a berth As any footpadhunted road
One that has the five factors beginning with not too far from and not too near to the alms resort is called favourable
For this is said by the Blessed One And how has a lodging five factors bhikkhus
Here bhikkhus a lodging is not too far not too near and has a path for going and coming It is little frequented by day with little sound and few voices by night There is little contact with gadflies flies wind burning sun and creeping things One who lives in that lodging easily obtains robes alms food lodging and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick
 In that lodging there are elder bhikkhus living who are learned versed in the scriptures observers of the Dhamma observers of the Vinaya observers of the Codes and when from time to time one asks them questions How is this venerable sir What is the meaning of this  then those venerable ones reveal the unrevealed explain the unexplained and remove doubt about the many things that raise doubts
This bhikkhus is how a lodging has five factors
These are the details for the clause After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to live in one that is favourable 
 Then he should sever the lesser impediments  one living in such a favourable monastery should sever any minor impediments that he may still have
that is to say long head hair nails and body hair should be cut
mending and patching of old robes should be done
or those that are soiled should be dyed
If there is a stain on the bowl the bowl should be baked
The bed chair etc should be cleaned up
These are the details for the clause Then he should sever the lesser impediments 
 Now with the clause And not overlook any of the directions for development  the time has come for the detailed exposition of all meditation subjects starting with the earth kasiṇa
THE EARTH KASIA When a bhikkhu has thus severed the lesser impediments then on his return from his alms round after his meal and after he has got rid of drowsiness due to the meal he should sit down comfortably in a secluded place and apprehend the sign in earth that is either made up or not made up
 For this is said
One who is learning the earth kasiṇa apprehends the sign in earth that is either made up or not made up that is bounded not unbounded limited not unlimited with a periphery not without a periphery circumscribed not uncircumscribed either the size of a bushel or the size of a saucer 
He sees to it that that sign is well apprehended well attended to well defined
Having done that and seeing its advantages and perceiving it as a treasure building up respect for it making it dear to him he anchors his mind to that object thinking Surely in this way I shall be freed from aging and death
Secluded from sense desires  he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna 
 Herein when in a previous becoming a man has gone forth into homelessness in the Dispensation or outside it with the rishis going forth and has already produced the jhāna tetrad or pentad on the earth kasiṇa and so has such merit and the support of past practice of jhāna as well then the sign arises in him on earth that is not made up that is to say on a ploughed area or on a threshing floor as in the Elder Mallakas case
It seems that while that venerable one was looking at a ploughed area the sign arose in him the size of that area
He extended it and attained the jhāna pentad Then by establishing insight with the jhāna as the basis for it he reached Arahantship
MAKING AN EARTH KASIA But when a man has had no such previous practice he should make a kasiṇa guarding against the four faults of a kasiṇa and not overlooking any of the directions for the meditation subject learnt from the teacher
Now the four faults of the earth kasiṇa are due to the intrusion of blue yellow red or white
So instead of using clay of such colours he should make the kasiṇa of clay like that in the stream of the Gangā which is the colour of the dawn
And he should make it not in the middle of the monastery in a place where novices etc are about
but on the confines of the monastery in a screened place either under an overhanging rock or in a leaf hut He can make it either portable or as a fixture
Of these a portable one should be made by tying rags of leather or matting onto four sticks and smearing thereon a disk of the size already mentioned using clay picked clean of grass roots gravel and sand and well kneaded
At the time of the preliminary work it should be laid on the ground and looked at
A fixture should be made by knocking stakes into the ground in the form of a lotus calyx lacing them over with creepers
If the clay is insufficient then other clay should be put underneath and a disk a span and four fingers across made on top of that with the quite pure dawncoloured clay
For it was with reference only to measurement that it was said above either the size of a bushel or the size of a saucer 
But that is bounded not unbounded was said to show its delimitedness
 So having thus made it delimited and of the size prescribed he should scrape it down with a stone trowela wooden trowel turns it a bad colour
so that should not be employedand make it as even as the surface of a drum Then he should sweep the place out and have a bath On his return he should seat himself on a wellcovered chair with legs a span and four fingers high prepared in a place that is two and a half cubits that is two and a half times elbow to fingertip from the kasiṇa disk
For the kasiṇa does not appear plainly to him if he sits further off than that and if he sits nearer than that faults in the kasiṇa appear
If he sits higher up he has to look at it with his neck bent and if he sits lower down his knees ache
STARTING CONTEMPLATION So after seating himself in the way stated he should review the dangers in sense desires in the way beginning Sense desires give little enjoyment and arouse longing for the escape from sense desires for the renunciation that is the means to the surmounting of all suffering He should next arouse joy of happiness by recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha then awe by thinking Now this is the way of renunciation entered upon by all Buddhas Paccekabuddhas and noble disciples and then eagerness by thinking In this way I shall surely come to know the taste of the bliss of seclusion After that he should open his eyes moderately apprehend the sign and so proceed to develop it
If he opens his eyes too wide they get fatigued and the disk becomes too obvious which prevents the sign becoming apparent to him
If he opens them too little the disk is not obvious enough and his mind becomes drowsy which also prevents the sign becoming apparent to him
So he should develop it by apprehending the sign  keeping his eyes open moderately as if he were seeing the reflection of his face on the surface of a looking glass The colour should not be reviewed The characteristic should not be given attention
But rather while not ignoring the colour attention should be given by setting the mind on the name concept as the most outstanding mental datum relegating the colour to the position of a property of its physical support
That conceptual state can be called by anyone he likes among the names for earth such as earth  the Great One  the Friendly One  ground  the Provider of Wealth  the Bearer of Wealth  etc whichever suits his manner of perception
Still earth is also a name that is obvious so it can be developed with the obvious one by saying earth earth
It should be adverted to now with eyes open now with eyes shut
And he should go on developing it in this way a hundred times a thousand times and even more than that until the learning sign arises
 When while he is developing it in this way it comes into focus as he adverts with his eyes shut exactly as it does with his eyes open then the learning sign is said to have been produced
After its production he should no longer sit in that place
he should return to his own quarters and go on developing it sitting there
But in order to avoid the delay of foot washing a pair of single soled sandals and a walking stick are desirable
Then if the new concentration vanishes through some unsuitable encounter he can put his sandals on take his walking stick and go back to the place to reapprehend the sign there When he returns he should seat himself comfortably and develop it by reiterated reaction to it and by striking at it with thought and applied thought
THE COUNTERPART SIGN As he does so the hindrances eventually become suppressed the defilements subside the mind becomes concentrated with access concentration and the counterpart sign arises
The difference between the earlier learning sign and the counterpart sign is this In the learning sign any fault in the kasiṇa is apparent But the counterpart sign appears as if breaking out from the learning sign and a hundred times a thousand times more purified like a lookingglass disk drawn from its case like a motherofpearl dish well washed like the moons disk coming out from behind a cloud like cranes against a thunder cloud
But it has neither colour nor shape
for if it had it would be cognizable by the eye gross susceptible of comprehension by insight and stamped with the three characteristics But it is not like that
For it is born only of perception in one who has obtained concentration being a mere mode of appearance
But as soon as it arises the hindrances are quite suppressed the defilements subside and the mind becomes concentrated in access concentration
THE TWO KINDS OF CONCENTRATION Now concentration is of two kinds that is to say access concentration and absorption concentration
the mind becomes concentrated in two ways that is on the plane of access and on the plane of obtainment
Herein the mind becomes concentrated on the plane of access by the abandonment of the hindrances
and on the plane of obtainment by the manifestation of the jhāna factors
The difference between the two kinds of concentration is this The factors are not strong in access It is because they are not strong that when access has arisen the mind now makes the sign its object and now reenters the life continuum just as when a young child is lifted up and stood on its feet it repeatedly falls down on the ground
But the factors are strong in absorption It is because they are strong that when absorption concentration has arisen the mind having once interrupted the flow of the lifecontinuum carries on with a stream of profitable impulsion for a whole night and for a whole day just as a healthy man after rising from his seat could stand for a whole day
 The arousing of the counterpart sign which arises together with access concentration is very difficult
Therefore if he is able to arrive at absorption in that same session by extending the sign it is good
If not then he must guard the sign diligently as if it were the foetus of a Wheelturning Monarch 
So guard the sign nor count the cost And what is gained will not be lost
Who fails to have this guard maintained Will lose each time what he has gained
Herein the way of guarding it is this
 Abode resort and speech and person The food the climate
 and the posture Eschew these seven different kinds Whenever found unsuitable
But cultivate the suitable For one perchance so doing finds
He need not wait too long until Absorption shall his wish fulfil
 Herein an abode is unsuitable if while he lives in it the unarisen sign does not arise in him or is lost when it arises and where unestablished mindfulness fails to become established and the unconcentrated mind fails to become concentrated
That is suitable in which the sign arises and becomes confirmed in which mindfulness becomes established and the mind becomes concentrated as in the Elder PadhāniyaTissa resident at Nāgapabbata
So if a monastery has many abodes he can try them one by one living in each for three days and stay on where his mind becomes unified
For it was due to suitability of abode that five hundred bhikkhus reached Arahantship while still dwelling in the Lesser Nāga Cave in Tambapaṇṇi Island after apprehending their meditation subject there
There is no counting the stream enterers who have reached Arahantship there after reaching the noble plane elsewhere
so too in the monastery of Cittalapabbata and others
 An almsresort village lying to the north or south of the lodging not too far within one kosa and a half and where alms food is easily obtained is suitable
The opposite kind is unsuitable
 Speech that included in the thirtytwo kinds of aimless talk is unsuitable for it leads to the disappearance of the sign
But talk based on the ten examples of talk is suitable though even that should be discussed with moderation
 Person one not given to aimless talk who has the special qualities of virtue etc by acquaintanceship with whom the unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or the concentrated mind becomes more so is suitable
One who is much concerned with his body who is addicted to aimless talk is unsuitable
for he only creates disturbances like muddy water added to clear water And it was owing to one such as this that the attainments of the young bhikkhu who lived at Koṭapabbata vanished not to mention the sign
 Food Sweet food suits one sour food another
 Climate a cool climate suits one a warm one another
So when he finds that by using certain food or by living in a certain climate he is comfortable or his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind becomes more so then that food or that climate is suitable
Any other food or climate is unsuitable
 Postures walking suits one standing or sitting or lying down suits another
So he should try them like the abode for three days each and that posture is suitable in which his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind becomes more so
Any other should be understood as unsuitable
So he should avoid the seven unsuitable kinds and cultivate the suitable
For when he practices in this way assiduously cultivating the sign then he need not wait too long until absorption shall his wish fulfil 
However if this does not happen while he is practicing in this way then he should have recourse to the ten kinds of skill in absorption
Here is the method Skill in absorption needs to be dealt with in ten aspects making the basis clean maintaining balanced faculties skill in the sign he exerts the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted he restrains the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained he encourages the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged he looks on at the mind with equanimity when it should be looked on at with equanimity avoidance of unconcentrated persons cultivation of concentrated persons resoluteness upon that 
 Herein making the basis clean is cleansing the internal and the external basis
For when his head hair nails and body hair are long or when the body is soaked with sweat then the internal basis is unclean and unpurified
But when an old dirty smelly robe is worn or when the lodging is dirty then the external basis is unclean and unpurified
When the internal and external bases are unclean then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness concomitants that arise is unpurified like the light of a lamps flame that arises with an unpurified lampbowl wick and oil as its support
formations do not become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with unpurified knowledge and when he devotes himself to his meditation subject it does not come to growth increase and fulfilment
But when the internal and external bases are clean then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants that arise is clean and purified like the light of a lamps flame that arises with a purified lamp bowl wick and oil as its support
formations become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with purified knowledge and as he devotes himself to his meditation subject it comes to growth increase and fulfilment
 Maintaining balanced faculties is equalizing the five faculties of faith and the rest
For if his faith faculty is strong and the others weak then the energy faculty cannot perform its function of exerting the mindfulness faculty its function of establishing the concentration faculty its function of not distracting and the understanding faculty its function of seeing So in that case the faith faculty should be modified either by reviewing the individual essences of the states concerned that is the objects of attention or by not giving them attention in the way in which the faith faculty became too strong
And this is illustrated by the story of the Elder Vakkali 
Then if the energy faculty is too strong the faith faculty cannot perform its function of resolving nor can the rest of the faculties perform their several functions So in that case the energy faculty should be modified by developing tranquillity and so on
And this should be illustrated by the story of the Elder Soṇa 
So too with the rest for it should be understood that when anyone of them is too strong the others cannot perform their several functions
 However what is particularly recommended is balancing faith with understanding and concentration with energy
For one strong in faith and weak in understanding has confidence uncritically and groundlessly
One strong in understanding and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as hard to cure as one sick of a disease caused by medicine
With the balancing of the two a man has confidence only when there are grounds for it
Then idleness overpowers one strong in concentration and weak in energy since concentration favours idleness
Agitation overpowers one strong in energy and weak in concentration since energy favours agitation
But concentration coupled with energy cannot lapse into idleness
and energy coupled with concentration cannot lapse into agitation So these two should be balanced
for absorption comes with the balancing of the two
 Again concentration and faith should be balanced One working on concentration needs strong faith
since it is with such faith and confidence that he reaches absorption
Then there is balancing of concentration and understanding One working on concentration needs strong unification
since that is how he reaches absorption
and one working on insight needs strong understanding
since that is how he reaches penetration of characteristics
but with the balancing of the two he reaches absorption as well
 Strong mindfulness however is needed in all instances
for mindfulness protects the mind from lapsing into agitation through faith energy and understanding which favour agitation and from lapsing into idleness through concentration which favours idleness So it is as desirable in all instances as a seasoning of salt in all sauces as a prime minister in all the kings business
Hence it is said in the commentaries  And mindfulness has been called universal by the Blessed One
For what reason
Because the mind has mindfulness as its refuge and mindfulness is manifested as protection and there is no exertion and restraint of the mind without mindfulness 
 Skill in the sign is skill in producing the as yet unproduced sign of unification of mind through the earth kasiṇa etc and it is skill in developing the sign when produced and skill in protecting the sign when obtained by development The last is what is intended here
 How does he exert the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted
When his mind is slack with overlaxness of energy etc then instead of developing the three enlightenment factors beginning with tranquillity he should develop those beginning with investigationofstates
For this is said by the Blessed One
Bhikkhus suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up and he put wet grass on it put wet cowdung on it put wet sticks on it sprinkled it with water and scattered dust on it would that man be able to make the small fire burn up
No venerable sir
So too bhikkhus when the mind is slack that is not the time to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor or the equanimity enlightenment factor
Why is that
Because a slack mind cannot well be roused by those states
When the mind is slack that is the time to develop the investigationofstates enlightenment factor the energy enlightenment factor and the happiness enlightenment factor
Why is that
Because a slack mind can well be roused by those states
Bhikkhus suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up and he put dry grass on it put dry cowdung on it put dry sticks on it blew on it with his mouth and did not scatter dust on it would that man be able to make that small fire burn up
Yes venerable sir 
 And here the development of the investigationofstates enlightenment factor etc should be understood as the nutriment for each one respectively
for this is said
Bhikkhus there are profitable and unprofitable states reprehensible and blameless states inferior and superior states dark and bright states the counterpart of each other
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen investigationofstates enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen investigationofstates enlightenment factor
Likewise Bhikkhus there is the element of initiative the element of launching and the element of persistence
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen energy enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen energy enlightenment factors
Likewise Bhikkhus there are states productive of the happiness enlightenment factor
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen happiness enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen happiness enlightenment factor 
 Herein wise attention given to the profitable etc is attention occurring in penetration of individual essences and of the three general characteristics
Wise attention given to the element of initiative etc is attention occurring in the arousing of the element of initiative and so on
Herein initial energy is called the element of initiative
The element of launching is stronger than that because it launches out from idleness
The element of persistence is still stronger than that because it goes on persisting in successive later stages
States productive of the happiness enlightenment factor is a name for happiness itself
and attention that arouses that is wise attention
There are besides seven things that lead to the arising of the investigation ofstates enlightenment factor asking questions making the basis clean balancing the faculties avoidance of persons without understanding cultivation of persons with understanding reviewing the field for the exercise of profound knowledge resoluteness upon that investigation of states
 Eleven things lead to the arising of the energy enlightenment factor reviewing the fearfulness of the states of loss such as the hell realms etc seeing benefit in obtaining the mundane and supramundane distinctions dependent on energy reviewing the course of the journey to be travelled thus The path taken by the Buddhas Paccekabuddhas and the great disciples has to be taken by me and it cannot be taken by an idler being a credit to the alms food by producing great fruit for the givers reviewing the greatness of the Master thus My Master praises the energetic and this unsurpassable Dispensation that is so helpful to us is honoured in the practice not otherwise reviewing the greatness of the heritage thus It is the great heritage called the Good Dhamma that is to be acquired by me and it cannot be acquired by an idler removing stiffness and torpor by attention to perception of light change of postures frequenting the open air etc avoidance of idle persons cultivation of energetic persons reviewing the right endeavours resoluteness upon that energy
 Eleven things lead to the arising of the happiness enlightenment factor the recollections of the Buddha of the Dhamma of the Sangha of virtue of generosity and of deities the recollection of peace avoidance of rough persons cultivation of refined persons reviewing encouraging discourses resoluteness upon that happiness
So by arousing these things in these ways he develops the investigationof states enlightenment factor and the others
This is how he exerts the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted
 How does he restrain the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained
When his mind is agitated through overenergeticness etc then instead of developing the three enlightenment factors beginning with investigationof states he should develop those beginning with tranquillity
for this is said by the Blessed One
Bhikkhus suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire and he put dry grass on it  and did not scatter dust on it would that man be able to extinguish that great mass of fire
No venerable sir
So too bhikkhus when the mind is agitated that is not the time to develop the investigationofstates enlightenment factor the energy enlightenment factor or the happiness enlightenment factor
Why is that
Because an agitated mind cannot well be quieted by those states
When the mind is agitated that is the time to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor and the equanimity enlightenment factor
Why is that
Because an agitated mind can well be quieted by those states 
Bhikkhus suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire and he put wet grass on it  and scattered dust on it would that man be able to extinguish that great mass of fire
Yes venerable sir 
 And here the development of the tranquillity enlightenment factor etc should be understood as the nutriment for each one respectively
for this is said
Bhikkhus there is bodily tranquillity and mental tranquillity
 Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen tranquillity enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen tranquillity enlightenment factor
Likewise Bhikkhus there is the sign of serenity the sign of nondiversion
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen concentration enlightenment factor or it leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen concentration enlightenment factor
Likewise Bhikkhus there are states productive of the equanimity enlightenment factor
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen equanimity enlightenment factor or it leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen equanimity enlightenment factor 
Herein wise attention given to the three instances is attention occurring in arousing tranquillity etc by observing the way in which they arose in him earlier
The sign of serenity is a term for serenity itself
and nondiversion is a term for that too in the sense of nondistraction
There are besides seven things that lead to the arising of the tranquillity enlightenment factor using superior food living in a good climate maintaining a pleasant posture keeping to the middle avoidance of violent persons cultivation of persons tranquil in body resoluteness upon that tranquillity
Eleven things lead to the arising of the concentration enlightenment factor making the basis clean skill in the sign balancing the faculties restraining the mind on occasion exerting the mind on occasion encouraging the listless mind by means of faith and a sense of urgency looking on with equanimity at what is occurring rightly avoidance of unconcentrated persons cultivation of concentrated persons reviewing of the jhānas and liberations resoluteness upon that concentration
Five things lead to the arising of the equanimity enlightenment factor maintenance of neutrality towards living beings maintenance of neutrality towards formations  avoidance of persons who show favouritism towards beings and formations cultivation of persons who maintain neutrality towards beings and formations resoluteness upon that equanimity
So by arousing these things in these ways he develops the tranquillity enlightenment factor as well as the others
This is how he restrains the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained
 How does he encourage the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged
When his mind is listless owing to sluggishness in the exercise of understanding or to failure to attain the bliss of peace then he should stimulate it by reviewing the eight grounds for a sense of urgency
These are the four namely birth aging sickness and death with the suffering of the states of loss as the fifth and also the suffering in the past rooted in the round of rebirths the suffering in the future rooted in the round of rebirths and the suffering in the present rooted in the search for nutriment
And he creates confidence by recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
This is how he encourages the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged
 How does he look on at the mind with equanimity on an occasion when it should be looked on at with equanimity
When he is practicing in this way and his mind follows the road of serenity occurs evenly on the object and is unidle unagitated and not listless then he is not interested to exert or restrain or encourage it he is like a charioteer when the horses are progressing evenly
This is how he looks on at the mind with equanimity on an occasion when it should be looked on at with equanimity
 Avoidance of unconcentrated persons is keeping far away from persons who have never trodden the way of renunciation who are busy with many affairs and whose hearts are distracted
 Cultivation of concentrated persons is approaching periodically persons who have trodden the way of renunciation and obtained concentration
 Resoluteness upon that is the state of being resolute upon concentration the meaning is giving concentration importance tending leaning and inclining to concentration
This is how the tenfold skill in concentration should be undertaken

Any man who acquires this sign This tenfold skill will need to heed
In order for absorption to gain Thus achieving his bolder goal
But if in spite of his efforts No result comes that might requite
His work still a wise wight persists Never this task relinquishing
Since a tiro if he gives up Thinking not to continue in
The task never gains distinction Here no matter how small at all
A man wise in temperament Notices how his mind inclines
Energy and serenity Always he couples each to each
Now his mind seeing that it holds back He prods now the restraining rein
Tightening seeing it pull too hard Guiding with even pace the race
Wellcontrolled bees get the pollen Wellbalanced efforts meet to treat
Leaves thread and ships and oiltubes too Gain thus not otherwise the prize
Let him set aside this lax Also this agitated state
Steering here his mind at the sign As the bee and the rest suggest
Here is the explanation of the meaning When a too clever bee learns that a flower on a tree is blooming it sets out hurriedly overshoots the mark turns back and arrives when the pollen is finished
and another not clever enough bee who sets out with too slow a speed arrives when the pollen is finished too
but a clever bee sets out with balanced speed arrives with ease at the cluster of flowers takes as much pollen as it pleases and enjoys the honeydew
Again when a surgeons pupils are being trained in the use of the scalpel on a lotus leaf in a dish of water one who is too clever applies the scalpel hurriedly and either cuts the lotus leaf in two or pushes it under the water
and another who is not clever enough does not even dare to touch it with the scalpel for fear of cutting it in two or pushing it under
but one who is clever shows the scalpel stroke on it by means of a balanced effort and being good at his craft he is rewarded on such occasions
 Again when the king announces Anyone who can draw out a spiders thread four fathoms long shall receive four thousand one man who is too clever breaks the spiders thread here and there by pulling it hurriedly
and another who is not clever enough does not dare to touch it with his hand for fear of breaking it
but a clever man pulls it out starting from the end with a balanced effort winds it on a stick and so wins the prize
Again a too clever skipper hoists full sails in a high wind and sends his ship adrift
and another not clever enough skipper lowers his sails in a light wind and remains where he is
but a clever skipper hoists full sails in a light wind takes in half his sails in a high wind and so arrives safely at his desired destination
Again when a teacher says Anyone who fills the oiltube without spilling any oil will win a prize one who is too clever fills it hurriedly out of greed for the prize and he spills the oil
and another who is not clever enough does not dare to pour the oil at all for fear of spilling it
but one who is clever fills it with a balanced effort and wins the prize
Just as in these five similes so too when the sign arises one bhikkhu forces his energy thinking I shall soon reach absorption Then his mind lapses into agitation because of his minds overexerted energy and he is prevented from reaching absorption
Another who sees the defect in overexertion slacks off his energy thinking What is absorption to me now Then his mind lapses into idleness because of his minds too lax energy and he too is prevented from reaching absorption
Yet another who frees his mind from idleness even when it is only slightly idle and from agitation when only slightly agitated confronting the sign with balanced effort reaches absorption One should be like the lastnamed
It was with reference to this meaning that it was said above
Wellcontrolled bees get the pollen Wellbalanced efforts meet to treat
Leaves thread and ships and oiltubes too Gain thus not otherwise the prize
Let him set aside then this lax Also this agitated state
Steering here his mind at the sign As the bee and the rest suggest
 So while he is guiding his mind in this way confronting the sign then knowing Now absorption will succeed there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the occurrence of consciousness as lifecontinuum and evoked by the constant repeating of earth earth
After that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object
the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere The rest are of the sense sphere
but they have stronger applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss and unification of mind than the normal ones They are called preliminary work consciousnesses because they are the preliminary work for absorption and they are also called access consciousnesses because of their nearness to absorption because they happen in its neighbourhood just as the words village access and city access are used for a place near to a village etc and they are also called conformity consciousnesses because they conform to those that precede the preliminary work consciousnesses and to the absorption that follows
And the last of these is also called change oflineage because it transcends the limited sensesphere lineage and brings into being the exalted finematerialsphere lineage
 But omitting repetitions then either the first is the preliminary work the second access the third conformity and the fourth changeoflineage
or else the first is access the second conformity and the third changeof lineage Then either the fourth in the latter case or the fifth in the former case is the absorption consciousness
For it is only either the fourth or the fifth that fixes in absorption And that is according as there is swift or sluggish direct knowledge
Beyond that impulsion lapses
and the lifecontinuum takes over
But the Abhidhamma scholar the Elder Godatta quoted this text Preceding profitable states are a condition as repetition condition for succeeding profitable states  Adding It is owing to the repetition condition that each succeeding state is strong so there is absorption also in the sixth and seventh  That is rejected by the commentaries with the remark that it is merely that elders opinion
adding that It is only either in the fourth or the fifth that there is absorption
Beyond that impulsion lapses It is said to do so because of nearness of the lifecontinuum
And that has been stated in this way after consideration so it cannot be rejected
For just as a man who is running towards a precipice and wants to stop cannot do so when he has his foot on the edge but falls over it so there can be no fixing in absorption in the sixth or the seventh because of the nearness to the lifecontinuum
That is why it should be understood that there is absorption only in the fourth or the fifth
 But that absorption is only of a single conscious moment
For there are seven instances in which the normal extent of the cognitive series does not apply They are in the cases of the first absorption the mundane kinds of direct knowledge the four paths fruition next after the path lifecontinuum jhāna in the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception as condition for cessation of perception and feeling and the fruition attainment in one emerging from cessation
Here the fruition next after the path does not exceed three consciousnesses in number
the consciousnesses of the base consisting of neither perception nor non perception as condition for cessation do not exceed two in number there is no measure of the number of consciousnesses in the lifecontinuum in the fine material and immaterial kinds of becoming
In the remaining instances the number of consciousnesses is one only
So absorption is of a single consciousness moment
After that it lapses into the lifecontinuum
Then the lifecontinuum is interrupted by adverting for the purpose of reviewing the jhāna next to which comes the reviewing of the jhāna
THE FIRST JHNA At this point Quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with happiness and bliss born of seclusion 
and so he has attained the first jhāna which abandons five factors possesses five factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa
 Herein quite secluded from sense desires means having secluded himself from having become without having gone away from sense desires
Now this word quite should be understood to have the meaning of absoluteness
Precisely because it has the meaning of absoluteness it shows how on the actual occasion of entering upon and dwelling in the first jhāna sense desires as well as being nonexistent then are the first jhānas contrary opposite and it also shows that the arrival takes place only through the letting go of sense desires
How
When absoluteness is introduced thus quite secluded from sense desires what is expressed is this sense desires are certainly incompatible with this jhāna when they exist it does not occur just as when there is darkness there is no lamplight
and it is only by letting go of them that it is reached just as the further bank is reached only by letting go of the near bank
That is why absoluteness is introduced
Here it might be asked But why is this word quite mentioned only in the first phrase and not in the second How is this might he enter upon and dwell in the first jhāna even when not secluded from unprofitable things
It should not be regarded in that way
It is mentioned in the first phrase as the escape from them
for this jhāna is the escape from sense desires since it surmounts the sensedesire element and since it is incompatible with greed for sense desires
according as it is said The escape from sense desires is this that is to say renunciation 
But in the second phrase the word eva should be adduced and taken as said as in the passage Bhikkhus only here is there an ascetic here a second ascetic 
For it is impossible to enter upon and dwell in jhāna unsecluded also from unprofitable things in other words the hindrances other than that sense desire
So this word must be read in both phrases thus Quite secluded from sense desires quite secluded from unprofitable things
And although the word secluded as a general term includes all kinds of seclusion that is to say seclusion by substitution of opposites etc and bodily seclusion etc still only the three namely bodily seclusion mental seclusion and seclusion by suppression should be regarded here
 But this term sense desires should be regarded as including all kinds that is to say sense desires as object as given in the Niddesa in the passage beginning What are sense desires as object They are agreeable visible objects   and the sense desires as defilement given there too and in the Vibhaṅga thus Zeal as sense desire  greed as sense desire zeal and greed as sense desire thinking as sense desire greed as sense desire thinking and greed as sense desire 
That being so the words quite secluded from sense desires properly mean quite secluded from sense desires as object and express bodily seclusion
while the words secluded from unprofitable things properly mean secluded from sense desires as defilement or from all unprofitable things and express mental seclusion
And in this case giving up of pleasure in sense desires is indicated by the first since it only expresses seclusion from sense desires as object while acquisition of pleasure in renunciation is indicated by the second since it expresses seclusion from sense desire as defilement
And with sense desires as object and sense desires as defilement expressed in this way it should also be recognized that the abandoning of the objective basis for defilement is indicated by the first of these two phrases and the abandoning of the subjective defilement by the second
also that the giving up of the cause of cupidity is indicated by the first and the giving up of the cause of stupidity by the second
also that the purification of ones occupation is indicated by the first and the educating of ones inclination by the second
This firstly is the method here when the words from sense desires are treated as referring to sense desires as object
But if they are treated as referring to sense desires as defilement then it is simply just zeal for sense desires in the various forms of zeal  greed  etc that is intended as sense desires 
And although that lust is also included by the word unprofitable it is nevertheless stated separately in the Vibhaṅga in the way beginning Herein what are sense desires Zeal as sense desire  because of its incompatibility with jhāna
Or alternatively it is mentioned in the first phrase because it is sense desire as defilement and in the second phrase because it is included in the unprofitable
And because this lust has various forms therefore from sense desires is said instead of from sense desire 
 And although there may be unprofitableness in other states as well nevertheless only the hindrances are mentioned subsequently in the Vibhaṅga thus Herein what states are unprofitable Lust   etc in order to show their opposition to and incompatibility with the jhāna factors
For the hindrances are the contrary opposites of the jhāna factors what is meant is that the jhāna factors are incompatible with them eliminate them abolish them
And it is said accordingly in the Peṭaka  Concentration is incompatible with lust happiness with ill will applied thought with stiffness and torpor bliss with agitation and worry and sustained thought with uncertainty 
 So in this case it should be understood that seclusion by suppression of lust is indicated by the phrase quite secluded from sense desires
and seclusion by suppression of all five hindrances by the phrase secluded from unprofitable things But omitting repetitions that of lust is indicated by the first and that of the remaining hindrances by the second
Similarly with the three unprofitable roots that of greed which has the five cords of sense desire as its province is indicated by the first and that of hate and delusion which have as their respective provinces the various grounds for annoyance  etc by the second
Or with the states consisting of the floods etc that of the flood of sense desires of the bond of sense desires of the canker of sense desires of sensedesire clinging of the bodily tie of covetousness and of the fetter of greed for sense desires is indicated by the first and that of the remaining floods bonds cankers clingings ties and fetters is indicated by the second
Again that of craving and of what is associated with craving is indicated by the first and that of ignorance and of what is associated with ignorance is indicated by the second
Furthermore that of the eight thought arisings associated with greed is indicated by the first and that of the remaining kinds of unprofitable thoughtarisings is indicated by the second
This in the first place is the explanation of the meaning of the words quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things 
So far the factors abandoned by the jhāna have been shown And now in order to show the factors associated with it which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought is said
Herein applied thinking is applied thought  hitting upon is what is meant
It has the characteristic of directing the mind on to an object  Its function is to strike at and thresh
for the meditator is said in virtue of it to have the object struck at by applied thought threshed by applied thought
It is manifested as the leading of the mind onto an object
Sustained thinking is sustained thought  continued sustainment  is what is meant
It has the characteristic of continued pressure on the object Its function is to keep conascent mental states occupied with that It is manifested as keeping consciousness anchored on that object
And though sometimes not separate applied thought is the first impact of the mind in the sense that it is both gross and inceptive like the striking of a bell
Sustained thought is the act of keeping the mind anchored in the sense that it is subtle with the individual essence of continued pressure like the ringing of the bell
Applied thought intervenes being the interference of consciousness at the time of first arousing thought like a birds spreading out its wings when about to soar into the air and like a bees diving towards a lotus when it is minded to follow up the scent of it
The behaviour of sustained thought is quiet being the near noninterference of consciousness like the birds planing with outspread wings after soaring into the air and like the bees buzzing above the lotus after it has dived towards it
 In the commentary to the Book of Twos this is said Applied thought occurs as a state of directing the mind onto an object like the movement of a large bird taking off into the air by engaging the air with both wings and forcing them downwards For it causes absorption by being unified
Sustained thought occurs with the individual essence of continued pressure like the birds movement when it is using its wings for the purpose of keeping hold on the air For it keeps pressing the object That fits in with the latters occurrence as anchoring
This difference of theirs becomes evident in the first and second jhānas in the fivefold reckoning
Furthermore applied thought is like the hand that grips firmly and sustained thought is like the hand that rubs when one grips a tarnished metal dish firmly with one hand and rubs it with powder and oil and a woollen pad with the other hand
Likewise when a potter has spun his wheel with a stroke on the stick and is making a dish  his supporting hand is like applied thought and his hand that moves back and forth is like sustained thought
Likewise when one is drawing a circle the pin that stays fixed down in the centre is like applied thought which directs onto the object and the pin that revolves round it is like sustained thought which continuously presses
So this jhāna occurs together with this applied thought and this sustained thought and it is called accompanied by applied and sustained thought as a tree is called accompanied by flowers and fruits
But in the Vibhaṅga the teaching is given in terms of a person in the way beginning He is possessed fully possessed of this applied thought and this sustained thought 
The meaning should be regarded in the same way there too
Born of seclusion here secludedness is seclusion  the meaning is disappearance of hindrances
Or alternatively it is secluded  thus it is seclusion the meaning is the collection of states associated with the jhāna is secluded from hindrances
Born of seclusion is born of or in that kind of seclusion
Happiness and bliss it refreshes  thus it is happiness 
It has the characteristic of endearing  Its function is to refresh the body and the mind or its function is to pervade  It is manifested as elation
But it is of five kinds as minor happiness momentary happiness showering happiness uplifting happiness and pervading happiness
Herein minor happiness is only able to raise the hairs on the body
Momentary happiness is like flashes of lightning at different moments
Showering happiness breaks over the body again and again like waves on the sea shore
 Uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body and make it spring up into the air
For this was what happened to the Elder MahāTissa resident at Puṇṇavallika He went to the shrine terrace on the evening of the fullmoon day Seeing the moonlight he faced in the direction of the Great Shrine at Anurādhapura thinking At this very hour the four assemblies are worshipping at the Great Shrine By means of objects formerly seen there he aroused uplifting happiness with the Enlightened One as object and he rose into the air like a painted ball bounced off a plastered floor and alighted on the terrace of the Great Shrine
 And this was what happened to the daughter of a clan in the village of Vattakālaka near the Girikaṇḍaka Monastery when she sprang up into the air owing to strong uplifting happiness with the Enlightened One as object
As her parents were about to go to the monastery in the evening it seems in order to hear the Dhamma  they told her My dear you are expecting a child you cannot go out at an unsuitable time We shall hear the Dhamma and gain merit for you  So they went out
And though she wanted to go too she could not well object to what they said She stepped out of the house onto a balcony and stood looking at the kāsacetiya Shrine at Girikaṇḍaka lit by the moon She saw the offering of lamps at the shrine and the four communities as they circumambulated it to the right after making their offerings of flowers and perfumes and she heard the sound of the massed recital by the Community of Bhikkhus
Then she thought How lucky they are to be able to go to the monastery and wander round such a shrine terrace and listen to such sweet preaching of Dhamma Seeing the shrine as a mound of pearls and arousing uplifting happiness
she sprang up into the air and before her parents arrived she came down from the air into the shrine terrace where she paid homage and stood listening to the Dhamma
When her parents arrived they asked her What road did you come by
She said I came through the air not by the road and when they told her My dear those whose cankers are destroyed come through the air But how did you come  she replied As I was standing looking at the shrine in the moonlight a strong sense of happiness arose in me with the Enlightened One as its object
Then I knew no more whether I was standing or sitting but only that I was springing up into the air with the sign that I had grasped and I came to rest on this shrine terrace 
So uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body make it spring up into the air
 But when pervading happiness arises the whole body is completely pervaded like a filled bladder like a rock cavern invaded by a huge inundation
Now this fivefold happiness when conceived and matured perfects the twofold tranquillity that is bodily and mental tranquillity
When tranquillity is conceived and matured it perfects the twofold bliss that is bodily and mental bliss
When bliss is conceived and matured it perfects the threefold concentration that is momentary concentration access concentration and absorption concentration
Of these what is intended in this context by happiness is pervading happiness which is the root of absorption and comes by growth into association with absorption
 But as to the other word pleasing is bliss  Or alternatively it thoroughly devours  consumes  bodily and mental affliction thus it is bliss  It has gratifying as its characteristic Its function is to intensify associated states It is manifested as aid
And wherever the two are associated happiness is the contentedness at getting a desirable object
and bliss is the actual experiencing of it when got
Where there is happiness there is bliss 
but where there is bliss there is not necessarily happiness
Happiness is included in the formations aggregate
bliss is included in the feeling aggregate
If a man exhausted in a desert saw or heard about a pond on the edge of a wood he would have happiness
if he went into the woods shade and used the water he would have bliss
And it should be understood that this is said because they are obvious on such occasions
 Accordingly this happiness and this bliss are of this jhāna or in this jhāna so in this way this jhāna is qualified by the words with happiness and bliss and also born of seclusion
Or alternatively the words happiness and bliss can be taken as the happiness and the bliss independently like the Dhamma and the Discipline 
and so then it can be taken as seclusionborn happinessandbliss of this jhāna or in this jhāna so in this way it is the happiness and bliss rather than the jhāna that are born of seclusion
For just as the words born of seclusion can as at be taken as qualifying the word jhāna so too they can be taken here as at as qualifying the expression happiness and bliss and then that total expression is predicated of this jhāna So it is also correct to call happinessandbliss bornofseclusion a single expression
In the Vibhaṅga it is stated in the way beginning This bliss accompanied by this happiness 
The meaning should be regarded in the same way there too
 First jhāna this will be explained below 
Enters upon  arrives at reaches is what is meant
or else taking it as makes enter  then producing is what is meant
In the Vibhaṅga this is said Enters upon the gaining the regaining the reaching the arrival at the touching the realizing of the entering upon 
the meaning of which should be regarded in the same way
 And dwells in  by becoming possessed of jhāna of the kind described above through dwelling in a posture favourable to that jhāna he produces a posture a procedure a keeping an enduring a lasting a behaviour a dwelling of the person
For this is said in the Vibhaṅga Dwells in poses proceeds keeps endures lasts behaves dwells hence dwells is said 
Now it was also said above which abandons five factors possesses five factors  Herein the abandoning of the five factors should be understood as the abandoning of these five hindrances namely lust ill will stiffness and torpor agitation and worry and uncertainty
for no jhāna arises until these have been abandoned
and so they are called the factors of abandoning
For although other unprofitable things too are abandoned at the moment of jhāna still only these are specifically obstructive to jhāna
 The mind affected through lust by greed for varied objective fields does not become concentrated on an object consisting in unity
or being overwhelmed by lust it does not enter on the way to abandoning the sensedesire element
When pestered by ill will towards an object it does not occur uninterruptedly
When overcome by stiffness and torpor it is unwieldy
When seized by agitation and worry it is unquiet and buzzes about
When stricken by uncertainty it fails to mount the way to accomplish the attainment of jhāna
So it is these only that are called factors of abandoning because they are specifically obstructive to jhāna
 But applied thought directs the mind onto the object sustained thought keeps it anchored there Happiness produced by the success of the effort refreshes the mind whose effort has succeeded through not being distracted by those hindrances and bliss intensifies it for the same reason
Then unification aided by this directing onto this anchoring this refreshing and this intensifying evenly and rightly centres the mind with its remaining associated states on the object consisting in unity Consequently possession of five factors should be understood as the arising of these five namely applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss and unification of mind
 For it is when these are arisen that jhāna is said to be arisen
which is why they are called the five factors of possession
Therefore it should not be assumed that the jhāna is something other which possesses them
But just as The army with the four factors and Music with the five factors and The path with the eight factors  are stated simply in terms of their factors so this too should be understood as stated simply in terms of its factors when it is said to have five factors or possess five factors 
 And while these five factors are present also at the moment of access and are stronger in access than in normal consciousness
they are still stronger here than in access and acquire the characteristic of the finematerial sphere
For applied thought arises here directing the mind on to the object in an extremely lucid manner
and sustained thought does so pressing the object very hard
and the happiness and bliss pervade the entire body
Hence it is said And there is nothing of his whole body not permeated by the happiness and bliss born of seclusion 
And unification too arises in the complete contact with the object that the surface of a boxs lid has with the surface of its base This is how they differ from the others
 Although unification of mind is not actually listed among these factors in the summary version beginning which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought  nevertheless it is mentioned later in the Vibhaṅga as follows Jhāna it is applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss unification and so it is a factor too
for the intention with which the Blessed One gave the summary is the same as that with which he gave the exposition that follows it
 Is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics  the goodness in three ways is in the beginning middle and end
The possession of the ten characteristics should be understood as the characteristics of the beginning middle and end too
Here is the text
 Of the first jhāna purification of the way is the beginning intensification of equanimity is the middle and satisfaction is the end Of the first jhāna purification of the way is the beginning how many characteristics has the beginning
The beginning has three characteristics the mind is purified of obstructions to that jhāna because it is purified the mind makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity because it has made way the mind enters into that state
And it is since the mind becomes purified of obstructions and through being purified makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity and having made way enters into that state
that the purification of the way is the beginning of the first jhāna These are the three characteristics of the beginning
Hence it is said The first jhāna is good in the beginning which possesses three characteristics 
 Of the first jhāna intensification of equanimity is the middle how many characteristics has the middle
The middle has three characteristics He now looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity he looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity
And in that he now looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified and looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity and looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity
that intensification of equanimity is the middle of the first jhāna These are the three characteristics of the middle
Hence it is said The first jhāna is good in the middle which possesses three characteristics 
 Of the first jhāna satisfaction is the end how many characteristics has the end
The end has four characteristics The satisfaction in the sense that there was nonexcess of any of the states arisen therein and the satisfaction in the sense that the faculties had a single function and the satisfaction in the sense that the appropriate energy was effective and the satisfaction in the sense of repetition
are the satisfaction in the end of the first jhāna These are the four characteristics of the end
Hence it is said The first jhāna is good in the end which possesses four characteristics 
 Herein purification of the way is access together with its concomitants
Intensification of equanimity is absorption
Satisfaction is reviewing So some comment
But it is said in the text The mind arrived at unity enters into purification of the way is intensified in equanimity and is satisfied by knowledge  and therefore it is from the standpoint within actual absorption that purification of the way firstly should be understood as the approach with intensification of equanimity as the function of equanimity consisting in specific neutrality and satisfaction as the manifestation of clarifying knowledges function in accomplishing nonexcess of states
How
 Firstly in a cycle of consciousness in which absorption arises the mind becomes purified from the group of defilements called hindrances that are an obstruction to jhāna
Being devoid of obstruction because it has been purified it makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity
Now it is the absorption concentration itself occurring evenly that is called the sign of serenity
But the consciousness immediately before that reaches that state by way of change in a single continuity  and so it is said that it makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity And it is said that it enters into that state by approaching it through having made way for it
That is why in the first place purification of the way while referring to aspects existing in the preceding consciousness should nevertheless be understood as the approach at the moment of the first jhānas actual arising
 Secondly when he has more interest in purifying since there is no need to repurify what has already been purified thus it is said that he looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified
And when he has no more interest in concentrating again what has already made way for serenity by arriving at the state of serenity it is said that he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity
And when he has no more interest in again causing appearance of unity in what has already appeared as unity through abandonment of its association with defilement in making way for serenity it is said that he looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity
That is why intensification of equanimity should be understood as the function of equanimity that consists in specific neutrality
 And lastly when equanimity was thus intensified the states called concentration and understanding produced there occurred coupled together without either one exceeding the other And also the five faculties beginning with faith occurred with the single function of deliverance owing to deliverance from the various defilements And also the energy appropriate to that which was favourable to their state of nonexcess and single function was effective And also its repetition occurs at that moment Now all these four aspects are only produced because it is after seeing with knowledge the various dangers in defilement and advantages in cleansing that satisfiedness purifiedness and clarifiedness ensue accordingly That is the reason why it was said that satisfaction should be understood as the manifestation of clarifying knowledges function in accomplishing nonexcess etc of states 
 Herein satisfaction as a function of knowledge is called the end since the knowledge is evident as due to onlooking equanimity
according as it is said He looks on with complete equanimity at the mind thus exerted then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to equanimity Owing to equanimity the mind is liberated from the many sorts of defilements then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to liberation
Because of being liberated these states come to have a single function
then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to development in the sense of the single function 
 Now as to the words and so he has attained the first jhāna  of the earth kasiṇa  Here it is first because it starts a numerical series also it is first because it arises first
It is called jhāna because of lighting the object and because of burning up opposition 
The disk of earth is called earth kasiṇa in the sense of entirety and the sign acquired with that as its support and also the jhāna acquired in the earthkasiṇa sign are so called too
So that jhāna should be understood as of the earth kasiṇa in this sense
with reference to which it was said above and so he has attained to the first jhāna  of the earth kasiṇa
 When it has been attained in this way the mode of its attainment must be discerned by the meditator as if he were a hairsplitter or a cook
For when a very skilful archer who is working to split a hair actually splits the hair on one occasion he discerns the modes of the position of his feet the bow the bowstring and the arrow thus
I split the hair as I stood thus with the bow thus the bowstring thus the arrow thus
From then on he recaptures those same modes and repeats the splitting of the hair without fail
So too the meditator must discern such modes as that of suitable food etc thus I attained this after eating this food attending on such a person in such a lodging in this posture at this time
In this way when that absorption is lost he will be able to recapture those modes and renew the absorption or while familiarizing himself with it he will be able to repeat that absorption again and again
 And just as when a skilled cook is serving his employer he notices whatever he chooses to eat and from then on brings only that sort and so obtains a reward so too this meditator discerns such modes as that of the food etc at the time of the attaining and he recaptures them and reobtains absorption each time it is lost
So he must discern the modes as a hairsplitter or a cook does
And this has been said by the Blessed One
Bhikkhus suppose a wise clever skilful cook set various kinds of sauces before a king or a kings minister such as sour bitter sharp sweet peppery and unpeppery salty and unsalty sauces
then the wise clever skilful cook learned his masters sign thus today this sauce pleased my master or he held out his hand for this one or he took a lot of this one or he praised this one or today the sour kind pleased my master or he held out his hand for the sour kind or he took a lot of the sour kind or he praised the sour kind  or he praised the unsalty kind
then the wise clever skilful cook is rewarded with clothing and wages and presents
Why is that
Because that wise clever skilful cook learned his masters sign in this way
So too bhikkhus here a wise clever skilful bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body as a body  He dwells contemplating feelings as feelings  consciousness as consciousness  mental objects as mental objects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
As he dwells contemplating mental objects as mental objects his mind becomes concentrated his defilements are abandoned He learns the sign of that
Then that wise clever skilful bhikkhu is rewarded with a happy abiding here and now he is rewarded with mindfulness and full awareness
Why is that
Because that wise clever skilful bhikkhu learned his consciousnesss sign 
 And when he recaptures those modes by apprehending the sign he just succeeds in reaching absorption but not in making it last
It lasts when it is absolutely purified from states that obstruct concentration
 When a bhikkhu enters upon a jhāna without first completely suppressing lust by reviewing the dangers in sense desires etc and without first completely tranquillizing bodily irritability by tranquillizing the body and without first completely removing stiffness and torpor by bringing to mind the elements of initiative etc  and without first completely abolishing agitation and worry by bringing to mind the sign of serenity etc and without first completely purifying his mind of other states that obstruct concentration then that bhikkhu soon comes out of that jhāna again like a bee that has gone into an unpurified hive like a king who has gone into an unclean park
 But when he enters upon a jhāna after first completely purifying his mind of states that obstruct concentration then he remains in the attainment even for a whole day like a bee that has gone into a completely purified hive like a king who has gone into a perfectly clean park
Hence the Ancients said
So let him dispel any sensual lust and resentment
Agitation as well and then torpor and doubt as the fifth
There let him find joy with a heart that is glad in seclusion
Like a king in a garden where all and each corner is clean
 So if he wants to remain long in the jhāna he must enter upon it after first purifying his mind from obstructive states
EXTENSION OF THE SIGN In order to perfect the development of consciousness he should besides extend the counterpart sign according as acquired
Now there are two planes for extension namely access and absorption
for it is possible to extend it on reaching access and on reaching absorption
But the extending should be done consistently in one or the other
which is why it was said he should besides extend the counterpart sign according as acquired
 The way to extend it is thisThe meditator should not extend the sign as a clay bowl or a cake or boiled rice or a creeper or a piece of cloth is extended He should first delimit with his mind successive sizes for the sign according as acquired that is to say one finger two fingers three fingers four fingers and then extend it by the amount delimited just as a ploughman delimits with the plough the area to be ploughed and then ploughs within the area delimited or just as bhikkhus fixing a boundary first observe the marks and then fix it
He should not in fact extend it without having delimited the amount it is to be extended by
After that has been done he can further extend it doing so by delimiting successive boundaries of say a span a ratana  the veranda the surrounding space the monastery and the boundaries of the village the town the district the kingdom and the ocean making the extreme limit the worldsphere or even beyond
 Just as young swans first starting to use their wings soar a little distance at a time and by gradually increasing it eventually reach the presence of the moon and sun so too when a bhikkhu extends the sign by successive delimitations in the way described he can extend it up to the limit of the world sphere or even beyond
 Then that sign appears to him like an ox hide stretched out with a hundred pegs over the earths ridges and hollows river ravines tracts of scrub and thorns and rocky inequalities in any area to which it has been extended
When a beginner has reached the first jhāna in this sign he should enter upon it often without reviewing it much
For the first jhāna factors occur crudely and weakly in one who reviews it much
Then because of that they do not become conditions for higher endeavour
While he is endeavouring for the unfamiliar higher jhāna he falls away from the first jhāna and fails to reach the second
 Hence the Blessed One said
Bhikkhus suppose there were a foolish stupid mountain cow with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains
who thought What if I walked in a direction I never walked in before ate grass I never ate before drank water I never drank before
and without placing her forefoot properly she lifted up her hind foot then she would not walk in the direction she never walked in before or eat the grass she never ate before or drink the water she never drank before
What if I walked in a direction I never walked in before  drank water I never drank before
and also she would not get back safely to the place where she had thought
Why is that
Because that mountain cow was foolish and stupid with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains So too bhikkhus here is a certain foolish stupid bhikkhu with no knowledge of fields and no skill quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things in entering upon and dwelling in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought with happiness and bliss born of seclusion
he does not repeat develop or cultivate that sign or properly establish it He thinks What if with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought I entered upon and dwelt in the second jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of concentration
He is unable with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought to enter upon and dwell in the second jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of concentration
Then he thinks What if quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things I entered upon and dwelt in the first jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of seclusion
He is unable quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things to enter upon and dwell in the first jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of seclusion
This bhikkhu is called one who has slipped between the two who has fallen between the two just like the foolish stupid mountain cow with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains  
 Therefore he should acquire mastery in the five ways first of all with respect to the first jhāna
Herein these are the five kinds of mastery mastery in adverting mastery in attaining mastery in resolving  mastery in emerging and mastery in reviewing
He adverts to the first jhāna where when and for as long as he wishes he has no difficulty in adverting thus it is mastery in adverting
He attains the first jhāna where  he has no difficulty in attaining thus it is mastery in attaining 
and all the rest should be quoted in detail 
 The explanation of the meaning here is this When he emerges from the first jhāna and first of all adverts to the applied thought then next to the adverting that arose interrupting the lifecontinuum either four or five impulsions impel with that applied thought as their object
Then there are two lifecontinuum consciousnesses Then there is adverting with the sustained thought as its object and followed by impulsions in the way just stated When he is able to prolong his conscious process uninterruptedly in this way with the five jhāna factors then his mastery of adverting is successful
But this mastery is found at its acme of perfection in the Blessed Ones Twin Marvel  or for others on the aforesaid occasions
There is no quicker mastery in adverting than that
 The venerable MahāMoggallānas ability to enter upon jhāna quickly as in the taming of the royal nāgaserpent Nandopananda  is called mastery in attaining
 Ability to remain in jhāna for a moment consisting in exactly a finger snap or exactly ten fingersnaps is called mastery in resolving 
Ability to emerge quickly in the same way is called mastery in emerging
 The story of the Elder Buddharakkhita may be told in order to illustrate both these last
Eight years after his admission to the Community that elder was sitting in the midst of thirty thousand bhikkhus possessed of supernormal powers who had gathered to attend upon the sickness of the Elder Mahā Rohanagutta at Therambatthala He saw a royal supaṇṇa swooping down from the sky intending to seize an attendant royal nāgaserpent as he was getting ricegruel accepted for the elder The Elder Buddharakkhita created a rock meanwhile and seizing the royal nāga by the arm he pushed him inside it
The royal supaṇṇa gave the rock a blow and made off
The senior elder remarked Friends if Rakkhita had not been there we should all have been put to shame 
 Mastery in reviewing is described in the same way as mastery in adverting
for the reviewing impulsions are in fact those next to the adverting mentioned there 
 When he has once acquired mastery in these five ways then on emerging from the now familiar first jhāna he can regard the flaws in it in this way This attainment is threatened by the nearness of the hindrances and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the applied and sustained thought He can bring the second jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the first jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the second
 When he has emerged from the first jhāna applied and sustained thought appear gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness while happiness and bliss and unification of mind appear peaceful Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factors and obtaining the peaceful factors knowing now the second jhāna will arise there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the lifecontinuum
After that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere belonging to the second jhāna
The rest are of the sense sphere of the kinds already stated 
THE SECOND JHNA And at this point With the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and dwells in the second jhāna which has internal confidence and singleness of mind without applied thought without sustained thought with happiness and bliss born of concentration 
and so he has attained the second jhāna which abandons two factors possesses three factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa
 Herein with the stilling of applied and sustained thought with the stilling with the surmounting of these two namely applied thought and sustained thought with their nonmanifestation at the moment of the second jhāna is what is meant
Herein although none of the states belonging to the first jhāna exist in the second jhāna
for the contact etc  in the first jhāna are one and here they are another
it should be understood all the same that the phrase with the stilling of applied and sustained thought is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the attaining of the other jhānas beginning with that of the second from the first is effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case
 Internal here ones own internal is intended
but that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too with the words internally in oneself 
And since ones own internal is intended the meaning here is this born in oneself generated in ones own continuity
 Confidence it is faith that is called confidence
The jhāna has confidence because it is associated with confidence
as a cloth has blue colour because it is associated with blue colour
Or alternatively that jhāna is stated to have confidence because it makes the mind confident with the confidence possessed by it and by stilling the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought
And with this conception of the meaning the word construction must be taken as confidence of mind
But with the firstmentioned conception of the meaning the words of mind must be construed with singleness
 Here is the construction of the meaning in that case Unique it comes up  thus it is single  the meaning is it comes up as the superlative the best because it is not overtopped by applied and sustained thought
for the best is called unique in the world
Or it is permissible to say that when deprived of applied and sustained thought it is unique without companion
Or alternatively it evokes associated states thus it is an evoker  the meaning is it arouses
And that is unique in the sense of best and it is an evoker  thus it is a unique evoker  This is a term for concentration
Then since the second jhāna gives existingness to  augments this single thing it gives singleness 
But as this single thing is a minds not a beings or a souls so singleness of mind is said
 It might be asked But does not this faith exist in the first jhāna too and also this concentration with the name of the single thing Then why is only this second jhāna said to have confidence and singleness of mind
It may be replied as follows It is because that first jhāna is not fully confident owing to the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought like water ruffled by ripples and wavelets That is why although faith does exist in it it is not called confidence
And there too concentration is not fully evident because of the lack of full confidence That is why it is not called singleness there
But in this second jhāna faith is strong having got a footing in the absence of the impediments of applied and sustained thought and concentration is also evident through having strong faith as its companion That may be understood as the reason why only this jhāna is described in this way
 But that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too with the words Confidence is faith having faith trust full confidence
Singleness of mind is steadiness of consciousness  right concentration 
And this commentary on the meaning should not be so understood as to conflict with the meaning stated in that way but on the contrary so as to agree and concur with it
 Without applied thought without sustained thought since it has been abandoned by development there is no applied thought in this or of this jhāna thus it is without applied thought
The same explanation applies to sustained thought
Also it is said in the Vibhaṅga So this applied thought and this sustained thought are quieted quietened stilled set at rest set quite at rest done away with quite done away with dried up quite dried up made an end of hence it is said without applied thought without sustained thought 
Here it may be asked Has not this meaning already been established by the words with the stilling of applied and sustained thought
So why is it said again without applied thought without sustained thoughts
It may be replied Yes that meaning has already been established But this does not indicate that meaning Did we not say earlier The phrase with the stilling of applied and sustained thought is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the act of attaining the other jhānas beginning with that of the second from the first is effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case  
 Besides this confidence comes about with the act of stilling not the darkness of defilement but the applied and sustained thought
And the singleness comes about not as in access jhāna with the abandoning of the hindrances nor as in the first jhāna with the manifestation of the factors but with the act of stilling the applied and sustained thought So that first clause indicates the cause of the confidence and singleness
In the same way this jhāna is without applied thought and without sustained thought not as in the third and fourth jhānas or as in eyeconsciousness etc with just absence but with the actual act of stilling the applied and sustained thought So that first clause also indicates the cause of the state without applied and sustained thought it does not indicate the bare absence of applied and sustained thought
The bare absence of applied and sustained thought is indicated by this second clause namely without applied thought without sustained thought
Consequently it needs to be stated notwithstanding that the first has already been stated
 Born of concentration born of the firstjhāna concentration or born of associated concentration is the meaning
Herein although the first was born of associated concentration too still it is only this concentration that is quite worthy to be called concentration because of its complete confidence and extreme immobility due to absence of disturbance by applied and sustained thought So only this jhāna is called born of concentration and that is in order to recommend it
With happiness and bliss is as already explained
Second second in numerical series
Also second because entered upon second
 Then it was also said above which abandons two factors possesses three factors  Herein the abandoning of two factors should be understood as the abandoning of applied thought and sustained thought
But while the hindrances are abandoned at the moment of the access of the first jhāna in the case of this jhāna the applied thought and sustained thought are not abandoned at the moment of its access
It is only at the moment of actual absorption that the jhāna arises without them
Hence they are called its factors of abandoning
 Its possession of three factors should be understood as the arising of the three that is happiness bliss and unification of mind
So when it is said in the Vibhaṅga Jhāna confidence happiness bliss unification of mind  this is said figuratively in order to show that jhāna with its equipment
But excepting the confidence this jhāna has literally three factors qua factors that have attained to the characteristic of lighting 
according as it is said What is jhāna of three factors on that occasion It is happiness bliss unification of mind 
The rest is as in the case of the first jhāna
Once this has been obtained in this way and he has mastery in the five ways already described then on emerging from the now familiar second jhāna he can regard the flaws in it thus This attainment is threatened by the nearness of applied and sustained thought Whatever there is in it of happiness of mental excitement proclaims its grossness  and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the happiness so expressed He can bring the third jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the second jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the third
 When he has emerged from the second jhāna happiness appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness while bliss and unification appear peaceful
Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors knowing now the third jhāna will arise there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the lifecontinuum
After that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere belonging to the third jhāna The rest are of the kinds already stated 
THE THIRD JHNA And at this point With the fading away of happiness as well he dwells in equanimity and mindful and fully aware he feels bliss with his body he enters upon and dwells in the third jhāna on account of which the Noble Ones announce He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful 
and so he has attained the third jhāna which abandons one factor possesses two factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa
Herein with the fading away of happiness as well  fading away is distaste for or surmounting of happiness of the kind already described
But the words as well between the two words pītiyā and virāgā have the meaning of a conjunction they conjoin to them either the word stilling or the expression the stilling of applied and sustained thought in the description of the second jhāna
Herein when taken as conjoining stilling the construction to be understood is with the fading away and what is more with the stilling of happiness
With this construction fading away has the meaning of distaste so the meaning can be regarded as with distaste for and with the stilling of happiness
But when taken as conjoining the words stilling of applied and sustained thought then the construction to be understood is with the fading of happiness and further with the stilling of applied and sustained thought
With this construction fading away has the meaning of surmounting so this meaning can be regarded as with the surmounting of happiness and with the stilling of applied and sustained thought 
 Of course applied and sustained thought have already been stilled in the second jhāna too However this is said in order to show the path to this third jhāna and in order to recommend it
For when with the stilling of applied and sustained thought is said it is declared that the path to this jhāna is necessarily by the stilling of applied and sustained thought
And just as although mistaken view of individuality etc are not abandoned in the attaining of the third noble path but in the first yet when it is recommended by describing their abandonment thus With the abandoning of the five lower fetters  then it awakens eagerness in those trying to attain that third noble path so too when the stilling of applied and sustained thought is mentioned though they are not actually stilled here but in the second this is a recommendation
Hence the meaning expressed is this With the surmounting of happiness and with the stilling of applied and sustained thought 
 He dwells in equanimity it watches things as they arise  thus it is equanimity 
it sees fairly sees without partiality  is the meaning
A possessor of the third jhāna is said to dwell in equanimity since he possesses equanimity that is clear abundant and sound
Equanimity is of ten kinds sixfactored equanimity equanimity as a divine abiding equanimity as an enlightenment factor equanimity of energy equanimity about formations equanimity as a feeling equanimity about insight equanimity as specific neutrality equanimity of jhāna and equanimity of purification
 Herein six factored equanimity is a name for the equanimity in one whose cankers are destroyed It is the mode of nonabandonment of the natural state of purity when desirable or undesirable objects of the six kinds come into focus in the six doors described thus Here a bhikkhu whose cankers are destroyed is neither glad nor sad on seeing a visible object with the eye he dwells in equanimity mindful and fully aware 
 Equanimity as a divine abiding is a name for equanimity consisting in the mode of neutrality towards beings described thus He dwells intent upon one quarter with his heart endued with equanimity 
 Equanimity as an enlightenment factor is a name for equanimity consisting in the mode of neutrality in conascent states described thus He develops the equanimity enlightenment factor depending on relinquishment 
 Equanimity of energy is a name for the equanimity otherwise known as neither overstrenuous nor overlax energy described thus From time to time he brings to mind the sign of equanimity 
 Equanimity about formations is a name for equanimity consisting in neutrality about apprehending reflexion and composure regarding the hindrances etc described thus How many kinds of equanimity about formations arise through concentration How many kinds of equanimity about formations arise through insight Eight kinds of equanimity about formations arise through concentration Ten kinds of equanimity about formations arise through insight 
 Equanimity as a feeling is a name for the equanimity known as neither painnorpleasure described thus On the occasion on which a sensesphere profitable consciousness has arisen accompanied by equanimity 
 Equanimity about insight is a name for equanimity consisting in neutrality about investigation described thus What exists what has become that he abandons and he obtains equanimity 
 Equanimity as specific neutrality is a name for equanimity consisting in the equal efficiency of conascent states it is contained among the orwhatever states beginning with zeal 
 Equanimity of jhāna is a name for equanimity producing impartiality towards even the highest bliss described thus He dwells in equanimity 
 Purifying equanimity is a name for equanimity purified of all opposition and so consisting in uninterestedness in stilling opposition described thus The fourth jhāna which  has mindfulness purified by equanimity 
 Herein sixfactored equanimity equanimity as a divine abiding equanimity as an enlightenment factor equanimity as specific neutrality equanimity of jhāna and purifying equanimity are one in meaning that is equanimity as specific neutrality
Their difference however is one of position
like the difference in a single being as a boy a youth an adult a general a king and so on
Therefore of these it should be understood that equanimity as an enlightenment factor etc are not found where there is sixfactored equanimity
or that sixfactored equanimity etc are not found where there is equanimity as an enlightenment factor
And just as these have one meaning so also equanimity about formations and equanimity about insight have one meaning too
for they are simply understanding classed in these two ways according to function
 Just as when a man has seen a snake go into his house in the evening and has hunted for it with a forked stick and then when he has seen it lying in the grain store and has looked to discover whether it is actually a snake or not and then by seeing three marks has no more doubt and so there is neutrality in him about further investigating whether or not it is a snake so too when a man has begun insight and he sees with insight knowledge the three characteristics then there is neutrality in him about further investigating the impermanence etc of formations and that neutrality is called equanimity about insight
 But just as when the man has caught hold of the snake securely with the forked stick and thinks How shall I get rid of the snake without hurting it or getting bitten by it then as he is seeking only the way to get rid of it there is neutrality in him about the catching hold of it
so too when a man through seeking the three characteristics sees the three kinds of becoming as if burning then there is neutrality in him about catching hold of formations and that neutrality is called equanimity about formations
 So when equanimity about insight is established equanimity about formations is established too
But it is divided into two in this way according to function in other words according to neutrality about investigating and about catching hold
Equanimity of energy and equanimity as feeling are different both from each other and from the rest
 So of these kinds of equanimity it is equanimity of jhāna that is intended here
That has the characteristic of neutrality Its function is to be unconcerned It is manifested as uninterestedness Its proximate cause is the fading away of happiness
Here it may be said Is this not simply equanimity as specific neutrality in the meaning And that exists in the first and second jhānas as well
so this clause He dwells in equanimity ought to be stated of those also Why is it not
It may be replied Because its function is unevident there
 since it is overshadowed by applied thought and the rest
But it appears here with a quite evident function with head erect as it were because it is not overshadowed by applied thought and sustained thought and happiness That is why it is stated here
 He dwells in equanimity 
the commentary on the meaning of the clause is thus completed in all its aspects
 Now as to mindful and fully aware here he remembers  thus he is mindful 
He has full awareness  thus he is fully aware 
This is mindfulness and full awareness stated as personal attributes
Herein mindfulness has the characteristic of remembering Its function is not to forget It is manifested as guarding
Full awareness has the characteristic of nonconfusion Its function is to investigate  It is manifested as scrutiny
 Herein although this mindfulness and this full awareness exist in the earlier jhānas as well
for one who is forgetful and not fully aware does not attain even access let alone absorption
yet because of the comparative grossness of those jhānas the minds going is easy there like that of a man on level ground and so the functions of mindfulness and full awareness are not evident in them
But it is only stated here because the subtlety of this jhāna which is due to the abandoning of the gross factors requires that the minds going always includes the functions of mindfulness and full awareness like that of a man on a razors edge
What is more just as a calf that follows a cow returns to the cow when taken away from her if not prevented so too when this third jhāna is led away from happiness it would return to happiness if not prevented by mindfulness and full awareness and would rejoin happiness
And besides beings are greedy for bliss and this kind of bliss is exceedingly sweet since there is none greater
But here there is nongreed for the bliss owing to the influence of the mindfulness and full awareness not for any other reason And so it should also be understood that it is stated only here in order to emphasize this meaning too
 Now as to the clause he feels bliss with his body here although in one actually possessed of the third jhāna there is no concern about feeling bliss
nevertheless he would feel the bliss associated with his mental body
and after emerging from the jhāna he would also feel bliss since his material body would have been affected by the exceedingly superior matter originated by that bliss associated with the mental body
It is in order to point to this meaning that the words he feels bliss with his body are said
 Now as to the clause that  on account of which the Noble Ones announce He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful here it is the jhāna on account of which as cause on account of which as reason the Noble Ones that is to say the Enlightened Ones etc announce teach declare establish reveal expound explain clarify that person who possesses the third jhānathey praise is what is intended
Why
Because he dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful
He enters upon and dwells in that third jhāna is how the construction should be understood here
But why do they praise him thus
Because he is worthy of praise
 For this man is worthy of praise since he has equanimity towards the third jhāna though it possesses exceedingly sweet bliss and has reached the perfection of bliss and he is not drawn towards it by a liking for the bliss
and he is mindful with the mindfulness established in order to prevent the arising of happiness and he feels with his mental body the undefiled bliss beloved of Noble Ones cultivated by Noble Ones
Because he is worthy of praise in this way it should be understood Noble Ones praise him with the words He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful thus declaring the special qualities that are worthy of praise
Third it is the third in the numerical series and it is third because it is entered upon third
 Then it was said which abandons one factor possesses two factors  here the abandoning of the one factor should be understood as the abandoning of happiness
But that is abandoned only at the moment of absorption as applied thought and sustained thought are at that of the second jhāna
hence it is called its factor of abandoning
 The possession of the two factors should be understood as the arising of the two namely bliss and unification
So when it is said in the Vibhaṅga Jhāna equanimity mindfulness full awareness bliss unification of mind  this is said figuratively in order to show that jhāna with its equipment
But excepting the equanimity and mindfulness and full awareness this jhāna has literally only two factors qua factors that have attained to the characteristic of lighting 
according as it is said What is the jhāna of two factors on that occasion It is bliss and unification of mind 
The rest is as in the case of the first jhāna
 Once this has been obtained in this way and once he has mastery in the five ways already described then on emerging from the now familiar third jhāna he can regard the flaws in it thus This attainment is threatened by the nearness of happiness Whatever there is in it of mental concern about bliss proclaims its grossness  and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the bliss so expressed  He can bring the fourth jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the third jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the fourth
 When he has emerged from the third jhāna the bliss in other words the mental joy appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness while the equanimity as feeling and the unification of mind appear peaceful Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors knowing now the fourth jhāna will arise there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the lifecontinuum
After that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere belonging to the fourth jhāna The rest are of the kinds already stated 
 But there is this difference blissful feeling is not a condition as repetition condition for neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling and the preliminary work must be aroused in the case of the fourth jhāna with neither painfulnorpleasant feeling consequently these consciousnesses of the preliminary work are associated with neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
and here happiness vanishes simply owing to their association with equanimity
THE FOURTH JHNA And at this point With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna which has neitherpainnorpleasure and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity 
 and so he has attained the fourth jhāna which abandons one factor possesses two factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa
 Herein with the abandoning of pleasure and pain with the abandoning of bodily pleasure and bodily pain
With the previous which took place before not in the moment of the fourth jhāna
Disappearance of joy and grief with the previous disappearance of the two that is mental bliss and mental pain with the abandoning is what is meant
 But when does the abandoning of these take place
At the moment of access of the four jhānas
For mental joy is only abandoned at the moment of the fourthjhāna access
while bodily pain mental grief and bodily bliss are abandoned respectively at the moments of access of the first second and third jhānas
So although the order in which they are abandoned is not actually mentioned nevertheless the abandoning of the pleasure pain joy and grief is stated here according to the order in which the faculties are summarized in the Indriya Vibhaṅga 
 But if these are only abandoned at the moments of access of the several jhānas why is their cessation said to take place in the jhāna itself in the following passage And where does the arisen pain faculty cease without remainder Here bhikkhus quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna which is  born of seclusion
It is here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder 
 Where does the arisen grief faculty cease without remainder  in the second jhāna  Where does the arisen pleasure faculty cease without remainder  in the third jhāna  Where does the arisen joy faculty cease without remainder Here bhikkhus with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna which  has mindfulness purified by equanimity It is here that the arisen joy faculty ceases without remainder  It is said in that way there referring to reinforced cessation
For in the first jhāna etc it is their reinforced cessation not just their cessation that takes place
At the moment of access it is just their cessation not their reinforced cessation that takes place
 For accordingly during the first jhāna access which has multiple adverting there could be rearising of the bodily pain faculty due to contact with gadflies flies etc or the discomfort of an uneven seat though that pain faculty had already ceased but not so during absorption
Or else though it has ceased during access it has not absolutely ceased there since it is not quite beaten out by opposition
But during absorption the whole body is showered with bliss owing to pervasion by happiness And the pain faculty has absolutely ceased in one whose body is showered with bliss since it is beaten out then by opposition
And during the secondjhāna access too which has multiple advertings there could be rearising of the mental grief faculty although it had already ceased there because it arises when there is bodily weariness and mental vexation which have applied thought and sustained thought as their condition
but it does not arise when applied and sustained thought are absent
When it arises it does so in the presence of applied and sustained thought and they are not abandoned in the secondjhāna access but this is not so in the second jhāna itself because its conditions are abandoned there
 Likewise in the thirdjhāna access there could be rearising of the abandoned bodily pleasure faculty in one whose body was pervaded by the superior materiality originated by the consciousness associated with the happiness But not so in the third jhāna itself
For in the third jhāna the happiness that is a condition for the bodily bliss has ceased entirely
Likewise in the fourthjhāna access there could be rearising of the abandoned mental joy faculty because of its nearness and because it has not been properly surmounted owing to the absence of equanimity brought to absorption strength But not so in the fourth jhāna itself
And that is why in each case the words without remainder are included thus It is here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder 
 Here it may be asked Then if these kinds of feeling are abandoned in the access in this way why are they brought in here
It is done so that they can be readily grasped
For the neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling described here by the words which has neitherpainnorpleasure is subtle hard to recognize and not readily grasped So just as when a cattleherd wants to catch a refractory ox that cannot be caught at all by approaching it he collects all the cattle into one pen and lets them out one by one and then he says That is it catch it and so it gets caught as well so too the Blessed One has collected all these five kinds of feeling together so that they can be grasped readily
for when they are shown collected together in this way then what is not bodily pleasure or bodily pain or mental joy or mental grief can still be grasped in this way This is neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling 
 Besides this may be understood as said in order to show the condition for the neitherpainfulnorpleasant minddeliverance
For the abandoning of bodily pain etc are conditions for that
according as it is said There are four conditions friend for the attainment of the neitherpainfulnorpleasant mind deliverance
Here friend with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna  equanimity
These are the four conditions for the attainment of the neitherpainfulnorpleasant minddeliverance 
 Or alternatively just as although mistaken view of individuality etc have already been abandoned in the earlier paths they are nevertheless mentioned as abandoned in the description of the third path for the purpose of recommending it  so too these kinds of feeling can be understood as mentioned here for the purpose of recommending this jhāna
Or alternatively they can be understood as mentioned for the purpose of showing that greed and hate are very far away owing to the removal of their conditions
for of these pleasure is a condition for joy and joy for greed
pain is a condition for grief and grief for hate
So with the removal of pleasure  etc greed and hate are very far away since they are removed along with their conditions
 Which has neitherpainnorpleasure no pain owing to absence of pain
no pleasure owing to absence of pleasure 
By this he indicates the third kind of feeling that is in opposition both to pain and to pleasure not the mere absence of pain and pleasure
This third kind of feeling named neitherpainnorpleasure is also called equanimity
It has the characteristic of experiencing what is contrary to both the desirable and the undesirable Its function is neutral Its manifestation is unevident Its proximate cause should be understood as the cessation of pleasure 
 And has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity has purity of mindfulness brought about by equanimity
For the mindfulness in this jhāna is quite purified and its purification is effected by equanimity not by anything else
That is why it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
Also it is said in the Vibhaṅga This mindfulness is cleared purified clarified by equanimity
hence it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity 
And the equanimity due to which there comes to be this purity of mindfulness should be understood as specific neutrality in meaning
And not only mindfulness is purified by it here but also all associated states However the teaching is given under the heading of mindfulness
Herein this equanimity exists in the three lower jhānas too
but just as although a crescent moon exists by day but is not purified or clear since it is outshone by the suns radiance in the daytime or since it is deprived of the night which is its ally owing to gentleness and owing to helpfulness to it so too this crescent moon of equanimity consisting in specific neutrality exists in the first jhāna etc but it is not purified since it is outshone by the glare of the opposing states consisting in applied thought etc and since it is deprived of the night of equanimityasfeeling for its ally
and because it is not purified the conascent mindfulness and other states are not purified either like the unpurified crescent moons radiance by day
That is why no one among these first three jhānas is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
But here this crescent moon consisting in specific neutrality is utterly pure because it is not outshone by the glare of the opposing states consisting in applied thought etc and because it has the night of equanimityasfeeling for its ally
And since it is purified the conascent mindfulness and other states are purified and clear also like the purified crescent moons radiance
That it should be understood is why only this jhāna is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
Fourth it is fourth in numerical series
and it is fourth because it is entered upon fourth
 Then it was said which abandons one factor possesses two factors  here the abandoning of the one factor should be understood as the abandoning of joy
But that joy is actually abandoned in the first impulsions of the same cognitive series 
Hence it is called its factor of abandoning
The possession of the two factors should be understood as the arising of the two namely equanimity as feeling and unification of mind
The rest is as stated in the case of the first jhāna
This in the first place is according to the fourfold reckoning of jhāna
 When however he is developing fivefold jhāna then on emerging from the now familiar first jhāna he can regard the flaws in it in this way This attainment is threatened by the nearness of the hindrances and its factors are weakened by the grossness of applied thought  He can bring the second jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the first jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the second
 Now he emerges from the first jhāna mindfully and fully aware and only applied thought appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors while the sustained thought etc appear peaceful
Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors the second jhāna arises in him in the way already described
Its factor of abandoning is applied thought only
The four beginning with sustained thought are the factors that it possesses
The rest is as already stated
 When this has been obtained in this way and once he has mastery in the five ways already described then on emerging from the now familiar second jhāna he can regard the flaws in it in this way This attainment is threatened by the nearness of applied thought and its factors are weakened by the grossness of sustained thought  He can bring the third jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the second jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the third
 Now he emerges from the second jhāna mindfully and fully aware only sustained thought appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors while happiness etc appear peaceful
Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors the third jhāna arises in him in the way already described
Its factor of abandoning is sustained thought only The three beginning with happiness as in the second jhāna in the fourfold reckoning are the factors that it possesses
The rest is as already stated
 So that which is the second in the fourfold reckoning becomes the second and third in the fivefold reckoning by being divided into two
And those which are the third and fourth in the former reckoning become the fourth and fifth in this reckoning
The first remains the first in each case
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the Treatise on the Development of Concen tration
called The Description of the Earth Kasiṇa
The fourth chapter
Now the water kasiṇa comes next after the earth kasiṇa 
Here is the detailed explanation One who wants to develop the water kasiṇa should as in the case of the earth kasiṇa seat himself comfortably and apprehend the sign in water that is either made up or not made up etc and so all the rest should be repeated in detail 
And as in this case so with all those that follow in this chapter
We shall in fact not repeat even this much and shall only point out what is different
Here too when someone has had practice in previous lives the sign arises for him in water that is not made up such as a pool a lake a lagoon or the ocean as in the case of the Elder CūḷaSīva
The venerable one it seems thought to abandon gain and honour and live a secluded life He boarded a ship at Mahātittha and sailed to Jambudīpa  As he gazed at the ocean meanwhile the kasiṇa sign the counterpart of that ocean arose in him
 Someone with no such previous practice should guard against the four faults of a kasiṇa and not apprehend the water as one of the colours blue yellow red or white He should fill a bowl or a fourfooted water pot to the brim with water uncontaminated by soil taken in the open through a clean cloth strainer or with any other clear unturbid water He should put it in a screened place on the outskirts of the monastery as already described and seat himself comfortably He should neither review its colour
nor bring its characteristic to mind
Apprehending the colour as belonging to its physical support he should set his mind on the name concept as the most outstanding mental datum and using any among the various names for water such as rain  liquid  dew  fluid  he should develop the kasiṇa by using preferably the obvious water water
As he develops it in this way the two signs eventually arise in him in the way already described
Here however the learning sign has the appearance of moving If the water has bubbles of froth mixed with it the learning sign has the same appearance and it is evident as a fault in the kasiṇa
But the counterpart sign appears inactive like a crystal fan set in space like the disk of a looking glass made of crystal
With the appearance of that sign he reaches access jhāna and the jhāna tetrad and pentad in the way already described
Anyone who wants to develop the fire kasiṇa should apprehend the sign in fire
Herein when someone with merit having had previous practice is apprehending the sign it arises in him in any sort of fire not made up as he looks at the fiery combustion in a lamps flame or in a furnace or in a place for baking bowls or in a forest conflagration as in the Elder Cittaguttas case
The sign arose in that elder as he was looking at a lamps flame while he was in the Uposatha house on the day of preaching the Dhamma
Anyone else should make one up
Here are the directions for making it He should split up some damp heartwood dry it and break it up into short lengths He should go to a suitable tree root or to a shed and there make a pile in the way done for baking bowls and have it lit He should make a hole a span and four fingers wide in a rush mat or a piece of leather or a cloth
and after hanging it in front of the fire he should sit down in the way already described Instead of giving attention to the grass and sticks below or the smoke above he should apprehend the sign in the dense combustion in the middle He should not review the colour as blue or yellow etc or give attention to its characteristic as heat etc
but taking the colour as belonging to its physical support and setting his mind on the name concept as the most outstanding mental datum and using any among the names for fire such as the Bright One  the Leaver of the Black Trail  the Knower of Creatures  the Altar of Sacrifice  etc he should develop the kasiṇa by using preferably the obvious fire fire
As he develops it in this way the two signs eventually arise in him as already described
Herein the learning sign appears like the fire to keep sinking down as the flame keeps detaching itself
But when someone apprehends it in a kasiṇa that is not made up any fault in the kasiṇa is evident in the learning sign and any firebrand or pile of embers or ashes or smoke appears in it
The counterpart sign appears motionless like a piece of red cloth set in space like a gold fan like a gold column
With its appearance he reaches access jhāna and the jhāna tetrad and pentad in the way already described
Anyone who wants to develop the air kasiṇa should apprehend the sign in air
And that is done either by sight or by touch
For this is said in the Commentaries One who is learning the air kasiṇa apprehends the sign in air He notices the tops of growing sugarcane moving to and fro or he notices the tops of bamboos or the tops of trees or the ends of the hair moving to and fro or he notices the touch of it on the body
So when he sees sugarcanes with dense foliage standing with tops level or bamboos or trees or else hair four fingers long on a mans head being struck by the wind he should establish mindfulness in this way This wind is striking on this place Or he can establish mindfulness where the wind strikes a part of his body after entering by a window opening or by a crack in a wall and using any among the names for wind beginning with wind  breeze  blowing  he should develop the kasiṇa by using preferably the obvious air air
Here the learning sign appears to move like the swirl of hot steam on rice gruel just withdrawn from an oven
The counterpart sign is quiet and motionless
The rest should be understood in the way already described
Next it is said in the Commentaries One who is learning the blue kasiṇa apprehends the sign in blue whether in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour element Firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a bush with blue flowers or such flowers spread out on a place of offering or any blue cloth or gem
 But anyone else should take flowers such as blue lotuses girikaṇṇikā flowers etc and spread them out to fill a tray or a flat basket completely so that no stamen or stalk shows or with only their petals Or he can fill it with blue cloth bunched up together
or he can fasten the cloth over the rim of the tray
or basket like the covering of a drum
Or he can make a kasiṇa disk either portable as described under the earth kasiṇa or on a wall with one of the colour elements such as bronzegreen leafgreen añjanaointment black surrounding it with a different colour
After that he should bring it to mind as blue blue in the way already described under the earth kasiṇa
 And here too any fault in the kasiṇa is evident in the learning sign the stamens and stalks and the gaps between the petals etc are apparent
The counterpart sign appears like a crystal fan in space free from the kasiṇa disk
The rest should be understood as already described
Likewise with the yellow kasiṇa
for this is said One who is learning the yellow kasiṇa apprehends the sign in yellow either in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour element
Therefore here too when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a flowering bush or flowers spread out or yellow cloth or colour element as in the case of the Elder Cittagutta
That venerable one it seems saw an offering being made on the flower altar with pattaṅga flowers at Cittalapabbata and as soon as he saw it the sign arose in him the size of the flower altar
Anyone else should make a kasiṇa in the way described for the blue kasiṇa with kaṇikāra flowers etc or with yellow cloth or with a colour element He should bring it to mind as yellow yellow
The rest is as before
Likewise with the red kasiṇa
for this is said One who is learning the red kasiṇa apprehends the sign in red either in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour element
Therefore here too when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a bandhujīvaka bush etc in flower or such flowers spread out or a red cloth or gem or colour element
But anyone else should make a kasiṇa in the way already described for the blue kasiṇa with jayasumana flowers or bandhujīvaka or red koraṇḍaka flowers etc or with red cloth or with a colour element
He should bring it to mind as red red The rest is as before
 Of the white kasiṇa it is said One who is learning the white kasiṇa apprehends the sign in white either in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour element So firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a flowering bush of such a kind or vassikasumana flowers etc spread out or a heap of white lotuses or lilies white cloth or colour element and it also arises in a tin disk a silver disk and the moons disk
 Anyone else should make a kasiṇa in the way already described for the blue kasiṇa with the white flowers already mentioned or with cloth or colour element He should bring it to mind as white white
The rest is as before
 Of the light kasiṇa it is said One who is learning the light kasiṇa apprehends the sign in light in a hole in a wall or in a keyhole or in a window opening So firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees the circle thrown on a wall or a floor by sunlight or moonlight entering through a hole in a wall etc or when he sees a circle thrown on the ground by sunlight or moonlight coming through a gap in the branches of a denseleaved tree or through a gap in a hut made of closely packed branches
Anyone else should use that same kind of circle of luminosity just described developing it as luminosity luminosity or light light
If he cannot do so he can light a lamp inside a pot close the pots mouth make a hole in it and place it with the hole facing a wall
The lamplight coming out of the hole throws a circle on the wall He should develop that as light light
This lasts longer than the other kinds
Here the learning sign is like the circle thrown on the wall or the ground
The counterpart sign is like a compact bright cluster of lights
The rest is as before
 Of the limitedspace kasiṇa it is said One who is learning the space kasiṇa apprehends the sign in a hole in a wall or in a keyhole or in a window opening So firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees any such gap as a hole in a wall
Anyone else should make a hole a span and four fingers broad in a well thatched hut or in a piece of leather or in a rush mat and so on He should develop one of these or a hole such as a hole in a wall as space space
Here the learning sign resembles the hole together with the wall etc that surrounds it Attempts to extend it fail
The counterpart sign appears only as a circle of space Attempts to extend it succeed
The rest should be understood as described under the earth kasiṇa
 He with Ten Powers ten kasiṇas
Tells who all things did see each of which can be
The cause of fourfold and of fivefold jhāna The finematerial spheres own master key
To tackle each and
how they are developed Now knowing their descriptions and the way
with its special part to play
Study each There are some further points that will repay
Of these the earth kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as the state described as Having been one he becomes many  etc and stepping or standing or sitting on space or on water by creating earth and the acquisition of the bases of mastery by the limited and measureless method
The water kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as diving in and out of the earth  causing rain storms creating rivers and seas making the earth and rocks and palaces quake 
The fire kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as smoking flaming causing showers of sparks countering fire with fire ability to burn only what one wants to burn  causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eye burning up the body by means of the fire element at the time of attaining Nibbāna 
The air kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as going with the speed of the wind causing wind storms
The blue kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating black forms causing darkness acquisition of the bases of mastery by the method of fairness and ugliness and attainment of the liberation by the beautiful
 The yellow kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating yellow forms resolving that something shall be gold  acquisition of the bases of mastery in the way stated and attainment of the liberation by the beautiful
The red kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating red forms acquisition of the bases of mastery in the way stated and attainment of the liberation by the beautiful
 The white kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating white forms banishing stiffness and torpor dispelling darkness causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eye
The light kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating luminous forms banishing stiffness and torpor dispelling darkness causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eye
 The space kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as revealing the hidden maintaining postures inside the earth and rocks by creating space inside them travelling unobstructed through walls and so on
 The classification above below around exclusive measureless applies to all kasiṇas
for this is said He perceives the earth kasiṇa
above below around exclusive measureless  and so on
 Herein above is upwards towards the skys level
Below is downwards towards the earths level
Around is marked off all around like the perimeter of a field
For one extends a kasiṇa upwards only another downwards another all round
or for some reason another projects it thus
as one who wants to see visible objects with the divine eye projects light
Hence above below around is said
The word exclusive however shows that anyone such state has nothing to do with any other
Just as there is water and nothing else in all directions for one who is actually in water so too the earth kasiṇa is the earth kasiṇa only it has nothing in common with any other kasiṇa
Similarly in each instance
Measureless means measureless intentness
He is intent upon the entirety with his mind
taking no measurements in this way This is its beginning this is its middle
 No kasiṇa can be developed by any living being described as follows Beings hindered by kamma by defilement or by kammaresult who lack faith zeal and understanding will be incapable of entering into the certainty of rightness in profitable states 
Herein the words hindered by kamma refer to those who possess bad kamma entailing immediate effect on rebirth
By defilement who have fixed wrong view or are hermaphrodites or eunuchs
By kammaresult who have had a rebirth linking with no profitable rootcause or with only two profitable rootcauses
Lack faith are destitute of faith in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
Zeal are destitute of zeal for the unopposed way
Understanding are destitute of mundane and supramundane right view
Will be incapable of entering into the certainty of rightness in profitable states means that they are incapable of entering into the noble path called certainty and rightness in profitable states
And this does not apply only to kasiṇas for none of them will succeed in developing any meditation subject at all
So the task of devotion to a meditation subject must be undertaken by a clansman who has no hindrance by kamma result who shuns hindrance by kamma and by defilement and who fosters faith zeal and understanding by listening to the Dhamma frequenting good men and so on
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the Treatise on the Development of Concentration
called The Description of the Remaining Kasiṇas
The fifth chapter
 Now ten kinds of foulness as corpses without consciousness were listed next after the kasiṇas thus the bloated the livid the festering the cut up the gnawed the scattered the hacked and scattered the bleeding the worm infested a skeleton  The bloated it is bloated because bloated by gradual dilation and swelling after the close of life as a bellows is with wind What is bloated is the same as the bloated 
Or alternatively what is bloated is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the bloated 
This is a term for a corpse in that particular state
 The livid what has patchy discolouration is called livid  What is livid is the same as the livid 
Or alternatively what is livid is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the livid 
This is a term for a corpse that is reddishcoloured in places where flesh is prominent whitishcoloured in places where pus has collected but mostly blueblack  as if draped with blueblack cloth in the blueblack places
The festering what is trickling with pus in broken places is festering  What is festering is the same as the festering 
Or alternatively what is festering is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the festering 
This is a term for a corpse in that particular state
The cut up what has been opened up by cutting it in two is called cut up  What is cut up is the same as the cut up 
Or alternatively what is cut up is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the cut up 
This is a term for a corpse cut in the middle
The gnawed what has been chewed here and there in various ways by dogs jackals etc is what is gnawed  What is gnawed is the same as the gnawed 
Or alternatively what is gnawed is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the gnawed 
This is a term for a corpse in that particular state
The scattered what is strewed about is scattered  What is scattered is the same as the scattered 
Or alternatively what is scattered is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the scattered 
This is a term for a corpse that is strewed here and there in this way Here a hand there a foot there the head 
 The hacked and scattered it is hacked and it is scattered in the way just described thus it is hacked and scattered 
This is a term for a corpse scattered in the way just described after it has been hacked with a knife in a crowsfoot pattern on every limb
 The bleeding it sprinkles  scatters blood  and it trickles here and there thus it is the bleeding 
This is a term for a corpse smeared with trickling blood
The worminfested it is maggots that are called worms  it sprinkles worms  thus it is worminfested 
This is a term for a corpse full of maggots
 A skeleton bone is the same as skeleton 
Or alternatively bone is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is a skeleton 
This is a term both for a single bone and for a framework of bones
These names are also used both for the signs that arise with the bloated etc as their support and for the jhānas obtained in the signs
Herein when a meditator wants to develop the jhāna called of the bloated by arousing the sign of the bloated on a bloated body he should in the way already described approach a teacher of the kind mentioned under the earth kasiṇa and learn the meditation subject from him
In explaining the meditation subject to him the teacher should explain it all that is the directions for going with the aim of acquiring the sign of foulness the characterizing of the surrounding signs the eleven ways of apprehending the sign the reviewing of the path gone by and come by concluding with the directions for absorption
And when the meditator has learnt it all well he should go to an abode of the kind already described and live there while seeking the sign of the bloated
Meanwhile when he hears people saying that at some village gate or on some road or at some forests edge or at the base of some rock or at the root of some tree or on some charnel ground a bloated corpse is lying he should not go there at once like one who plunges into a river where there is no ford
 Why not
Because this foulness is beset by wild beasts and nonhuman beings
and he might risk his life there
Or perhaps the way to it goes by a village gate or a bathing place or an irrigated field
and there a visible object of the opposite sex might come into focus Or perhaps the body is of the opposite sex
for a female body is unsuitable for a man and a male body for a woman If only recently dead it may even look beautiful hence there might be danger to the life of purity
But if he judges himself thus This is not difficult for one like me then he can go there
And when he goes he should do so only after he has spoken to the senior elder of the Community or to some wellknown bhikkhu
 Why
Because if all his limbs are seized with shuddering at the charnel ground or if his gorge rises when he is confronted with disagreeable objects such as the visible forms and sounds of nonhuman beings lions tigers etc or something else afflicts him
then he whom he told will have his bowl and robe well looked after in the monastery
or he will care for him by sending young bhikkhus or novices to him
Besides robbers may meet there thinking a charnel ground a safe place for them whether or not they have done anything wrong
And when men chase them they drop their goods near the bhikkhu and run away
Perhaps the men seize the bhikkhu saying We have found the thief with the goods and bully him
Then he whom he told will explain to the men Do not bully him he went to do this special work after telling me and he will rescue him
This is the advantage of going only after informing someone
Therefore he should inform a bhikkhu of the kind described and then set out eager to see the sign and as happy and joyful as a warriornoble on his way to the scene of anointing as one going to offer libations at the hall of sacrifice or as a pauper on his way to unearth a hidden treasure And he should go there in the way advised by the Commentaries
 For this is said
One who is learning the bloated sign of foulness goes alone with no companion with unremitting mindfulness established with his sense faculties turned inwards with his mind not turned outwards reviewing the path gone by and come by
In the place where the bloated sign of foulness has been left he notes any stone or termitemound or tree or bush or creeper there each with its particular sign and in relation to the object
When he has done this he characterizes the bloated sign of foulness by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essence by its colour by its mark by its shape by its direction by its location by its delimitation by its joints by its openings by its concavities by its convexities and all round
Then he sees that the sign is properly apprehended that it is properly remembered that it is properly defined 
 When he has properly apprehended the sign properly remembered it properly defined it he goes alone with no companion with unremitting mindfulness established with his sense faculties turned inwards with his mind not turned outwards reviewing the path gone by and come by
When he walks he resolves that his walk is oriented towards it
when he sits he prepares a seat that is oriented towards it
 What is the purpose what is the advantage of characterizing the surrounding signs
Characterizing the surrounding signs has nondelusion for its purpose it has nondelusion for its advantage
What is the purpose what is the advantage of apprehending the sign in the other eleven ways
Apprehending the sign in the other eleven ways has anchoring the mind for its purpose it has anchoring the mind for its advantage
What is the purpose what is the advantage of reviewing the path gone by and come by
Reviewing the path gone by and come by has keeping the mind on the track for its purpose it has keeping the mind on the track for its advantage
When he has established reverence for it by seeing its advantages and by perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love it he anchors his mind upon that object Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and death
Quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna  seclusion
He has arrived at the first jhāna of the finematerial sphere His is a heavenly abiding and an instance of the meritorious action consisting in meditative development
So if he goes to the charnel ground to test his control of mind let him do so after striking the gong or summoning a chapter
If he goes there mainly for developing that meditation subject let him go alone with no companion without renouncing his basic meditation subject and keeping it always in mind taking a walking stick or a staff to keep off attacks by dogs etc ensuring unremitting mindfulness by establishing it well with his mind not turned outwards because he has ensured that his faculties of which his mind is the sixth are turned inwards
As he goes out of the monastery he should note the gate I have gone out in such a direction by such a gate
After that he should define the path by which he goes This path goes in an easterly direction  westerly  northerly  southerly direction or It goes in an intermediate direction
and In this place it goes to the left in this place to the right and In this place there is a stone in this a termite mound in this a tree in this a bush in this a creeper
He should go to the place where the sign is defining in this way the path by which he goes
And he should not approach it upwind
for if he did so and the smell of corpses assailed his nose his brain might get upset or he might throw up his food or he might repent his coming thinking What a place of corpses I have come to
So instead of approaching it upwind he should go downwind
If he cannot go by a downwind pathif there is a mountain or a ravine or a rock or a fence or a patch of thorns or water or a bog in the waythen he should go stopping his nose with the corner of his robe
These are the duties in going
When he has gone there in this way he should not at once look at the sign of foulness
he should make sure of the direction
For perhaps if he stands in a certain direction the object does not appear clearly to him and his mind is not wieldy
So rather than there he should stand where the object appears clearly and his mind is wieldy
And he should avoid standing to leeward or to windward of it
For if he stands to leeward he is bothered by the corpse smell and his mind strays
and if he stands to windward and nonhuman beings are dwelling there they may get annoyed and do him a mischief
So he should move round a little and not stand too much to windward
Then he should stand not too far off or too near or too much towards the feet or the head
For if he stands too far off the object is not clear to him
and if he stands too near he may get frightened
If he stands too much towards the feet or the head not all the foulness becomes manifest to him equally
So he should stand not too far off or too near opposite the middle of the body in a place convenient for him to look at it
Then he should characterize the surrounding signs in the way stated thus In the place where the bloated sign of foulness has been left he notes any stone  or creeper there with its sign 
 These are the directions for characterizing them If there is a rock in the eyes focus near the sign he should define it in this way This rock is high or low small or large brown or black or white long or round
after which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a rock this is the sign of foulness this is the sign of foulness this is a rock
If there is a termitemound he should define it in this way This is high or low small or large brown or black or white long or round
after which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a termite mound this is the sign of foulness
If there is a tree he should define it in this way This is a pipal fig tree or a banyan fig tree or a kacchaka fig tree or a kapittha fig tree it is tall or short small or large black or white
after which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a tree this is the sign of foulness
If there is a bush he should define it in this way This is a sindi bush or a karamanda bush or a kaṇavīra bush or a koraṇḍaka bush it is tall or short small or large
after which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a bush this is the sign of foulness
If there is a creeper he should define it in this way This is a pumpkin creeper or a gourd creeper or a brown creeper or a black creeper or a stinking creeper
after which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a creeper this is the sign of foulness this is the sign of foulness this is a creeper
 Also with its particular sign and in relation to the object was said  but that is included by what has just been said
for he characterizes it with its particular sign when he defines it again and again
and he characterizes it in relation to the object when he defines it by combining it each time in pairs thus This is a rock this is the sign of foulness this is the sign of foulness this is a rock
 Having done this again he should bring to mind the fact that it has an individual essence its own state of being bloated which is not common to anything else since it was said that he defines it by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essence
The meaning is that it should be defined according to individual essence according to its own nature as the inflated the bloated
Having defined it in this way he should apprehend the sign in the following six ways that is to say by its colour by its mark by its shape by its direction by its location by its delimitation
How
 The meditator should define it by its colour thus This is the body of one who is black or white or yellowskinned
 Instead of defining it by the female mark or the male mark he should define it by its mark thus This is the body of one who was in the first phase of life in the middle phase in the last phase
 By its shape he should define it only by the shape of the bloated thus This is the shape of its head this is the shape of its neck this is the shape of its hand this is the shape of its chest this is the shape of its belly this is the shape of its navel this is the shape of its hips this is the shape of its thigh this is the shape of its calf this is the shape of its foot
 He should define it by its direction thus There are two directions in this body that is down from the navel as the lower direction and up from it as the upper direction
Or alternatively he can define it thus I am standing in this direction the sign of foulness is in that direction
 He should define it by its location thus The hand is in this location the foot in this the head in this the middle of the body in this
Or alternatively he can define it thus I am in this location the sign of foulness is in that
 He should define it by its delimitation thus This body is delimited below by the soles of the feet above by the tips of the hair all round by the skin the space so delimited is filled up with thirtytwo pieces of corpse
Or alternatively he can define it thus This is the delimitation of its hand this is the delimitation of its foot this is the delimitation of its head this is the delimitation of the middle part of its body
Or alternatively he can delimit as much of it as he has apprehended thus Just this much of the bloated is like this
 However a female body is not appropriate for a man or a male one for a woman
for the object namely the repulsive aspect does not make its appearance in a body of the opposite sex which merely becomes a condition for the wrong kind of excitement
To quote the Majjhima Commentary Even when decaying a woman invades a mans mind and stays there
That is why the sign should be apprehended in the six ways only in a body of the same sex
 But when a clansman has cultivated the meditation subject under former Enlightened Ones kept the ascetic practices threshed out the great primary elements discerned formations defined mentalitymateriality eliminated the perception of a being done the ascetics duties lived the moral life and developed the development when he contains the seed of turning away from formations and has mature knowledge and little defilement then the counterpart sign appears to him in the place while he keeps looking
If it does not appear in that way then it appears to him as he is apprehending the sign in the six ways
But if it does not appear to him even then he should apprehend the sign again in five more ways by its joints by its openings by its concavities by its convexities and all round
Herein by its joints is properly by its hundred and eighty joints
But how can he define the hundred and eighty joints in the bloated
Consequently he can define it by its fourteen major joints thus Three joints in the right arm three in the left arm three in the right leg three in the left leg one neck joint one waist joint
 By its openings an opening is the hollow between the arm and the side the hollow between the legs the hollow of the stomach the hollow of the ear He should define it by its openings in this way
Or alternatively the opened or closed state of the eyes and the opened or closed state of the mouth can be defined
 By its concavities he should define any concave place on the body such as the eye sockets or the inside of the mouth or the base of the neck
Or he can define it thus I am standing in a concave place the body is in a convex place
 By its convexities he should define any raised place on the body such as the knee or the chest or the forehead
Or he can define it thus I am standing in a convex place the body is in a concave place
 All round the whole body should be defined all round
After working over the whole body with knowledge he should establish his mind thus The bloated the bloated upon any part that appears clearly to him
If it has not appeared even yet and if there is special intensity of the bloatedness in the belly he should establish his mind thus The bloated the bloated on that
 Now as to the words he sees that the sign is properly apprehended etc the explanation is this
The meditator should apprehend the sign thoroughly in that body in the way of apprehending the sign already described
He should advert to it with wellestablished mindfulness
He should see that it is properly remembered properly defined by doing that again and again
Standing in a place not too far from and not too near to the body he should open his eyes look and apprehend the sign
He should open his eyes and look a hundred times a thousand times thinking Repulsiveness of the bloated repulsiveness of the bloated and he should close his eyes and advert to it
 As he does so again and again the learning sign becomes properly apprehended by him
When is it properly apprehended
When it comes into focus alike whether he opens his eyes and looks or closes his eyes and adverts then it is called properly apprehended
When he has thus properly apprehended the sign properly remembered it and properly defined it then if he is unable to conclude his development on the spot he can go to his own lodging alone in the same way as described of his coming with no companion keeping that same meditation subject in mind with mindfulness well established and with his mind not turned outwards owing to his faculties being turned inwards
As he leaves the charnel ground he should define the path he comes back by thus The path by which I have left goes in an easterly direction westerly  northerly  southerly direction or It goes in an intermediate direction
or In this place it goes to the left in this place to the right and In this place there is a stone in this a termitemound in this a tree in this a bush in this a creeper When he has defined the path he has come back by and when once back he is walking up and down he should see that his walk is oriented towards it too the meaning is that he should walk up and down on a piece of ground that faces in the direction of the sign of foulness
And when he sits he should prepare a seat oriented towards it too
 But if there is a bog or a ravine or a tree or a fence or a swamp in that direction if he cannot walk up and down on a piece of ground facing in that direction if he cannot prepare his seat thus because there is no room for it
then he can both walk up and down and sit in a place where there is room even though it does not face that way
but he should turn his mind in that direction
Now as to the questions beginning with what is the purpose  characterizing the surrounding signs
The intention of the answer that begins with the words has nondelusion for its purpose is this If someone goes at the wrong time to the place where the sign of the bloated is and opens his eyes for the purpose of apprehending the sign by characterizing the surrounding signs then as soon as he looks the dead body appears as if it were standing up and threatening and pursuing him and when he sees the hideous and fearful object his mind reels he is like one demented gripped by panic fear and terror and his hair stands on end
For among the thirtyeight meditation subjects expounded in the texts no object is so frightening as this one
There are some who lose jhāna in this meditation subject
Why
Because it is so frightening
 So the meditator must stand firm Establishing his mindfulness well he should remove his fears in this way No dead body gets up and pursues one
If that stone or that creeper close to it were to come the body might come too
but since that stone or that creeper does not come the body will not come either
Its appearance to you in this way is born of your perception created by your perception Today your meditation subject has appeared to you Do not be afraid bhikkhu He should laugh it off and direct his mind to the sign
In that way he will arrive at distinction
The words Characterizing the surrounding signs has nondelusion for its purpose are said on this account
To succeed in apprehending the sign in the eleven ways is to anchor the meditation subject
For the opening of his eyes and looking conditions the arising of the learning sign
and as he exercises his mind on that the counterpart sign arises
and as he exercises his mind on that he reaches absorption
When he is sure of absorption he works up insight and realizes Arahantship
Hence it was said apprehending the sign in the other eleven ways has anchoring the mind for its purpose
The reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping the mind on the track for its purpose the meaning is that the reviewing of the path gone by and of the path come back by mentioned is for the purpose of keeping properly to the track of the meditation subject
For if this bhikkhu is going along with his meditation subject and people on the way ask him about the day What is today venerable sir  or they ask him some question about Dhamma or they welcome him he ought not to go on in silence thinking I have a meditation subject
The day must be told the question must be answered
even by saying I do not know if he does not know
a legitimate welcome must be responded to
As he does so the newly acquired sign vanishes
But even if it does vanish he should still tell the day when asked
if he does not know the answer to the question he should still say I do not know
and if he does know it he should explain it surely and he must respond to a welcome
Also reception of visitors must be attended to on seeing a visiting bhikkhu
and all the remaining duties in the Khandhakas must be carried out too that is the duties of the shrine terrace the duties of the Bodhitree terrace the duties of the Uposatha house the duties of the refectory and the bath house and those to the teacher the preceptor visitors departing bhikkhus and the rest
And the newly acquired sign vanishes while he is carrying out these too When he wants to go again thinking I shall go and take up the sign he finds he cannot go to the charnel ground because it has been invaded by nonhuman beings or by wild beasts or the sign has disappeared
For a bloated corpse only lasts one or two days and then turns into a livid corpse
Of all the meditation subjects there is none so hard to come by as this
So when the sign has vanished in this way the bhikkhu should sit down in his night quarters or in his day quarters and first of all review the path gone by and come by up to the place where he is actually sitting crosslegged doing it in this way I went out of the monastery by this gate I took a path leading in such and such a direction I turned left at such and such a place I turned right at such and such a place
in one part of it there was a stone in another a termitemound or a tree or a bush or a creeper
having gone by that path I saw the foulness in such and such a place
I stood there facing in such and such a direction and observed such and such surrounding signs I apprehended the sign of foulness in this way I left the charnel ground in such and such a direction I came back by such and such a path doing this and this and I am now sitting here
 As he reviews it in this way the sign becomes evident and appears as if placed in front of him
the meditation subject rides in its track as it did before
Hence it was said the reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping the mind on the track for its purpose
Now as to the words when he has established reverence for it by seeing its advantages and by perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love it he anchors the mind on that object here having gained jhāna by exercising his mind on the repulsiveness in the bloated he should increase insight with the jhāna as its proximate cause and then he should see the advantages in this way Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and death
Just as a pauper who acquired a treasure of gems would guard and love it with great affection feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of it I have got what is hard indeed to get  so too this bhikkhu I have got this meditation subject which is indeed as hard to get as a very valuable treasure is for a pauper to get
For one whose meditation subject is the four elements discerns the four primary elements in himself one whose meditation subject is breathing discerns the wind in his own nostrils and one whose meditation subject is a kasiṇa makes a kasiṇa and develops it at his ease so these other meditation subjects are easily got
But this one lasts only one or two days after which it turns into a livid corpse There is none harder to get than this one  should guard the sign loving it and feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of it
In his night quarters and in his day quarters he should keep his mind anchored there thus Repulsiveness of the bloated repulsiveness of the bloated
And he should advert to the sign bring it to mind
and strike at it with thought and applied thought over and over again
As he does so the counterpart sign arises
Here is the difference between the two signs The learning sign appears as a hideous dreadful and frightening sight
but the counterpart sign appears like a man with big limbs lying down after eating his fill
 Simultaneously with his acquiring the counterpart sign his lust is abandoned by suppression owing to his giving no attention externally to sense desires as object
And owing to his abandoning of approval ill will is abandoned too as pus is with the abandoning of blood
Likewise stiffness and torpor are abandoned through exertion of energy agitation and worry are abandoned through devotion to peaceful things that cause no remorse and uncertainty about the Master who teaches the way about the way and about the fruit of the way is abandoned through the actual experience of the distinction attained So the five hindrances are abandoned
And there are present applied thought with the characteristic of directing the mind on to that same sign and sustained thought accomplishing the function of pressing on the sign and happiness due to the acquisition of distinction and tranquillity due to the production of tranquillity in one whose mind is happy and bliss with that tranquillity as its sign and unification that has bliss as its sign due to the production of concentration in one whose mind is blissful So the jhāna factors become manifest
Thus access which is the obverse of the first jhāna is produced in him too at that same moment
All after that up to absorption in the first jhāna and mastery in it should be understood as described under the earth kasiṇa
 As regards the livid and the rest the characterizing already described starting with the going in the way beginning One who is learning the bloated sign of foulness goes alone with no companion with unremitting mindfulness established  should all be understood with its exposition and intention substituting for the word bloated the appropriate word in each case thus One who is learning the livid sign of foulness  One who is learning the festering sign of foulness 
But the differences are as follows The livid should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the livid repulsiveness of the livid
Here the learning sign appears blotchycoloured
but the counterpart signs appearance has the colour which is most prevalent
The festering should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the festering repulsiveness of the festering
Here the learning sign appears as though trickling
but the counterpart sign appears motionless and quiet
The cut up is found on a battlefield or in a robbers forest or on a charnel ground where kings have robbers cut up
or in the jungle in a place where men are torn up by lions and tigers
So if when he goes there it comes into focus at one adverting although lying in different places that is good
If not then he should not touch it with his own hand
for by doing so he would become familiar with it
He should get a monastery attendant or one studying to become an ascetic or someone else to put it together in one place
If he cannot find anyone to do it he should put it together with a walking stick or a staff in such a way that there is only a fingers breadth separating the parts
Having put it together thus he should bring it to mind as Repulsiveness of the cut up repulsiveness of the cut up
Herein the learning sign appears as though cut in the middle
but the counterpart sign appears whole
 The gnawed should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the gnawed repulsiveness of the gnawed
Here the learning sign appears as though gnawed here and there
but the counterpart sign appears whole
 After getting the scattered put together or putting it together in the way described under the cut up so that there is only a fingers breadth separating the pieces it should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the scattered repulsiveness of the scattered
Here the learning sign appears with the gaps evident
but the counterpart sign appears whole
 The hacked and scattered is found in the same places as those described under the cut up
Therefore after going there and getting it put together or putting it together in the way described under the cut up so that there is only a fingers breadth separating the pieces it should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the hacked and scattered repulsiveness of the hacked and scattered
Here when the learning sign becomes evident it does so with the fissures of the wounds
but the counterpart sign appears whole
The bleeding is found at the time when blood is trickling from the openings of wounds received on battlefields etc or from the openings of burst boils and abscesses when the hands and feet have been cut off
So on seeing that it should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the bleeding repulsiveness of the bleeding
Here the learning sign appears to have the aspect of moving like a red banner struck by wind
but the counterpart sign appears quiet
There is a worminfested corpse when at the end of two or three days a mass of maggots oozes out from the corpses nine orifices
and the mass lies there like a heap of paddy or boiled rice as big as the body whether the body is that of a dog a jackal a human being an ox a buffalo an elephant a horse a python or what you will
It can be brought to mind with respect to anyone of these as Repulsiveness of the worminfested repulsiveness of the worminfested
For the sign arose for the Elder CūḷaPiṇḍapātikaTissa in the corpse of an elephants carcass in the Kāḷadīghavāpi reservoir
Here the learning sign appears as though moving
but the counterpart sign appears quiet like a ball of boiled rice
A skeleton is described in various aspects in the way beginning As though he were looking at a corpse thrown onto a charnel ground a skeleton with flesh and blood held together by sinews 
So he should go in the way already described to where it has been put and noticing any stones etc with their surrounding signs and in relation to the object he should characterize it by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essence thus This is a skeleton and he should apprehend the sign in the eleven ways by colour and the rest
But if he looks at it apprehending it only by its colour as white it does not appear to him with its individual essence as repulsive but only as a variant of the white kasiṇa
Consequently he should only look at it as a skeleton in the repulsive aspect
Mark is a term for the hand etc here
so he should define it by its mark according to hand foot head chest arm waist thigh and shin
He should define it by its shape however according as it is long short square round small or large
By its direction and by its location are as already described 
Having defined it by its delimitation according to the periphery of each bone he should reach absorption by apprehending whichever appears most evident to him
But it can also be defined by its concavities and by its convexities according to the concave and convex places in each bone
And it can also be defined by position thus I am standing in a concave place the skeleton is in a convex place or I am standing in a convex place the skeleton is in a concave place
It should be defined by its joints according as any two bones are joined together
It should be defined by its openings according to the gaps separating the bones
It should be defined all round by directing knowledge to it comprehensively thus In this place there is this skeleton
If the sign does not arise even in this way then the mind should be established on the frontal bone
And in this case just as in the case of those that precede it beginning with the worminfested the apprehending of the sign should be observed in this elevenfold manner as appropriate
This meditation subject is successful with a whole skeleton frame and even with a single bone as well
So having learnt the sign in anyone of these in the eleven ways he should bring it to mind as Repulsiveness of a skeleton repulsiveness of a skeleton
Here the learning sign and the counterpart sign are alike so it is said That is correct for a single bone
But when the learning sign becomes manifest in a skeleton frame what is correct to say is that there are gaps in the learning sign
while the counterpart sign appears whole
And the learning sign even in a single bone should be dreadful and terrifying
but the counterpart sign produces happiness and joy because it brings access
 What is said in the Commentaries in this context allows that deduction
For there after saying this There is no counterpart sign in the four divine abidings and in the ten kinds of foulness
for in the case of the divine abidings the sign is the breaking down of boundaries itself
and in the case of the ten kinds of foulness the sign comes into being as soon as the repulsiveness is seen without any thinking about it it is again said immediately next Here the sign is twofold the learning sign and the counterpart sign
The learning sign appears hideous dreadful and terrifying and so on
So what we said was well considered And it is only this that is correct here
Besides the appearance of a womans whole body as a collection of bones to the Elder MahāTissa through his merely looking at her teeth demonstrates this here 
 The Divine Ruler with ten hundred eyes Did him  fair in fame This foulness of ten species in such wise
with the Ten Powers eulogize Who made known as cause of jhāna
To tackle each and how they are developed Now knowing their description and the way
There are some further points that will repay Study each with its special part to play
One who has reached jhāna in anyone of these goes free from cupidity he resembles an Arahant without greed because his greed has been well suppressed
At the same time however this classification of foulness should be understood as stated in accordance with the particular individual essences successively reached by the dead body and also in accordance with the particular subdivisions of the greedy temperament
When a corpse has entered upon the repulsive state it may have reached the individual essence of the bloated or anyone of the individual essences beginning with that of the livid
So the sign should be apprehended as Repulsiveness of the bloated Repulsiveness of the livid according to whichever he has been able to find This it should be understood is how the classification of foulness comes to be tenfold with the bodys arrival at each particular individual essence
And individually the bloated suits one who is greedy about shape since it makes evident the disfigurement of the bodys shape
The livid suits one who is greedy about the bodys colour since it makes evident the disfigurement of the skins colour
The festering suits one who is greedy about the smell of the body aroused by scents perfumes etc since it makes evident the evil smells connected with this sore the body
The cut up suits one who is greedy about compactness in the body since it makes evident the hollowness inside it
The gnawed suits one who is greedy about accumulation of flesh in such parts of the body as the breasts since it makes it evident how a fine accumulation of flesh comes to nothing
The scattered suits one who is greedy about the grace of the limbs since it makes it evident how limbs can be scattered
The hacked and scattered suits one who is greedy about a fine body as a whole since it makes evident the disintegration and alteration of the body as a whole
The bleeding suits one who is greedy about elegance produced by ornaments since it makes evident its repulsiveness when smeared with blood
The worminfested suits one who is greedy about ownership of the body since it makes it evident how the body is shared with many families of worms
A skeleton suits one who is greedy about fine teeth since it makes evident the repulsiveness of the bones in the body
This it should be understood is how the classification of foulness comes to be tenfold according to the subdivisions of the greedy temperament But as regards the tenfold foulness just as it is only by virtue of its rudder that a boat keeps steady in a river with turbulent waters and a rapid current and it cannot be steadied without a rudder so too here owing to the weak hold on the object consciousness when unified only keeps steady by virtue of applied thought and it cannot be steadied without applied thought which is why there is only the first jhāna here not the second and the rest
And repulsive as this object is still it arouses joy and happiness in him by his seeing its advantages thus Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and death and by his abandoning the hindrances oppression just as a garbage heap does in a flowerscavenger by his seeing the advantages thus Now I shall get a high wage and as the workings of purges and emetics do in a man suffering the pains of sickness
This foulness while of ten kinds has only one characteristic
For though it is of ten kinds nevertheless its characteristic is only its impure stinking disgusting and repulsive state 
And foulness appears with this characteristic not only in a dead body but also in a living one as it did to the Elder MahāTissa who lived at Cetiyapabbata  and to the novice attendant on the Elder Saṅgharakkhita while he was watching the king riding an elephant
For a living body is just as foul as a dead one
only the characteristic of foulness is not evident in a living body being hidden by adventitious embellishments
 This is the bodys nature it is a collection of over three hundred bones jointed by one hundred and eighty joints bound together by nine hundred sinews plastered over with nine hundred pieces of flesh enveloped in the moist inner skin enclosed in the outer cuticle with orifices here and there constantly dribbling and trickling like a grease pot inhabited by a community of worms the home of disease the basis of painful states perpetually oozing from the nine orifices like a chronic open carbuncle
from both of whose eyes eyefilth trickles from whose ears comes earfilth from whose nostrils snot from whose mouth food and bile and phlegm and blood from whose lower outlets excrement and urine and from whose ninetynine thousand pores the broth of stale sweat seeps
with bluebottles and their like buzzing round it
which when untended with tooth sticks and mouthwashing and headanointing and bathing and underclothing and dressing would judged by the universal repulsiveness of the body make even a king if he wandered from village to village with his hair in its natural wild disorder no different from a flowerscavenger or an outcaste or what you will So there is no distinction between a kings body and an outcastes in so far as its impure stinking nauseating repulsiveness is concerned
 But by rubbing out the stains on its teeth with tooth sticks and mouth washing and all that by concealing its private parts under several cloths by daubing it with various scents and salves by pranking it with nosegays and such things it is worked up into a state that permits of its being taken as I and mine
So men delight in women and women in men without perceiving the true nature of its characteristic foulness now masked by this adventitious adornment
But in the ultimate sense there is no place here even the size of an atom fit to lust after
And then when any such bits of it as head hairs body hairs nails teeth spittle snot excrement or urine have dropped off the body beings will not touch them they are ashamed humiliated and disgusted
But as long as anyone of these things remains in it though it is just as repulsive they take it as agreeable desirable permanent pleasant self because they are wrapped in the murk of ignorance and dyed with affection and greed for self
Taking it as they do they resemble the old jackal who saw a flower not yet fallen from a kiṃsuka tree in a forest and yearned after it thinking This is a piece of meat it is a piece of meat
 There was a jackal chanced to see A flowering kiṃsuka in a wood
In haste he went to where it stood I have found a meatbearing tree 
He chewed the blooms that fell but could
Of course find nothing fit to eat He took it thus Unlike the meat There on the tree this is no good
A wise man will not think to treat As foul only the part that fell
But treats as foul the part as well That in the body has its seat
And soon get caught in Evils snare They take the body to be fair
Fools cannot in their folly tell Nor can escape its painful spell
But since the wise have thus laid bare Be it alive or dead they know
This filthy bodys nature so There is no beauty lurking there
 For this is said
This filthy body stinks outright Like ordure like a privys site
This body men that have insight Condemn as object of a fools delight
A tumour where nine holes abide Wrapped in a coat of clammy hide
And trickling filth on every side Polluting the air with stenches far and wide
If it perchance should come about That what is inside it came out
Surely a man would need a knout With which to put the crows and dogs to rout
 So a capable bhikkhu should apprehend the sign whether in a living body
or in a dead one wherever the aspect of foulness is manifest and he should make the meditation subject reach absorption
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the Treatise on the Development of Concentration
called The Description of Foulness as a Meditation Subject
The sixth chapter
 Now ten recollections were listed next after the ten kinds of foulness  As to these Mindfulness itself is recollection because it arises again and again or alternatively the mindfulness that is proper for a clansman gone forth out of faith since it occurs only in those instances where it should occur is recollection  The recollection arisen inspired by the Enlightened One is the recollection of the Buddha This is a term for mindfulness with the Enlightened Ones special qualities as its object
The recollection arisen inspired by the Law is the recollection of the Dhamma This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of the Laws being well proclaimed etc as its object
The recollection arisen inspired by the Community is the recollection of the Saṅgha This is a term for mindfulness with the Communitys special qualities of being entered on the good way etc as its object
The recollection arisen inspired by virtue is the recollection of virtue This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of virtues untornness etc as its object
The recollection arisen inspired by generosity is the recollection of generosity This is a term for mindfulness with generositys special qualities of free generosity etc as its object
The recollection arisen inspired by deities is the recollection of deities This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of ones own faith etc as its object with deities standing as witnesses
The recollection arisen inspired by death is the recollection of death This is a term for mindfulness with the termination of the life faculty as its object
Mindfulness occupied with the body  it is gone to the material body that is analyzed into head hairs etc or it is gone into the body thus it is bodygone  It is bodygone and it is mindfulness  thus it is bodygone mindfulness  but instead of shortening the vowel thus in the usual way bodygone mindfulness is said This is a term for mindfulness that has as its object the sign of the bodily parts consisting of head hairs and the rest
The mindfulness arisen inspired by breathing is mindfulness of breathing This is a term for mindfulness that has as its object the sign of in breaths and outbreaths
The recollection arisen inspired by peace is the recollection of peace This is a term that has as its object the stilling of all suffering
 Now a meditator with absolute confidence who wants to develop firstly the recollection of the Enlightened One among these ten should go into solitary retreat in a favourable abode and recollect the special qualities of the Enlightened One the Blessed One as follows That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished fully enlightened endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct sublime the knower of worlds the incomparable leader of men to be tamed the teacher of gods and men enlightened and blessed 
Here is the way he recollects That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished he is such since he is fully enlightened  he is such since he is blessed he is so for these several reasons is what is meant
Herein what he recollects firstly is that the Blessed One is accomplished for the following reasons because of remoteness  and because of his enemies and the spokes having been destroyed  and because of his worthiness of requisites etc and because of absence of secret evildoing
 He stands utterly remote and far away from all defilements because he has expunged all trace of defilement by means of the pathbecause of such remoteness he is accomplished 
A man remote indeed we call From something he has not at all
The Saviour too that has no stain May well the name accomplished gain
 And these enemies  these defilements are destroyed by the pathbecause the enemies are thus destroyed he is accomplished also
The enemies that were deployed Greed and the rest have been destroyed
By his the Helpers wisdoms sword So he is accomplished  all accord
 Now this wheel of the round of rebirths with its hub made of ignorance and of craving for becoming with its spokes consisting of formations of merit and the rest with its rim of ageing and death which is joined to the chariot of the triple becoming by piercing it with the axle made of the origins of cankers  has been revolving throughout time that has no beginning All of this wheels spokes were destroyed by him at the Place of Enlightenment as he stood firm with the feet of energy on the ground of virtue wielding with the hand of faith the axe of knowledge that destroys kamma because the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished also
Or alternatively it is the beginningless round of rebirths that is called the wheel of the round of rebirths
Ignorance is its hub because it is its root
Ageinganddeath is its rim because it terminates it
The remaining ten states of the dependent origination are its spokes because ignorance is their root and ageinganddeath their termination Herein ignorance is unknowing about suffering and the rest
And ignorance in sensual becoming is a condition for formations in sensual becoming Ignorance in finematerial becoming is a condition for formations in finematerial becoming Ignorance in immaterial becoming is a condition for formations in immaterial becoming
 Formations in sensual becoming are a condition for rebirthlinking consciousness in sensual becoming And similarly with the rest
 Rebirthlinking consciousness in sensual becoming is a condition for mentalitymateriality in sensual becoming Similarly in finematerial becoming
In immaterial becoming it is a condition for mentality only
 Mentalitymateriality in sensual becoming is a condition for the sixfold base in sensual becoming Mentalitymateriality in finematerial becoming is a condition for three bases in finematerial becoming Mentality in immaterial becoming is a condition for one base in immaterial becoming
The sixfold base in sensual becoming is a condition for six kinds of contact in sensual becoming Three bases in finematerial becoming are conditions for three kinds of contact in finematerial becoming The mind base alone in immaterial becoming is a condition for one kind of contact in immaterial becoming
The six kinds of contact in sensual becoming are conditions for six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming Three kinds of contact in finematerial becoming are conditions for three kinds of feeling there too One kind of contact in immaterial becoming is a condition for one kind of feeling there too
 The six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming are conditions for the six groups of craving in sensual becoming Three in the finematerial becoming are for three there too One kind of feeling in the immaterial becoming is a condition for one group of craving in the immaterial becoming
The craving in the several kinds of becoming is a condition for the clinging there Clinging etc are the respective conditions for becoming and the rest
In what way
Here someone thinks I shall enjoy sense desires and with sense desire clinging as condition he misconducts himself in body speech and mind Owing to the fulfilment of his misconduct he reappears in a state of loss 
The kamma that is the cause of his reappearance there is kamma process becoming the aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirthprocess becoming the generating of the aggregates is birth their maturing is ageing their dissolution is death
Another thinks I shall enjoy the delights of heaven and in the parallel manner he conducts himself well Owing to the fulfilment of his good conduct he reappears in a sensualsphere heaven
The kamma that is the cause of his reappearance there is kammaprocess becoming and the rest as before
Another thinks I shall enjoy the delights of the Brahmāworld and with sensedesire clinging as condition he develops lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity Owing to the fulfilment of the meditative development he is reborn in the Brahmāworld
The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kammaprocess becoming and the rest is as before
 Yet another thinks I shall enjoy the delights of immaterial becoming and with the same condition he develops the attainments beginning with the base consisting of boundless space Owing to the fulfilment of the development he is reborn in one of these states
The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kammaprocess becoming the aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth process becoming the generating of the aggregates is birth their maturing is ageing their dissolution is death 
The remaining kinds of clinging are construable in the same way
 So Understanding of discernment of conditions thus Ignorance is a cause formations are causally arisen and both these states are causally arisen is knowledge of the causal relationship of states
Understanding of discernment of conditions thus In the past and in the future ignorance is a cause formations are causally arisen and both these states are causally arisen is knowledge of the causal relationship of states  and all the clauses should be given in detail in this way
 Herein ignorance and formations are one summarization consciousness mentalitymateriality the sixfold base contact and feeling are another craving clinging and becoming are another and birth and ageinganddeath are another
Here the first summarization is past the two middle ones are present and birth and ageinganddeath are future
When ignorance and formations are mentioned then also craving clinging and becoming are included too so these five states are the round of kamma in the past The five beginning with consciousness are the round of the kammaresult in the present When craving clinging and becoming are mentioned then also ignorance and formations are included too so these five states are the round of kamma in the present And because the five beginning with consciousness are described under the heading of birth and ageinganddeath these five states are the round of kammaresult in the future
These make twenty aspects in this way
And here there is one link between formations and consciousness one between feeling and craving one between becoming and birth  Now the Blessed One knew saw understood and penetrated in all aspects this dependent origination with its four summarizations its three times its twenty aspects and its three links
Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that Hence it was said Understanding of discernment of conditions is knowledge of the causal relationship of states 
Thus when the Blessed One by correctly knowing these states with knowledge of relations of states became dispassionate towards them when his greed faded away when he was liberated then he destroyed quite destroyed abolished the spokes of this wheel of the round of rebirths of the kind just described
Because the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished also
The spokes of rebirths wheel have been Destroyed with wisdoms weapon keen
By him the Helper of the World And so accomplished he is called
 And he is worthy of the requisites of robes etc and of the distinction of being accorded homage because it is he who is most worthy of offerings
For when a Perfect One has arisen important deities and human beings pay homage to none else
for Brahmā Sahampati paid homage to the Perfect One with a jewelled garland as big as Sineru
and other deities did so according to their means as well as human beings as King Bimbisāra of Magadha and the king of Kosala
And after the Blessed One had finally attained Nibbāna King Asoka renounced wealth to the amount of ninetysix million for his sake and founded eightfour thousand monasteries throughout all Jambudīpa 
And so with all these what need to speak of others Because of worthiness of requisites he is accomplished also
 And he does not act like those fools in the world who vaunt their cleverness and yet do evil but in secret for fear of getting a bad name Because of absence of secret evildoing he is accomplished also
No secret evil deed may claim An author so august the name
Accomplished is his deservedly By absence of such secrecy 
So in all ways
The Sage of remoteness unalloyed Vanquished defiling foes deployed
The spokes of rebirths wheel destroyed Worthy of requisites employed
Secret evil he does avoid For these five reasons he may claim This word accomplished for his name
 He is fully enlightened because he has discovered all things rightly and by himself 
In fact all things were discovered by him rightly by himself in that he discovered of the things to be directly known that they must be directly known  of the things to be fully understood that they must be fully understood  of the things to be abandoned that they must be abandoned  of the things to be realized that they must be realized  and of the things to be developed that they must be developed 
Hence it is said
What must be directly known is directly known What has to be developed has been developed
What has to be abandoned has been abandoned And that brahman is why I am enlightened 
 Besides he has discovered all things rightly by himself step by step thus The eye is the truth of suffering the prior craving that originates it by being its rootcause is the truth of origin the nonoccurrence of both is the truth of cessation the way that is the act of understanding cessation is the truth of the path And so too in the case of the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mind
And the following things should be construed in the same way the six bases beginning with visible objects the six groups of consciousness beginning with eyeconsciousness the six kinds of contact beginning with eyecontact the six kinds of feeling beginning with the eyecontactborn the six kinds of perception beginning with perception of visible objects the six kinds of volition beginning with volition about visible objects the six groups of craving beginning with craving for visible objects the six kinds of applied thought beginning with applied thought about visible objects the six kinds of sustained thought beginning with sustained thought about visible objects the five aggregates beginning with the aggregate of matter the ten kasiṇas the ten recollections the ten perceptions beginning with perception of the bloated the thirtytwo aspects of the body beginning with head hairs the twelve bases the eighteen elements the nine kinds of becoming beginning with sensual becoming the four jhānas beginning with the first the four measureless states beginning with the development of lovingkindness the four immaterial attainments the factors of the dependent origination in reverse order beginning with ageinganddeath and in forward order beginning with ignorance 
 Herein this is the construction of a single clause of the dependent origination Ageinganddeath is the truth of suffering birth is the truth of origin the escape from both is the truth of cessation the way that is the act of understanding cessation is the truth of the path In this way he has discovered progressively discovered completely discovered all states rightly and by himself step by step
Hence it was said above He is fully enlightened because he has discovered all things rightly and by himself 
He is endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct vijjācaraṇasampanno  vijjāhi caraṇena ca sampanno 
Herein as to clear vision there are three kinds of clear vision and eight kinds of clear vision
The three kinds should be understood as stated in the Bhayabherava Sutta  and the eight kinds as stated in the Ambattha Sutta 
For there eight kinds of clear vision are stated made up of the six kinds of directknowledge together with insight and the supernormal power of the mindmade body
 Virtuous conduct should be understood as fifteen things that is to say restraint by virtue guarding of the sense faculties knowledge of the right amount in eating devotion to wakefulness the seven good states and the four jhānas of the finematerial sphere
For it is precisely by means of these fifteen things that a noble disciple conducts himself that he goes towards the deathless That is why it is called virtuous conduct
according as it is said Here Mahānāma a noble disciple has virtue  etc the whole of which should be understood as given in the Middle Fifty of the Majjhima Nikāya
 Now the Blessed One is endowed with these kinds of clear vision and with this conduct as well
hence he is called endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct 
 Herein the Blessed Ones possession of clear vision consists in the fulfilment of omniscience 
while his possession of conduct consists in the fulfilment of the great compassion 
He knows through omniscience what is good and harmful for all beings and through compassion he warns them of harm and exhorts them to do good
That is how he is possessed of clear vision and conduct
which is why his disciples have entered upon the good way instead of entering upon the bad way as the selfmortifying disciples of those who are not possessed of clear vision and conduct have done
He is called sublime because of a manner of going that is good  because of being gone to an excellent place  because of having gone rightly  and because of enunciating rightly 
 A manner of going is called gone 
and that in the Blessed One is good  purified blameless
But what is that
It is the noble path
for by means of that manner of going he has gone without attachment in the direction of safetythus he is sublime because of a manner of going that is good
 And it is to the excellent place that he has gone  to the deathless Nibbānathus he is sublime also because of having gone to an excellent place
 And he has rightly gone  without going back again to the defilements abandoned by each path
For this is said He does not again turn return go back to the defilements abandoned by the stream entry path thus he is sublime  he does not again turn return go back to the defilements abandoned by the Arahant path thus he is sublime  Or alternatively he has rightly gone from the time of making his resolution at the feet of Dīpaṅkara up till the Enlightenment Session by working for the welfare and happiness of the whole world through the fulfilment of the thirty perfections and through following the right way without deviating towards either of the two extremes that is to say towards eternalism or annihilationism towards indulgence in sense pleasures or selfmortificationthus he is sublime also because of having gone rightly
 And he enunciates rightly  he speaks only fitting speech in the fitting placethus he is sublime also because of enunciating rightly
Here is a sutta that confirms this Such speech as the Perfect One knows to be untrue and incorrect conducive to harm and displeasing and unwelcome to others that he does not speak
And such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct but conducive to harm and displeasing and unwelcome to others that he does not speak
 And such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct conducive to good but displeasing and unwelcome to others that speech the Perfect One knows the time to expound
Such speech as the Perfect One knows to be untrue and incorrect and conducive to harm but pleasing and welcome to others that he does not speak
And such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct but conducive to harm though pleasing and welcome to others that he does not speak
And such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct conducive to good and pleasing and welcome to others that speech the Perfect One knows the time to expound 
thus he is sublime also because of enunciating rightly
He is the knower of worlds because he has known the world in all ways
For the Blessed One has experienced known and penetrated the world in all ways to its individual essence its arising its cessation and the means to its cessation
according as it is said Friend that there is a worlds end where one neither is born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor reappears which is to be known or seen or reached by travelthat I do not say Yet I do not say that there is ending of suffering without reaching the worlds end
Rather it is in this fathomlong carcass with its perceptions and its consciousness that I make known the world the arising of the world the cessation of the world and the way leading to the cessation of the world
Tis utterly impossible To reach by travel the worlds end
But there is no escape from pain Until the worlds end has been reached
It is a sage a knower of the worlds
Who gets to the worlds end and it is he Whose life divine is lived out to its term
He is at peace who the worlds end has known
And hopes for neither this world nor the next 
Moreover there are three worlds the world of formations the world of beings and the world of location
Herein in the passage One world all beings subsist by nutriment  the world of formations is to be understood
In the passage The world is eternal or The world is not eternal it is the world of beings
In the passage As far as moon and sun do circulate Shining and lighting up the four directions
Over a thousand times as great a world Your power holds unquestionable sway 
it is the world of location
The Blessed One has known that in all ways too
Likewise because of the words One world all beings subsist by nutriment
Two worlds mentality and materiality
Three worlds three kinds of feeling
Four worlds four kinds of nutriment
Five worlds five aggregates as objects of clinging
Six worlds six internal bases
Seven worlds seven stations of consciousness
Eight worlds eight worldly states
Nine worlds nine abodes of beings
Ten worlds ten bases
Twelve worlds twelve bases
Eighteen worlds eighteen elements  this world of formations was known to him in all ways
 But he knows all beings habits knows their inherent tendencies knows their temperaments knows their bents knows them as with little dust on their eyes and with much dust on their eyes with keen faculties and with dull faculties with good behaviour and with bad behaviour easy to teach and hard to teach capable and incapable of achievement 
therefore this world of beings was known to him in all ways
And as the world of beings so also the world of location
For accordingly this world measures as follows One worldsphere is twelve hundred thousand leagues and thirtyfour hundred and fifty leagues in breadth and width
In circumference however
The measure of it all around Is six and thirty hundred thousand
And then ten thousand in addition Four hundred too less half a hundred 
 Herein
Two times a hundred thousand leagues And then four nahutas as well 
This earth this Bearer of All Wealth Has that much thickness as they tell
And its support
Four times a hundred thousand leagues And then eight nahutas as well 
The water resting on the air Has that much thickness as they tell
And the support of that
Nine times a hundred thousand goes The air out in the firmament
And sixty thousand more besides So this much is the worlds extent
Such is its extent And these features are to be found in it
plunges down into the sea Full four and eighty thousand leagues
Sineru tallest of all mountains and towers up in like degree
Seven concentric mountain rings surround Sineru in suchwise That each of them in depth and height is half its predecessors size
Yugandhara sadhara Karavīka Sudassana
Nemindhara Vinataka Assakaṇṇa  Vast ranges called
Heavenly breezes fan their cliffs agleam with gems and here reside
The Four Kings of the Cardinal Points and other gods and sprites beside
Himālayas lofty mountain mass rises in height five hundred leagues
And in its width and in its breadth it covers quite three thousand leagues
And then it is bedecked besides with four and eighty thousand peaks
The Jambu Tree called Nāga lends the name by its magnificence To Jambudīpas land its trunk thrice five leagues in circumference Soars fifty leagues and bears all round branches of equal amplitude So that a hundred leagues define diameter and altitude
 And the size of the Jambu Tree is the same as that of the Citrapāṭaliya Tree of the Asura demons the Simbali Tree of the Garuḷa demons the Kadamba Tree in the western continent of Aparagoyana the Kappa Tree in the northern continent of the Uttarakurus the Sirīsa Tree in the eastern continent of Pubbavideha and the Pāricchattaka Tree in the heaven of the Deities of the Thirtythree 
Hence the Ancients said
The Pāṭali Simbali and Jambu the deities Pāricchattaka
The Kadamba the Kappa Tree and the Sirīsa as the seventh
The Worldsphere Mountains line of summits plunges down into the sea Just two and eighty thousand leagues and towers up in like degree Enringing one worldelement all round in its entirety
 Herein the moons disk is fortynine leagues across
and the suns disk is fifty leagues
The realm of Tāvatiṃsa is ten thousand leagues
Likewise the realm of the Asura demons the great Avīci Hell and Jambudīpa 
Aparagoyāna is seven thousand leagues
Likewise Pubbavideha
Uttarakurū is eight thousand leagues
And herein each great continent is surrounded by five hundred small islands
And the whole of that constitutes a single worldsphere a single worldelement
Between this and the adjacent worldspheres are the Lokantarika hells
So the worldspheres are infinite in number the world elements are infinite and the Blessed One has experienced known and penetrated them with the infinite knowledge of the Enlightened Ones
Therefore this world of location was known to him in all ways too
So he is knower of worlds because he has seen the world in all ways
 In the absence of anyone more distinguished for special qualities than himself there is no one to compare with him thus he is incomparable
For in this way he surpasses the whole world in the special quality of virtue and also in the special qualities of concentration understanding deliverance and knowledge and vision of deliverance
In the special quality of virtue he is without equal he is the equal only of those other Enlightened Ones without equal he is without like without double without counterpart  in the special quality of knowledge and vision of deliverance he is  without counterpart
according as it is said I do not see in the world with its deities its Māras and its Brahmās in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans with its princes and men anyone more perfect in virtue than myself  with the rest in detail
and likewise in the Aggappasāda Sutta  and so on and in the stanzas beginning I have no teacher and my like does not exist in all the world  all of which should be taken in detail
 He guides men to be tamed  thus he is leader of men to be tamed 
he tames he disciplines is what is meant
Herein animal males and human males and nonhuman males that are not tamed but fit to be tamed are men to be tamed 
For the animal males namely the royal nāga Apalāla Cūḷodara Mahodara Aggisikha Dhūmasikha the royal nāga ravāḷa the elephant Dhanapālaka and so on were tamed by the Blessed One freed from the poison of defilement and established in the refuges and the precepts of virtue and also the human males namely Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son the brahman student Ambaṭṭha Pokkharasāti Soṇadaṇḍa Kūṭadanta and so on and also the nonhuman males namely the spirits ḷavaka Sūciloma and Kharaloma Sakka Ruler of Gods etc were tamed and disciplined by various disciplinary means
And the following sutta should be given in full here I discipline men to be tamed sometimes gently Kesi and I discipline them sometimes roughly and I discipline them sometimes gently and roughly 
Then the Blessed One moreover further tames those already tamed doing so by announcing the first jhāna etc respectively to those whose virtue is purified etc and also the way to the higher path to stream enterers and so on
Or alternatively the words incomparable leader of men to be tamed can be taken together as one clause
For the Blessed One so guides men to be tamed that in a single session they may go in the eight directions by the eight liberations without hesitation
Thus he is called the incomparable leader of men to be tamed
And the following sutta passage should be given in full here Guided by the elephanttamer bhikkhus the elephant to be tamed goes in one direction  
He teaches by means of the here and now of the life to come and of the ultimate goal according as befits the case thus he is the Teacher 
And furthermore this meaning should be understood according to the Niddesa thus Teacher  the Blessed One is a caravan leader since he brings home caravans 
Just as one who brings a caravan home gets caravans across a wilderness gets them across a robberinfested wilderness gets them across a wildbeastinfested wilderness gets them across a foodless wilderness gets them across a waterless wilderness gets them right across gets them quite across gets them properly across gets them to reach a land of safety so too the Blessed One is a caravan leader one who brings home the caravans he gets them across a wilderness gets them across the wilderness of birth 
Of gods and men devamanussānaṃ  devānañ ca manussānañ ca 
This is said in order to denote those who are the best and also to denote those persons capable of progress
For the Blessed One as a teacher bestowed his teaching upon animals as well
For when animals can through listening to the Blessed Ones Dhamma acquire the benefit of a suitable rebirth as support for progress and with the benefit of that same support they come in their second or third rebirth to partake of the path and its fruition
Maṇḍūka the deitys son and others illustrate this
While the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma to the inhabitants of the city of Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lake it seems a frog apprehended a sign in the Blessed Ones voice A cowherd who was standing leaning on a stick put his stick on the frogs head and crushed it
He died and was straight away reborn in a gilded divine palace twelve leagues broad in the realm of the Thirty three 
He found himself there as if waking up from sleep amidst a host of celestial nymphs and he exclaimed So I have actually been reborn here What deed did I do  When he sought for the reason he found it was none other than his apprehension of the sign in the Blessed Ones voice
He went with his divine palace at once to the Blessed One and paid homage at his feet
Though the Blessed One knew about it he asked him
Who now pays homage at my feet Shining with glory of success
Illuminating all around With beauty so outstanding 
In my last life I was a frog The waters of a pond my home
A cowherds crook ended my life While listening to your Dhamma 
The Blessed One taught him the Dhamma
Eightyfour thousand creatures gained penetration to the Dhamma
As soon as the deitys son became established in the fruition of streamentry he smiled and then vanished
He is enlightened with the knowledge that belongs to the fruit of liberation since everything that can be known has been discovered by him
Or alternatively he discovered the four truths by himself and awakened others to them thus and for other such reasons he is enlightened 
And in order to explain this meaning the whole passage in the Niddesa beginning thus He is the discoverer of the truths thus he is enlightened 
He is the awakened of the generation thus he is enlightened   or the same passage from the Paṭisambhidā  should be quoted in detail
 Blessed is a term signifying the respect and veneration accorded to him as the highest of all beings and distinguished by his special qualities
Hence the Ancients said
Blessed is the best of words Blessed is the finest word
Deserving awe and veneration Blessed is the name therefore
Or alternatively names are of four kinds denoting a period of life describing a particular mark signifying a particular acquirement and fortuitously arisen
which last in the current usage of the world is called capricious
Herein names denoting a period of life are those such as yearling calf  steer to be trained  yoke ox  and the like
Names describing a particular mark are those such as staffbearer  umbrellabearer  topknotwearer  hand possessor  and the like
Names signifying a particular acquirement are those such as possessor of the threefold clear vision  possessor of the six directknowledges  and the like
Such names are Sirivaḍḍhaka  Dhanavaḍḍhaka  etc are fortuitously arisen names they have no reference to the wordmeanings
 This name Blessed is one signifying a particular acquirement it is not made by MahāMāyā or by King Suddhodana or by the eighty thousand kinsmen or by distinguished deities like Sakka Santusita and others
And this is said by the General of the Law Blessed this is not a name made by a mother  This name Buddha which signifies final liberation is a realistic description of Buddhas  the Blessed Ones together with their obtainment of omniscient knowledge at the root of an Enlightenment Tree 
Now in order to explain also the special qualities signified by this name they cite the following stanza
The reverend one has blessings  is a frequenter  a partaker  a possessor of what has been analyzed 
He has caused abolishing  he is fortunate 
He has fully developed himself in many ways
He has gone to the end of becoming  thus is called Blessed 
The meaning of these words should be understood according to the method of explanation given in the Niddesa 
But there is this other way
He is fortunate  possessed of abolishment  associated with blessings  and a possessor of what has been analyzed 
He has frequented  and he has rejected going in the kinds of becoming  thus he is Blessed 
 Herein by using the characteristic of language beginning with vowel augmentation of syllable elision of syllable  or by using the characteristic of insertion beginning with the example of pisodara etc  it may be known that he can also be called blessed when he can be called fortunate owing to the fortunateness to have reached the further shore of the ocean of perfection of giving virtue etc which produce mundane and supramundane bliss 
 for he has abolished all the hundred thousand kinds of trouble anxiety and defilement classed as greed as hate as delusion and as misdirected attention as consciencelessness and shamelessness as anger and enmity as contempt and domineering as envy and avarice as deceit and fraud as obduracy and presumption as pride and haughtiness as vanity and negligence as craving and ignorance as the three roots of the unprofitable kinds of misconduct defilement stains fictitious perceptions applied thoughts and diversifications as the four perversenesses cankers ties floods bonds bad ways cravings and clingings as the five wildernesses in the heart shackles in the heart hindrances and kinds of delight as the six roots of discord and groups of craving as the seven inherent tendencies as the eight wrongnesses as the nine things rooted in craving as the ten courses of unprofitable action as the sixtytwo kinds of false view as the hundred and eight ways of behaviour of cravingor in brief the five Māras that is to say the Māras of defilement of the aggregates and of kammaformations Māra as a deity and Māra as death
Similarly he can also be called blessed when he can be called possessed of abolishment owing to the following menaces having been abolished
And in this context it is said
He has abolished greed and hate Delusion too he is cankerfree
Abolished every evil state Blessed his name may rightly be
 And by his fortunateness is indicated the excellence of his material body which bears a hundred characteristics of merit
and by his having abolished defects is indicated the excellence of his Dhamma body
Likewise by his fortunateness is indicated the esteem of worldly people and by his having abolished defects the esteem of those who resemble him And by his fortunateness it is indicated that he is fit to be relied on by laymen and by his having abolished defects that he is fit to be relied on by those gone forth into homelessness and when both have relied on him they acquire relief from bodily and mental pain as well as help with both material and Dhamma gifts and they are rendered capable of finding both mundane and supramundane bliss
Now in the world the word blessing is used for six things namely lordship Dhamma fame glory wish and endeavour He has supreme lordship over his own mind either of the kind reckoned as mundane and consisting in minuteness lightness etc or that complete in all aspects
and likewise the supramundane Dhamma
And he has exceedingly pure fame spread through the three worlds acquired though the special quality of veracity
And he has glory of all limbs perfect in every aspect which is capable of comforting the eyes of people eager to see his material body
And he has his wish in other words the production of what is wanted since whatever is wanted and needed by him as beneficial to himself or others is then and there produced for him
And he has the endeavour in other words the right effort which is the reason why the whole world venerates him
He is also called blessed since he is associated with blessings such as those of the following kind in the sense that he has those blessings 
owing to his having analyzed and clarified all states into the three classes beginning with the profitable or profitable etc states into such classes as aggregates bases elements truths faculties dependent origination etc or the noble truth of suffering into the senses of oppressing being formed burning and changing and that of origin into the senses of accumulating source bond and impediment and that of cessation into the senses of escape seclusion being unformed and deathless and that of the path into the senses of outlet cause seeing and predominance Having analyzed having revealed having shown them is what is meant
He can also be called blessed when he can be called a possessor of what has been analyzed 
He can also be called blessed when he can be called one who has frequented owing to his having frequented  cultivated repeatedly practiced such mundane and supramundane higherthanhuman states as the heavenly the divine and the noble abidings as bodily mental and existential seclusion as the void the desireless and the signless liberations and others as well
He can also be called blessed when he can be called one who has rejected going in the kinds of becoming because in the three kinds of becoming  the going  in other words craving has been rejected by him And the syllables bha from the word bhava and ga from the word gamana and va from the word vanta with the letter a lengthened make the word bhagavā just as is done in the world of the grammarians outside the Dispensation with the word mekhalā since garland for the private parts can be said
 As long as the meditator recollects the special qualities of the Buddha in this way For this and this reason the Blessed One is accomplished  for this and this reason he is blessed then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion
his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Perfect One 
 So when he has thus suppressed the hindrances by preventing obsession by greed etc and his mind faces the meditation subject with rectitude then his applied thought and sustained thought occur with a tendency toward the Enlightened Ones special qualities
As he continues to exercise applied thought and sustained thought upon the Enlightened Ones special qualities happiness arises in him
With his mind happy with happiness as a proximate cause his bodily and mental disturbances are tranquilized by tranquillity
When the disturbances have been tranquilized bodily and mental bliss arise in him
When he is blissful his mind with the Enlightened Ones special qualities for its object becomes concentrated and so the jhāna factors eventually arise in a single moment
But owing to the profundity of the Enlightened Ones special qualities or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption
And that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of the Buddha too because it arises with the recollection of the Enlightened Ones special qualities as the means
When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Buddha he is respectful and deferential towards the Master He attains fullness of faith mindfulness understanding and merit He has much happiness and gladness He conquers fear and dread He is able to endure pain He comes to feel as if he were living in the Masters presence
And his body when the recollection of the Buddhas special qualities dwells in it becomes as worthy of veneration as a shrine room
His mind tends toward the plane of the Buddhas
When he encounters an opportunity for transgression he has awareness of conscience and shame as vivid as though he were face to face with the Master
And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destiny
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection of the Buddha Blessed with such mighty potency
This firstly is the section dealing with the recollection of the Enlightened One in the detailed explanation
One who wants to develop the recollection of the Dhamma should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of both the Dhamma of the scriptures and the ninefold supramundane Dhamma as follows The Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One visible here and now not delayed  inviting of inspection onwardleading and directly experienceable by the wise 
Well proclaimed in this clause the Dhamma of the scriptures is included as well as the other in the rest of the clauses only the supramundane Dhamma is included
Herein the Dhamma of the scriptures is well proclaimed because it is good in the beginning the middle and the end and because it announces the life of purity that is utterly perfect and pure with meaning and with detail 
Even a single stanza of the Blessed Ones teaching is good in the beginning with the first word good in the middle with the second third etc and good in the end with the last word because the Dhamma is altogether admirable
A sutta with a single sequence of meaning is good in the beginning with the introduction good in the end with the conclusion and good in the middle with what is in between
A sutta with several sequences of meaning is good in the beginning with the first sequence of meaning good in the end with the last sequence of meaning and good in the middle with the sequences of meaning in between
Furthermore it is good in the beginning with the introduction giving the place of and the origin giving the reason for its utterance It is good in the middle because it suits those susceptible of being taught since it is unequivocal in meaning and reasoned with cause and example It is good in the end with its conclusion that inspires faith in the hearers
Also the entire Dhamma of the Dispensation is good in the beginning with virtue as ones own wellbeing It is good in the middle with serenity and insight and with path and fruition It is good in the end with Nibbāna
Or alternatively it is good in the beginning with virtue and concentration It is good in the middle with insight and the path It is good in the end with fruition and Nibbāna
Or alternatively it is good in the beginning because it is the good discovery made by the Buddha It is good in the middle because it is the wellregulatedness of the Dhamma It is good in the end because it is the good way entered upon by the Saṅgha
Or alternatively it is good in the beginning as the discovery of what can be attained by one who enters upon the way of practice in conformity after hearing about it It is good in the middle as the unproclaimed enlightenment of Paccekabuddhas It is good in the end as the enlightenment of disciples
And when listened to it does good through hearing it because it suppresses the hindrances thus it is good in the beginning And when made the way of practice it does good through the way being entered upon because it brings the bliss of serenity and insight thus it is good in the middle And when it has thus been made the way of practice and the fruit of the way is ready it does good through the fruit of the way because it brings unshakable equipoise thus it is good in the end So it is well proclaimed because of being good in the beginning the middle and the end
Now the life of purity that is to say the life of purity of the Dispensation and the life of purity of the path which the Blessed One announces which he shows in various ways when he teaches the Dhamma is with meaning because of perfection of meaning and it is with detail because of perfection of detail as it is proper that it should be
It is with meaning because it conforms to the words declaring its meaning by pronouncing clarifying revealing expounding and explaining it It is with detail because it has perfection of syllables words details style language and descriptions
It is with meaning owing to profundity of meaning and profundity of penetration It is with detail owing to profundity of law and profundity of teaching
It is with meaning because it is the province of the discriminations of meaning and of perspicuity It is with detail because it is the province of the discriminations of law and of language 
It is with meaning since it inspires confidence in persons of discretion being experienceable by the wise It is with detail since it inspires confidence in worldly persons being a fit object of faith
It is with meaning because its intention is profound It is with detail because its words are clear
It is utterly perfect with the complete perfection due to absence of anything that can be added
It is pure with the immaculateness due to absence of anything to be subtracted
 Furthermore it is with meaning because it provides the particular distinction of achievement through practice of the way and it is with detail because it provides the particular distinction of learning through mastery of scripture It is utterly perfect because it is connected with the five aggregates of Dhamma beginning with virtue  It is pure because it has no imperfection because it exists for the purpose of crossing over the round of rebirths flood  and because it is not concerned with worldly things So it is well proclaimed because it announces the life of purity that is utterly perfect and pure with meaning and with detail 
Or alternatively it is well proclaimed since it has been properly proclaimed with no perversion of meaning
For the meaning of other sectarians law suffers perversion since there is actually no obstruction in the things described there as obstructive and actually no outlet in the things described there as outlets
which is why their law is illproclaimed but not so the Blessed Ones Law whose meaning suffers no perversion
since the things described there as obstructions and the things described there as outlets are so in actual fact
So in the first place the Dhamma of the scriptures is well proclaimed
 The supramundane Dhamma is well proclaimed since both the way that accords with Nibbāna and the Nibbāna that accords with the way have been proclaimed
according as it is said The way leading to Nibbāna has been properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One and Nibbāna and the way meet
Just as the water of the Ganges meets and joins with the water of the Yamunā so too the way leading to Nibbāna has been properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One and Nibbāna and the way meet 
And here the noble path which is the middle way since it does not approach either extreme is well proclaimed in being proclaimed to be the middle way
The fruits of asceticism where defilements are tranquilized are well proclaimed too in being proclaimed to have tranquilized defilement
Nibbāna whose individual essence is eternal deathless the refuge the shelter etc is well proclaimed too in being proclaimed to have an individual essence that is eternal and so on So the supramundane Dhamma is also well proclaimed 
Visible here and now firstly the noble path is visible here and now since it can be seen by a noble person himself when he has done away with greed etc in his own continuity
according as it is said When a man is dyed with greed brahman and is overwhelmed and his mind is obsessed by greed then he thinks for his own affliction he thinks for others affliction he thinks for the affliction of both
and he experiences mental suffering and grief
When greed has been abandoned he neither thinks for his own affliction nor thinks for others affliction nor thinks for the affliction of both and he does not experience mental suffering and grief
This brahman is how the Dhamma is visible here and now 
Furthermore the ninefold supramundane Dhamma is also visible here and now since when anyone has attained it it is visible to him through reviewing knowledge without his having to rely on faith in another
Or alternatively the view that is recommended is proper view  It conquers by means of proper view thus it has proper view 
For in this way the noble path conquers defilements by means of the proper view associated with it and the noble fruition does so by means of the proper view that is its cause and Nibbāna does so by means of the proper view that has Nibbāna as its objective field
So the ninefold supramundane Dhamma has the proper view since it conquers by means of proper view just as a charioteer is so called because he conquers by means of a chariot 
 Or alternatively it is seeing that is called the seen 
then diṭṭha and sandiṭṭha are identical in meaning as seeing
It is worthy of being seen  thus it is visible here and now 
For the supramundane Dhamma arrests the fearful round of kamma etc as soon as it is seen by means of penetration consisting in development of the path and by means of penetration consisting in realization of Nibbāna
So it is visible here and now since it is worthy of being seen  just as one who is clothable is so called because he is worthy of clothes 
It has no delay in the matter of giving its own fruit thus it is without delay 
Without delay is the same as not delayed 
What is meant is that instead of giving its fruit after creating a delay  say five days seven days it gives its fruit immediately next to its own occurrence 
 Or alternatively what is delayed is what needs some distant time to be reached before it can give its fruit
What is that
It is the mundane law of profitable kamma
This however is undelayed because its fruit comes immediately next to it so it is not delayed 
This is said with reference to the path
It is worthy of an invitation to inspect given thus Come and see this Dhamma  thus it is inviting of inspection 
But why is it worthy of this invitation
Because it is found and because of its purity
For if a man has said that there is money or gold in an empty fist he cannot say Come and see it
Why not
Because it is not found
And on the other hand while dung or urine may well be found a man cannot for the purpose of cheering the mind by exhibiting beauty say Come and see this
on the contrary they have to be covered up with grass and leaves
Why
Because of their impurity
But this ninefold supramundane Dhamma is actually found as such in its individual essence and it is as pure as the full moons disk in a cloudless sky as a gem of pure water on bleached cloth
 Consequently it is worthy of the invitation to inspect since it is found and pure thus it is inviting of inspection 
 The word opanayika is equivalent to the gerund upanetabba 
Here is an exposition An inducing is an inducement  As the four paths and four fruitions this Dhamma is worth inducing that is arousing in ones own mind subjectively by means of development without any question of whether or not ones clothing or ones head is on fire 
thus it is onwardleading 
This applies to the abovementioned eight formed supramundane states 
But the unformed dhamma is worth inducing by ones own mind to become the minds object thus it is onward leading too
the meaning is that it is worth treating as ones shelter by realizing it
 Or alternatively what induces the noble person onwards to Nibbāna is the noble path which is thus inductive 
Again what can be induced to realizability is the Dhamma consisting in fruition and Nibbāna which is thus inductive  too
The word upaneyya is the same as the word opanayika
Is directly experienceable by the wise it can be experienced by all the kinds of wise men beginning with the acutely wise each in himself thus The path has been developed fruition attained and cessation realized by me
For it does not happen that when a preceptor has developed the path his co resident abandons his defilements nor does a coresident dwell in comfort owing to the preceptors attainment of fruition nor does he realize the Nibbāna realized by the preceptor
So this is not visible in the way that an ornament on anothers head is but rather it is visible only in ones own mind
What is meant is that it can be undergone by wise men but it is not the province of fools
 Now in addition this Dhamma is well proclaimed
Why
Because it is visible here and now
It is visible here and now because it is not delayed
It is not delayed because it invites inspection
And what invites inspection is onward leading
As long as the meditator recollects the special qualities of the Dhamma in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed
or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion
his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Dhamma  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment
But owing to the profundity of the Dhammas special qualities or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption
And that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of the Dhamma too because it arises with the recollection of the Dhammas special qualities as the means
 When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Dhamma he thinks I never in the past met a master who taught a law that led onward thus who possessed this talent nor do I now see any such a master other than the Blessed One  Seeing the Dhammas special qualities in this way he is respectful and deferential towards the Master
He entertains great reverence for the Dhamma and attains fullness of faith and so on He has much happiness and gladness He conquers fear and dread He is able to endure pain He comes to feel as if he were living in the Dhammas presence And his body when the recollection of the Dhammas special qualities dwells in it becomes as worthy of veneration as a shrine room His mind tends towards the realization of the peerless Dhamma When he encounters an opportunity for transgression he has vivid awareness of conscience and shame on recollecting the wellregulatedness of the Dhamma
And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destiny
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection of the Dhamma Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of the Dhamma in the detailed explanation
One who wants to develop the recollection of the Community should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of the community of Noble Ones as follows The community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the good way the community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the straight way the community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the true way the community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the proper way that is to say the four pairs of men the eight persons this community of the Blessed Ones disciples is fit for gifts fit for hospitality fit for offerings fit for reverential salutation as an incomparable field of merit for the world 
 Herein entered on the good way is thoroughly entered on the way  What is meant is that it has entered on a way that is the right way  the way that is irreversible the way that is in conformity with truth the way that has no opposition the way that is regulated by the Dhamma
They hear attentively the Blessed Ones instruction thus they are his disciples 
The community of the disciples is the community of those disciples The meaning is that the total of disciples forms a communality because it possesses in common both virtue and right view
 That right way being straight unbent uncrooked unwarped is called noble and true and is known as proper owing to its becomingness
therefore the noble community that has entered on that is also said to have entered on the straight way entered on the true way and entered on the proper way
Those who stand on the path can be understood to have entered on the good way since they possess the right way
And those who stand in fruition can be understood to have entered on the good way with respect to the way that is now past since by means of the right way they have realized what should be realized
 Furthermore the Community has entered on the good way because it has entered on the way according as instructed in the wellproclaimed Dhamma and Discipline  and because it has entered on the immaculate way
It has entered on the straight way because it has entered on the way avoiding the two extremes and taking the middle course and because it has entered on the way of the abandonment of the faults of bodily and verbal crookedness tortuousness and warpedness
 because Nibbāna is what is called true
It has entered on the true way and it has entered on the way with that as its aim
It has entered on the proper way because it has entered on the way of those who are worthy of proper acts of veneration
 The word yadidaṃ  yāni imāni
The four pairs of men taking them pairwise the one who stands on the first path and the one who stands in the first fruition as one pair in this way there are four pairs
The eight persons taking them by persons the one who stands on the first path as one and the one who stands in the first fruition as one in this way there are eight persons
And there in the compound purisapuggala the words purisa and puggala have the same meaning
but it is expressed in this way to suit differing susceptibility to teaching
This community of the Blessed Ones disciples this community of the Blessed Ones disciples taken by pairs as the four pairs of men and individually as the eight persons  As to fit for gifts etc what should be brought and given is a gift  the meaning is what is to be brought even from far away and donated to the virtuous
It is a term for the four requisites
The Community is fit to receive that gift because it makes it bear great fruit thus it is fit for gifts 
Or alternatively all kinds of property even when the bringer comes from far away can be given here thus the Community can be given to 
or it is fit to be given to by Sakka and others thus it can be given to
And the brahmans fire is called to be given to  for they believe that what is sacrificed to it brings great fruit
 But if something is to be sacrificed to for the sake of the great fruit brought by what is sacrificed to it then surely the Community should be sacrificed to
for what is sacrificed to the Community has great fruit
according as it is said
Were anyone to serve the fire Out in the woods a hundred years
And pay one moments homage too To men of selfdevelopment
His homage would by far excel His hundred years of sacrifice 
And the words āhavanīya  which is used in the schools is the same in meaning as this word āhuneyya used here
There is only the mere trifling difference of syllables
So it is fit for gifts 
Fit for hospitality  hospitality is what a donation to visitors is called prepared with all honours for the sake of dear and beloved relatives and friends who have come from all quarters
But even more than to such objects of hospitality it is fitting that it should be given also to the Community
for there is no object of hospitality so fit to receive hospitality as the Community
since it is encountered after an interval between Buddhas and possesses wholly endearing and lovable qualities
So it is fit for hospitality since the hospitality is fit to be given to it and it is fit to receive it
But those who take the text to be pāhavanīya have it that the Community is worthy to be placed first and so what is to be given should first of all be brought here and given  and for that reason it is fit to be given hospitality to
or since it is worthy to be given to in all aspects  it is thus fit to be given hospitality to 
And here this is called pāhuneyya in the same sense
Offering is what a gift is called that is to be given out of faith in the world to come
The Community is worthy of that offering or it is helpful to that offering because it purifies it by making it of great fruit thus it is fit for offerings 
It is worthy of being accorded by the whole world the reverential salutation consisting in placing both hands palms together above the head thus it is fit for reverential salutation 
As an incomparable field of merit for the world as a place without equal in the world for growing merit
just as the place for growing the kings or ministers rice or corn is the kings ricefield or the kings cornfield so the Community is the place for growing the whole worlds merit
For the worlds various kinds of merit leading to welfare and happiness grow with the Community as their support
Therefore the Community is an incomparable field of merit for the world
 As long as he recollects the special qualities of the Saṅgha in this way classed as having entered on the good way etc then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed
or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion
his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Saṅgha  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment
But owing to the profundity of the Communitys special qualities or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption
And that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of the Saṅgha too because it arises with the recollection of the Communitys special qualities as the means
When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Community he is respectful and deferential towards the Community
He attains fullness of faith and so on He has much happiness and bliss He conquers fear and dread He is able to endure pain He comes to feel as if he were living in the Communitys presence
And his body when the recollection of the Sanghas special qualities dwells in it becomes as worthy of veneration as an Uposatha house where the Community has met His mind tends towards the attainment of the Communitys special qualities When he encounters an opportunity for transgression he has awareness of conscience and shame as vividly as if he were face to face with the Community And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destiny
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection of the Saṅgha Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of the Community in the detailed explanation
 One who wants to develop the recollection of virtue should go into solitary retreat and recollect his own different kinds of virtue in their special qualities of being untorn etc as follows Indeed my various kinds of virtue are untorn unrent unblotched unmottled liberating praised by the wise not adhered to and conducive to concentration 
And a layman should recollect them in the form of laymens virtue while one gone forth into homelessness should recollect them in the form of the virtue of those gone forth
 Whether they are the virtues of laymen or of those gone forth when no one of them is broken in the beginning or in the end not being torn like a cloth ragged at the ends then they are untorn
When no one of them is broken in the middle not being rent like a cloth that is punctured in the middle then they are unrent
When they are not broken twice or thrice in succession not being blotched like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with discrepantcoloured oblong or round patch appearing on her back or belly then they are unblotched
When they are not broken all over at intervals not being mottled like a cow speckled with discrepantcoloured spots then they are unmottled
 Or in general they are untorn unrent unblotched unmottled when they are undamaged by the seven bonds of sexuality and by anger and enmity and the other evil things 
 Those same virtues are liberating since they liberate by freeing from the slavery of craving
They are praised by the wise because they are praised by such wise men as Enlightened Ones
They are not adhered to since they are not adhered to with craving and false view or because of the impossibility of misapprehending that There is this flaw in your virtues
They are conducive to concentration since they conduce to access concentration and absorption concentration or to path concentration and fruition concentration
 As long as he recollects his own virtues in their special qualities of being untorn etc in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed
or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion
his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by virtue  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment
But owing to the profundity of the virtues special qualities or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption
And that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of virtue too because it arises with the virtues special qualities as the means
 And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of virtue he has respect for the training He lives in communion with his fellows in the life of purity He is sedulous in welcoming He is devoid of the fear of selfreproach and so on He sees fear in the slightest fault He attains fullness of faith and so on He has much happiness and gladness
And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destiny
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection of his virtue Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of virtue in the detailed explanation
 One who wants to develop the recollection of generosity should be naturally devoted to generosity and the constant practice of giving and sharing
Or alternatively if he is one who is starting the development of it he should make the resolution From now on when there is anyone present to receive I shall not eat even a single mouthful without having given a gift And that very day he should give a gift by sharing according to his means and his ability with those who have distinguished qualities When he has apprehended the sign in that he should go into solitary retreat and recollect his own generosity in its special qualities of being free from the stain of avarice etc as follows It is gain for me it is great gain for me that in a generation obsessed by the stain of avarice I abide with my heart free from stain by avarice and am freely generous and openhanded that I delight in relinquishing expect to be asked and rejoice in giving and sharing 
 Herein it is gain for me it is my gain advantage The intention is I surely partake of those kinds of gain for a giver that have been commended by the Blessed One as follows A man who gives life by giving food shall have life either divine or human  and A giver is loved and frequented by many  and One who gives is ever loved according to the wise mans law  and so on
 It is great gain for me it is great gain for me that this Dispensation or the human state has been gained by me
Why
Because of the fact that I abide with my mind free from stain by avarice  and rejoice in giving and sharing
 Herein obsessed by the stain of avarice is overwhelmed by the stain of avarice
Generation beings so called owing to the fact of their being generated
So the meaning here is this among beings who are overwhelmed by the stain of avarice which is one of the dark states that corrupt the natural transparency of consciousness and which has the characteristic of inability to bear sharing ones own good fortune with others
 Free from stain by avarice because of being both free from avarice and from the other stains greed hate and the rest
I abide with my heart I abide with my consciousness of the kind already stated is the meaning
But in the sutta I live the home life with my heart free  etc is said because it was taught there as a mental abiding to depend on constantly to Mahānāma the Sakyan who was a streamenterer asking about an abiding to depend on
There the meaning is I live overcoming 
 Freely generous liberally generous
Openhanded with hands that are purified
What is meant is with hands that are always washed in order to give gifts carefully with ones own hands
That I delight in relinquishing the act of relinquishing is relinquishing  the meaning is giving up
To delight in relinquishing is to delight in constant devotion to that relinquishing
Expect to be asked  accustomed to being asked because of giving whatever others ask for is the meaning
Yājayoga is a reading
in which case the meaning is devoted to sacrifice  in other words to sacrificing 
And rejoice in sharing
the meaning is he recollects thus I give gifts and I share out what is to be used by myself and I rejoice in both
 As long as he recollects his own generosity in its special qualities of freedom from stain by avarice etc in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed
or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion
his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by generosity  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment
But owing to the profundity of the generositys special qualities or owing to his being occupied in recollecting the generositys special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption
And that access jhāna is known as recollection of generosity too because it arises with the generositys special qualities as the means
 And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of generosity he becomes ever more intent on generosity his preference is for nongreed he acts in conformity with lovingkindness he is fearless He has much happiness and gladness And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destiny
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection of his giving Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of generosity in the detailed explanation
 One who wants to develop the recollection of deities should possess the special qualities of faith etc evoked by means of the noble path recollect his own special qualities of faith etc with deities standing as witnesses as follows
and he should go into solitary retreat and There are deities of the Realm of the Four Kings  there are deities of the Realm of the Thirtythree  there are deities who are Gone to Divine Bliss  who are Contented  who Delight in Creating  who Wield Power Over Others Creations  there are deities of Brahmās Retinue  there are deities higher than that And those deities were possessed of faith such that on dying here they were reborn there and such faith is present in me too
And those deities were possessed of virtue 
of learning 
of generosity 
of understanding such that when they died here they were reborn there and such understanding is present in me too 
 In the sutta however it is said On the occasion Mahānāma on which a noble disciple recollects the faith the virtue the learning the generosity and the understanding that are both his own and of those deities on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed  
Although this is said it should nevertheless be understood as said for the purpose of showing that the special qualities of faith etc in oneself are those in the deities making the deities stand as witnesses
For it is said definitely in the Commentary He recollects his own special qualities making the deities stand as witnesses
 As long as in the prior stage he recollects the deities special qualities of faith etc and in the later stage he recollects the special qualities of faith etc existing in himself then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed
or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by deities  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already stated  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment
But owing to the profundity of the special qualities of faith etc or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption
And that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of deities too because it arises with the deities special qualities as the means
 And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of deities he becomes dearly loved by deities He obtains even greater fullness of faith He has much happiness and gladness
And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destiny
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection of deities Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of deities in the detailed explanation
 Now in setting forth the detail of these recollections after the words His mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Perfect One it is added When a noble disciples mind has rectitude Mahānāma the meaning inspires him the law inspires him and the application of the law makes him glad When he is glad happiness is born in him  Herein the meaning inspires him should be understood as said of contentment inspired by the meaning beginning This Blessed One is such since he is  
The law inspires him is said of contentment inspired by the text
The application of the law makes him glad is said of both 
 And when in the case of the recollection of deities inspired by deities is said this should be understood as said either of the consciousness that occurs in the prior stage inspired by deities or of the consciousness that occurs in the later stage inspired by the special qualities that are similar to those of the deities and are productive of the deities state 
 These six recollections succeed only in noble disciples
For the special qualities of the Enlightened One the Law and the Community are evident to them
and they possess the virtue with the special qualities of untornness etc the generosity that is free from stain by avarice and the special qualities of faith etc similar to those of deities
 And in the Mahānāma Sutta they are expounded in detail by the Blessed One in order to show a streamwinner an abiding to depend upon when he asked for one
 Also in the Gedha Sutta  Here bhikkhus a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One in this way That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished  His mind has rectitude on that occasion He has renounced got free from emerged from cupidity
Cupidity bhikkhus is a term for the five cords of sense desire
Some beings gain purity here by making this recollection their prop  they are expounded in order that a noble disciple should purify his consciousness by means of the recollections and so attain further purification in the ultimate sense thus 
 And in the Sambādhokāsa Sutta taught by the venerable MahāKaccāna they are expounded as the realization of the wideopen through the susceptibility of purification that exists in the ultimate sense only in a noble disciple thus It is wonderful friends it is marvellous how the realization of the wideopen in the crowded house life has been discovered by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened for the purification of beings for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the ending of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realization of Nibbāna that is to say the six stations of recollection
What six
Here friends a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One  Some beings are susceptible to purification in this way 
 Also in the Uposatha Sutta And what is the Noble Ones Uposatha Visākhā
It is the gradual cleansing of the mind still sullied by imperfections
And what is the gradual cleansing of the mind still sullied by imperfections
Here Visākhā a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One   they are expounded in order to show the greatness of the fruit of the Uposatha as a mindpurifying meditation subject for a noble disciple who is observing the Uposatha
 And in the Book of Elevens  One who has faith is successful Mahānāma not one who has no faith
One who is energetic  One whose mindfulness is established  One who is concentrated  One who has understanding is successful Mahānāma not one who has no understanding
Having established yourself in these five things Mahānāma you should develop six things
Here Mahānāma you should recollect the Perfect One That Blessed One is such since   when a noble disciple has asked Venerable sir in what way should we abide who abide in various ways they are expounded to him in order to show the way of abiding in this way 
 Still though this is so they can be brought to mind by an ordinary man too if he possesses the special qualities of purified virtue and the rest
For when he is recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha etc even only according to hearsay his consciousness settles down
by virtue of which the hindrances are suppressed In his supreme gladness he initiates insight and he even attains to Arahantship like the Elder Phussadeva who dwelt at Kaṭakandhakāra
 That venerable one it seems saw a figure of the Enlightened One created by Māra He thought How good this appears despite its having greed hate and delusion What can the Blessed Ones goodness have been like For he was quite without greed hate and delusion  He acquired happiness with the Blessed One as object and by augmenting his insight he reached Arahantship
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the Treatise on the Development of Concentration
called The Description of Six Recollections
The seventh chapter
 Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness of death which was listed next 
Herein death is the interruption of the life faculty included within the limits of a single becoming 
But death as termination  in other words the Arahants termination of the suffering of the round is not intended here nor is momentary death in other words the momentary dissolution of formations nor the death of conventional usage in such expressions as dead tree dead metal and so on
As intended here it is of two kinds that is to say timely death and untimely death
Herein timely death comes about with the exhaustion of merit or with the exhaustion of a life span or with both
Untimely death comes about through kamma that interrupts other lifeproducing kamma
Herein death through exhaustion of merit is a term for the kind of death that comes about owing to the result of former rebirthproducing kammas having finished ripening although favourable conditions for prolonging the continuity of a life span may be still present
Death through exhaustion of a life span is a term for the kind of death that comes about owing to the exhaustion of the normal life span of men of today which measures only a century owing to want of such excellence in destiny as deities have or in time as there is at the beginning of an aeon or in nutriment as the Uttarakurus and so on have
Untimely death is a term for the death of those whose continuity is interrupted by kamma capable of causing them to fall from their place at that very moment as in the case of DūsiMāra  Kalāburājā  etc or for the death of those whose lifes continuity is interrupted by assaults with weapons etc due to previous kamma
All these are included under the interruption of the life faculty of the kinds already stated
So mindfulness of death is the remembering of death in other words of the interruption of the life faculty
One who wants to develop this should go into solitary retreat and exercise attention wisely in this way Death will take place the life faculty will be interrupted or Death death
If he exercises his attention unwisely in recollecting the possible death of an agreeable person sorrow arises as in a mother on recollecting the death of her beloved child she bore
and gladness arises in recollecting the death of a disagreeable person as in enemies on recollecting the death of their enemies
and no sense of urgency arises on recollecting the death of neutral people as happens in a corpseburner on seeing a dead body
and anxiety arises on recollecting ones own death as happens in a timid person on seeing a murderer with a poised dagger
In all that there is neither mindfulness nor sense of urgency nor knowledge
So he should look here and there at beings that have been killed or have died and advert to the death of beings already dead but formerly seen enjoying good things doing so with mindfulness with a sense of urgency and with knowledge after which he can exercise his attention in the way beginning Death will take place
By so doing he exercises it wisely He exercises it as a right means is the meaning
When some exercise it merely in this way their hindrances get suppressed their mindfulness becomes established with death as its object and the meditation subject reaches access
But one who finds that it does not get so far should do his recollecting of death in eight ways that is to say as having the appearance of a murderer as the ruin of success by comparison as to sharing the body with many as to the frailty of life as signless as to the limitedness of the extent as to the shortness of the moment
 Herein as having the appearance of a murderer he should do his recollecting thus
Just as a murderer appears with a sword thinking I shall cut this mans head off and applies it to his neck so death appears
Why
Because it comes with birth and it takes away life
As budding toadstools always come up lifting dust on their tops so beings are born along with aging and death
For accordingly their rebirthlinking consciousness reaches aging immediately next to its arising and then breaks up together with its associated aggregates like a stone that falls from the summit of a rock
So to begin with momentary death comes along with birth
But death is inevitable for what is born consequently the kind of death intended here also comes along with birth
 Therefore just as the risen sun moves on towards its setting and never turns back even for a little while from wherever it has got to
or just as a mountain torrent sweeps by with a rapid current ever flowing and rushing on and never turning back even for a little while so too this living being travels on towards death from the time when he is born and he never turns back even for a little while
Hence it is said
Right from the very day a man Has been conceived inside a womb
He cannot but go on and on Nor going can he once turn back 
 And whilst he goes on thus death is as near to him as drying up is to rivulets in the summer heat as falling is to the fruits of trees when the sap reaches their attachments in the morning as breaking is to clay pots tapped by a mallet as vanishing is to dewdrops touched by the suns rays
Hence it is said
The nights and days go slipping by As life keeps dwindling steadily
Till mortals span like water pools In failing rills is all used up 
As there is fear when fruits are ripe That in the morning they will fall
So mortals are in constant fear When they are born that they will die
And as the fate of pots of clay Once fashioned by the potters hand
Or small or big or baked or raw
Condemns them to be broken up So mortals life leads but to death 
The dewdrop on the blade of grass Vanishes when the sun comes up
Such is a human span of life So mother do not hinder me 
So this death which comes along with birth is like a murderer with poised sword And like the murderer who applies the sword to the neck it carries off life and never returns to bring it back
That is why since death appears like a murderer with poised sword owing to its coming along with birth and carrying off life it should be recollected as having the appearance of a murderer 
 As the ruin of success here success shines as long as failure does not overcome it And the success does not exist that might endure out of reach of failure
Accordingly
He gave with joy a hundred millions After conquering all the earth
Till in the end his realm came down To less than half a gallnuts worth
Yet when his merit was used up His body breathing its last breath
The Sorrowless Asoka too Felt sorrow face to face with death 
 Furthermore all health ends in sickness all youth ends in aging all life ends in death all worldly existence is procured by birth haunted by aging surprised by sickness and struck down by death
Hence it is said
As though huge mountains made of rock So vast they reached up to the sky
Were to advance from every side Grinding beneath them all that lives
So age and death roll over all
Warriors priests merchants and craftsmen The outcastes and the scavengers
Crushing all beings sparing none
And here no troops of elephants No charioteers no infantry
No strategy in form of spells No riches serve to beat them off 
This is how death should be recollected as the ruin of success by defining it as deaths final ruining of lifes success
 By comparison by comparing oneself to others
Herein death should be recollected by comparison in seven ways that is to say with those of great fame with those of great merit with those of great strength with those of great supernormal power with those of great understanding with Paccekabuddhas with fully enlightened Buddhas
How
 Although Mahāsammata Mandhātu Mahāsudassana Daḷhanemi Nimi etc were greatly famous and had a great following and though they had amassed enormous wealth yet death inevitably caught up with them at length so how shall it not at length overtake me
Great kings like Mahāsammata Whose fame did spread so mightily
All fell into deaths power too What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way firstly by comparison with those of great fame
How by comparison with those of great merit
Jotika Jaṭila Ugga And Meṇḍaka and Puṇṇaka
These the world said and others too Did live most meritoriously
Yet they came one and all to death What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great merit
How by comparison with those of great strength
Vāsudeva Baladeva Bhīmasena Yuddhiṭṭhila
And Cāṇura the wrestler Were in the Exterminators power
Throughout the world they were renowned As blessed with strength so mighty
They too went to the realm of death What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great strength
How by comparison with those of great supernormal power
Who with the point of his great toe Did rock Vejayantas Palace towers
The second of the chief disciples The foremost in miraculous powers
Like a deer in a lions jaw he too Despite miraculous potency
Fell in the dreadful jaws of death What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great supernormal power
How by comparison with those of great understanding
The first of the two chief disciples Did so excel in wisdoms art
That save the Helper of the World No being is worth his sixteenth part
But though so great was Sāriputtas Understanding faculty
He fell into deaths power too What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great understanding
How by comparison with Paccekabuddhas
Even those who by the strength of their own knowledge and energy crushed all the enemy defilements and reached enlightenment for themselves who stood alone like the horn of the rhinoceros  who were selfperfected were still not free from death So how should I be free from it
To help them in their search for truth The Sages various signs employed
Their knowledge brought them selfperfection Their cankers were at length destroyed
Like the rhinoceross horn They lived alone in constancy
But death they could no way evade What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with Paccekabuddhas
How by comparison with fully enlightened Buddhas
Even the Blessed One whose material body was embellished with the eighty lesser details and adorned with the thirtytwo marks of a great man  whose Dhamma body brought to perfection the treasured qualities of the aggregates of virtue etc made pure in every aspect who overpassed greatness of fame greatness of merit greatness of strength greatness of supernormal power and greatness of understanding who had no equal who was the equal of those without equal without double accomplished and fully enlightenedeven he was suddenly quenched by the downpour of deaths rain as a great mass of fire is quenched by the downpour of a rain of water
And so the Greatest Sage possessed Such mighty power in every way
And it was not through fear or guilt That over him Death held his sway
No being not even one without Guilt or pusillanimity But will be smitten down
so how I Will he not conquer those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with fully enlightened Buddhas
 When he does his recollecting in this way by comparing himself with others possessed of such great fame etc in the light of the universality of death thinking Death will come to me even as it did to those distinguished beings then his meditation subject reaches access
This is how death should be recollected by comparison
 As to the sharing of the body with many this body is shared by many
Firstly it is shared by the eighty families of worms There too creatures live in dependence on the outer skin feeding on the outer skin creatures live in dependence on the inner skin feeding on the inner skin creatures live in dependence on the flesh feeding on the flesh creatures live in dependence on the sinews feeding on the sinews creatures live in dependence on the bones feeding on the bones and creatures live in dependence on the marrow feeding on the marrow
And there they are born grow old and die evacuate and make water
and the body is their maternity home their hospital their charnelground their privy and their urinal
The body can also be brought to death with the upsetting of these worms
And just as it is shared with the eighty families of worms so too it is shared by the several hundred internal diseases as well as by such external causes of death as snakes scorpions and what not
And just as when a target is set up at a crossroads and then arrows spears pikes stones etc come from all directions and fall upon it so too all kinds of accidents befall the body
and it also comes to death through these accidents befalling it
Hence the Blessed One said Here bhikkhus when day is departing and night is drawing on a bhikkhu considers thus In many ways I can risk death A snake may bite me or a scorpion may sting me or a centipede may sting me I might die of that and that would set me back Or I might stumble and fall or the food I have eaten might disagree with me or my bile might get upset or my phlegm might get upset and sever my joints as it were like knives I might die of that and that would set me back 
That is how death should be recollected as to sharing the body with many
 As to the frailty of life this life is impotent and frail
For the life of beings is bound up with breathing it is bound up with the postures it is bound up with cold and heat it is bound up with the primary elements and it is bound up with nutriment
 Life occurs only when the inbreaths and outbreaths occur evenly
But when the wind in the nostrils that has gone outside does not go in again or when that which has gone inside does not come out again then a man is reckoned to be dead
And it occurs only when the four postures are found occurring evenly
But with the prevailing of anyone of them the life process is interrupted
And it occurs only when cold and heat are found occurring evenly
But it fails when a man is overcome by excessive cold or heat
And it occurs only when the four primary elements are found occurring evenly
But with the disturbance of the earth element even a strong mans life can be terminated if his body becomes rigid or with the disturbance of one of the elements beginning with water if his body becomes flaccid and petrified with a flux of the bowels etc or if he is consumed by a bad fever or if he suffers a severing of his limbjoint ligatures 
And life occurs only in one who gets physical nutriment at the proper time but if he gets none he uses his life up
This is how death should be recollected as to the frailty of life
 As signless as indefinable The meaning is that it is unpredictable
For in the case of all beings
The span the sickness and the time and where The body will be laid the destiny
The living world can never know these things There is no sign foretells when they will be
Herein firstly the span has no sign because there is no definition such as Just so much must be lived no more than that
For beings die in the various stages of the embryo namely at the time of the kalala of the abbuda of the pesi of the ghana at one month gone two months gone three months gone four months gone five months gone  ten months gone
and on the occasion of coming out of the womb
And after that they die this side or the other of the century
And the sickness has no sign because there is no definition such as Beings die only of this sickness not of any other
For beings die of eye disease or of any one among those beginning with ear disease 
And the time has no sign because there is no definition such as One has to die only at this time not at any other
For beings die in the morning and at any of the other times such as noon
 And where the body will be laid down has no sign because there is no definition such as When people die they must drop their bodies only here not anywhere else
For the person of those born inside a village is dropped outside the village
and that of those born outside the village is dropped inside it
Likewise that of those born in water is dropped on land and that of those born on land in water And this can be multiplied in many ways
 And the destiny has no sign because there is no definition such as One who dies there must be reborn here
For there are some who die in a divine world and are reborn in the human world and there are some who die in the human world and are reborn in a divine world and so on And in this way the world goes round and round the five kinds of destinies like an ox harnessed to a machine This is how death should be recollected as signless
 As to the limitedness of the extent the extent of human life is short now
One who lives long lives a hundred years more or less
Hence the Blessed One said Bhikkhus this human life span is short There is a new life to be gone to there are profitable deeds to be done there is the life of purity to be led There is no not dying for the born
He who lives long lives a hundred years more or less 
The life of humankind is short A wise man holds it in contempt
And acts as one whose head is burning Death will never fail to come 
And he said further Bhikkhus there was once a teacher called Araka   all of which sutta should be given in full adorned as it is with seven similes
 And he said further Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live a night and day that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me
and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live a day that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me
                          
and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me
these are called bhikkhus who dwell in negligence and slackly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction of cankers
 And bhikkhus when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live for as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me
and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live as long as it takes to breathe in and breathe out or as long as it takes to breathe out and breathe in that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me
these are called bhikkhus who dwell in diligence and keenly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction of cankers 
So short in fact is the extent of life that it is not certain even for as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls
 As to the shortness of the moment in the ultimate sense the lifemoment of living beings is extremely short being only as much as the occurrence of a single conscious moment
Just as a chariot wheel when it is rolling rolls that is touches the ground only on one point of the circumference of its tire and when it is at rest rests only on one point so too the life of living beings lasts only for a single conscious moment
When that consciousness has ceased the being is said to have ceased
according as it is said In a past conscious moment he did live not he does live not he will live
In a future conscious moment not he did live not he does live he will live
In the present conscious moment not he did live he does live not he will live
Life person pleasure painjust these alone
Join in one conscious moment that flicks by
Ceased aggregates of those dead or alive
Are all alike gone never to return
No world is born if consciousness is not Produced when that is present then it lives
When consciousness dissolves the world is dead The highest sense this concept will allow 
This is how death should be recollected as to the shortness of the moment
So while he does his recollecting by means of one or other of these eight ways his consciousness acquires the support of repetition owing to the reiterated attention mindfulness settles down with death as its object the hindrances are suppressed and the jhāna factors make their appearance
But since the object is stated with individual essences and since it awakens a sense of urgency the jhāna does not reach absorption and is only access
Now with special development the supramundane jhāna and the second and the fourth immaterial jhānas reach absorption even with respect to states with individual essences
For the supramundane reaches absorption by means of progressive development of the purification
and the immaterial jhānas do so by means of development consisting in the surmounting of the object
since there in those two immaterial jhānas there is merely the surmounting of the object of jhāna that had already reached absorption
But here in mundane mindfulness of death there is neither
so the jhāna only reaches access
And that access is known as mindfulness of death too since it arises through its means
 A bhikkhu devoted to mindfulness of death is constantly diligent He acquires perception of disenchantment with all kinds of becoming  He conquers attachment to life He condemns evil He avoids much storing He has no stain of avarice about requisites Perception of impermanence grows in him following upon which there appear the perceptions of pain and notself
But while beings who have not developed mindfulness of death fall victims to fear horror and confusion at the time of death as though suddenly seized by wild beasts spirits snakes robbers or murderers he dies undeluded and fearless without falling into any such state
And if he does not attain the deathless here and now he is at least headed for a happy destiny on the breakup of the body
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection about death Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of death in the detailed explanation
 Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject which is never promulgated except after an Enlightened Ones arising and is outside the province of any sectarians It has been commended by the Blessed One in various ways in different suttas thus Bhikkhus when one thing is developed and repeatedly practiced it leads to a supreme sense of urgency
 to supreme benefit
to supreme surcease of bondage
to supreme mindfulness and full awareness
to acquisition of knowledge and vision
to a happy life here and now
to realization of the fruit of clear vision and deliverance
What is that one thing
It is mindfulness occupied with the body 
And thus Bhikkhus they savour the deathless who savour mindfulness occupied with the body
they do not savour the deathless who do not savour mindfulness occupied with the body
They have savoured the deathless who have savoured mindfulness occupied with the body they have not savoured  They have neglected  they have not neglected  They have missed  they have found the deathless who have found mindfulness occupied with the body  And it has been described in fourteen sections in the passage beginning And how developed bhikkhus how repeatedly practiced is mindfulness occupied with the body of great fruit of great benefit
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu gone to the forest   that is to say the sections on breathing on postures on the four kinds of full awareness on attention directed to repulsiveness on attention directed to elements and on the nine charnelground contemplations
Herein the three that is to say the sections on postures on the four kinds of full awareness  and on attention directed to elements as they are stated in that sutta deal with insight
Then the nine sections on the charnel ground contemplations as stated there deal with that particular phase of insight knowledge called contemplation of danger
And any development of concentration in the bloated etc that might be implied there has already been explained in the Description of Foulness 
So there are only the two that is the sections on breathing and on directing attention to repulsiveness that as stated there deal with concentration
Of these two the section on breathing is a separate meditation subject namely mindfulness of breathing
What is intended here as mindfulness occupied with the body is the thirty two aspects This meditation subject is taught as the direction of attention to repulsiveness thus Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and contained in the skin as full of many kinds of filth thus
 In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidney heart liver midriff spleen lungs bowels entrails gorge dung bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urine  the brain being included in the bone marrow in this version with a total of only thirtyone aspects
Here is the description of the development introduced by a commentary on the text
This body this filthy body constructed out of the four primary elements
Up from the soles of the feet from the soles of the feet upwards
Down from the top of the hair from the highest part of the hair downwards
Contained in the skin terminated all round by the skin
Reviews  as full of many kinds of filth he sees that this body is packed with the filth of various kinds beginning with head hairs
How
In this body there are head hairs  urine 
 Herein there are means there are found
In this in this which is expressed thus Up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and contained in the skin as full of many kinds of filth
 Body the carcass
for it is the carcass that is called body because it is a conglomeration of filth because such vile things as the head hairs etc and the hundred diseases beginning with eye disease have it as their origin 
Head hairs body hairs these things beginning with head hairs are the thirty two aspects
The construction here should be understood in this way In this body there are head hairs in this body there are body hairs
 No one who searches throughout the whole of this fathomlong carcass starting upwards from the soles of the feet starting downwards from the top of the head and starting from the skin all round ever finds even the minutest atom at all beautiful in it such as a pearl or a gem or beryl or aloes or saffron or camphor or talcum powder on the contrary he finds nothing but the various very malodorous offensive drablooking sorts of filth consisting of the head hairs body hairs and the rest
Hence it is said In this body there are head hairs body hairs  urine 
This is the commentary on the wordconstruction here
Now a clansman who as a beginner wants to develop this meditation subject should go to a good friend of the kind already described and learn it
And the teacher who expounds it to him should tell him the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving attention
Herein the sevenfold skill in learning should be told thus as verbal recitation as mental recitation as to colour as to shape as to direction as to location as to delimitation
 This meditation subject consists in giving attention to repulsiveness Even if one is master of the Tipiṭaka the verbal recitation should still be done at the time of first giving it attention
For the meditation subject only becomes evident to some through recitation as it did to the two elders who learned the meditation subject from the Elder Mahā Deva of the Hill Country 
On being asked for the meditation subject it seems the elder gave the text of the thirtytwo aspects saying Do only this recitation for four months
 Although they were familiar respectively with two and three Piṭakas it was only at the end of four months of recitation of the meditation subject that they became streamenterers with right apprehension of the text
So the teacher who expounds the meditation subject should tell the pupil to do the recitation verbally first
Now when he does the recitation he should divide it up into the skin pentad etc and do it forwards and backwards
After saying Head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin he should repeat it backwards Skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
Next to that with the kidney pentad after saying Flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidney he should repeat it backwards Kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
Next with the lungs pentad after saying Heart liver midriff spleen lungs he should repeat it backwards Lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
Next with the brain pentad after saying Bowels entrails gorge dung brain he should repeat it backwards Brain dung gorge entrails bowels lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
Next with the fat sextad after saying Bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat he should repeat it backwards Fat sweat blood pus phlegm bile brain dung gorge entrails bowels lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
Next with the urine sextad after saying Tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints urine he should repeat it backwards Urine oil of the joints snot spittle grease tears fat sweat blood pus phlegm bile brain dung gorge entrails bowels lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
 The recitation should be done verbally in this way a hundred times a thousand times even a hundred thousand times
For it is through verbal recitation that the meditation subject becomes familiar and the mind being thus prevented from running here and there
the parts become evident and seem like the fingers of a pair of clasped hands like a row of fence posts
 The mental recitation should be done just as it is done verbally
For the verbal recitation is a condition for the mental recitation
and the mental recitation is a condition for the penetration of the characteristic of foulness
 As to colour the colour of the head hairs etc should be defined
 As to shape their shape should be defined too
 As to direction in this body upwards from the navel is the upward direction and downwards from it is the downward direction So the direction should be defined thus This part is in this direction 
 As to location the location of this or that part should be defined thus This part is established in this location 
 As to delimitation there are two kinds of delimitation that is delimitation of the similar and delimitation of the dissimilar
Herein delimitation of the similar should be understood in this way This part is delimited above and below and around by this
 Delimitation of the dissimilar should be understood as nonintermixedness in this way Head hairs are not body hairs and body hairs are not head hairs 
When the teacher tells the skill in learning in seven ways thus he should do so knowing that in certain suttas this meditation subject is expounded from the point of view of repulsiveness and in certain suttas from the point of view of elements
For in the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta it is expounded only as repulsiveness
In the Mahā Hatthipadopama Sutta  in the Mahā Rāhulovāda Sutta  and the Dhātuvibhaṅga  it is expounded as elements
In the Kāyagatāsati Sutta  however four jhānas are expounded with reference to one to whom it has appeared as a colour kasiṇa 
Herein it is an insight meditation subject that is expounded as elements
and a serenity meditation subject that is expounded as repulsiveness
Consequently it is only the serenity meditation subject that is relevant here
Having thus told the sevenfold skill in learning he should tell the tenfold skill in giving attention as follows as to following the order not too quickly not too slowly as to warding off distraction as to surmounting the concept as to successive leaving as to absorption  as to the three suttantas
 Herein as to following the order from the time of beginning the recitation attention should be given following the serial order without skipping
For just as when someone who has no skill climbs a thirtytworung ladder using every other step his body gets exhausted and he falls without completing the climb so too one who gives it attention skipping parts becomes exhausted in his mind and does not complete the development since he fails to get the satisfaction that ought to be got with successful development
 Also when he gives attention to it following the serial order he should do so not too quickly
For just as when a man sets out on a threeleague journey even if he has already done the journey out and back a hundred times rapidly without taking note of turnings to be taken and avoided though he may finish his journey he still has to ask how to get there so too when the meditator gives his attention to the meditation subject too quickly though he may reach the end of the meditation subject it still does not become clear or bring about any distinction So he should not give his attention to it too quickly
 And as not too quickly so also not too slowly
For just as when a man wants to do a threeleague journey in one day if he loiters on the way among trees rocks pools etc he does not finish the journey in a day and needs two or three to complete it so too if the meditator gives his attention to the meditation subject too slowly he does not get to the end and it does not become a condition for distinction
 As to warding off distraction he must ward off temptation to drop the meditation subject and to let his mind get distracted among the variety of external objects
For if not just as when a man has entered on a onefootwide cliff path if he looks about here and there without watching his step he may miss his footing and fall down the cliff which is perhaps as high as a hundred men so too when there is outward distraction the meditation subject gets neglected and deteriorates
So he should give his attention to it warding off distraction
 As to surmounting the concept this name concept beginning with head hairs body hairs must be surmounted and consciousness established on the aspect repulsive
 For just as when men find a water hole in a forest in a time of drought they hang up some kind of signal there such as a palm leaf and people come to bathe and drink guided by the signal body hairs
but when the way has become plain with their continual traffic there is no further need of the signal and they go to bathe and drink there whenever they want so too when repulsiveness becomes evident to him as he is giving his attention to the meditation subject through the means of the name concept head hairs
he must surmount the concept head hairs body hairs and establish consciousness on only the actual repulsiveness
 As to successive leaving in giving his attention he should eventually leave out any parts that do not appear to him
For when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs his attention then carries on till it arrives at the last part that is urine and stops there
and when he gives his attention to urine his attention then carries on till it arrives back at the first part that is head hairs and stops there
As he persists in giving his attention thus some parts appear to him and others do not
Then he should work on those that have appeared till one out of any two appears the clearer
He should arouse absorption by again and again giving attention to the one that has appeared thus
Here is a simile Suppose a hunter wanted to catch a monkey that lived in a grove of thirtytwo palms and he shot an arrow through a leaf of the palm that stood at the beginning and gave a shout then the monkey went leaping successively from palm to palm till it reached the last palm and when the hunter went there too and did as before it came back in like manner to the first palm and being followed thus again and again after leaping from each place where a shout was given it eventually jumped on to one palm and firmly seizing the palm shoots leaf spike in the middle would not leap any more even when shotso it is with this
The application of the simile is this The thirtytwo parts of the body are like the thirtytwo palms in the grove
The monkey is like the mind
The meditator is like the hunter
The range of the meditators mind in the body with its thirtytwo parts as object is like the monkeys inhabiting the palm grove of thirtytwo palms
The settling down of the meditators mind in the last part after going successively from part to part when he began by giving his attention to head hairs is like the monkeys leaping from palm to palm and going to the last palm when the hunter shot an arrow through the leaf of the palm where it was and gave a shout
Likewise in the return to the beginning
His doing the preliminary work on those parts that have appeared leaving behind those that did not appear while as he gave his attention to them again and again some appeared to him and some did not is like the monkeys being followed and leaping up from each place where a shout is given
The meditators repeated attention given to the part that in the end appears the more clearly of any two that have appeared to him and his finally reaching absorption is like the monkeys eventually stopping in one palm firmly seizing the palm shoots leaf spike in the middle and not leaping up even when shot
 There is another simile too Suppose an almsfoodeater bhikkhu went to live near a village of thirtytwo families and when he got two lots of alms at the first house he left out one house beyond it
and next day when he got three lots of alms at the first house he left out two houses beyond it
and on the third day he got his bowl full at the first house and went to the sitting hall and ate
so it is with this
The thirtytwo aspects are like the village with the thirtytwo families
The meditator is like the almsfood eater
The meditators preliminary work is like the almsfood eaters going to live near the village
The meditators continuing to give attention after leaving out those parts that do not appear and doing his preliminary work on the pair of parts that do appear is like the almsfood eaters getting two lots of alms at the first house and leaving out one house beyond it and like his next day getting three lots of alms at the first house and leaving out two houses beyond it
The arousing of absorption by giving attention again and again to that which has appeared the more clearly of two is like the almsfood eaters getting his bowl full at the first house on the third day and then going to the sitting hall and eating
 As to absorption as to absorption part by part The intention here is this it should be understood that absorption is brought about in each one of the parts
  As to the three suttantas the intention here is this it should be understood that the three suttantas namely those on higher consciousness on coolness and on skill in the enlightenment factors have as their purpose the linking of energy with concentration
 Herein
Bhikkhus there are three signs that should be given attention from time to time by a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness
The sign of concentration should be given attention from time to time
the sign of exertion should be given attention from time to time
the sign of equanimity should be given attention from time to time
If a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention only to the sign of concentration then his consciousness may conduce to idleness
If a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention only to the sign of exertion then his consciousness may conduce to agitation
If a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention only to the sign of equanimity then his consciousness may not become rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers
But bhikkhus when a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention from time to time to the sign of concentration  to the sign of exertion  to the sign of equanimity then his consciousness becomes malleable wieldy and bright it is not brittle and becomes rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers
Bhikkhus just as a skilled goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice prepares his furnace and heats it up and puts crude gold into it with tongs and he blows on it from time to time sprinkles water on it from time to time and looks on at it from time to time
and if the goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice only blew on the crude gold it would burn and
if he only sprinkled water on it it would cool down
and if he only looked on at it it would not get rightly refined
but when the goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice blows on the crude gold from time to time sprinkles water on it from time to time and looks on at it from time to time then it becomes malleable wieldy and bright it is not brittle and it submits rightly to being wrought
whatever kind of ornament he wants to work it into whether a chain or a ring or a necklace or a gold fillet it serves his purpose
So too bhikkhus there are three signs that should be given attention from time to time by a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness  becomes rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers
 He attains the ability to be a witness through realization by directknowledge of any state realizable by directknowledge to which he inclines his mind whenever there is occasion 
 this sutta should be understood to deal with higher consciousness
 Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu possesses six things he is able to realize the supreme coolness
What six
Here bhikkhus when consciousness should be restrained he restrains it
when consciousness should be exerted he exerts it
when consciousness should be encouraged he encourages it
when consciousness should be looked on at with equanimity he looks on at it with equanimity
He is resolute on the superior state to be attained he delights in Nibbāna
Possessing these six things a bhikkhu is able to realize the supreme coolness 
 this sutta deals with coolness
 Skill in the enlightenment factors has already been dealt with in the explanation of skill in absorption in the passage beginning Bhikkhus when the mind is slack that is not the time for developing the tranquillity enlightenment factor  
So the meditator should make sure that he has apprehended this sevenfold skill in learning well and has properly defined this tenfold skill in giving attention thus learning the meditation subject properly with both kinds of skill
If it is convenient for him to live in the same monastery as the teacher then he need not get it explained in detail thus to begin with but as he applies himself to the meditation subject after he has made quite sure about it he can have each successive stage explained as he reaches each distinction
One who wants to live elsewhere however must get it explained to him in detail in the way already given and he must turn it over and over getting all the difficulties solved He should leave an abode of an unsuitable kind as described in the Description of the Earth Kasiṇa and go to live in a suitable one Then he should sever the minor impediments and set about the preliminary work for giving attention to repulsiveness
 When he sets about it he should first apprehend the learning sign in head hairs
How
The colour should be defined first by plucking out one or two head hairs and placing them on the palm of the hand
 He can also look at them in the haircutting place
or in a bowl of water or rice gruel
If the ones he sees are black when he sees them they should be brought to mind as black
if white as white
if mixed they should be brought to mind in accordance with those most prevalent
And as in the case of head hairs so too the sign should be apprehended visually with the whole of the skin pentad 
Having apprehended the sign thus and defined all the other parts of the body by colour shape direction location and delimitation  he should then define repulsiveness in five ways that is by colour shape odour habitat and location
Here is the explanation of all the parts given in successive order
Head Hairs Firstly head hairs are black in their normal colour the colour of fresh ariṭṭhaka seeds
As to shape they are the shape of long round measuring rods
As to direction they lie in the upper direction
As to location it is bounded on both sides by the roots of the ears in front by the forehead and behind by the nape of the neck
their location is the wet inner skin that envelops the skull
 As to delimitation they are bounded below by the surface of their own roots which are fixed by entering to the amount of the tip of a rice grain into the inner skin that envelops the head They are bounded above by space and all round by each other There are no two hairs together This is their delimitation by the similar
Head hairs are not body hairs and body hairs are not head hairs being likewise not intermixed with the remaining thirtyone parts the head hairs are a separate part This is their delimitation by the dissimilar
Such is the definition of head hairs as to colour and so on
 Their definition as to repulsiveness in the five ways that is by colour etc is as follows
Head hairs are repulsive in colour
as well as in shape odour habitat and location
For on seeing the colour of a head hair in a bowl of inviting rice gruel or cooked rice people are disgusted and say This has got hairs in it Take it away
 So they are repulsive in colour
Also when people are eating at night they are likewise disgusted by the mere sensation of a hairshaped akkabark or makaci bark fibre
So they are repulsive in shape
 And the odour of head hairs unless dressed with a smearing of oil scented with flowers etc is most offensive
And it is still worse when they are put in the fire
Even if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour and shape still their odour is directly repulsive
Just as a babys excrement as to its colour is the colour of turmeric and as to its shape is the shape of a piece of turmeric root
and just as the bloated carcass of a black dog thrown on a rubbish heap as to its colour is the colour of a ripe palmyra fruit and
as to its shape is the shape of a mandolinshaped drum left face down
 and its fangs are like jasmine buds and so even if both these are not directly repulsive in colour and shape still their odour is directly repulsive
so too even if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour and shape still their odour is directly repulsive
 But just as pot herbs that grow on village sewage in a filthy place are disgusting to civilized people and unusable so also head hairs are disgusting since they grow on the sewage of pus blood urine dung bile phlegm and the like This is the repulsive aspect of the habitat
And these head hairs grow on the heap of the other thirtyone parts as fungi do on a dunghill
And owing to the filthy place they grow in they are quite as unappetizing as vegetables growing on a charnelground on a midden etc as lotuses or water lilies growing in drains and so on This is the repulsive aspect of their location
And as in the case of head hairs so also the repulsiveness of all the parts should be defined in the same five ways by colour shape odour habitat and location
All however must be defined individually by colour shape direction location and delimitation as follows
Body Hairs Herein firstly as to natural colour body hairs are not pure black like head hairs but blackish brown
As to shape they are the shape of palm roots with the tips bent down
As to direction they lie in the two directions
As to location except for the locations where the head hairs are established and for the palms of the hands and soles of the feet they grow in most of the rest of the inner skin that envelops the body
As to delimitation they are bounded below by the surface of their own roots which are fixed by entering to the extent of a likhā into the inner skin that envelops the body above by space and all round by each other There are no two body hairs together This is the delimitation by the similar
But their delimitation by the dissimilar is like that for the head hairs
Nails Nails is the name for the twenty nail plates
They are all white as to colour
As to shape they are the shape of fish scales
As to direction the toenails are in the lower direction the fingernails are in the upper direction So they grow in the two directions
As to location they are fixed on the tips of the backs of the fingers and toes
As to delimitation they are bounded in the two directions by the flesh of the ends of the fingers and toes and inside by the flesh of the backs of the fingers and toes and externally and at the end by space and all round by each other There are no two nails together 
Teeth There are thirtytwo tooth bones in one whose teeth are complete
They are white in colour
As to shape they are of various shapes
for firstly in the lower row the four middle teeth are the shape of pumpkin seeds set in a row in a lump of clay
that on each side of them has one root and one point and is the shape of a jasmine bud
each one after that has two roots and two points and is the shape of a wagon prop
then two each side with three roots and three points
then two each side fourrooted and fourpointed
Likewise in the upper row
As to direction they lie in the upper direction
As to location they are fixed in the jawbones
As to delimitation they are bounded by the surface of their own roots which are fixed in the jawbones they are bounded above by space and all round by each other There are no two teeth together 
Skin The inner skin envelops the whole body
Outside it is what is called the outer cuticle which is black brown or yellow in colour and when that from the whole of the body is compressed together it amounts to only as much as a jujubefruit kernel
But as to colour the skin itself is white
and its whiteness becomes evident when the outer cuticle is destroyed by contact with the flame of a fire or the impact of a blow and so on
As to shape it is the shape of the body
in brief
But in detail the skin of the toes is the shape of silkworms cocoons
the skin of the back of the foot is the shape of shoes with uppers
the skin of the calf is the shape of a palm leaf wrapping cooked rice
the skin of the thighs is the shape of a long sack full of paddy
the skin of the buttocks is the shape of a cloth strainer full of water
the skin of the back is the shape of hide streched over a plank
the skin of the belly is the shape of the hide stretched over the body of a lute
the skin of the chest is more or less square
the skin of both arms is the shape of the hide stretched over a quiver
the skin of the backs of the hands is the shape of a razor box or the shape of a comb case
the skin of the fingers is the shape of a key box
the skin of the neck is the shape of a collar for the throat
the skin of the face is the shape of an insects nest full of holes
the skin of the head is the shape of a bowl bag
The meditator who is discerning the skin should first define the inner skin that covers the face working his knowledge over the face beginning with the upper lip
Next the inner skin of the frontal bone
Next he should define the inner skin of the head separating as it were the inner skins connection with the bone by inserting his knowledge in between the cranium bone and the inner skin of the head as he might his hand in between the bag and the bowl put in the bag
Next the inner skin of the shoulders
Next the inner skin of the right arm forwards and backwards
and then in the same way the inner skin of the left arm
Next after defining the inner skin of the back he should define the inner skin of the right leg forwards and backwards
then the inner skin of the left leg in the same way
Next the inner skin of the groin the paunch the bosom and the neck should be successively defined
Then after defining the inner skin of the lower jaw next after that of the neck he should finish on arriving at the lower lip
When he discerns it in the gross in this way it becomes evident to him more subtly too
As to direction it lies in both directions
As to location it covers the whole body
As to delimitation it is bounded below by its fixed surface and above by space 
Flesh There are nine hundred pieces of flesh

The flesh between each two ribs is the shape of clay mortar squeezed thin in a flattened opening
The flesh of the breast is the shape of a lump of clay made into a ball and flung down
The flesh of the two upper arms is the shape of a large skinned rat and twice the size
When he discerns it grossly in this way it becomes evident to him subtly too
As to direction it lies in both directions
As to location it is plastered over the three hundred and odd bones
As to delimitation it is bounded below by its surface which is fixed on to the collection of bones and above by the skin and all round each by each other piece 
Sinews There are nine hundred sinews
As to colour all the sinews are white
As to shape they have various shapes
For five of great sinews that bind the body together start out from the upper part of the neck and descend by the front
and five more by the back
and then five by the right
and five by the left
And of those that bind the right hand five descend by the front of the hand
and five by the back
likewise those that bind the left hand
And of those that bind the right foot five descend by the front and five by the back
likewise those that bind the left foot
So there are sixty great sinews called body supporters which descend from the neck and bind the body together
and they are also called tendons
They are all the shape of yam shoots
But there are others scattered over various parts of the body
which are finer than the lastnamed They are the shape of strings and cords
There are others still finer the shape of creepers Others still finer are the shape of large lute strings
Yet others are the shape of coarse thread
The sinews in the backs of the hands and feet are the shape of a birds claw

Gorge This is what has been eaten drunk chewed and tasted and is present in the stomach
As to colour it is the colour of swallowed food
As to shape it is the shape of rice loosely tied in a cloth strainer
As to direction it is in the upper direction
As to location it is in the stomach
 What is called the stomach is a part of the bowelmembrane which is like the swelling of air produced in the middle of a length of wet cloth when it is being twisted and wrung out from the two ends It is smooth outside Inside it is like a balloon of cloth soiled by wrapping up meat refuse or it can be said to be like the inside of the skin of a rotten jack fruit It is the place where worms dwell seething in tangles the thirtytwo families of worms such as round worms boilproducing worms palmsplinter worms needlemouthed worms tape worms thread worms and the rest When there is no food and drink etc present they leap up shrieking and pounce upon the hearts flesh and when food and drink etc are swallowed they wait with uplifted mouths and scramble to snatch the first two or three lumps swallowed It is these worms maternity home privy hospital and charnel ground
Just as when it has rained heavily in a time of drought and what has been carried by the water into the cesspit at the gate of an outcaste villagethe various kinds of ordure such as urine excrement bits of hide and bones and sinews as well as spittle snot blood etcgets mixed up with the mud and water already collected there and after two or three days the families of worms appear and it ferments warmed by the energy of the suns heat frothing and bubbling on the top quite black in colour and so utterly stinking and loathsome that one can scarcely go near it or look at it much less smell or taste it so too the stomach is where the assortment of food drink etc falls after being pounded up by the tongue and stuck together with spittle and saliva losing at that moment its virtues of colour smell taste etc and taking on the appearance of weavers paste and dogs vomit then to get soused in the bile and phlegm and wind that have collected there where it ferments with the energy of the stomachfires heat seethes with the families of worms frothing and bubbling on the top till it turns into utterly stinking nauseating muck
even to hear about which takes away any appetite for food drink etc let alone to see it with the eye of understanding
And when the food drink etc fall into it they get divided into five parts the worms eat one part the stomachfire bums up another part another part becomes urine another part becomes excrement and one part is turned into nourishment and sustains the blood flesh and so on
 As to delimitation it is bounded by the stomach lining and by what appertains to gorge 
Dung This is excrement
As to colour it is mostly the colour of eaten food
As to shape it is the shape of its location
As to direction it is in the lower direction
As to location it is to be found in the receptacle for digested food 
 The receptacle for digested food is the lowest part at the end of the bowel between the navel and the root of the spine It measures eight fingerbreadths in height and resembles a bamboo tube Just as when rain water falls on a higher level it runs down to fill a lower level and stays there so too the receptacle for digested food is where any food drink etc that have fallen into the receptacle for undigested food have been continuously cooked and simmered by the stomachfire and have got as soft as though ground up on a stone run down to through the cavities of the bowels and it is pressed down there till it becomes impacted like brown clay pushed into a bamboo joint and there it stays
As to delimitation it is bounded by the receptacle for digested food and by what appertains to dung 
Brain This is the lumps of marrow to be found inside the skull
As to colour it is white the colour of the flesh of a toadstool
it can also be said that it is the colour of turned milk that has not yet become curd
As to shape it is the shape of its location
As to direction it belongs to the upper direction
As to location it is to be found inside the skull like four lumps of dough put together to correspond with the skulls four sutured sections
As to delimitation it is bounded by the skulls inner surface and by what appertains to brain 
Bile There are two kinds of bile local bile and free bile
Herein as to colour the local bile is the colour of thick madhuka oil
the free bile is the colour of faded ākulī flowers
As to shape both are the shape of their location
As to direction the local bile belongs to the upper direction the other belongs to both directions
As to location the free bile spreads like a drop of oil on water all over the body except for the fleshless parts of the head hairs body hairs teeth nails and the hard dry skin When it is disturbed the eyes become yellow and twitch and there is shivering and itching of the body
The local bile is situated near the flesh of the liver between the heart and the lungs It is to be found in the bile container  which is like a large kosātakī gourd pip When it is disturbed beings go crazy and become demented they throw off conscience and shame and do the undoable speak the unspeakable and think the unthinkable
 As to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to bile 
Phlegm The phlegm is inside the body and it measures a bowlful
As to colour it is white the colour of the juice of nāgabalā leaves
As to shape it is the shape of its location
As to direction it belongs to the upper direction
As to location it is to be found on the stomachs surface
Just as duckweed and green scum on the surface of water divide when a stick or a potsherd is dropped into the water and then spread together again so too at the time of eating and drinking etc when the food drink etc fall into the stomach the phlegm divides and then spreads together again And if it gets weak the stomach becomes utterly disgusting with a smell of ordure like a ripe boil or a rotten hens egg and then the belchings and the mouth reek with a stench like rotting ordure rising from the stomach
so that the man has to be told Go away your breath smells But when it grows plentiful it holds the stench of ordure beneath the surface of the stomach acting like the wooden lid of a privy
As to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to phlegm 
Pus Pus is produced by decaying blood
As to colour it is the colour of bleached leaves
but in a dead body it is the colour of stale thickened gruel
As to shape it is the shape of its location
As to direction it belongs to both directions
As to location however there is no fixed location for pus where it could be found stored up Wherever blood stagnates and goes bad in some part of the body damaged by wounds with stumps and thorns by burns with fire etc or where boils carbuncles etc appear it can be found there
As to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to pus 
Blood There are two kinds of blood stored blood and mobile blood
Herein as to colour stored blood is the colour of cooked and thickened lac solution
mobile blood is the colour of clear lac solution
As to shape both are the shape of their locations
As to direction the stored blood belongs to the upper direction
the other belongs to both directions
As to location except for the fleshless parts of the head hairs body hairs teeth nails and the hard dry skin the mobile blood permeates the whole of the clungto body by following the network of veins
The stored blood fills the lower part of the livers site to the extent of a bowlful and by its splashing little by little over the heart kidney and lungs it keeps the kidney heart liver and lungs moist
For it is when it fails to moisten the kidney heart etc that beings become thirsty
As to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to blood 
Sweat This is the water element that trickles from the pores of the body hairs and so on
As to colour it is the colour of clear sesame oil
As to shape it is the shape of its location
As to direction it belongs to both directions
As to location there is no fixed location for sweat where it could always be found like blood
But if the body is heated by the heat of a fire by the suns heat by a change of temperature etc then it trickles from all the pore openings of the head hairs and body hairs as water does from a bunch of unevenly cut lilybud stems and lotus stalks pulled up from the water So its shape should also be understood to correspond to the poreopenings of the head hairs and body hairs
And the meditator who discerns sweat should only give his attention to it as it is to be found filling the poreopenings of the head hairs and body hairs
As to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to sweat 
Fat This is a thick unguent
As to colour it is the colour of sliced turmeric
As to shape firstly in the body of a stout man it is the shape of turmericcoloured dukūla rags placed between the inner skin and the flesh
In the body of a lean man it is the shape of turmericcoloured dukūla rags placed in two or three thicknesses on the shank flesh thigh flesh back flesh near the spine and bellycovering flesh
As to direction it belongs to both directions
As to location it permeates the whole of a stout mans body it is to be found on a lean mans shank flesh and so on And though it was described as unguent above still it is neither used as oil on the head nor as oil for the nose etc because of its utter disgustingness
As to delimitation it is bounded below by the flesh above by the inner skin and all round by what appertains to fat 
Tears These are the water element that trickles from the eye
As to colour they are the colour of clear sesame oil
As to shape they are the shape of their location
As to direction they belong to the upper direction
As to location they are to be found in the eye sockets
But they are not stored in the eye sockets all the while as the bile is in the bile container
But when beings feel joy and laugh uproariously or feel grief and weep and lament or eat particular kinds of wrong food or when their eyes are affected by smoke dust dirt etc
then being originated by the joy grief wrong food or temperature they fill up the eye sockets or trickle out
And the meditator who discerns tears should discern them only as they are to be found filling the eye sockets
As to delimitation they are bounded by what appertains to tears 
Grease This is a melted unguent
As to colour it is the colour of coconut oil
Also it can be said to be the colour of oil sprinkled on gruel
As to shape it is a film the shape of a drop of unguent spread out over still water at the time of bathing
As to direction it belongs to both directions
As to location it is to be found mostly on the palms of the hands backs of the hands soles of the feet backs of the feet tip of the nose forehead and points of the shoulders
And it is not always to be found in the melted state in these locations
but when these parts get hot with the heat of a fire the suns heat upset of temperature or upset of elements then it spreads here and there in those places like the film from the drop of unguent on the still water at the time of bathing
As to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to grease 
Spittle This is water element mixed with froth inside the mouth
As to colour it is white the colour of the froth
As to shape it is the shape of its location
or it can be called the shape of froth
As to direction it belongs to the upper direction
As to location it is to be found on the tongue after it has descended from the cheeks on both sides
 And it is not always to be found stored there
but when beings see particular kinds of food or remember them or put something hot or bitter or sharp or salty or sour into their mouths or when their hearts are faint or nausea arises on some account then spittle appears and runs down from the cheeks on both sides to settle on the tongue
It is thin at the tip of the tongue and thick at the root of the tongue It is capable without getting used up of wetting unhusked rice or husked rice or anything else chewable that is put into the mouth like the water in a pit scooped out in a river sand bank
As to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to spittle 
Snot This is impurity that trickles out from the brain
As to colour it is the colour of a young palmyra kernel
As to shape it is the shape of its location
As to direction it belongs to the upper direction
As to location it is to be found filling the nostril cavities
And it is not always to be found stored there but rather just as though a man tied up curd in a lotus leaf which he then pricked with a thorn underneath and whey oozed out and dripped so too when beings weep or suffer a disturbance of elements produced by wrong food or temperature then the brain inside the head turns into stale phlegm and it oozes out and comes down by an opening in the palate and it fills the nostrils and stays there or trickles out
And the meditator who discerns snot should discern it only as it is to be found filling the nostril cavities
As to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to snot 
Oil of the Joints This is the slimy ordure inside the joints in the body
As to colour it is the colour of kaṇikāra gum
As to shape it is the shape of its location
As to direction it belongs to both directions
As to location it is to be found inside the hundred and eighty joints serving the function of lubricating the bones joints
If it is weak when a man gets up or sits down moves forward or backward bends or stretches then his bones creak and he goes about making a noise like the snapping of fingers
and when he has walked only one or two leagues distance his air element gets upset and his limbs pain him
But if a man has plenty of it his bones do not creak when he gets up sits down etc and even when he has walked a long distance his air element does not get upset and his limbs do not pain him
As to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to oil of the joints 
Urine This is the urine solution
As to colour it is the colour of bean brine
As to shape it is the shape of water inside a water pot placed upside down
As to direction it belongs to the lower direction
As to location it is to be found inside the bladder
For the bladder sack is called the bladder
Just as when a porous pot with no mouth is put into a cesspool then the solution from the cesspool gets into the porous pot with no mouth even though no way of entry is evident so too while the urinary secretion from the body enters the bladder its way of entry is not evident Its way of exit however is evident
And when the bladder is full of urine beings feel the need to make water
As to delimitation it is delimited by the inside of the bladder and by what is similar to urine This is the delimitation by the similar
But its delimitation by the dissimilar is like that for the head hairs 
The Arising of Absorption When the meditator has defined the parts beginning with the head hairs in this way by colour shape direction location and delimitation  and he gives his attention in the ways beginning with following the order not too quickly to their repulsiveness in the five aspects of colour shape smell habitat and location  then at last he surmounts the concept  Then just as when a man with good sight is observing a garland of flowers of thirty two colours knotted on a single string and all the flowers become evident to him simultaneously so too when the meditator observes this body thus There are in this body head hairs then all these things become evident to him as it were simultaneously
Hence it was said above in the explanation of skill in giving attention For when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs his attention carries on till it arrives at the last part that is urine and stops there 
 If he applies his attention externally as well when all the parts have become evident in this way then human beings animals etc as they go about are divested of their aspect of beings and appear as just assemblages of parts And when drink food etc is being swallowed by them it appears as though it were being put in among the assemblage of parts
 Then as he gives his attention to them again and again as Repulsive repulsive employing the process of successive leaving etc  eventually absorption arises in him
Herein the appearance of the head hairs etc as to colour shape direction location and delimitation is the learning sign
their appearance as repulsive in all aspects is the counterpart sign
As he cultivates and develops that counterpart sign absorption arises in him but only of the first jhāna in the same way as described under foulness as a meditation subject 
And it arises singly in one to whom only one part has become evident or who has reached absorption in one part and makes no further effort about another
 But several first jhānas according to the number of parts are produced in one to whom several parts have become evident or who has reached jhāna in one and also makes further effort about another As in the case of the Elder Mallaka
The elder it seems took the Elder Abhaya the Dīgha reciter by the hand and after saying Friend Abhaya first learn this matter he went on The Elder Mallaka is an obtainer of thirtytwo jhānas in the thirtytwo parts
If he enters upon one by night and one by day he goes on entering upon them for over a fortnight but if he enters upon one each day he goes on entering upon them for over a month
 And although this meditation is successful in this way with the first jhāna it is nevertheless called mindfulness occupied with the body because it is successful through the influence of the mindfulness of the colour shape and so on
 And the bhikkhu who is devoted to this mindfulness occupied with the body is a conqueror of boredom and delight and boredom does not conquer him he dwells transcending boredom as it arises
He is a conqueror of fear and dread and fear and dread do not conquer him he dwells transcending fear and dread as they arise
He is one who bears cold and heat  who endures  arisen bodily feelings that are  menacing to life 
he becomes an obtainer of the four jhānas based on the colour aspect of the head hairs etc
and he comes to penetrate the six kinds of directknowledge 
So let a man if he is wise Untiringly devote his days
To mindfulness of body which Rewards him in so many ways
This is the section dealing with mindfulness occupied with the body in the detailed treatise
It has been recommended by the Blessed One thus And bhikkhus this concentration through mindfulness of breathing when developed and practiced much is both peaceful and sublime it is an unadulterated blissful abiding and it banishes at once and stills evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as they arise 
It has been described by the Blessed One as having sixteen bases thus And how developed bhikkhus how practiced much is concentration through mindfulness of breathing both peaceful and sublime an unadulterated blissful abiding banishing at once and stilling evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as they arise
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect established mindfulness in front of him ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he knows I breathe in long or breathing out long he knows I breathe out long
 Breathing in short he knows I breathe in short or breathing out short he knows I breathe out short
 He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body
he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body
 He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation
he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
 He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing happiness he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing happiness  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing bliss he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing bliss  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formation he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the mental formation  He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the mental formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the mental formation   He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the manner of consciousness  He trains thus I shall breathe in gladdening the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out gladdening the manner of consciousness  He trains thus I shall breathe in concentrating the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out concentrating the manner of consciousness  He trains thus I shall breathe in liberating the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out liberating the manner of consciousness   He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating impermanence he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating impermanence  He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating fading away he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating fading away  He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating cessation he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating cessation
 He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating relinquishment
he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment 
 The description of development is complete in all respects
however only if it is given in due course after a commentary on the text
So it is given here introduced by a commentary on the first part of the text
And how developed bhikkhus how practiced much is concentration through mindfulness of breathing here in the first place how is a question showing desire to explain in detail the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing in its various forms
Developed bhikkhus  is concentration through mindfulness of breathing this shows the thing that is being asked about out of desire to explain it in its various forms
How practiced much  as soon as they arise here too the same explanation applies
 Herein developed means aroused or increased
concentration through mindfulness of breathing is either concentration associated with mindfulness that discerns breathing
or it is concentration on mindfulness of breathing
Practiced much practiced again and again
 Both peaceful and sublime  it is peaceful in both ways and sublime in both ways
the two words should each be understood as governed by the word both 
What is meant
Unlike foulness which as a meditation subject is peaceful and sublime only by penetration but is neither peaceful nor sublime in its object since its object in the learning stage is gross and after that its object is repulsivenessunlike that this is not unpeaceful or unsublime in any way but on the contrary it is peaceful stilled and quiet both on account of the peacefulness of its object and on account of the peacefulness of that one of its factors called penetration
And it is sublime something one cannot have enough of both on account of the sublimeness of its object and on account of the sublimeness of the aforesaid factor
Hence it is called both peaceful and sublime
 It is an unadulterated blissful abiding it has no adulteration thus it is unadulterated it is unalloyed unmixed particular special
Here it is not a question of peacefulness to be reached through preliminary work as with the kasiṇas or through access as with foulness for instance
It is peaceful and sublime in its own individual essence too starting with the very first attention given to it
But some say that it is unadulterated because it is unalloyed possessed of nutritive value and sweet in its individual essence too
So it should be understood to be unadulterated and a blissful abiding since it leads to the obtaining of bodily and mental bliss with every moment of absorption
 As soon as they arise whenever they are not suppressed
Evil bad
Unprofitable thoughts thoughts produced by unskilfulness 
It banishes at once it banishes suppresses at that very moment
Stills  it thoroughly calms 
or else when eventually brought to fulfilment by the noble path it cuts off because of partaking of penetration it tranquilizes is what is meant
 In brief however the meaning here is this
Bhikkhus in what way in what manner by what system is concentration through mindfulness of breathing developed in what way is it practiced much that it is both peaceful  as soon as they arise
 He now said Here bhikkhus etc giving the meaning of that in detail
Herein here bhikkhus a bhikkhu means bhikkhus in this dispensation a bhikkhu
For this word here signifies the Buddhas dispensation as the prerequisite for a person to produce concentration through mindfulness of breathing in all its modes and it denies that such a state exists in any other dispensation
For this is said Bhikkhus only here is there an ascetic here a second ascetic here a third ascetic here a fourth ascetic other dispensations are devoid of ascetics 
That is why it was said above in this dispensation a bhikkhu
 Gone to the forest  or to an empty place this signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing
For this bhikkhus mind has long been dissipated among visible data etc as its object and it does not want to mount the object of concentration throughmindfulnessofbreathing it runs off the track like a chariot harnessed to a wild ox
Now suppose a cowherd wanted to tame a wild calf that had been reared on a wild cows milk he would take it away from the cow and tie it up apart with a rope to a stout post dug into the ground then the calf might dash to and fro but being unable to get away it would eventually sit down or lie down by the post So too when a bhikkhu wants to tame his own mind which has long been spoilt by being reared on visible data etc as object for its food and drink he should take it away from visible data etc as object and bring it into the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place and tie it up there to the post of inbreaths and outbreaths with the rope of mindfulness
And so his mind may then dash to and fro when it no longer gets the objects it was formerly used to but being unable to break the rope of mindfulness and get away it sits down lies down by that object under the influence of access and absorption
Hence the Ancients said
 Just as a man who tames a calf Would tie it to a post so here
Should his own mind by mindfulness Be firmly to the object tied
This is how an abode is favourable to his development
Hence it was said above This signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing 
Or alternatively this mindfulness of breathing as a meditation subject which is foremost among the various meditation subjects of all Buddhas some Paccekabuddhas and some Buddhas disciples as a basis for attaining distinction and abiding in bliss here and nowis not easy to develop without leaving the neighbourhood of villages which resound with the noises of women men elephants horses etc noise being a thorn to jhāna 
whereas in the forest away from a village a meditator can at his ease set about discerning this meditation subject and achieve the fourth jhāna in mindfulness of breathing and then by making that same jhāna the basis for comprehension of formations with insight  he can reach Arahantship the highest fruit
That is why the Blessed One said gone to the forest etc in pointing out a favourable abode for him
 For the Blessed One is like a master of the art of building sites  As the master of the art of building sites surveys the proposed site for a town thoroughly examines it and then gives his directions Build the town here and when the town is safely finished he receives great honour from the royal family so the Blessed One examines an abode as to its suitability for the meditator and he directs Devote yourself to the meditation subject here and later on when the meditator has devoted himself to the meditation subject and has reached Arahantship and says The Blessed One is indeed fully enlightened the Blessed One receives great honour
 And this bhikkhu is compared to a leopard
For just as a great leopard king lurks in a grass wilderness or a jungle wilderness or a rock wilderness in the forest and seizes wild beaststhe wild buffalo wild ox boar etcso too the bhikkhu who devotes himself to his meditation subject in the forest etc should be understood to seize successively the paths of streamentry oncereturn nonreturn and Arahantship and the noble fruitions as well
Hence the Ancients said
For as the leopard by his lurking in the forest seizes beasts
So also will this Buddhas son with insight gifted strenuous
By his retreating to the forest seize the highest fruit of all 
So the Blessed One said gone to the forest etc to point out a forest abode as a place likely to hasten his advancement
 Herein gone to the forest is gone to any kind of forest possessing the bliss of seclusion among the kinds of forests characterized thus Having gone out beyond the boundary post all that is forest  and A forest abode is five hundred bow lengths distant 
To the root of a tree gone to the vicinity of a tree
To an empty place gone to an empty secluded space
And here he can be said to have gone to an empty place if he has gone to any of the remaining seven kinds of abode 
 Having thus indicated an abode that is suitable to the three seasons suitable to humour and temperament and favourable to the development of mindfulness of breathing he then said sits down etc indicating a posture that is peaceful and tends neither to idleness nor to agitation
Then he said having folded his legs crosswise etc to show firmness in the sitting position easy occurrence of the inbreaths and outbreaths and the means for discerning the object
 Herein crosswise is the sitting position with the thighs fully locked
Folded having locked
Set his body erect having placed the upper part of the body erect
with the eighteen backbones resting end to end
For when he is seated like this his skin flesh and sinews are not twisted
and so the feelings that would arise moment by moment if they were twisted do not arise
That being so his mind becomes unified and the meditation subject instead of collapsing attains to growth and increase
 Established mindfulness in front of him  having placed mindfulness facing the meditation subject 
Or alternatively the meaning can be treated here too according to the method of explanation given in the Paṭisambhidā which is this Pari has the sense of control 
mukhaṃ has the sense of outlet 
sati has the sense of establishment 
that is why parimukhaṃ satiṃ is said 
The meaning of it in brief is Having made mindfulness the outlet from opposition forgetfulness being thereby controlled
 Ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out having seated himself thus having established mindfulness thus the bhikkhu does not abandon that mindfulness ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out he is a mindful worker is what is meant
 Now breathing in long etc is said in order to show the different ways in which he is a mindful worker
For in the Paṭisambhidā in the exposition of the clause Ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out this is said
He is a mindful worker in thirtytwo ways
 when he knows unification of mind and nondistraction by means of a long inbreath mindfulness is established in him
owing to that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker
 When he knows unification of mind and nondistraction by means of a long outbreath 
 by means of breathing in contemplating relinquishment  When he knows unification of mind and nondistraction by means of breathing out contemplating relinquishment mindfulness is established in him
owing to that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker 
 Herein breathing in long is producing a long inbreath
Assāsa is the wind issuing out
passāsa is the wind entering in is said in the Vinaya Commentary
But in the Suttanta Commentaries it is given in the opposite sense
Herein when any infant comes out from the mothers womb first the wind from within goes out
and subsequently the wind from without enters in with fine dust strikes the palate and is extinguished with the infants sneezing
This firstly is how assāsa and passāsa should be understood
 But their length and shortness should be understood by extent 
For just as water or sand that occupies an extent of space is called a long water a long sand a short water a short sand so in the case of elephants and snakes bodies the inbreaths and outbreaths regarded as particles slowly fill the long extent in other words their persons and slowly go out again
That is why they are called long
They rapidly fill a short extent in other words the person of a dog a hare etc and rapidly go out again That is why they are called short 
 And in the case of human beings some breathe in and breathe out long by extent of time as elephants snakes etc do
while others breathe in and breathe out short in that way as dogs hares etc do Of these therefore the breaths that travel over a long extent in entering in and going out are to be understood as long in time and the breaths that travel over a little extent in entering in and going out as short in time
 Now this bhikkhu knows I breathe in I breathe out long while breathing in and breathing out long in nine ways
And the development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body should be understood to be perfected in one aspect in him who knows thus
according as it is said in the Paṭisambhidā
 How breathing in long does he know I breathe in long
breathing out long does he know I breathe out long
 He breathes in a long inbreath reckoned as an extent
 He breathes out a long outbreath reckoned as an extent
 He breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths reckoned as an extent
As he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths reckoned as an extent zeal arises
 Through zeal he breathes in a long inbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent
 Through zeal he breathes out a long outbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent Through zeal he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent
As through zeal he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent gladness arises
 Through gladness he breathes in a long inbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent
 Through gladness he breathes out a long outbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent Through gladness he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent
As through gladness he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent his mind turns away from the long in breaths and outbreaths and equanimity is established
Long inbreaths and outbreaths in these nine ways are a body
The establishment is mindfulness
The contemplation is knowledge
The body is the establishment  but it is not the mindfulness
Mindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that body
That is why development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said 
 The same method of explanation applies also in the case of short breaths
But there is this difference While in the former case a long inbreath reckoned as an extent is said here a short inbreath reckoned as a little duration is given
So it must be construed as short as far as the phrase That is why development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said 
 So it should be understood that it is when this bhikkhu knows inbreaths and outbreaths in these nine ways as a long extent and as a little duration that breathing in long he knows I breathe in long  breathing out short he knows I breathe out short is said of him
And when he knows thus
The long kind and the short as well
The inbreath and the outbreath too
Such then are the four kinds that happen
At the bhikkhus nose tip here
 He trains thus I shall breathe in  I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body he trains thus I shall breathe in making known making plain the beginning middle and end of the entire inbreath body
I shall breathe out making known making plain the beginning middle and end of the entire out breath body thus he trains
Making them known making them plain in this way he both breathes in and breathes out with consciousness associated with knowledge
That is why it is said He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out 
 To one bhikkhu the beginning of the inbreath body or the outbreath body distributed in particles that is to say regarded as successive arisings is plain but not the middle or the end
 he is only able to discern the beginning and has difficulty with the middle and the end
To another the middle is plain not the beginning or the end he is only able to discern the middle and has difficulty with the beginning and the end
To another the end is plain not the beginning or the middle
he is only able to discern the end and has difficulty with the beginning and the middle
To yet another all stages are plain he is able to discern them all and has no difficulty with any of them Pointing out that one should be like the lastmentioned bhikkhu he said He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out experiencing the whole body 
 Herein he trains he strives he endeavours in this way
Or else the restraint here in one such as this is training in the higher virtue
his consciousness is training in the higher consciousness
and his understanding is training in the higher understanding  So he trains in repeats develops repeatedly practices these three kinds of training on that object by means of that mindfulness by means of that attention This is how the meaning should be regarded here
 Herein in the first part of the system he should only breathe in and breathe out and not do anything else at all and it is only afterwards that he should apply himself to the arousing of knowledge and so on
Consequently the present tense is used here in the text He knows I breathe in  he knows I breathe out
But the future tense in the passage beginning I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body should be understood as used in order to show that the aspect of arousing knowledge etc has to be undertaken from then on
 He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe in shall breathe out tranquilizing completely tranquilizing stopping stilling the gross bodily formation
 And here both the gross and subtle state and also progressive tranquilizing should be understood
For previously at the time when the bhikkhu has still not discerned the meditation subject his body and his mind are disturbed and so they are gross
And while the grossness of the body and the mind has still not subsided the inbreaths and outbreaths are gross They get stronger his nostrils become inadequate and he keeps breathing in and out through his mouth
But they become quiet and still when his body and mind have been discerned
When they are still then the inbreaths and outbreaths occur so subtly that he has to investigate whether they exist or not
 Suppose a man stands still after running or descending from a hill or putting down a big load from his head then his inbreaths and outbreaths are gross his nostrils become inadequate and he keeps on breathing in and out through his mouth
But when he has rid himself of his fatigue and has bathed and drunk and put a wet cloth on his heart and is lying in the cool shade then his inbreaths and outbreaths eventually occur so subtly that he has to investigate whether they exist or not so too previously at the time when the bhikkhu has still not discerned  he has to investigate whether they exist or not
 Why is that
Because previously at the time when he has still not discerned there is no concern in him no reaction no attention no reviewing to the effect that I am progressively tranquilizing each grosser bodily formation  But when he has discerned there is
So his bodily formation at the time when he has discerned is subtle in comparison with that at the time when he has not
Hence the Ancients said
The mind and body are disturbed And then in excess it occurs
But when the body is undisturbed Then it with subtlety occurs
In discerning the meditation subject the formation is gross and it is subtle by comparison in the firstjhāna access
also it is gross in that and subtle by comparison in the first jhāna
in the first jhāna and secondjhāna access it is gross and in the second jhāna subtle
in the second jhāna and thirdjhāna access it is gross and in the third jhāna subtle
in the third jhāna and fourthjhāna access it is gross and in the fourth jhāna it is so exceedingly subtle that it even reaches cessation
This is the opinion of the Dīgha and Saṃyutta reciters
But the Majjhima reciters have it that it is subtler in each access than in the jhāna below too in this way In the first jhāna it is gross and in the secondjhāna access it is subtle by comparison and so on
It is however the opinion of all that the bodily formation occurring before the time of discerning becomes tranquilized at the time of discerning
and the bodily formation at the time of discerning becomes tranquilized in the firstjhāna access  and the bodily formation occurring in the fourthjhāna access becomes tranquilized in the fourth jhāna
This is the method of explanation in the case of serenity
 But in the case of insight the bodily formation occurring at the time of not discerning is gross and in discerning the primary elements it is by comparison subtle
that also is gross and in discerning derived materiality it is subtle
that also is gross and in discerning all materiality it is subtle
that also is gross and in discerning the immaterial it is subtle
that also is gross and in discerning the material and immaterial it is subtle
that also is gross and in discerning conditions it is subtle
that also is gross and in seeing mentalitymateriality with its conditions it is subtle
that also is gross and in insight that has the characteristics of impermanence etc as its object it is subtle
that also is gross in weak insight while in strong insight it is subtle
Herein the tranquilizing should be understood as the relative tranquillity of the subsequent compared with the previous
Thus should the gross and subtle state and the progressive tranquilizing be understood here
 But the meaning of this is given in the Paṭisambhidā together with the objection and clarification thus
How is it that he trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
What are the bodily formations
Long in breaths  outbreaths experiencing the whole body belong to the body these things being bound up with the body are bodily formations
he trains in tranquilizing stopping stilling those bodily formations When there are such bodily formations whereby there is bending backwards sideways in all directions and forwards and perturbation vacillation moving and shaking of the body he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
When there are such bodily formations whereby there is no bending backwards sideways in all directions and forwards and no perturbation vacillation moving and shaking of the body quietly subtly he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
 Objection So then he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation
he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
that being so there is no production of awareness of wind
and there is no production of inbreaths and outbreaths
and there is no production of mindfulness of breathing and there is no production of concentration through mindfulness of breathing and consequently the wise neither enter into nor emerge from that attainment
 Clarification So then he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
that being so there is production of awareness of wind and there is production of inbreaths and outbreaths and there is production of mindfulness of breathing and there is production of concentration through mindfulness of breathing and consequently the wise enter into and emerge from that attainment
 Like what
Just as when a gong is struck
At first gross sounds occur and consciousness occurs because the sign of the gross sounds is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the gross sounds have ceased then afterwards faint sounds occur
and consciousness occurs because the sign of the faint sounds is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the faint sounds have ceased then afterwards consciousness occurs because it has the sign of the faint sounds as its objectso too at first gross inbreaths and outbreaths occur and consciousness does not become distracted
because the sign of the gross inbreaths and outbreaths is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the gross inbreaths and outbreaths have ceased then afterwards faint inbreaths and outbreaths occur and consciousness does not become distracted
because the sign of the faint inbreaths and outbreaths is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the faint inbreaths and outbreaths have ceased then afterwards consciousness does not become distracted because it has the sign of the faint inbreaths and outbreaths as its object
That being so there is production of awareness of wind and there is production of inbreaths and outbreaths and there is production of mindfulness of breathing and there is production of concentration through mindfulness of breathing and consequently the wise enter into and emerge from that attainment
 Inbreaths and outbreaths tranquilizing the bodily formation are a body The establishment is mindfulness The contemplation is knowledge The body is the establishment  but it is not the mindfulness Mindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that body
That is why development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said 
This in the first place is the consecutive word commentary here on the first tetrad which deals with contemplation of the body
 The first tetrad is set forth as a meditation subject for a beginner
but the other three tetrads are respectively set forth as the contemplations of feeling of the manner of consciousness and of mental objects for one who has already attained jhāna in this tetrad
So if a clansman who is a beginner wants to develop this meditation subject and through insight based on the fourth jhāna produced in breathing to reach Arahantship together with the discriminations he should first do all the work connected with the purification of virtue etc in the way already described after which he should learn the meditation subject in five stages from a teacher of the kind already described
 Here are the five stages learning questioning establishing absorption characteristic
Herein learning is learning the meditation subject
Questioning is questioning about the meditation subject
Establishing is establishing the meditation subject
Absorption is the absorption of the meditation subject
Characteristic is the characteristic of the meditation subject
what is meant is that it is the ascertaining of the meditation subjects individual essence thus This meditation subject has such a characteristic 
 Learning the meditation subject in the five stages in this way he neither tires himself nor worries the teacher
So in giving this meditation subject consisting in mindfulness of breathing attention he can live either with the teacher or elsewhere in an abode of the kind already described learning the meditation subject in the five stages thus getting a little expounded at a time and taking a long time over reciting it He should sever the minor impediments After finishing the work connected with the meal and getting rid of any dizziness due to the meal he should seat himself comfortably Then making sure he is not confused about even a single word of what he has learned from the teacher he should cheer his mind by recollecting the special qualities of the Three Jewels
 Here are the stages in giving attention to it
 counting connection touching fixing observing
 turning away purification and looking back on these
Herein counting is just counting
connection is carrying on
touching is the place touched by the breaths
fixing is absorption
observing is insight
turning away is the path
purification is fruition
looking back on these is reviewing
 Herein this clansman who is a beginner should first give attention to this meditation subject by counting
And when counting he should not stop short of five
or go beyond ten
or make any break in the series
By stopping short of five his thoughts get excited in the cramped space like a herd of cattle shut in a cramped pen
By going beyond ten his thoughts take the number rather than the breaths for their support
By making a break in the series he wonders if the meditation subject has reached completion or not
So he should do his counting without those faults
 When counting he should at first do it slowly that is late as a grain measurer does
For a grain measurer having filled his measure says One and empties it
and then refilling it he goes on saying One one while removing any rubbish he may have noticed
And the same with Two two and so on
So taking the inbreath or the outbreath whichever appears most plainly he should begin with One one and count up to Ten ten noting each as it occurs
 As he does his counting in this way the inbreaths and outbreaths become evident to him as they enter in and issue out
Then he can leave off counting slowly  like a grain measurer and he can count quickly that is early as a cowherd does
For a skilled cowherd takes pebbles in his pocket and goes to the cow pen in the morning whip in hand sitting on the bar of the gate prodding the cows in the back he counts each one as it reaches the gate saying One two dropping a pebble for each
And the cows of the herd which have been spending the three watches of the night uncomfortably in the cramped space come out quickly in parties jostling each other as they escape
So he counts quickly Three four five and so up to ten In this way the inbreaths and outbreaths which had already become evident to him while he counted them in the former way now keep moving along quickly
 Then knowing that they keep moving along quickly not apprehending them either inside or outside the body but apprehending them just as they reach the nostril door
he can do his counting quickly  One two three four five one two three four five six  seven  eight  nine  ten
For as long as the meditation subject is connected with counting it is with the help of that very counting that the mind becomes unified just as a boat in a swift current is steadied with the help of a rudder
 When he counts quickly the meditation subject becomes apparent to him as an uninterrupted process
Then knowing that it is proceeding uninterruptedly he can count quickly in the way just described not discerning the wind either inside or outside the body
For by bringing his consciousness inside along with the incoming breath it seems as if it were buffeted by the wind inside or filled with fat
By taking his consciousness outside along with the outgoing breath it gets distracted by the multiplicity of objects outside
However his development is successful when he fixes his mindfulness on the place touched by the breaths
That is why it was said above He can count quickly in the way just described not discerning the wind either inside or outside 
 But how long is he to go on counting
Until without counting mindfulness remains settled on the inbreaths and outbreaths as its object
For counting is simply a device for setting mindfulness on the inbreaths and out breaths as object by cutting off the external dissipation of applied thoughts
 Having given attention to it in this way by counting he should now do so by connection
Connection is the uninterrupted following of the inbreaths and outbreaths with mindfulness after counting has been given up
And that is not by following after the beginning the middle and the end
 The navel is the beginning of the wind issuing out the heart is its middle and the nosetip is its end
The nosetip is the beginning of the wind entering in the heart is its middle and the navel is its end
And if he follows after that his mind is distracted by disquiet and perturbation
according as it is said
When he goes in with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of the in breath his mind being distracted internally both his body and his mind are disquieted and perturbed and shaky
When he goes out with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of the outbreath his mind being distracted externally both his body and his mind are disquieted and perturbed and shaky 
 So when he gives his attention to it by connection he should do so not by the beginning middle and end
but rather by touching and by fixing
 There is no attention to be given to it by touching separate from fixing as there is by counting separate from connection
But when he is counting the breaths in the place touched by each he is giving attention to them by counting and touching
When he has given up counting and is connecting them by means of mindfulness in that same place and fixing consciousness by means of absorption then he is said to be giving his attention to them by connection touching and fixing
And the meaning of this may be understood through the similes of the man who cannot walk and the gatekeeper given in the commentaries and through the simile of the saw given in the Paṭisambhidā
 Here is the simile of the man who cannot walk Just as a man unable to walk who is rocking a swing for the amusement of his children and their mother sits at the foot of the swing post and sees both ends and the middle of the swing plank successively coming and going yet does not move from his place in order to see both ends and the middle so too when a bhikkhu places himself with mindfulness as it were at the foot of the post for anchoring mindfulness and rocks the swing of the inbreaths and outbreaths he sits down with mindfulness on the sign at that same place and follows with mindfulness the beginning middle and end of the inbreaths and outbreaths at the place touched by them as they come and go keeping his mind fixed there he then sees them without moving from his place in order to see them This is the simile of the man who cannot walk
 This is the simile of the gatekeeper Just as a gatekeeper does not examine people inside and outside the town asking Who are you Where have you come from Where are you going What have you got in your hand
for those people are not his concernbut he does examine each man as he arrives at the gate so too the incoming breaths that have gone inside and the outgoing breaths that have gone outside are not this bhikkhus concern but they are his concern each time they arrive at the nostril gate itself
 Then the simile of the saw should be understood from its beginning
For this is said
Sign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousness
By one who knows not these three things Development is not obtained
Sign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousness
By one who does know these three things Development can be obtained 
 How is it that these three things are not the object of a single consciousness that they are nevertheless not unknown that the mind does not become distracted that he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect
Suppose there were a tree trunk placed on a level piece of ground and a man cut it with a saw
The mans mindfulness is established by the saws teeth where they touch the tree trunk without his giving attention to the saws teeth as they approach and recede though they are not unknown to him as they do so and he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect
As the tree trunk placed on the level piece of ground so the sign for the anchoring of mindfulness
As the saws teeth so the inbreaths and outbreaths
As the mans mindfulness established by the saws teeth where they touch the tree trunk without his giving attention to the saws teeth as they approach and recede though they are not unknown to him as they do so and so he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect so too the bhikkhu sits having established mindfulness at the nose tip or on the upper lip without giving attention to the inbreaths and outbreaths as they approach and recede though they are not unknown to him as they do so and he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect
Effort what is the effort
The body and the mind of one who is energetic become wieldythis is the effort
What is the task
Imperfections come to be abandoned in one who is energetic and his applied thoughts are stilledthis is the task
What is the effect
Fetters come to be abandoned in one who is energetic and his inherent tendencies come to be done away withthis is the effect
So these three things are not the object of a single consciousness and they are nevertheless not unknown and the mind does not become distracted and he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect
Whose mindfulness of breathing in And out is perfect well developed
And gradually brought to growth According as the Buddha taught
Tis he illuminates the world Just like the full moon free from cloud
This is the simile of the saw
But here it is precisely his not giving attention to the breaths as yet to come and already gone that should be understood as the purpose
 When someone gives his attention to this meditation subject sometimes it is not long before the sign arises in him and then the fixing in other words absorption adorned with the rest of the jhāna factors is achieved
 After someone has given his attention to counting both body and mind become light as though the body would leap up into the air
Just as when a body that is disturbed sits down on a bed or chair the bed or chair sags down and creaks and the cover gets rumpled
but when a body that is not disturbed sits down the bed or chair neither sags down nor creaks the cover does not get rumpled and it is as though filled with cotton wool
why
because a body that is not disturbed is light
so too after he has given his attention to counting when the bodily disturbance has been stilled by the gradual cessation of gross inbreaths and outbreaths then both the body and the mind become light the physical body is as though it were ready to leap up into the air
 When his gross inbreaths and out breaths have ceased his consciousness occurs with the sign of the subtle inbreaths and outbreaths as its object
And when that has ceased it goes on occurring with the successively subtler signs as its object
How
 Suppose a man stuck a bronze bell with a big iron bar and at once a loud sound arose his consciousness would occur with the gross sound as its object
then when the gross sound had ceased it would occur afterwards with the sign of the subtle sound as its object and when that had ceased it would go on occurring with the sign of the successively subtler sounds as its object This is how it should be understood
And this is given in detail in the passage beginning Just as when a metal gong is struck 
For while other meditation subjects become clearer at each higher stage this one does not
in fact as he goes on developing it it becomes more subtle for him at each higher stage and it even comes to the point at which it is no longer manifest However when it becomes unmanifest in this way the bhikkhu should not get up from his seat shake out his leather mat and go away
What should be done
He should not get up with the idea Shall I ask the teacher  or Is my meditation subject lost
for by going away and so disturbing his posture the meditation subject has to be started anew
So he should go on sitting as he was and temporarily substitute the place normally touched for the actual breaths as the object of contemplation
 These are the means for doing it The bhikkhu should recognize the unmanifest state of the meditation subject and consider thus Where do these inbreaths and outbreaths exist Where do they not
In whom do they exist In whom not
Then as he considers thus he finds that they do not exist in one inside the mothers womb or in those drowned in water or likewise in unconscious beings or in the dead or in those attained to the fourth jhāna or in those born into a finematerial or immaterial existence or in those attained to cessation of perception and feeling So he should apostrophize himself thus You with all your wisdom are certainly not inside a mothers womb or drowned in water or in the unconscious existence or dead or attained to the fourth jhāna or born into the finematerial or immaterial existence or attained to cessation
Those inbreaths and outbreath are actually existent in you only you are not able to discern them because your understanding is dull
Then fixing his mind on the place normally touched by the breaths he should proceed to give his attention to that
 These inbreaths and outbreaths occur striking the tip of the nose in a longnosed man
and the upper lip in a shortnosed man
So he should fix the sign thus This is the place where they strike
This was why the Blessed One said Bhikkhus I do not say of one who is forgetful who is not fully aware that he practices development of mindfulness of breathing 
 Although any meditation subject no matter what is successful only in one who is mindful and fully aware
yet any meditation subject other than this one gets more evident as he goes on giving it his attention
But this mindfulness of breathing is difficult difficult to develop a field in which only the minds of Buddhas Paccekabuddhas and Buddhas sons are at home It is no trivial matter nor can it be cultivated by trivial persons
In proportion as continued attention is given to it it becomes more peaceful and more subtle
So strong mindfulness and understanding are necessary here
 Just as when doing needlework on a piece of fine cloth a fine needle is needed
and a still finer instrument for boring the needles eye so too when developing this meditation subject which resembles fine cloth both the mindfulness which is the counterpart of the needle and the understanding associated with it which is the counterpart of the instrument for boring the needles eye need to be strong
A bhikkhu must have the necessary mindfulness and understanding and must look for the inbreaths and outbreaths nowhere else than the place normally touched by them
Suppose a ploughman after doing some ploughing sent his oxen free to graze and sat down to rest in the shade then his oxen would soon go into the forest
Now a skilled ploughman who wants to catch them and yoke them again does not wander through the forest following their tracks but rather he takes his rope and goad and goes straight to the drinking place where they meet and he sits or lies there Then after the oxen have wandered about for a part of the day they come to the drinking place where they meet and they bathe and drink and when he sees that they have come out and are standing about he secures them with the rope and prodding them with the goad he brings them back yokes them and goes on with his ploughing So too the bhikkhu should not look for the inbreaths and out breaths anywhere else than the place normally touched by them
And he should take the rope of mindfulness and the goad of understanding and fixing his mind on the place normally touched by them he should go on giving his attention to that
For as he gives his attention in this way they reappear after no long time as the oxen did at the drinking place where they met
So he can secure them with the rope of mindfulness and yoking them in that same place and prodding them with the goad of understanding he can keep on applying himself to the meditation subject
 When he does so in this way the sign soon appears to him
But it is not the same for all
on the contrary some say that when it appears it does so to certain people producing a light touch like cotton or silkcotton or a draught
 But this is the exposition given in the commentaries It appears to some like a star or a cluster of gems or a cluster of pearls to others with a rough touch like that of silkcotton seeds or a peg made of heartwood to others like a long braid string or a wreath of flowers or a puff of smoke to others like a stretchedout cobweb or a film of cloud or a lotus flower or a chariot wheel or the moons disk or the suns disk
 In fact this resembles an occasion when a number of bhikkhus are sitting together reciting a suttanta When a bhikkhu asks What does this sutta appear like to you one says It appears to me like a great mountain torrent
another To me it is like a line of forest trees
another To me it is like a spreading fruit tree giving cool shade
For the one sutta appears to them differently because of the difference in their perception
Similarly this single meditation subject appears differently because of difference in perception
It is born of perception its source is perception it is produced by perception
Therefore it should be understood that when it appears differently it is because of difference in perception
 And here the consciousness that has inbreath as its object is one the consciousness that has outbreath as its object is another and the consciousness that has the sign as its object is another
For the meditation subject reaches neither absorption nor even access in one who has not got these three things clear
But it reaches access and also absorption in one who has got these three things clear
For this is said
Sign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousness
By one who knows not these three things Development is not obtained
Sign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousness
By one who does know these three things Development can be obtained 
 And when the sign has appeared in this way the bhikkhu should go to the teacher and tell him Venerable sir such and such has appeared to me
But say the Dīgha reciters the teacher should say neither This is the sign nor This is not the sign
after saying It happens like this friend he should tell him Go on giving it attention again and again
for if he were told It is the sign he might become complacent and stop short at that 
and if he were told It is not the sign he might get discouraged and give up
so he should encourage him to keep giving it his attention without saying either
So the Dīgha reciters say firstly
But the Majjhima reciters say that he should be told This is the sign friend Well done Keep giving attention to it again and again 
 Then he should fix his mind on that same sign
and so from now on his development proceeds by way of fixing
For the Ancients said this
Fixing his mind upon the sign And putting away extraneous aspects
The clever man anchors his mind Upon the breathings in and out 
 So as soon as the sign appears his hindrances are suppressed his defilements subside
his mindfulness is established
and his consciousness is concentrated in access concentration
 Then he should not give attention to the sign as to its colour or review it as to its specific characteristic
He should guard it as carefully as a kings chief queen guards the child in her womb due to become a Wheelturning Monarch or as a farmer guards the ripening crops and he should avoid the seven unsuitable things beginning with the unsuitable abode and cultivate the seven suitable things
Then guarding it thus he should make it grow and improve with repeated attention and he should practice the tenfold skill in absorption and bring about evenness of energy 
 As he strives thus fourfold and fivefold jhāna is achieved by him on that same sign in the same way as described under the earth kasiṇa
 However when a bhikkhu has achieved the fourfold and fivefold jhāna and wants to reach purity by developing the meditation subject through observing and through turning away he should make that jhāna familiar by attaining mastery in it in the five ways  and then embark upon insight by defining mentalitymateriality
How
 On emerging from the attainment he sees that the inbreaths and outbreaths have the physical body and the mind as their origin
and that just as when a blacksmiths bellows are being blown the wind moves owing to the bag and to the mans appropriate effort so too inbreaths and outbreaths are due to the body and the mind
Next he defines the inbreaths and outbreaths and the body as materiality and the consciousness and the states associated with the consciousness as the immaterial mind
This is in brief 
but the details will be explained later in the defining of mentalitymateriality 
Having defined mentalitymateriality in this way he seeks its condition
With search he finds it and so overcomes his doubts about the way of mentality materialitys occurrence in the three divisions of time 
His doubts being overcome he attributes the three characteristics beginning with that of suffering to mentality and materiality comprehending them by groups  he abandons the ten imperfections of insight beginning with illumination which arise in the first stages of the contemplation of rise and fall  and he defines as the path the knowledge of the way that is free from these imperfections  He reaches contemplation of dissolution by abandoning attention to arising When all formations have appeared as terror owing to the contemplation of their incessant dissolution he becomes dispassionate towards them  his greed for them fades away and he is liberated from them  After he has thus reached the four noble paths in due succession and has become established in the fruition of Arahantship he at last attains to the nineteen kinds of reviewing knowledge  and he becomes fit to receive the highest gifts from the world with its deities
 At this point his development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing beginning with counting and ending with looking back is completed This is the commentary on the first tetrad in all aspects
 Now since there is no separate method for developing the meditation subject in the case of the other tetrads
their meaning therefore needs only to be understood according to the word commentary
 He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out experiencing happiness that is making happiness known making it plain
Herein the happiness is experienced in two ways with the object and with nonconfusion
 How is the happiness experienced with the object
He attains the two jhānas in which happiness is present
At the time when he has actually entered upon them the happiness is experienced with the object owing to the obtaining of the jhāna because of the experiencing of the object
 How with nonconfusion
When after entering upon and emerging from one of the two jhānas accompanied by happiness he comprehends with insight that happiness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall
then at the actual time of the insight the happiness is experienced with nonconfusion owing to the penetration of its characteristics of impermanence and so on
 For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā
When he knows unification of mind and nondistraction through long inbreaths mindfulness is established in him
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge that happiness is experienced
When he knows unification of mind and nondistraction through long out breaths  through short inbreaths  through short outbreaths  through in breaths  outbreaths experiencing the whole body  through inbreaths  outbreaths tranquilizing the bodily formation mindfulness is established in him
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge that happiness is experienced
It is experienced by him when he adverts when he knows sees reviews steadies his mind resolves with faith exerts energy establishes mindfulness concentrates his mind understands with understanding directly knows what is to be directly known fully understands what is to be fully understood abandons what is to be abandoned develops what is to be developed realizes what is to be realized
It is in this way that that happiness is experienced 
 The remaining three clauses should be understood in the same way as to meaning
but there is this difference here The experiencing of bliss must be understood to be through three jhānas and that of the mental formation through four
The mental formation consists of the two aggregates of feeling and perception
And in the case of the clause experiencing bliss it is said in the Paṭisambhidā in order to show the plane of insight here as well Bliss there are two kinds of bliss bodily bliss and mental bliss 
Tranquilizing the mental formation tranquilizing the gross mental formation stopping it is the meaning
And this should be understood in detail in the same way as given under the bodily formation 
 Here moreover in the happiness clause feeling which is actually being contemplated in this tetrad is stated under the heading of happiness which is a formation
but in the bliss clause feeling is stated in its own form
In the two mentalformation clauses the feeling is that necessarily associated with perception because of the words Perception and feeling belong to the mind these things being bound up with the mind are mental formations  So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of feeling
 In the third tetrad the experiencing of the manner of consciousness must be understood to be through four jhānas
 Gladdening the manner of consciousness he trains thus Making the mind glad instilling gladness into it cheering it rejoicing it I shall breathe in shall breathe out
Herein there is gladdening in two ways through concentration and through insight
How through concentration
He attains the two jhānas in which happiness is present
At the time when he has actually entered upon them he inspires the mind with gladness instils gladness into it by means of the happiness associated with the jhāna
How through insight
After entering upon and emerging from one of the two jhānas accompanied by happiness he comprehends with insight that happiness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall
thus at the actual time of insight he inspires the mind with gladness instils gladness into it by making the happiness associated with the jhāna the object
It is of one progressing in this way that the words He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out gladdening the manner of consciousness are said
 Concentrating the manner of consciousness evenly placing the mind evenly putting it on its object by means of the first jhāna and so on
Or alternatively when having entered upon those jhānas and emerged from them he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall then at the actual time of insight momentary unification of the mind arises through the penetration of the characteristics of impermanence and so on
Thus the words He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out concentrating the manner of consciousness are said also of one who evenly places the mind evenly puts it on its object by means of the momentary unification of the mind arisen thus
 Liberating the manner of consciousness he both breathes in and breathes out delivering liberating the mind from the hindrances by means of the first jhāna from applied and sustained thought by means of the second from happiness by means of the third from pleasure and pain by means of the fourth
Or alternatively when having entered upon those jhānas and emerged from them he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall
then at the actual time of insight he delivers liberates the mind from the perception of permanence by means of the contemplation of impermanence from the perception of pleasure by means of the contemplation of pain from the perception of self by means of the contemplation of not self from delight by means of the contemplation of dispassion from greed by means of the contemplation of fading away from arousing by means of the contemplation of cessation from grasping by means of the contemplation of relinquishment
Hence it is said He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out liberating the manner of consciousness 
So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of mind
 But in the fourth tetrad as to contemplating impermanence here firstly the impermanent should be understood
and impermanence
and the contemplation of impermanence
and one contemplating impermanence
Herein the five aggregates are the impermanent
Why
Because their essence is rise and fall and change
Impermanence is the rise and fall and change in those same aggregates or it is their nonexistence after having been the meaning is it is the breakup of produced aggregates through their momentary dissolution since they do not remain in the same mode
Contemplation of impermanence is contemplation of materiality etc as impermanent in virtue of that impermanence
One contemplating impermanence possesses that contemplation
So it is when one such as this is breathing in and breathing out that it can be understood of him He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out contemplating impermanence 
 Contemplating fading away there are two kinds of fading away that is fading away as destruction and absolute fading away
Herein fading away as destruction is the momentary dissolution of formations
Absolute fading away is Nibbāna
Contemplation of fading away is insight and it is the path which occurs as the seeing of these two
It is when he possesses this twofold contemplation that it can be understood of him He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out contemplating fading away 
 The same method of explanation applies to the clause contemplating cessation
 Contemplating relinquishment relinquishment is of two kinds too that is to say relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into
Relinquishment itself as a way of contemplation is contemplation of relinquishment
For insight is called both relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into since firstly through substitution of opposite qualities it gives up defilements with their aggregateproducing kamma formations and secondly through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed it also enters into Nibbāna by inclining towards Nibbāna which is the opposite of the formed 
Also the path is called both relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into since it gives up defilements with their aggregateproducing kammaformations by cutting them off and it enters into Nibbāna by making it its object
Also both insight and path knowledge are called contemplation because of their reseeing successively each preceding kind of knowledge
It is when he possesses this twofold contemplation that it can be understood of him He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment 
 This tetrad deals only with pure insight
while the previous three deal with serenity and insight
This is how the development of mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases in four tetrads should be understood
This mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases thus is of great fruit of great benefit
 Its great beneficialness should be understood here as peacefulness both because of the words And bhikkhus this concentration through mindfulness of breathing when developed and much practiced is both peaceful and sublime  etc and because of its ability to cut off applied thoughts
for it is because it is peaceful sublime and an unadulterated blissful abiding that it cuts off the minds running hither and thither with applied thoughts obstructive to concentration and keeps the mind only on the breaths as object
Hence it is said Mindfulness of breathing should be developed in order to cut off applied thoughts 
 Also its great beneficialness should be understood as the root condition for the perfecting of clear vision and deliverance
for this has been said by the Blessed One Bhikkhus mindfulness of breathing when developed and much practiced perfects the four foundations of mindfulness The four foundations of mindfulness when developed and much practiced perfect the seven enlightenment factors The seven enlightenment factors when developed and much practiced perfect clear vision and deliverance 
 Again its great beneficialness should be understood to reside in the fact that it causes the final inbreaths and outbreaths to be known
for this is said by the Blessed One Rāhula when mindfulness of breathing is thus developed thus practiced much the final inbreaths and outbreaths too are known as they cease not unknown 
 Herein there are three kinds of breaths that are final because of cessation that is to say final in becoming final in jhāna and final in death
For among the various kinds of becoming  inbreaths and outbreaths occur in the sensualsphere becoming not in the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming That is why there are final ones in becoming
In the jhānas they occur in the first three but not in the fourth That is why there are final ones in jhāna
Those that arise along with the sixteenth consciousness preceding the death consciousness cease together with the death consciousness They are called final in death
It is these last that are meant here by final 
 When a bhikkhu has devoted himself to this meditation subject it seems if he adverts at the moment of arising of the sixteenth consciousness before the death consciousness to their arising then their arising is evident to him
if he adverts to their presence then their presence is evident to him
if he adverts to their dissolution then their dissolution is evident to him and it is so because he has thoroughly discerned inbreaths and outbreaths as object
 When a bhikkhu has attained Arahantship by developing some other meditation subject than this one he may be able to define his life term or not
But when he has reached Arahantship by developing this mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases he can always define his life term
He knows My vital formations will continue now for so long and no more  Automatically he performs all the functions of attending to the body dressing and robing etc after which he closes his eyes like the Elder Tissa who lived at the Koṭapabbata Monastery like the Elder Mahā Tissa who lived at the Mahā Karañjiya Monastery like the Elder Tissa the almsfood eater in the kingdom of Devaputta like the elders who were brothers and lived at the Cittalapabbata monastery
 Here is one story as an illustration
After reciting the Pātimokkha it seems on the Uposatha day of the full moon one of the two elders who were brothers went to his own dwelling place surrounded by the Community of Bhikkhus As he stood on the walk looking at the moonlight he calculated his own vital formations and he said to the Community of Bhikkhus In what way have you seen bhikkhus attaining Nibbāna up till now
Some answered Till now we have seen them attain Nibbāna sitting in their seats
Others answered We have seen them sitting crosslegged in the air
The elder said I shall now show you one attaining Nibbāna while walking  He then drew a line on the walk saying I shall go from this end of the walk to the other end and return when I reach this line I shall attain Nibbāna  So saying he stepped on to the walk and went to the far end On his return he attained Nibbāna in the same moment in which he stepped on the line
So let a man if he is wise Untiringly devote his days
To mindfulness of breathing which Rewards him always in these ways
This is the section dealing with mindfulness of breathing in the detailed explanation
 One who wants to develop the recollection of peace mentioned next to mindfulness of breathing should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of Nibbāna in other words the stilling of all suffering as follows Bhikkhus in so far as there are dhammas whether formed or unformed fading away is pronounced the best of them that is to say the disillusionment of vanity the elimination of thirst the abolition of reliance the termination of the round the destruction of craving fading away cessation Nibbāna 
 Herein in so far as means as many as
Dhammas means individual essences
Whether formed or unformed whether made by conditions going together coming together or not so made
Fading away is pronounced the best of them of these formed and unformed dhammas fading away is pronounced the best is called the foremost the highest
 Herein fading away is not mere absence of greed but rather it is that unformed dhamma which while given the names disillusionment of vanity etc in the clause that is to say the disillusionment of vanity  Nibbāna is treated basically as fading away
It is called disillusionment of vanity because on coming to it all kinds of vanity  such as the vanity of conceit and vanity of manhood are disillusioned undone done away with
And it is called elimination of thirst because on coming to it all thirst for sense desires is eliminated and quenched
But it is called abolition of reliance because on coming to its reliance on the five cords of sense desire is abolished
It is called termination of the round because on coming to it the round of the three planes of existence is terminated
It is called destruction of craving because on coming to it craving is entirely destroyed fades away and ceases
It is called Nibbāna because it has gone away from  has escaped from  is dissociated from craving which has acquired in common usage the name fastening because by ensuring successive becoming craving serves as a joining together a binding together a lacing together of the four kinds of generation five destinies seven stations of consciousness and nine abodes of beings
 This is how peace in other words Nibbāna should be recollected according to its special qualities beginning with disillusionment of vanity
But it should also be recollected according to the other special qualities of peace stated by the Blessed One in the suttas beginning with Bhikkhus I shall teach you the unformed  the truth  the other shore  the hardtosee  the undecaying  the lasting  the undiversified  the deathless  the auspicious  the safe  the marvellous  the intact  the unafflicted  the purity  the island  the shelter  
 As he recollects peace in its special qualities of disillusionment of vanity etc in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by peace 
So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described under the recollection of the Enlightened One etc the jhāna factors arise in a single moment
But owing to the profundity of the special qualities of peace or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of various kinds the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption
And that jhāna itself is known as recollection of peace too because it arises by means of the special qualities of peace
 And as in the case of the six recollections this also comes to success only in a noble disciple Still though this is so it can nevertheless also be brought to mind by an ordinary person who values peace
For even by hearsay the mind has confidence in peace
 A bhikkhu who is devoted to this recollection of peace sleeps in bliss and wakes in bliss his faculties are peaceful his mind is peaceful he has conscience and shame he is confident he is resolved to attain the superior state he is respected and honoured by his fellows in the life of purity
And even if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destiny
So that is why a man of wit Untiringly devotes his days
To mind the noble peace which can Reward him in so many ways
This is the section dealing with the recollection of peace in the detailed explanation
composed for the purpose of gladdening good people in the Path of Purification
in the Treatise on the Development of Concentration
called The Description of Recollections as Meditation Subjects
The eighth chapter
 The four divine abidings were mentioned next to the recollections as meditation subjects  They are lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity A meditator who wants to develop firstly lovingkindness among these if he is a beginner should sever the impediments and learn the meditation subject Then when he has done the work connected with the meal and got rid of any dizziness due to it he should seat himself comfortably on a wellprepared seat in a secluded place To start with he should review the danger in hate and the advantage in patience
 Why
Because hate has to be abandoned and patience attained in the development of this meditation subject
and he cannot abandon unseen dangers and attain unknown advantages
Now the danger in hate should be seen in accordance with such suttas as this Friends when a man hates is a prey to hate and his mind is obsessed by hate he kills living things and  
No higher rule the Buddhas say than patience And no Nibbāna higher than forbearance 
Patience in force in strong array Tis him I call a brahman 
No greater thing exists than patience  And the advantage in patience should be understood according to such suttas as these 
Thereupon he should embark upon the development of lovingkindness for the purpose of secluding the mind from hate seen as a danger and introducing it to patience known as an advantage
But when he begins he must know that some persons are of the wrong sort at the very beginning and that lovingkindness should be developed towards certain kinds of persons and not towards certain other kinds at first
For lovingkindness should not be developed at first towards the following four kinds of persons an antipathetic person a very dearly loved friend a neutral person and a hostile person
Also it should not be developed specifically towards the opposite sex
or towards a dead person
 What is the reason why it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the others
To put an antipathetic person in a dear ones place is fatiguing
To put a very dearly loved friend in a neutral persons place is fatiguing and if the slightest mischance befalls the friend he feels like weeping
To put a neutral person in a respected ones or a dear ones place is fatiguing
Anger springs up in him if he recollects a hostile person That is why it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the rest
Then if he develops it specifically towards the opposite sex lust inspired by that person springs up in him
An elder supported by a family was asked it seems by a friends son Venerable sir towards whom should lovingkindness be developed
The elder told him Towards a person one loves
He loved his own wife
Through developing lovingkindness towards her he was fighting against the wall all the night
That is why it should not be developed specifically towards the opposite sex
But if he develops it towards a dead person he reaches neither absorption nor access
A young bhikkhu it seems had started developing lovingkindness inspired by his teacher
His lovingkindness made no headway at all
He went to a senior elder and told him Venerable sir I am quite familiar with attaining jhāna through lovingkindness and yet I cannot attain it What is the matter
The elder said Seek the sign friend the object of your meditation
He did so Finding that his teacher had died he proceeded with developing lovingkindness inspired by another and attained absorption
That is why it should not be developed towards one who is dead
First of all it should be developed only towards oneself doing it repeatedly thus May I be happy and free from suffering or May I keep myself free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily
If that is so does it not conflict with what is said in the texts For there is no mention of any development of it towards oneself in what is said in the Vibhaṅga
And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart filled with lovingkindness
Just as he would feel lovingkindness on seeing a dearly loved person so he pervades all beings with lovingkindness 
and in the Paṭisambhidā
In what five ways is the minddeliverance of lovingkindness practiced with unspecified pervasion May all beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily
May all breathing things  all who are born  all persons  all those who have a personality be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily 
in what is said 
and in the Mettā Sutta
In joy and safety
may all beings be joyful at heart 
in what is said Does it not conflict with what is said in the texts
For there is no mention of any development of it towards oneself Does it not conflict with those texts
 It does not conflict
Why not
Because that refers to absorption
But this initial development towards oneself refers to making oneself an example
For even if he developed lovingkindness for a hundred or a thousand years in this way I am happy and so on absorption would never arise
But if he develops it in this way I am happy Just as I want to be happy and dread pain as I want to live and not to die so do other beings too making himself the example then desire for other beings welfare and happiness arises in him
And by the Blessed Ones saying
I visited all quarters with my mind
Nor found I any dearer than myself
Self is likewise to every other dear
Who loves himself will never harm another 
this method is indicated 
So he should first as example pervade himself with lovingkindness Next after that in order to proceed easily he can recollect such gifts kind words etc as inspire love and endearment such virtue learning etc as inspire respect and reverence met with in a teacher or his equivalent or a preceptor or his equivalent developing lovingkindness towards him in the way beginning May this good man be happy and free from suffering
With such a person of course he attains absorption But if this bhikkhu does not rest content with just that much and wants to break down the barriers he should next after that develop lovingkindness towards a very dearly loved friend then towards a neutral person as a very dearly loved friend then towards a hostile person as neutral
And while he does so he should make his mind malleable and wieldy in each instance before passing on to the next
But if he has no enemy or he is of the type of a great man who does not perceive another as an enemy even when the other does him harm he should not interest himself as follows Now that my consciousness of lovingkindness has become wieldy towards a neutral person I shall apply it to a hostile one
Rather it was about one who actually has an enemy that it was said above that he should develop lovingkindness towards a hostile person as neutral
If resentment arises in him when he applies his mind to a hostile person because he remembers wrongs done by that person he should get rid of the resentment by entering repeatedly into lovingkindness jhāna towards any of the firstmentioned persons and then after he has emerged each time directing lovingkindness towards that person
But if it does not die out in spite of his efforts then
Let him reflect upon the saw With other figures of such kind
And strive and strive repeatedly To leave resentment far behind
He should admonish himself in this way Now you who get angry has not the Blessed One said this
 Bhikkhus even if bandits brutally severed limb from limb with a twohandled saw he who entertained hate in his heart on that account
would not be one who carried out my teaching  And this
To repay angry men in kind Is worse than to be angry first
Repay not angry men in kind And win a battle hard to win
The weal of both he does promote His own and then the others too
Who shall anothers anger know And mindfully maintain his peace 
And this Bhikkhus there are seven things gratifying and helpful to an enemy that happen to one who is angry whether woman or man
What seven
Here bhikkhus an enemy wishes thus for his enemy Let him be ugly
Why is that
An enemy does not delight in an enemys beauty
Now this angry person is a prey to anger ruled by anger though well bathed well anointed with hair and beard trimmed and clothed in white yet he is ugly being a prey to anger
This is the first thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is angry whether woman or man
Furthermore an enemy wishes thus for his enemy Let him lie in pain  Let him have no fortune  Let him not be wealthy  Let him not be famous  Let him have no friends  Let him not on the breakup of the body after death reappear in a happy destiny in the heavenly world
Why is that
An enemy does not delight in an enemys going to a happy destiny
Now this angry person is a prey to anger ruled by anger he misconducts himself in body speech and mind
Misconducting himself thus in body speech and mind on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a state of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell being a prey to anger 
And this As a log from a pyre burnt at both ends and fouled in the middle serves neither for timber in the village nor for timber in the forest
so is such a person as this I say
If you are angry now you will be one who does not carry out the Blessed Ones teaching by repaying an angry man in kind you will be worse than the angry man and not win the battle hard to win you will yourself do to yourself the things that help your enemy and you will be like a pyre log 
If his resentment subsides when he strives and makes effort in this way it is good
If not then he should remove irritation by remembering some controlled and purified state in that person which inspires confidence when remembered
For one person may be controlled in his bodily behaviour
with his control in doing an extensive course of duty known to all
though his verbal and mental behaviour are not controlled
Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his bodily behaviour remembered
Another may be controlled in his verbal behaviour
and his control known to all
he may naturally be clever at welcoming kindly easy to talk with congenial opencountenanced deferential in speech and he may expound the Dhamma with a sweet voice and give explanations of Dhamma with well rounded phrases and details
though his bodily and mental behaviour are not controlled Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his verbal behaviour remembered
 Another may be controlled in his mental behaviour and his control in worshiping at shrines etc evident to all
For when one who is uncontrolled in mind pays homage at a shrine or at an Enlightenment Tree or to elders he does not do it carefully and he sits in the Dhammapreaching pavilion with mind astray or nodding
while one whose mind is controlled pays homage carefully and deliberately listens to the Dhamma attentively remembering it and evincing the confidence in his mind through his body or his speech
So another may be only controlled in his mental behaviour though his bodily and verbal behaviour are not controlled Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his mental behaviour remembered
But there may be another in whom not even one of these three things is controlled Then compassion for that person should be aroused thus Though he is going about in the human world now nevertheless after a certain number of days he will find himself in one of the eight great hells or the sixteen prominent hells
For irritation subsides too through compassion
In yet another all three may be controlled Then he can remember any of the three in that person whichever he likes
for the development of lovingkindness towards such a person is easy
And in order to make the meaning of this clear Bhikkhus there are five ways of dispelling annoyance
whereby annoyance arisen in a bhikkhu can be entirely dispelled  this following sutta from the Book of Fives should be cited in full
 But if irritation still arises in him in spite of his efforts then he should admonish himself thus
Suppose an enemy has hurt You now in what is his domain
Why try yourself as well to hurt Your mind That is not his domain
In tears you left your family They had been kind and helpful too
So why not leave your enemy The anger that brings harm to you
gnawing at the very roots Of all the virtues that you guard
This anger that you entertain  Who is there such a fool as you
Another does ignoble deeds So you are angryHow is this
Do you then want to copy too The sort of acts that he commits
Suppose another to annoy Provokes you with some odious act
Why suffer anger to spring up And do as he would have you do
If you get angry then maybe You make him suffer maybe not
Though with the hurt that anger brings You certainly are punished now
If angerblinded enemies Set out to tread the path of woe
Do you by getting angry too Intend to follow heel to toe
If hurt is done you by a foe Because of anger on your part
Then put your anger down for why Should you be harassed groundlessly
Since states last but a moments time Those aggregates by which was done
The odious act have ceased so now What is it you are angry with
Whom shall he hurt who seeks to hurt Another in the others absence
Your presence is the cause of hurt Why are you angry then with him
But if resentment does not subside when he admonishes himself thus then he should review the fact that he himself and the other are owners of their deeds 
Herein he should first review this in himself thus Now what is the point of your getting angry with him
Will not this kamma of yours that has anger as its source lead to your own harm
For you are the owner of your deeds heir of your deeds having deeds as your parent deeds as your kin deeds as your refuge you will become the heir of whatever deeds you do  And this is not the kind of deed to bring you to full enlightenment to undeclared enlightenment or to the disciples grade or to any such position as the status of Brahmā or Sakka or the throne of a Wheelturning Monarch or a regional king etc but rather this is the kind of deed to lead to your fall from the Dispensation even to the status of the eaters of scraps etc and to the manifold suffering in the hells and so on
By doing this you are like a man who wants to hit another and picks up a burning ember or excrement in his hand and so first burns himself or makes himself stink
 Having reviewed ownership of deeds in himself in this way he should review it in the other also And what is the point of his getting angry with you
Will it not lead to his own harm
For that venerable one is owner of his deeds heir of his deeds  he will become the heir of whatever deeds he does
And this is not the kind of deed to bring him to full enlightenment to undeclared enlightenment or to the disciples grade or to any such position as the status of Brahmā or Sakka or to the throne of a Wheelturning Monarch or a regional king etc but rather this is the kind of deed to lead to his fall from the Dispensation even to the status of the eaters of scraps etc and to the manifold suffering in the hells and so on
By doing this he is like a man who wants to throw dust at another against the wind and only covers himself with it
For this is said by the Blessed One
When a fool hates a man that has no hate
Is purified and free from every blemish
Such evil he will find comes back on him
As does fine dust thrown up against the wind 
But if it still does not subside in him when he reviews ownership of deeds in this way then he should review the special qualities of the Masters former conduct
Here is the way of reviewing it Now you who have gone forth is it not a fact that when your Master was a Bodhisatta before discovering full enlightenment while he was still engaged in fulfilling the perfections during the four incalculable ages and a hundred thousand aeons he did not allow hate to corrupt his mind even when his enemies tried to murder him on various occasions
For example in the Sīlavant Birth Story when his friends rose to prevent his kingdom of three hundred leagues being seized by an enemy king who had been incited by a wicked minister in whose mind his own queen had sown hate for him he did not allow them to lift a weapon
Again when he was buried along with a thousand companions up to the neck in a hole dug in the earth in a charnel ground he had no thought of hate And when after saving his life by a heroic effort helped by jackals scraping away soil when they had come to devour the corpses he went with the aid of a spirit to his own bedroom and saw his enemy lying on his own bed he was not angry but treated him as a friend undertaking a mutual pledge and he then exclaimed
The brave aspire the wise will not lose heart
I see myself as I had wished to be 
 And in the Khantivādin Birth Story he was asked by the stupid king of Kāsi  What do you preach monk  and he replied I am a preacher of patience and when the king had him flogged with scourges of thorns and had his hands and feet cut off he felt not the slightest anger 
It is perhaps not so wonderful that an adult who had actually gone forth into homelessness should have acted in that way
but also as an infant he did so For in the CūḷaDhammapāla Birth Story
Oh Dhammapālas arms are severed That had been bathed in sandalwood
He was the heir to all the earth O king my breath is choking me 
his hands and feet were ordered to be lopped off like four bamboo shoots by his father King Mahāpatāpa and his mother lamented over him thus  Then his father still not satisfied commanded that his head be cut off as well But even then he had not the least trace of hate since he had firmly resolved thus Now is the time to restrain your mind now good Dhammapāla be impartial towards these four persons that is to say towards your father who is having your head cut off the man who is beheading you your lamenting mother and yourself
And it is perhaps not so wonderful that one who had become a human being should have acted in that way
but also as an animal he did so For while the Bodhisatta was the elephant called Chaddanta he was pierced in the navel by a poisoned shaft But even then he allowed no hate towards the hunter who had wounded him to corrupt his mind
according as it is said
The elephant when struck by the stout shaft
Addressed the hunter with no hate in mind
What is your aim What is the reason why
You kill me thus What can your purpose be 
And when the elephant had spoken thus and was told Sir I have been sent by the king of Kāsis queen to get your tusks in order to fulfil her wish he cut off his own tusks whose gorgeous radiance glittered with the flashes of the six coloured rays and gave them to him
And when he was the Great Monkey the man whom he had pulled out of a rocky chasm thought
Now this is food for human kind Like other forest animals
So why then should a hungry man Not kill the ape to eat I ask
Ill travel independently Taking his meat as a provision
Thus I shall cross the waste and that Will furnish my viaticum 
Then he took up a stone and dashed it on his head But the monkey looked at him with eyes full of tears and said
Oh act not so good sir or else That you would do to me today
The fate you reap will long deter All others from such deeds as this 
And with no hate in his mind and regardless of his own pain he saw to it that the man reached his journeys end in safety
And while he was the royal nāga Bhūridatta when he had undertaken the Uposatha precepts and was lying on the top of a termitemound though he was caught and sprinkled with medicinal charms resembling the fire that ushers in the end of an aeon and was put into a box and treated as a plaything throughout the whole of Jambudīpa yet he had no trace of hate for that brahman
according as it is said
While being put into the coffer And being crushed down with his hand
I had no hate for lambāna Lest I should break my precept vow 
And when he was the royal nāga Campeyya he let no hate spring up in his mind while he was being cruelly treated by a snake charmer
according as it is said
While I was living in the Law Observing the Uposatha
A snake charmer took me away To play with at the royal gate
Whatever hue he might conceive Blue and yellow and red as well
So in accordance with his thought I would become what he had wished
I would turn dry land into water And water into land likewise
Now had I given way to wrath I could have seared him into ash
Had I relaxed mindmastery I should have let my virtue lapse
And one who lets his virtue lapse Cannot attain the highest goal 
And when he was the royal nāga Saṅkhapāla while he was being carried along on a carrying pole by the sixteen village boys after they had wounded him in eight places with sharp spears and inserted thorn creepers into the wounds orifices and while after threading a strong rope through his nose they were causing him great agony by dragging him along bumping his body on the surface of the ground though he was capable of turning those village boys to cinders with a mere glance yet he did not even show the least trace of hate on opening his eyes
according as it is said
On the fourteenth and the fifteenth too ḷāra
I regularly kept the Holy Day
Until there came those sixteen village boys
Bearing a rope and a stout spear as well
The hunters cleft my nose and through the slit
They passed a rope and dragged me off like that
But though I felt such poignant agony
I let no hate disturb my Holy Day 
And he performed not only these wonders but also many others too such as those told in the Mātuposaka Birth Story 
Now it is in the highest degree improper and unbecoming to you to arouse thoughts of resentment since you are emulating as your Master that Blessed One who reached omniscience and who has in the special quality of patience no equal in the world with its deities 
But if as he reviews the special qualities of the Masters former conduct the resentment still does not subside in him since he has long been used to the slavery of defilement then he should review the suttas that deal with the beginninglessness of the round of rebirths
Here is what is said
Bhikkhus it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother  your father  your brother  your sister  your son  your daughter 
Consequently he should think about that person thus This person it seems as my mother in the past carried me in her womb for ten months and removed from me without disgust as if it were yellow sandalwood my urine excrement spittle snot etc and played with me in her lap and nourished me carrying me about on her hip And this person as my father went by goat paths and paths set on piles etc to pursue the trade of merchant and he risked his life for me by going into battle in double array by sailing on the great ocean in ships and doing other difficult things and he nourished me by bringing back wealth by one means or another thinking to feed his children
And as my brother sister son daughter this person gave me such and such help So it is unbecoming for me to harbour hate for him in my mind 
But if he is still unable to quench that thought in this way then he should review the advantages of lovingkindness thus Now you who have gone forth into homelessness has it not been said by the Blessed One as follows
Bhikkhus when the minddeliverance of lovingkindness is cultivated developed much practiced made the vehicle made the foundation established consolidated and properly undertaken eleven blessings can be expected
What are the eleven
A man sleeps in comfort wakes in comfort and dreams no evil dreams he is dear to human beings he is dear to nonhuman beings deities guard him fire and poison and weapons do not affect him his mind is easily concentrated the expression of his face is serene he dies unconfused if he penetrates no higher he will be reborn in the Brahmāworld 
 If you do not stop this thought you will be denied these advantages 
But if he is still unable to stop it in this way he should try resolution into elements
How
Now you who have gone forth into homelessness when you are angry with him what is it you are angry with
Is it head hairs you are angry with Or body hairs Or nails  Or is it urine you are angry with
Or alternatively is it the earth element in the head hairs etc you are angry with Or the water element Or the fire element Or is it the air element you are angry with
Or among the five aggregates or the twelve bases or the eighteen elements with respect to which this venerable one is called by such and such a name which then is it the materiality aggregate you are angry with Or the feeling aggregate the perception aggregate the formations aggregate the consciousness aggregate you are angry with
Or is it the eye base you are angry with Or the visibleobject base you are angry with  Or the mind base you are angry with Or the mentalobject base you are angry with
Or is it the eye element you are angry with Or the visibleobject element Or the eyeconsciousness element  Or the mind element Or the mentalobject element Or the mindconsciousness element you are angry with
For when he tries the resolution into elements his anger finds no foothold like a mustard seed on the point of an awl or a painting on the air
But if he cannot effect the resolution into elements he should try the giving of a gift
It can either be given by himself to the other or accepted by himself from the other
But if the others livelihood is not purified and his requisites are not proper to be used it should be given by oneself
And in the one who does this the annoyance with that person entirely subsides
And in the other even anger that has been dogging him from a past birth subsides at the moment as happened to the senior elder who received a bowl given to him at the Cittalapabbata Monastery by an almsfoodeater elder who had been three times made to move from his lodging by him and who presented it with these words Venerable sir this bowl worth eight ducats was given me by my mother who is a lay devotee and it is rightly obtained let the good lay devotee acquire merit
So efficacious is this act of giving
And this is said
A gift for taming the untamed A gift for every kind of good
Through giving gifts they do unbend And condescend to kindly speech
 When his resentment towards that hostile person has been thus allayed then he can turn his mind with lovingkindness towards that person too just as towards the one who is dear the very dear friend and the neutral person
Then he should break down the barriers by practicing lovingkindness over and over again accomplishing mental impartiality towards the four persons that is to say himself the dear person the neutral person and the hostile person
The characteristic of it is this Suppose this person is sitting in a place with a dear a neutral and a hostile person himself being the fourth then bandits come to him and say Venerable sir give us a bhikkhu and on being asked why they answer So that we may kill him and use the blood of his throat as an offering then if that bhikkhu thinks Let them take this one or this one he has not broken down the barriers
And also if he thinks Let them take me but not these three he has not broken down the barriers either
Why
Because he seeks the harm of him whom he wishes to be taken and seeks the welfare of the other only
But it is when he does not see a single one among the four people to be given to the bandits and he directs his mind impartially towards himself and towards those three people that he has broken down the barriers
Hence the Ancients said
 The four that is himself the dear The neutral and the hostile one
When he discriminates between  But only kindly towards beings
Then skilled is not the name he gets Nor having amity at will
Now when a bhikkhus barriers Have all the four been broken down
He treats with equal amity The whole world with its deities
Far more distinguished than the first Is he who knows no barriers
 Thus the sign and access are obtained by this bhikkhu simultaneously with the breaking down of the barriers
But when breaking down of the barriers has been effected he reaches absorption in the way described under the earth kasiṇa without trouble by cultivating developing and repeatedly practicing that same sign
At this point he has attained the first jhāna which abandons five factors possesses five factors is good in three ways is endowed with ten characteristics and is accompanied by lovingkindness
And when that has been obtained then by cultivating developing and repeatedly practicing that same sign he successively reaches the second and third jhānas in the fourfold system and the second third and fourth in the fivefold system
Now it is by means of one of these jhānas beginning with the first that he Dwells pervading one direction with his heart endued with loving kindness
likewise the second direction likewise the third direction likewise the fourth direction
and so above below and around everywhere and equally he dwells pervading the entire world with his heart endued with loving kindness abundant exalted measureless free from enmity and free from affliction 
For this versatility comes about only in one whose consciousness has reached absorption in the first jhāna and the rest
 And here endued with lovingkindness means possessing lovingkindness
With his heart  with his mind 
One direction this refers to anyone direction in which a being is first discerned and means pervasion of the beings included in that one direction
Pervading touching making his object
He dwells  he causes the occurrence of an abiding in postures that is devoted to the divine abidings 
Likewise the second just as he dwells pervading anyone direction among those beginning with the eastern one so he does with the next one and the third and the fourth is the meaning
 So above in that same way in the upper direction is what is meant
Below around so too the lower direction and the direction all round
Herein below is underneath
and around is in the intermediate directions
So he sends his heart full of lovingkindness back and forth in all directions like a horse in a circus ground
Up to this point specified pervasion with lovingkindness is shown in the discernment of each direction separately
Everywhere etc is said for the purpose of showing unspecified pervasion
Herein everywhere means in all places
Equally  to all classed as inferior medium superior friendly hostile neutral etc just as to oneself 
equality with oneself without making the distinction This is another being is what is meant
Or alternatively equally is with the whole state of the mind not reserving even a little is what is meant
Entire  possessing all beings  associated with all beings is the meaning
World is the world of beings
 Endued with lovingkindness is said again here in order to introduce the synonyms beginning with abundant
Or alternatively endued with lovingkindness is repeated because the word likewise or the word so is not repeated here as it was in the case of the preceding specified pervasion
Or alternatively it is said as a way of concluding
And abundant should be regarded here as abundance in pervading
But it is exalted in plane from the sensualsphere plane to the fine materialsphere plane measureless through familiarity and through having measureless beings as its object free from enmity through abandonment of ill will and hostility and free from affliction through abandonment of grief without suffering is what is meant
This is the meaning of the versatility described in the way beginning With his heart endued with lovingkindness
And just as this versatility is successful only in one whose mind has reached absorption so too that described in the Paṭisambhidā should be understood to be successful only in one whose mind has reached absorption that is to say The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified pervasion in five ways The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with specified pervasion in seven ways The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with directional pervasion in ten ways 
 And herein the minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified pervasion in these five ways May all beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily May all breathing things  all creatures  all persons  all those who have a personality be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily 
 The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with specified pervasion in these seven ways May all women be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily May all men  all Noble Ones  all not Noble Ones  all deities  all human beings  all in states of loss be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily 
 May all beings in the eastern direction be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily
May all beings in the western direction  northern direction  southern direction  eastern intermediate direction  western intermediate direction  northern intermediate direction  southern intermediate direction  downward direction  upward direction be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily
May all breathing things in the eastern direction  May all creatures in the eastern direction  May all persons in the eastern direction  May all who have a personality in the eastern direction  etc  in the upward direction be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily
May all women in the eastern direction  May all men in the eastern direction  May all Noble Ones in the eastern direction  May all not Noble Ones in the eastern direction  May all deities in the eastern direction  May all human beings in the eastern direction  May all those in states of loss in the eastern direction  etc  be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily 
The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with directional pervasion in these ten ways 
 Herein all signifies inclusion without exception
Beings  they are held  gripped by desire and greed for the aggregates beginning with materiality thus they are beings 
For this is said by the Blessed One
Any desire for matter Rādha any greed for it any delight in it any craving for it has held it has gripped it that is why a being is said 
But in ordinary speech this term of common usage is applied also to those who are without greed just as the term of common usage palm fan is used for different sorts of fans in general even if made of split bamboo
However in the world etymologists who do not consider meaning have it that it is a mere name
while those who do consider meaning have it that a being is so called with reference to the bright principle 
Breathing things  so called because of their state of breathing  the meaning is because their existence depends on inbreaths and outbreaths
Creatures  so called because of being  the meaning is because of their being fully become  because of their being generated 
puṃ is what hell is called
they fall into that is the meaning of persons 
Personality is what the physical body is called
or it is just the pentad of aggregates since it is actually only a concept derived from that pentad of aggregates
What is referred to is included in that personality thus it has a personality 
Included in is delimited by gone into is the meaning
And all the remaining terms should be understood as synonyms for all beings used in accordance with ordinary speech as in the case of the term beings
Of course there are other synonyms too for all beings such as all folks all souls etc still it is for claritys sake that The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified pervasion in five ways is said and that only these five are mentioned
 Those who would have it that there is not only a mere verbal difference between beings breathing things etc but also an actual difference in meaning are contradicted by the mention of unspecified pervasion So instead of taking the meaning in that way the unspecified pervasion with loving kindness is done in any one of these five ways
And here may all beings be free from enmity is one absorption
free from affliction is one absorption
free from affliction is free from afflictedness 
free from anxiety is one absorption
free from anxiety is free from suffering
may they live happily is one absorption
Consequently he should do his pervading with lovingkindness according to whichever of these phrases is clear to him
So with the four kinds of absorption in each of the five ways there are twenty kinds of absorption in unspecified pervasion
 In specified pervasion with the four kinds of absorption in each of the seven ways there are twentyeight kinds of absorption
And here woman and man are stated according to sex
Noble Ones and not Noble Ones according to Noble Ones and ordinary people
deities and human beings and those in states of loss according to the kind of rebirth
 In directional pervasion with twenty kinds of absorption in each of the directions beginning with all beings in the eastern direction there are two hundred kinds of absorption and with twentyeight kinds in each of the directions beginning with all women in the eastern direction there are two hundred and eighty kinds so these make four hundred and eighty kinds of absorption
Consequently all the kinds of absorption mentioned in the Paṭisambhidā amount to five hundred and twentyeight
So when this meditator develops the minddeliverance of lovingkindness through any one of these kinds of absorption he obtains the eleven advantages described in the way beginning A man sleeps in comfort 
 Herein sleeps in comfort means that instead of sleeping uncomfortably turning over and snoring as other people do he sleeps comfortably
he falls asleep as though entering upon an attainment
 He wakes in comfort instead of waking uncomfortably groaning and yawning and turning over as others do he wakes comfortably without contortions like a lotus opening
 He dreams no evil dreams when he sees dreams he sees only auspicious ones as though he were worshipping a shrine as though he were making an offering as though he were hearing the Dhamma
But he does not see evil dreams as others do as though being surrounded by bandits as though being threatened by wild beasts as though falling into chasms 
He is dear to human beings he is as dear to and beloved by human beings as a necklace worn to hang on the chest as a wreath adorning the head
He is dear to nonhuman beings he is just as dear to nonhuman beings as he is to human beings as in the Elder Visākhas case
He was a landowner it seems at Pāṭaliputta 
While he was living there he heard this The Island of Tambapaṇṇi  apparently is adorned with a diadem of shrines and gleams with the yellow cloth and there a man can sit or lie wherever he likes there the climate is favourable the abodes are favourable the people are favourable the Dhamma to be heard is favourable and all these favourable things are easily obtained there
He made over his fortune to his wife and children and left his home with only a single ducat sewn into the hem of his garment He stopped for one month on the sea coast in expectation of a ship
and meanwhile by his skill in trading he made a thousand during the month by buying goods here and selling them there in lawful enterprise
 Eventually he came to the Great Monastery at Anurādha pura and there he asked for the going forth into homelessness
When he was being conducted to the chapter house for the goingforth ceremony the purse containing the thousand pieces dropped out from under his belt
When asked What is that he replied It is a thousand ducats venerable sirs They told him Lay follower it is not possible to distribute them after the going forth Distribute them now Then he said Let none who have come to the scene of Visākhas going forth depart emptyhanded and opening the purse he strewed them over the chapter house yard after which he received the going forth and the full admission
When he had acquired five years seniority and had become familiar with the two Codes he celebrated the Pavāraṇā at the end of the Rains took a meditation subject that suited him and set out to wander living for four months in each monastery and doing the duties on a basis of equality with the residents
While he was wandering in this way
The elder halted in a wood To scan the tenor of his way
He thundered forth this roundelay Proclaiming that he found it good
So from your fulladmission day Till in this place you paused and stood
No stumbling mars your bhikkhuhood Be thankful for such grace I say
On his way to Cittalapabbata he came to a road fork and stood wondering which turn to take
Then a deity living in a rock held out a hand pointing out the road to him
 He came to the Cittalapabbata Monastery After he had stayed there for four months he lay down thinking In the morning I depart
Then a deity living in a maṇila tree at the end of the walk sat down on a step of the stair and burst into tears
The elder asked Who is that
It is I Maṇiliyā venerable sir
What are you weeping for
Because you are going away
What good does my living here to you
Venerable sir as long as you live here non human beings treat each other kindly Now when you are gone they will start quarrels and loose talk
The elder said If my living here makes you live at peace that is good and so he stayed there another four months Then he again thought of leaving
but the deity wept as before
And so the elder lived on there and it was there that he attained Nibbāna This is how a bhikkhu who abides in lovingkindness is dear to nonhuman beings
 Deities guard him deities guard him as a mother and father guard their child
Fire poison and weapons do not affect him they do not affect do not enter into the body of one who abides in lovingkindness like the fire in the case of the lay woman devotee Uttarā  like the poison in the case of the Saṃyutta reciter the Elder CūḷaSiva like the knife in the case of the novice Saṅkicca 
they do not disturb the body is what is meant
And they tell the story of the cow here too
A cow was giving milk to her calf it seems
A hunter thinking I shall shoot her flourished a longhandled spear in his hand and flung it
It struck her body and bounced off like a palm leafand that was owing neither to access nor to absorption but simply to the strength of her consciousness of love for her calf
So mightily powerful is loving kindness
His mind is easily concentrated the mind of one who abides in lovingkindness is quickly concentrated there is no sluggishness about it
 The expression of his face is serene his face has a serene expression like a palmyra fruit loosed from its stem
He dies unconfused there is no dying deluded for one who abides in loving kindness He passes away undeluded as if falling asleep
If he penetrates no higher if he is unable to reach higher than the attainment of lovingkindness and attain Arahantship then when he falls from this life he reappears in the Brahmāworld as one who wakes up from sleep
This is the detailed explanation of the development of lovingkindness
One who wants to develop compassion should begin his task by reviewing the danger in lack of compassion and the advantage in compassion
And when he begins it he should not direct it at first towards the dear etc persons
for one who is dear simply retains the position of one who is dear
a very dear companion retains the position of a very dear companion
one who is neutral retains the position of one who is neutral
one who is antipathetic retains the position of one who is antipathetic
and one who is hostile retains the position of one who is hostile
One of the opposite sex and one who is dead are also not the field for it
In the Vibhaṅga it is said And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with compassion
Just as he would feel compassion on seeing an unlucky unfortunate person so he pervades all beings with compassion  Therefore first of all on seeing a wretched man unlucky unfortunate in every way a fit object for compassion unsightly reduced to utter misery with hands and feet cut off sitting in the shelter for the helpless with a pot placed before him with a mass of maggots oozing from his arms and legs and moaning compassion should be felt for him in this way This being has indeed been reduced to misery if only he could be freed from this suffering 
But if he does not encounter such a person then he can arouse compassion for an evildoing person even though he is happy by comparing him to one about to be executed
How
 Suppose a robber has been caught with stolen goods and in accordance with the kings command to execute him the kings men bind him and lead him off to the place of execution giving him a hundred blows in sets of four
Then people give him things to chew and eat and also garlands and perfumes unguents and betel leaves
Although he goes along eating and enjoying these things as though he were happy and well off still no one fancies that he is really happy and well off On the contrary people feel compassion for him thinking This poor wretch is now about to die every step he takes brings him nearer to the presence of death
So too a bhikkhu whose meditation subject is compassion should arouse compassion for an evildoing person even if he is happy Though this poor wretch is now happy cheerful enjoying his wealth still for want of even one good deed done now in any one of the three doors of body speech and mind he can come to experience untold suffering in the states of loss
 Having aroused compassion for that person in that way he should next arouse compassion for a dear person next for a neutral person and next for a hostile person successively in the same way
 But if resentment towards the hostile person arises in the way already described he should make it subside in the way described under lovingkindness 
And here too when someone has done profitable deeds and the meditator sees or hears that he has been overtaken by one of the kinds of ruin beginning with ruin of health relatives property etc he deserves the meditators compassion and so he does too in any case even with no such ruin thus In reality he is unhappy because he is not exempt from the suffering of the round of becoming And in the way already described the meditator should break down the barriers between the four kinds of people that is to say himself the dear person the neutral person and the hostile person Then cultivating that sign developing it and repeatedly practicing it he should increase the absorption by the triple and quadruple jhāna in the way already stated under lovingkindness
But the order given in the Aṅguttara Commentary is that a hostile person should first be made the object of compassion and when the mind has been made malleable with respect to him next the unlucky person next the dear person and next oneself That does not agree with the text an unlucky unfortunate person Therefore he should begin the development break down the barriers and increase absorption only in the way stated here
 After that the versatility consisting in the unspecified pervasion in five ways the specified pervasion in seven ways and the directional pervasion in ten ways and the advantages described as He sleeps in comfort etc should be understood in the same way as given under lovingkindness
This is the detailed explanation of the development of compassion
One who begins the development of gladness should not start with the dear person and the rest
for a dear person is not the proximate cause of gladness merely in virtue of dearness how much less the neutral and the hostile person
One of the opposite sex and one who is dead are also not the field for it
However the very dear companion can be the proximate cause for itone who in the commentaries is called a boon companion
for he is constantly glad he laughs first and speaks afterwards So he should be the first to be pervaded with gladness
Or on seeing or hearing about a dear person being happy cheerful and glad gladness can be aroused thus This being is indeed glad How good how excellent
For this is what is referred to in the Vibhaṅga And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with gladness
Just as he would be glad on seeing a dear and beloved person so he pervades all beings with gladness 
But if his boon companion or the dear person was happy in the past but is now unlucky and unfortunate then gladness can still be aroused by remembering his past happiness and apprehending the glad aspect in this way In the past he had great wealth a great following and he was always glad Or gladness can be aroused by apprehending the future glad aspect in him in this way In the future he will again enjoy similar success and will go about in gold palanquins on the backs of elephants or on horseback and so on
Having thus aroused gladness with respect to a dear person he can then direct it successively towards a neutral one and after that towards a hostile one
But if resentment towards the hostile one arises in him in the way already described he should make it subside in the same way as described under loving kindness  He should break down the barriers by means of mental impartiality towards the four that is towards these three and himself And by cultivating that sign developing and repeatedly practicing it he should increase the absorption to triple and quadruple jhāna in the way already stated under lovingkindness
Next the versatility consisting in unspecified pervasion in five ways specified pervasion in seven ways and directional pervasion in ten ways and also the advantages described as He sleeps in comfort etc should be understood in the same way as stated under lovingkindness
This is the detailed explanation of the development of gladness
 One who wants to develop equanimity must have already obtained the triple or quadruple jhāna in lovingkindness and so on He should emerge from the third jhāna in the fourfold reckoning after he has made it familiar and he should see danger in the former three divine abidings because they are linked with attention given to beings enjoyment in the way beginning May they be happy because resentment and approval are near and because their association with joy is gross And he should also see the advantage in equanimity because it is peaceful Then he should arouse equanimity by looking on with equanimity at a person who is normally neutral
 after that at a dear person and the rest
For this is said And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with equanimity
Just as he would feel equanimity on seeing a person who was neither beloved nor unloved so he pervades all beings with equanimity 
Therefore he should arouse equanimity towards the neutral person in the way already stated Then through the neutral one he should break down the barriers in each case between the three people that is the dear person then the boon companion and then the hostile one and lastly himself And he should cultivate that sign develop and repeatedly practice it
As he does so the fourth jhāna arises in him in the way described under the earth kasiṇa
But how then Does this arise in one in whom the third jhāna has already arisen on the basis of the earth kasiṇa etc
It does not
Why not
Because of the dissimilarity of the object
It arises only in one in whom the third jhāna has arisen on the basis of lovingkindness etc because the object is similar
But after that the versatility and the obtaining of advantages should be understood in the same way as described under lovingkindness
This is the detailed explanation of the development of equanimity
 Now having thus known these divine abidings Told by the Divine One supremely wise
There is this general explanation too Concerning them that he should recognize
Meanings Now as to the meaning firstly of lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity it fattens  thus it is lovingkindness  it is solvent is the meaning
Also it comes about with respect to a friend  or it is behaviour towards a friend thus it is lovingkindness 
When there is suffering in others it causes good peoples hearts to be moved  thus it is compassion 
Or alternatively it combats others suffering attacks and demolishes it thus it is compassion
Or alternatively it is scattered upon those who suffer it is extended to them by pervasion thus it is compassion 
Those endowed with it are glad  or itself is glad  or it is the mere act of being glad  thus it is gladness 
It looks on at  abandoning such interestedness as thinking May they be free from enmity and having recourse to neutrality thus it is equanimity 
Characteristic Etc As to the characteristic etc lovingkindness is characterized here as promoting the aspect of welfare Its function is to prefer welfare It is manifested as the removal of annoyance Its proximate cause is seeing loveableness in beings
It succeeds when it makes ill will subside and it fails when it produces affection
Compassion is characterized as promoting the aspect of allaying suffering Its function resides in not bearing others suffering It is manifested as non cruelty Its proximate cause is to see helplessness in those overwhelmed by suffering
It succeeds when it makes cruelty subside and it fails when it produces sorrow
 Gladness is characterized as gladdening  Its function resides in being unenvious It is manifested as the elimination of aversion  Its proximate cause is seeing beings success
It succeeds when it makes aversion subside and it fails when it produces merriment
Equanimity is characterized as promoting the aspect of neutrality towards beings Its function is to see equality in beings It is manifested as the quieting of resentment and approval Its proximate cause is seeing ownership of deeds thus Beings are owners of their deeds Whose if not theirs is the choice by which they will become happy or will get free from suffering or will not fall away from the success they have reached
 It succeeds when it makes resentment and approval subside and it fails when it produces the equanimity of unknowing which is that worldlyminded indifference of ignorance based on the house life
Purpose The general purpose of these four divine abidings is the bliss of insight and an excellent form of future existence
That peculiar to each is respectively the warding off of ill will and so on
For here lovingkindness has the purpose of warding off ill will
while the others have the respective purposes of warding off cruelty aversion  and greed or resentment
And this is said too
For this is the escape from ill will friends that is to say the minddeliverance of lovingkindness 
For this is the escape from cruelty friends that is to say the minddeliverance of compassion 
For this is the escape from boredom friends that is to say the minddeliverance of gladness 
For this is the escape from greed friends that is to say the minddeliverance of equanimity 
The Near and Far Enemies And here each one has two enemies one near and one far
The divine abiding of lovingkindness has greed as its near enemy since both share in seeing virtues Greed behaves like a foe who keeps close by a man and it easily finds an opportunity So lovingkindness should be well protected from it
And ill will which is dissimilar to the similar greed is its far enemy like a foe ensconced in a rock wilderness So lovingkindness must be practiced free from fear of that
for it is not possible to practice lovingkindness and feel anger simultaneously 
Compassion has grief based on the home life as its near enemy since both share in seeing failure Such grief has been described in the way beginning When a man either regards as a privation failure to obtain visible objects cognizable by the eye that are sought after desired agreeable gratifying and associated with worldliness or when he recalls those formerly obtained that are past ceased and changed then grief arises in him Such grief as this is called grief based on the home life 
And cruelty which is dissimilar to the similar grief is its far enemy
So compassion must be practiced free from fear of that
for it is not possible to practice compassion and be cruel to breathing things simultaneously
 Gladness has joy based on the home life as its near enemy since both share in seeing success Such joy has been described in the way beginning When a man either regards as gain the obtaining of visible objects cognizable by the eye that are sought  and associated with worldliness or recalls those formerly obtained that are past ceased and changed then joy arises in him Such joy as this is called joy based on the home life 
And aversion  which is dissimilar to the similar joy is its far enemy
So gladness should be practiced free from fear of that for it is not possible to practice gladness and be discontented with remote abodes and things connected with the higher profitableness simultaneously
 Such unknowing has been described in the way beginning On seeing a visible object with the eye equanimity arises in the foolish infatuated ordinary man in the untaught ordinary man who has not conquered his limitations who has not conquered future kamma result who is unperceiving of danger Such equanimity as this does not surmount the visible object
Such equanimity as this is called equanimity based on the home life  Equanimity has the equanimity of unknowing based on the home life as its near enemy since both share in ignoring faults and virtues
And greed and resentment which are dissimilar to the similar unknowing are its far enemies
Therefore equanimity must be practiced free from fear of that
for it is not possible to look on with equanimity and be inflamed with greed or be resentful simultaneously
The Beginning Middle and End Etc Now zeal consisting in desire to act is the beginning of all these things Suppression of the hindrances etc is the middle Absorption is the end
Their object is a single living being or many living beings as a mental object consisting in a concept
The Order in Extension The extension of the object takes place either in access or in absorption
Here is the order of it Just as a skilled ploughman first delimits an area and then does his ploughing so first a single dwelling should be delimited and loving kindness developed towards all beings there in the way beginning In this dwelling may all beings be free from enmity
When his mind has become malleable and wieldy with respect to that he can then delimit two dwellings
Next he can successively delimit three four five six seven eight nine ten one street half the village the whole village the district the kingdom one direction and so on up to one worldsphere or even beyond that and develop loving kindness towards the beings in such areas
Likewise with compassion and so on This is the order in extending here
The Outcome Just as the immaterial states are the outcome of the kasiṇas and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is the outcome of concentration and fruition attainment is the outcome of insight and the attainment of cessation is the outcome of serenity coupled with insight so the divine abiding of equanimity is the outcome of the first three divine abidings
For just as the gable rafters cannot be placed in the air without having first set up the scaffolding and built the framework of beams so it is not possible to develop the fourth without having already developed the third jhāna in the earlier 
Four Questions And here it may be asked But why are lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity called divine abidings
And why are they only four
And what is their order And why are they called measureless states in the Abhidhamma
It may be replied The divineness of the abiding should be understood here in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate
For these abidings are the best in being the right attitude towards beings
And just as Brahmā gods abide with immaculate minds so the meditators who associate themselves with these abidings abide on an equal footing with Brahmā gods So they are called divine abidings in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate
 Here are the answers to the questions beginning with Why are they only four 
Their number four is due to paths to purity And other sets of four
As welfare and the rest
their order to their aim Immeasurable
Their scope is found to be so measureless states their name
 For among these lovingkindness is the way to purity for one who has much ill will compassion is that for one who has much cruelty gladness is that for one who has much aversion  and equanimity is that for one who has much greed
Also attention given to beings is only fourfold that is to say as bringing welfare as removing suffering as being glad at their success and as unconcern that is to say impartial neutrality
And one abiding in the measureless states should practice lovingkindness and the rest like a mother with four sons namely a child an invalid one in the flush of youth and one busy with his own affairs for she wants the child to grow up wants the invalid to get well wants the one in the flush of youth to enjoy for long the benefits of youth and is not at all bothered about the one who is busy with his own affairs
That is why the measureless states are only four as due to paths to purity and other sets of four
 One who wants to develop these four should practice them towards beings first as the promotion of the aspect of welfareand lovingkindness has the promotion of the aspect of welfare as its characteristic
and next on seeing or hearing or judging that beings whose welfare has been thus wished for are at the mercy of suffering they should be practiced as the promotion of the aspect of the removal of sufferingand compassion has the promotion of the aspect of the removal of suffering as its characteristic
and then on seeing the success of those whose welfare has been wished for and the removal of whose suffering has been wished for they should be practiced as being gladand gladness has the act of gladdening as its characteristic
but after that there is nothing to be done and so they should be practiced as the neutral aspect in other words the state of an onlookerand equanimity has the promotion of the aspect of neutrality as its characteristic
therefore since their respective aims are the aspect of welfare etc their order should be understood to correspond with loving kindness stated first then compassion gladness and equanimity
All of them however occur with a measureless scope
 for their scope is measureless beings
and instead of assuming a measure such as Loving kindness etc should be developed only towards a single being or in an area of such an extent they occur with universal pervasion
That is why it was said
Their number four is due to paths to purity And other sets of four
 As welfare and the rest
their order to their aim Immeasurable
Their scope is found to be so measureless states their name
As Producing Three Jhānas and Four Jhānas Though they have a single characteristic in having a measureless scope yet the first three are only of triple and quadruple jhāna respectively in the fourfold and fivefold reckonings
Why
Because they are not dissociated from joy
But why are their aims not dissociated from joy
Because they are the escape from ill will etc which are originated by grief
But the last one belongs only to the remaining single jhāna
Why
Because it is associated with equanimous feeling
For the divine abiding of equanimity that occurs in the aspect of neutrality towards beings does not exist apart from equanimous that is to say neither painfulnorpleasant feeling
 However someone might say this It has been said by the Blessed One in the Book of Eights speaking of the measureless states in general Next bhikkhu you should develop the concentration with applied thought and sustained thought and you should develop it without applied thought and with sustained thought only and you should develop it without applied thought and without sustained thought and you should develop it with happiness and you should develop it without happiness and you should develop it accompanied by gratification and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity  Consequently all four measureless states have quadruple and quintuple jhāna
 He should be told Do not put it like that
For if that were so then contemplation of the body etc would also have quadruple and quintuple jhāna But there is not even the first jhāna in the contemplation of feeling or in the other two
So do not misrepresent the Blessed One by adherence to the letter The Enlightened Ones word is profound and should be taken as it is intended giving due weight to the teachers
 And the intention here is this The Blessed One it seems was asked to teach the Dhamma thus Venerable sir it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that having heard the Blessed Ones Dhamma I may dwell alone withdrawn diligent ardent and selfexerted  But the Blessed One had no confidence yet in that bhikkhu since although he had already heard the Dhamma he had nevertheless gone on living there instead of going to do the ascetics duties and the Blessed One expressed his lack of confidence thus So too some misguided men merely question me and when the Dhamma is expounded to them they still fancy that they need not follow me  However the bhikkhu had the potentiality for the attainment of Arahantship and so he advised him again saying Therefore bhikkhu you should train thus My mind shall be steadied quite steadied internally and arisen evil unprofitable things shall not obsess my mind and remain
You should train thus 
But what is stated in that advice is basic concentration consisting in mere unification of mind internally in the sense of in oneself 
 After that he told him about its development by means of lovingkindness in order to show that he should not rest content with just that much but should intensify his basic concentration in this way As soon as your mind has become steadied quite steadied internally bhikkhu and arisen evil unprofitable things do not obsess your mind and remain
then you should train thus The mind deliverance of lovingkindness will be developed by me frequently practiced made the vehicle made the foundation established consolidated and properly undertaken
You should train thus bhikkhu  after which he said further As soon as this concentration has been thus developed by you bhikkhu and frequently practiced then you should develop this concentration with applied thought and sustained thought  and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity 
 The meaning is this Bhikkhu when this basic concentration has been developed by you by means of lovingkindness then instead of resting content with just that much you should make this basic concentration reach quadruple and quintuple jhāna in other objects by further developing it in the way beginning With applied thought 
 And having spoken thus pointing out that you should effect its further development by means of quadruple and quintuple jhāna in other objects this further development being preceded by the remaining divine abidings of compassion and the rest he further said As soon as this concentration has been thus developed by you bhikkhu and frequently practiced
then you should train thus The minddeliverance of compassion will be developed by me   etc
 Having thus shown how its further development by means of quadruple and quintuple jhāna is preceded by lovingkindness etc and having told him As soon as this concentration has been developed by you bhikkhu and frequently practiced then you should train thus I shall dwell contemplating the body as a body etc he concluded the discourse with Arahantship as its culmination thus As soon as this concentration has been developed by you bhikkhu completely developed then wherever you go you will go in comfort wherever you stand you will stand in comfort wherever you sit you will sit in comfort wherever you make your couch you will do so in comfort 
From that it must be understood that the three beginning with lovingkindness have only triplequadruple jhāna and that equanimity has only the single remaining jhāna
And they are expounded in the same way in the Abhidhamma as well
The Highest Limit of Each And while they are twofold by way of the triplequadruple jhāna and the single remaining jhāna still they should be understood to be distinguishable in each case
by a different efficacy consisting in having beauty as the highest etc For they are so described in the Haliddavasana Sutta
according as it is said Bhikkhus the minddeliverance of lovingkindness has beauty as the highest I say 
The minddeliverance of compassion has the base consisting of boundless space as the highest I say 
The minddeliverance of gladness has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as the highest I say 
The mind deliverance of equanimity has the base consisting of nothingness as the highest I say 
 But why are they described in this way
Because each is the respective basic support for each
For beings are unrepulsive to one who abides in loving kindness
Being familiar with the unrepulsive aspect when he applies his mind to unrepulsive pure colours such as blueblack his mind enters into them without difficulty
So lovingkindness is the basic support for the liberation by the beautiful  but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having beauty as the highest
 One who abides in compassion has come to know thoroughly the danger in materiality since compassion is aroused in him when he sees the suffering of beings that has as its material sign beating with sticks and so on
So well knowing the danger in materiality when he removes whichever kasiṇa concept he was contemplating whether that of the earth kasiṇa or another and applies his mind to the space that remains  which is the escape from materiality then his mind enters into that space without difficulty
So compassion is the basic support for the sphere of boundless space but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having the base consisting of boundless space as the highest
 When he abides in gladness his mind becomes familiar with apprehending consciousness since gladness is aroused in him when he sees beings consciousness arisen in the form of rejoicing over some reason for joy
Then when he surmounts the sphere of boundless space that he had already attained in due course and applies his mind to the consciousness that had as its object the sign of space his mind enters into it without difficulty So gladness is the basic support for the base consisting of boundless consciousness but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having the sphere of boundless consciousness as the highest
 When he abides in equanimity his mind becomes skilled in appre hending what is nonexistent because his mind has been diverted from apprehension of the ultimate sense namely pleasure pain etc owing to having no further concern such as May beings be happy or May they be released from pain or May they not lose the success they have obtained
Now his mind has become used to being diverted from apprehension of what is existent in the ultimate sense and his mind has become skilled in apprehending what is nonexistent in the ultimate sense  and so when he surmounts the base consisting of boundless consciousness attained in due course and applies his mind to the absence which is nonexistent as to individual essence of consciousness which is a reality in the ultimate sense then his mind enters into that without difficulty 
So equanimity is the basic support for the base consisting of nothingness but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having the base consisting of nothingness as the highest
 When he has understood thus that the special efficacy of each resides respectively in having beauty as the highest etc he should besides understand how they bring to perfection all the good states beginning with giving
For the Great Beings minds retain their balance by giving preference to beings welfare by dislike of beings suffering by desire for the various successes achieved by beings to last and by impartiality towards all beings And to all beings they give gifts which are a source a pleasure without discriminating thus It must be given to this one it must not be given to this one
 And in order to avoid doing harm to beings they undertake the precepts of virtue
They practice renunciation for the purpose of perfecting their virtue
They cleanse their understanding for the purpose of nonconfusion about what is good and bad for beings
They constantly arouse energy having beings welfare and happiness at heart
When they have acquired heroic fortitude through supreme energy they become patient with beings many kinds of faults
They do not deceive when promising We shall give you this we shall do this for you
They are unshakably resolute upon beings welfare and happiness
Through unshakable lovingkindness they place them first before themselves
Through equanimity they expect no reward Having thus fulfilled the ten perfections these divine abidings then perfect all the good states classed as the ten powers the four kinds of fearlessness the six kinds of knowledge not shared by disciples and the eighteen states of the Enlightened One This is how they bring to perfection all the good states beginning with giving
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the Treatise on the Development of Concentration
called The Description of the Divine Abidings
The ninth chapter
 Now as to the four immaterial states mentioned next to the divine abidings  one who wants firstly to develop the base consisting of boundless space sees in gross physical matter danger through the wielding of sticks etc because of the words It is in virtue of matter that wielding of sticks wielding of knives quarrels brawls and disputes takes place but that does not exist at all in the immaterial state
and in this expectation he enters upon the way to dispassion for only material things for the fading and cessation of only those  and he sees danger in it too through the thousand afflictions beginning with eye disease So in order to surmount that he enters upon the fourth jhāna in any one of the nine kasiṇas beginning with the earth kasiṇa and omitting the limitedspace kasiṇa
Now although he has already surmounted gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the finematerial sphere nevertheless he still wants also to surmount the kasiṇa materiality since it is the counterpart of the former
How does he do this
Suppose a timid man is pursued by a snake in a forest and flees from it as fast as he can then if he sees in the place he has fled to a palm leaf with a streak painted on it or a creeper or a rope or a crack in the ground he is fearful anxious and will not even look at it
Suppose again a man is living in the same village as a hostile man who illuses him and on being threatened by him with a flogging and the burning down of his house he goes away to live in another village then if he meets another man there of similar appearance voice and manner he is fearful anxious and will not even look at him
Here is the application of the similes The time when the bhikkhu has the gross physical matter as his object is like the time when the men were respectively threatened by the snake and by the enemy
The time when the bhikkhu surmounts the gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the fine material sphere is like the first mans fleeing as fast as he can and the other mans going away to another village
The bhikkhus observing that even the matter of the kasiṇa is the counterpart of that gross physical matter and his wanting to surmount that also is like the first mans seeing in the place he had fled to the palm leaf with a streak painted on it etc and the other mans seeing the man who resembled the enemy in the village he had left and their unwillingness to look owing to fear and anxiety
And here the similes of the dog attacked by a boar and that of the pisāca goblin and the timid man should be understood too
 So when he has thus become disgusted with the kasiṇa materiality the object of the fourth jhāna and wants to get away from it he achieves mastery in the five ways Then on emerging from the now familiar fourth jhāna of the finematerial sphere he sees the danger in that jhāna in this way This makes its object the materiality with which I have become disgusted and It has joy as its near enemy and It is grosser than the peaceful liberations
There is however no comparative grossness of factors here as in the case of the four finematerial jhānas
for the immaterial states have the same two factors as this finematerial jhāna
 When he has seen the danger in that finematerial fourth jhāna jhāna in this way and has ended his attachment to it he gives his attention to the base consisting of boundless space as peaceful Then when he has spread out the kasiṇa to the limit of the worldsphere or as far as he likes he removes the kasiṇa materiality by giving his attention to the space touched by it regarding that as space or boundless space 
When he is removing it he neither folds it up like a mat nor withdraws it like a cake from a tin It is simply that he does not advert to it or give attention to it or review it it is when he neither adverts to it nor gives attention to it nor reviews it but gives his attention exclusively to the space touched by it regarding that as space space that he is said to remove the kasiṇa 
And when the kasiṇa is being removed it does not roll up or roll away It is simply that it is called removed on account of his nonattention to it his attention being given to space space  This is conceptualized as the mere space left by the removal of the kasiṇa materiality
Whether it is called space left by the removal of the kasiṇa or space touched by the kasiṇa or space secluded from the kasiṇa it is all the same
He adverts again and again to the sign of the space left by the removal of the kasiṇa as space space and strikes at it with thought and applied thought
As he adverts to it again and again and strikes at it with thought and applied thought the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in access
He cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices it
 As he again and again adverts to it and gives attention to it in this way consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space arises in absorption with the space as its object as the consciousness belonging to the finematerial sphere did in the case of the earth kasiṇa and so on
And here too in the prior stage there are either three or four sensualsphere impulsions associated with equanimous feeling
while the fourth or the fifth is of the immaterial sphere
The rest is the same as in the case of the earth kasiṇa 
There is however this difference When the immaterialsphere conscious ness has arisen in this way the bhikkhu who has been formerly looking at the kasiṇa disk with the jhāna eye finds himself looking at only space after that sign has been abruptly removed by the attention given in the preliminary work thus space space  He is like a man who has plugged an opening in a covered vehicle a sack or a pot with a piece of blue rag or with a piece of rag of some such colour as yellow red or white and is looking at that and then when the rag is removed by the force of the wind or by some other agency he finds himself looking at space
And at this point it is said With the complete surmounting of perceptions of matter with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance with nonattention to perceptions of variety aware of unbounded space he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space 
 Herein complete is in all aspects or of all perceptions without exception is the meaning
Of perceptions of matter both of the finematerial jhānas mentioned here under the heading of perception and of those things that are their object
For the jhāna of the finematerial sphere is called matter in such passages as Possessed of visible matter he sees instances of matter  and it is its object too that is called matter in such passages as He sees instances of visible matter externally  fair and ugly  Consequently here the words perception of matter  in the sense of perceptions about matter are used for finematerial jhāna stated thus under the headings of perceptions
Also it has the label matter  thus it is labelled matter 
what is meant is that matter is its name
So it should be understood that this is also a term for what is classed as the earth kasiṇa etc which is the object of that jhāna
With the surmounting with the fading away and with the cessation
What is meant
With the fading away and with the cessation both because of the fading away and because of the cessation either in all aspects or without exception of these perceptions of matter reckoned as jhāna which number fifteen with the five each of the profitable resultant and functional and also of these things labelled matter reckoned as objects of those perceptions which number nine with the earth kasiṇa etc he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space
For he cannot enter upon and dwell in that without completely surmounting perceptions of matter
Herein there is no surmounting of these perceptions in one whose greed for the object of those perceptions has not faded away and when the perceptions have been surmounted their objects have been surmounted as well
That is why in the Vibhaṅga only the surmounting of the perceptions and not that of the objects is mentioned as follows Herein what are perceptions of matter
They are the perception perceiving perceivedness in one who has attained a fine materialsphere attainment or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this present life These are what are called perceptions of matter
These perceptions of matter are passed surpassed surmounted
Hence With the complete surmounting of perceptions of matter is said 
Because these attainments have to be reached by surmounting the object they are not to be reached by retaining the same object as in the first and subsequent jhānas
Threrefore But this commentary should be understood to deal also with the surmounting of the object
 With the disappearance of perceptions of resistance perceptions of resistance are perceptions arisen through the impact of the physical base consisting of the eye etc and the respective objects consisting of visible objects etc
and this is a term for perception of visible objects and so on
according as it is said Here what are perceptions of resistance
Perceptions of visible objects perceptions of sounds perceptions of odours perceptions of flavours perceptions of tangible objectsthese are called perceptions of resistance 
with the complete disappearance the abandoning the nonarising of these ten kinds of perceptions of resistance that is to say of the five profitableresultant and five unprofitableresultant causing their nonoccurrence is what is meant
Of course these are not to be found in one who has entered upon the first jhāna etc either
for consciousness at that time does not occur by way of the five doors
Still the mention of them here should be understood as a recommendation of this jhāna for the purpose of arousing interest in it just as in the case of the fourth jhāna there is mention of the pleasure and pain already abandoned elsewhere and in the case of the third path there is mention of the false view of personality etc already abandoned earlier
 Or alternatively though these are also not to be found in one who has attained the finematerial sphere still their not being there is not due to their having been abandoned
for development of the finematerial sphere does not lead to fading of greed for materiality and the occurrence of those finematerial jhānas is actually dependent on materiality
But this development of the immaterial does lead to the fading of greed for materiality
Therefore it is allowable to say that they are actually abandoned here
and not only to say it but to maintain it absolutely
In fact it is because they have not been abandoned already before this that it was said by the Blessed One that sound is a thorn to one who has the first jhāna 
And it is precisely because they are abandoned here that the imperturbability of the immaterial attainments and their state of peaceful liberation are mentioned 
and that ḷāra Kālāma neither saw the five hundred carts that passed close by him nor heard the sound of them while he was in an immaterial attainment 
With nonattention to perceptions of variety either to perceptions occurring with variety as their domain or to perceptions themselves various
For perceptions of variety are so called for two reasons
firstly because the kinds of perception included along with the mind element and mindconsciousness element in one who has not attainedwhich kinds are intended here as described in the Vibhaṅga thus Herein what are perceptions of variety The perception perceiving perceivedness in one who has not attained and possesses either mind element or mind consciousness element in one who has not attained and possesses either mind element or mindconsciousness element these are called perceptions of variety occur with respect to a domain that is varied in individual essence with the variety classed as visibleobject sound etc and secondly because the fortyfour kinds of perceptionthat is to say eight kinds of sensesphere profitable perception twelve kinds of unprofitable perception eleven kinds of sensesphere profitable resultant perception two kinds of unprofitableresultant perception and eleven kinds of sensesphere functional perceptionthemselves have variety have various individual essences and are dissimilar from each other
With the complete nonattention to nonadverting to nonreaction to nonreviewing of these perceptions of variety
what is meant is that because he does not advert to them give them attention or review them therefore 
And two things should be understood firstly that because the earlier perceptions of matter and perceptions of resistance do not exist even in the kind of existence produced by this jhāna on rebirth
let alone when this jhāna is entered upon and dwelt in that existence their absence is stated here in two ways as surmounting and disappearance
and secondly in the case of perceptions of variety nonattention to them is said because twentyseven kinds of perceptionthat is to say eight kinds of sensesphere profitable perception nine kinds of functional perception and ten kinds of unprofitable perceptionstill exist in the kind of existence produced by this jhāna
For when he enters upon and dwells in this jhāna there too he does so by nonattention to them also but he has not attained when he does give attention to them
And here briefly it should be understood that the abandoning of all fine materialsphere states is signified by the words with the surmounting of perceptions of matter
and the abandoning of and nonattention to all sensesphere consciousness and its concomitants is signified by the words with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance with nonattention to perceptions of variety
Unbounded space here it is called unbounded because neither its end as its arising nor its end as its fall are made known
It is the space left by the removal of the kasiṇa that is called space
And here unboundedness should be understood as referring to the attention also
which is why it is said in the Vibhaṅga He places settles his consciousness in that space he pervades unboundedly  hence unbounded space is said 
 He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space it has no bound  and thus it is unbounded  What is spatially unbounded is unbounded space  Unbounded space is the same as boundless space  That boundless space is a base in the sense of habitat for the jhāna whose nature it is to be associated with it as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless space 
He enters and dwells in having reached that base consisting of boundless space having caused it to be produced he dwells with an abiding consisting in postures that are in conformity with it
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of boundless space as a meditation subject
When he wants to develop the base consisting of boundless consciousness he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment of the base consisting of boundless space Then he should see the danger in the base consisting of boundless space in this way This attainment has finematerial jhāna as its near enemy and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of boundless consciousness  So having ended his attachment to that he should give his attention to the base consisting of boundless consciousness as peaceful adverting again and again as consciousness consciousness to the consciousness that occurred pervading that space as its object He should give it attention review it and strike at it with applied and sustained thought
but he should not give attention simply in this way boundless boundless 
 As he directs his mind again and again on to that sign in this way the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in access
He cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices it
As he does so consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness arises in absorption with the past consciousness that pervaded the space as its object just as that belonging to the base consisting of boundless space did with the space as its object
But the method of explaining the process of absorption should be understood in the way already described
 And at this point it is said By completely surmounting the base consisting of boundless space aware of unbounded consciousness he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless consciousness 
 Herein completely is as already explained
By  surmounting the base consisting of boundless space the jhāna is called the base consisting of boundless space in the way already stated  and its object is so called too
For the object too is boundless space in the way already stated  and then because it is the object of the first immaterial jhāna it is its base in the sense of habitat as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless space
Likewise it is boundless space and then because it is the cause of the jhānas being of that species it is its base in the sense of locality of the species as Kambojā is the base of horses thus it is the base consisting of boundless space in this way also
So it should be understood that the words By  surmounting the base consisting of boundless space include both the jhāna and its object together since this base consisting of boundless consciousness is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting by causing the nonoccurrence of and by not giving attention to both the jhāna and its object
Unbounded consciousness What is meant is that he gives his attention thus unbounded consciousness to that same consciousness that occurred in pervading as its object the space as unbounded space
Or unbounded refers to the attention
For when he gives attention without reserve to the consciousness that had the space as its object then the attention he gives to it is unbounded 
 For it is said in the Vibhaṅga Unbounded consciousness he gives attention to that same space pervaded by consciousness he pervades boundlessly hence unbounded consciousness is said 
But in that passage the instrumental case by consciousness must be understood in the sense of accusative
 for the teachers of the commentary explain its meaning in that way What is meant by He pervades boundlessly is that he gives attention to that same consciousness which had pervaded that space 
 He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless consciousness it has no bound  thus it is unbounded 
What is unbounded is boundless 
and unbounded consciousness is called boundless consciousness that is viññāṇañcaṃ in the contracted form instead of viññāṇānañcaṃ which is the full number of syllables
This is an idiomatic form
That boundless consciousness is the base in the sense of foundation for the jhāna whose nature it is to be associated with it as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless consciousness 
The rest is the same as before
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of boundless consciousness as a meditation subject
When he wants to develop the base consisting of nothingness he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment in the base consisting of boundless consciousness Then he should see the danger in the base consisting of boundless consciousness in this way This attainment has the base consisting of boundless space as its near enemy and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of nothingness  So having ended his attachment to that he should give his attention to the base consisting of nothingness as peaceful He should give attention to the present nonexistence voidness secluded aspect of that same past consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space which became the object of the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness
How does he do this
 Without giving further attention to that consciousness he should now advert again and again in this way there is not there is not or void void or secluded secluded and give his attention to it review it and strike at it with thought and applied thought
As he directs his mind on to that sign thus the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in access
He cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices it
As he does so consciousness belonging to the base consisting of nothingness arises in absorption making its object the void secluded nonexistent state of that same past exalted consciousness that occurred in pervading the space just as the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness did the then past exalted consciousness that had pervaded the space
And here too the method of explaining the absorption should be understood in the way already described
But there is this difference Suppose a man sees a community of bhikkhus gathered together in a meeting hall or some such place and then goes elsewhere then after the bhikkhus have risen at the conclusion of the business for which they had met and have departed the man comes back and as he stands in the doorway looking at that place again he sees it only as void he sees it only as secluded
he does not think So many bhikkhus have died so many have left the district but rather he sees only the nonexistence thus This is void secludedso too having formerly dwelt seeing with the jhāna eye belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness the earlier consciousness that had occurred making the space its object now when that consciousness has disappeared owing to his giving attention to the preliminary work in the way beginning There is not there is not he dwells seeing only its non existence in other words its departedness when this consciousness has arisen in absorption
 And at this point it is said By completely surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness aware that There is nothing he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of nothingness 
 Herein completely is as already explained
By  surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness here too the jhāna is called the base consisting of boundless consciousness in the way already stated and its object is socalled too
For the object too is boundless consciousness in the way already stated and then because it is the object of the second immaterial jhāna it is its base in the sense of habitat as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless consciousness
Likewise it is boundless consciousness and then because it is the cause of the jhānas being of that species it is its base in the sense of locality of the species as Kambojā is the base of horses thus it is the base consisting of boundless consciousness in this way also
So it should be understood that the words By  surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness include both the jhāna and its object together since this base consisting of nothingness is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting by causing the non occurrence of by not giving attention to both jhāna and its object
 There is nothing  what is meant is that he gives his attention thus there is not there is not or void void or secluded secluded
It is said in the Vibhaṅga There is nothing he makes that same consciousness nonexistent makes it absent makes it disappear sees that there is nothing hence there is nothing is said  which is expressed in a way that resembles comprehension by insight of liability to destruction nevertheless the meaning should be understood in the way described above
For the words He makes that same consciousness nonexistent makes it absent makes it disappear are said of one who does not advert to it or gives attention to it or review it and only gives attention to its nonexistence its voidness its secludedness they are not meant in the other way 
He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of nothingness it has no owning  this it is nonowning  what is meant is that it has not even the mere act of its dissolution remaining
The state of nonowning is nothingness  This is a term for the disappearance of the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space
That nothingness is the base in the sense of foundation for that jhāna as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of nothingness
The rest is as before
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of nothingness as a meditation subject
 When however he wants to develop the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness Then he should see the danger in the base consisting of nothingness and the advantage in what is superior to it in this way This attainment has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as its near enemy and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception or in this way Perception is a boil perception is a dart  this is peaceful this is sublime that is to say neither perception nor nonperception  So having ended his attachment to the base consisting of nothingness he should give attention to the base consisting of neither perception non nonperception as peaceful He should advert again and again to that attainment of the base consisting of nothingness that has occurred making nonexistence its object adverting to it as peaceful peaceful and he should give his attention to it review it and strike at it with thought and applied thought
 As he directs his mind again and again on to that sign in this way the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in access
He cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices it
As he does so consciousness belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception arises in absorption making its object the four mental aggregates that constitute the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness just as the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of nothingness did the disappearance of the previous consciousness
And here too the method of explaining the absorption should be understood in the way already described
And at this point it is said By completely surmounting the base consisting of nothingness he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception 
 Herein completely is already explained
By  surmounting the base consisting of nothingness here too the jhāna is called the base consisting of nothingness in the way already stated and its object is so called too
For the object too is nothingness in the way already stated and then because it is the object of the third immaterial jhāna it is its base in the sense of habitat as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of nothingness
Likewise it is nothingness and then because it is the cause of the jhānas being of that species it is its base in the sense of locality of the species as Kambojā is the base of horses thus it is the base consisting of nothingness in this way also
So it should be understood that the words By  surmounting the base consisting of nothingness include both the jhāna and its object together since the base consisting of neither perception nor non perception is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting by causing the nonoccurrence of by not giving attention to both the jhāna and its object
Base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception then there is he who so practices that there is in him the perception on account of the presence of which this attainment is called the the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception
and in the Vibhaṅga in order to point out that person firstly one specified as neither percipient nor nonpercipient it is said gives attention to that same base consisting of nothingness as peaceful he develops the attainment with residual formations hence neither percipient nor non percipient is said 
 Herein he gives attention  as peaceful means that he gives attention to it as peaceful because of the peacefulness of the object thus How peaceful this attainment is for it can make even nonexistence its object and still subsist
If he brings it to mind as peaceful then how does there come to be surmounting
Because there is no actual desire to attain it
For although he gives attention to it as peaceful yet there is no concern in him or reaction or attention such as I shall advert to this or I shall attain this or I shall resolve upon the duration of this
Why not
Because the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is more peaceful and better than the base consisting of nothingness
Suppose a king is proceeding along a city street with the great pomp of royalty splendidly mounted on the back of an elephant and he sees craftsmen wearing one cloth tightly as a loincloth and another tied round their heads working at the various crafts such as ivory carving etc their limbs covered with ivory dust etc now while he is pleased with their skill thinking How skilled these craftmasters are and what crafts they practice he does not however think Oh that I might abandon royalty and become a craftsman like that
Why not
Because of the great benefits in the majesty of kings
he leaves the craftsmen behind and proceeds on his way
So too though this meditator gives attention to that attainment as peaceful yet there is no concern in him or reaction or attention such as I shall advert to this attainment or I shall attain this or I shall resolve upon the duration of it or I shall emerge from it or I shall review it 
As he gives attention to it as peaceful in the way already described he reaches the ultrasubtle absorbed perception in virtue of which he is called neither percipient nor nonpercipient and it is said of him that He develops the attainment with residual formations 
The attainment with residual formations is the fourth immaterial attainment whose formations have reached a state of extreme subtlety
Now in order to show the meaning of the kind of perception that has been reached on account of which this jhāna is called the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception it is said Base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception states of consciousness or its concomitants in one who has attained the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this present life 
Of these what is intended here is the states of consciousness and its concomitants in one who has attained
The word meaning here is this that jhāna with its associated states neither has perception nor has no perception because of the absence of gross perception and the presence of subtle perception thus it is neither perception nor non perception 
It is neither perception nor nonperception and it is a base because it is included in the mindbase and the mentalobject base  thus it is the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception 
 Or alternatively the perception here is neither perception since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception nor yet non perception since it is present in a subtle state as a residual formation thus it is neither perception nor nonperception
It is neither perception nor non perception and it is a base in the sense of a foundation for the other states thus it is the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception 
And here it is not only perception that is like this but feeling as well is neitherfeelingnornonfeeling consciousness is neitherconsciousnessnor nonconsciousness and contact is neithercontactnornoncontact
and the same description applies to the rest of the associated states
but it should be understood that this presentation is given in terms of perception
And the meaning should be illustrated by the similes beginning with the smearing of oil on the bowl
A novice smeared a bowl with oil it seems and laid it aside When it was time to drink gruel an elder told him to bring the bowl
He said Venerable sir there is oil in the bowl
But then when he was told Bring the oil novice I shall fill the oil tube he replied There is no oil venerable sir
Herein just as There is oil is in the sense of incompatibility with the gruel because it has been poured into the bowl
and just as There is no oil is in the sense of filling the oil tube etc
so too this perception is neither perception since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception and it is nor non perception because it is present in a subtle form as a residual formation
But in this context what is perceptions function
It is the perceiving of the object and it is the production of dispassion if that attainment and its object are made the objective field of insight
But it is not able to make the function of perceiving decisive as the heat element in tepid water is not able to make the function of burning decisive
and it is not able to produce dispassion by treatment of its objective field with insight in the way that perception is in the case of the other attainments
There is in fact no bhikkhu capable of reaching dispassion by comprehension of aggregates connected with the base consisting of neither perception nor non perception unless he has already done his interpreting with other aggregates  And furthermore when the venerable Sāriputta
or someone very wise and naturally gifted with insight as he was is able to do so
even he has to do it by means of comprehension of groups in this way So it seems these states not having been come to be having come to be they vanish  and not by means of actual direct insight into states one by one as they arise
Such is the subtlety that this attainment reaches
And this meaning should be illustrated by the simile of the water on the road as it was by the simile of the oilsmearing on the bowl
A novice was walking in front of an elder it seems who had set out on a journey He saw a little water and said There is water venerable sir remove your sandals
Then the elder said If there is water bring me the bathing cloth and let us bathe but the novice said There is none venerable sir
Herein just as There is water is in the sense of mere wetting of the sandals and There is none is in the sense of bathing
so too this perception is neither perception since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception and it is nor nonperception because it is present in a subtle form as a residual formation
 And this meaning should be illustrated not only by these similes but by other appropriate ones as well
Enters upon and dwells in is already explained
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception as a meditation subject
 Thus has the Peerless Helper told The fourfold immaterial state
To know these general matters too Will not be inappropriate
 For these immaterial states
While reckoned by the surmounting of The object they are four the wise
Do not admit surmounting of Factors that one can recognize
 Of these four the first is due to surmounting signs of materiality the second is due to surmounting space the third is due to surmounting the consciousness that occurred with that space as its object
and the fourth is due to surmounting the disappearance of the consciousness that occurred with that space as its object So they should be understood as four in number with the surmounting of the object in each case
But the wise do not admit any surmounting of jhāna factors
for there is no surmounting of factors in them as there is in the case of the finematerialsphere attainments
Each one has just the two factors namely equanimity and unification of mind
 That being so
They progress in refinement each Is finer than the one before
Two figures help to make them known The cloth lengths and each palace floor
Suppose there were a fourstoried palace on its first floor the five objects of sense pleasure were provided in a very fine form as divine dancing singing and music and perfumes scents garlands food couches clothing etc
and on the second they were finer than that
and on the third finer still
and on the fourth they were finest of all
yet they are still only palace floors and there is no difference between them in the matter of their state as palace floors
it is with the progressive refinement of the five objects of sense pleasure that each one is finer than the one below
again suppose there were lengths of cloth of quadruple triple double and single thickness and made of thick thin thinner and very thin thread spun by one woman all the same measure in width and breadth
now although these lengths of cloth are four in number yet they measure the same in width and breadth there is no difference in their measurement
but in softness to the touch fineness and costliness each is finer than the one before so too although there are only the two factors in all four immaterial states that is to say equanimity and unification of mind still each one should be understood as finer than the one before with the progressive refinement of factors due to successful development
And for the fact that each one of them is finer than the last there is this figure
One hangs upon a tent that stands On filth on him another leans
Outside a third not leaning stands Against the last another leans
Between the four men and these states The correspondence then is shown
And so how each to each relates Can by a man of wit be known
This is how the meaning should be construed There was a tent in a dirty place it seems Then a man arrived and being disgusted with the dirt he rested himself on the tent with his hands and remained as if hung or hanging on to it
Then another man came and leant upon the man hanging on to the tent
Then another man came and thought The one who is hanging on to the tent and the one who is leaning upon him are both badly off
and if the tent falls they will certainly fallI think I shall stand outside
So instead of leaning upon the one leaning upon the first he remained outside
Then another arrived and taking account of the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one leaning upon him and fancying that the one standing outside was well placed he stood leaning upon him
Herein this is how it should be regarded The space from which the kasiṇa has been removed is like the tent in the dirty place The consciousness of the base consisting of boundless space which makes space its object owing to disgust with the sign of the finematerial is like the man who hangs on to the tent owing to disgust with the dirt The consciousness of the base consisting of boundless consciousness the occurrence of which is contingent upon the consciousness of the base consisting of boundless space whose object is space is like the man who leans upon the man who hangs on to the tent The consciousness of the base consisting of nothingness which instead of making the consciousness of the base consisting of boundless space its object has the nonexistence of that as its object is like the man who after considering the insecurity of those two does not lean upon the one hanging on to the tent but stands outside The consciousness of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception the occurrence of which is contingent upon the consciousness of the base consisting of nothingness which stands in a place outside in other words in the nonexistence of the past consciousness is like the man who stands leaning upon the lastnamed having considered the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one leaning upon him and fancying that the one standing outside is well placed
 And while occurring in this way
It takes this for its object since There is no other one as good
As men depend upon a king Whose fault they see for livelihood
 For although this consciousness of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception has seen the flaw in the base consisting of nothingness in this way This attainment has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as its near enemy notwithstanding that fact it takes it as its object in the absence of any other
Like what
As men for the sake of livelihood depend on kings whose faults they see
For just as for the sake of livelihood and because they cannot get a livelihood elsewhere people put up with some king ruler of all quarters who is unrestrained and harsh in bodily verbal and mental behaviour though they see his faults thus He is harshly behaved so too the consciousness of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception takes that base consisting of nothingness as its object in spite of seeing its faults in this way and it does so since it cannot find another better object

As one who mounts a lofty stair Leans on its railings for a prop
As one who climbs an airy peak Leans on the mountains very top
As one who stands on a crags edge Leans for support on his own knees
Each jhāna rests on that below For so it is with each of these
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the treatise on the Development of Concentration
called The Description of the Immaterial States
The tenth chapter
 Now comes the description of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment which was listed as the one perception next to the immaterial states 
Herein it nourishes  thus it is nutriment 
That is of four kinds as physical nutriment nutriment consisting of contact nutriment consisting of mental volition and nutriment consisting of consciousness
 But what is it here that nourishes what
Physical nutriment nourishes the materiality of the octad that has nutritive essence as eighth
contact as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of feeling
mental volition as nutriment nourishes rebirth linking in the three kinds of becoming
consciousness as nutriment nourishes mentalitymateriality at the moment of rebirthlinking
 Now when there is physical nutriment there is attachment which brings peril
when there is nutriment as contact there is approaching which brings peril
 when there is nutriment as mental volition there is rebirthlinking which brings peril
And to show how they bring fear thus physical nutriment should be illustrated by the simile of the childs flesh 
contact as nutriment by the simile of the hideless cow 
mental volition as nutriment by the simile of the pit of live coals 
and consciousness as nutriment by the simile of the hundred spears 
But of these four kinds of nutriment it is only physical nutriment classed as what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted that is intended here as nutriment in this sense
The perception arisen as the apprehension of the repulsive aspect in that nutriment is perception of repulsiveness in nutriment
 One who wants to develop that perception of repulsiveness in nutriment should learn the meditation subject and see that he has no uncertainty about even a single word of what he has learnt Then he should go into solitary retreat and review repulsiveness in ten aspects in the physical nutriment
classified as what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted that is to say as to going seeking using secretion receptacle what is uncooked  what is cooked  fruit outflow and smearing
 Herein as to going even when a man has gone forth in so mighty a dispensation still after he has perhaps spent all night reciting the Enlightened Ones word or doing the ascetic s work after he has risen early to do the duties connected with the shrine terrace and the Enlightenmenttree terrace to set out the water for drinking and washing to sweep the grounds and to see to the needs of the body after he has sat down on his seat and given attention to his meditation subject twenty or thirty times and got up again then he must take his bowl and outer robe he must leave behind the ascetics woods that are not crowded with people offer the bliss of seclusion possess shade and water and are clean cool delightful places he must disregard the Noble Ones delight in seclusion and he must set out for the village in order to get nutriment as a jackal for the charnel ground
And as he goes thus from the time when he steps down from his bed or chair he has to tread on a carpet covered with the dust of his feet geckos droppings and so on
Next he has to see the doorstep which is more repulsive than the inside of the room since it is often fouled with the droppings of rats bats and so on
Next the lower terrace which is more repulsive than the terrace above since it is all smeared with the droppings of owls pigeons and so on
Next the grounds which are more repulsive than the lower floor since they are defiled by old grass and leaves blown about by the wind by sick novices urine excrement spittle and snot and in the rainy season by water mud and so on
And he has to see the road to the monastery which is more repulsive than the grounds
In due course after standing in the debating lodge when he has finished paying homage at the Enlightenment Tree and the shrine he sets out thinking Instead of looking at the shrine that is like a cluster of pearls and the Enlightenment Tree that is as lovely as a bouquet of peacocks tail feathers and the abode that is as fair as a gods palace I must now turn my back on such a charming place and go abroad for the sake of food and on the way to the village the view of a road of stumps and thorns and an uneven road broken up by the force of water awaits him
Next after he has put on his waist cloth as one who hides an abscess and tied his waist band as one who ties a bandage on a wound and robed himself in his upper robes as one who hides a skeleton and taken out his bowl as one who takes out a pan for medicine when he reaches the vicinity of the village gate perhaps the sight of an elephants carcass a horses carcass a buffalos carcass a human carcass a snakes carcass or a dogs carcass awaits him
and not only that but he has to suffer his nose to be assailed by the smell of them
Next as he stands in the village gateway he must scan the village streets in order to avoid danger from savage elephants horses and so on
 So this repulsive experience beginning with the carpet that has to be trodden on and ending with the various kinds of carcasses that have to be seen and smelled has to be undergone for the sake of nutriment
Oh nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to going
 How as to seeking
When he has endured the repulsiveness of going in this way and has gone into the village and is clothed in his cloak of patches he has to wander in the village streets from house to house like a beggar with a dish in his hand
And in the rainy season wherever he treads his feet sink into water and mire up to the flesh of the calves He has to hold the bowl in one hand and his robe up with the other
In the hot season he has to go about with his body covered with the dirt grass and dust blown about by the wind
On reaching such and such a house door he has to see and even to tread in gutters and cesspools covered with bluebottles and seething with all the species of worms all mixed up with fish washings meat washings rice washings spittle snot dogs and pigs excrement and what not
from which flies come up and settle on his outer cloak of patches and on his bowl and on his head
And when he enters a house some give and some do not
And when they give some give yesterdays cooked rice and stale cakes and rancid jelly sauce and so on
Some not giving say Please pass on venerable sir others keep silent as if they did not see him Some avert their faces Others treat him with harsh words such as Go away you baldhead
When he has wandered for alms in the village in this way like a beggar he has to depart from it
So this experience beginning with the entry into the village and ending with the departure from it which is repulsive owing to the water mud etc that has to be trodden in and seen and endured has to be undergone for the sake of nutriment
Oh nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to seeking
 How as to using
After he has sought the nutriment in this way and is sitting at ease in a comfortable place outside the village then so long as he has not dipped his hand into it he would be able to invite a respected bhikkhu or a decent person if he saw one to share it
but as soon as he has dipped his hand into it out of desire to eat he would be ashamed to say Take some
And when he has dipped his hand in and is squeezing it up the sweat trickling down his five fingers wets any dry crisp food there may be and makes it sodden
And when its good appearance has been spoilt by his squeezing it up and it has been made into a ball and put into his mouth then the lower teeth function as a mortar the upper teeth as a pestle and the tongue as a hand
It gets pounded there with the pestle of the teeth like a dogs dinner in a dogs trough while he turns it over and over with his tongue then the thin spittle at the tip of the tongue smears it and the thick spittle behind the middle of the tongue smears it and the filth from the teeth in the parts where a toothstick cannot reach smears it
 When thus mashed up and besmeared this peculiar compound now destitute of the original colour and smell is reduced to a condition as utterly nauseating as a dogs vomit in a dogs trough
Yet notwithstanding that it is like this it can still be swallowed because it is no longer in range of the eyes focus This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to using
 How as to secretion
Buddhas and Paccekabuddhas and Wheelturning Monarchs have only one of the four secretions consisting of bile phlegm pus and blood
but those with weak merit have all four
So when the food has arrived at the stage of being eaten and it enters inside then in one whose secretion of bile is in excess it becomes as utterly nauseating as if smeared with thick madhuka oil
in one whose secretion of phlegm in excess it is as if smeared with the juice of nāgabalā leaves
in one whose secretion of pus is in excess it is as if smeared with rancid buttermilk
and in one whose secretion of blood is in excess it is as utterly nauseating as if smeared with dye This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to secretion
 How as to receptacle
When it has gone inside the belly and is smeared with one of these secretions then the receptacle it goes into is no gold dish or crystal or silver dish and so on
On the contrary if it is swallowed by one ten years old it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for ten years
If it is swallowed by one twenty years old thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety ears old
if it is swallowed by one a hundred years old it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for a hundred years This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to receptacle
 How as to what is uncooked 
After this nutriment has arrived at such a place for its receptacle then for as long as it remains uncooked it stays in that same place just described which is shrouded in absolute darkness pervaded by draughts tainted by various smells of ordure and utterly fetid and loathsome And just as when a cloud out of season has rained during a drought and bits of grass and leaves and rushes and the carcasses of snakes dogs and human beings that have collected in a pit at the gate of an outcaste village remain there warmed by the suns heat until the pit becomes covered with froth and bubbles so too what has been swallowed that day and yesterday and the day before remains there together and being smothered by the layer of phlegm and covered with froth and bubbles produced by digestion through being fermented by the heat of the bodily fires it becomes quite loathsome This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is uncooked
 How as to what is cooked
When it has been completely cooked there by the bodily fires it does not turn into gold silver etc as the ores of gold silver etc do through smelting
Instead giving off froth and bubbles it turns into excrement and fills the receptacle for digested food like brown clay squeezed with a smoothing trowel and packed into a tube and it turns into urine and fills the bladder This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is cooked
 How as to fruit
When it has been rightly cooked it produces the various kinds of ordure consisting of head hairs body hairs nails teeth and the rest When wrongly cooked it produces the hundred diseases beginning with itch ringworm smallpox leprosy plague consumption coughs flux and so on Such is its fruit This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to fruit
 How as to outflow
On being swallowed it enters by one door after which it flows out by several doors in the way beginning Eyedirt from the eye ear dirt from the ear 
And on being swallowed it is swallowed even in the company of large gatherings
But on flowing out now converted into excrement urine etc it is excreted only in solitude
On the first day one is delighted to eat it elated and full of happiness and joy
On the second day one stops ones nose to void it with a wry face disgusted and dismayed
And on the first day one swallows it lustfully greedily gluttonously infatuatedly But on the second day after a single night has passed one excretes it with distaste ashamed humiliated and disgusted
Hence the Ancients said
 The food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suck
Go in all by a single door But by nine doors come oozing out
The food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suck
Men like to eat in company But to excrete in secrecy
The food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suck
These a man eats with high delight And then excretes with dumb disgust
The food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suck
A single night will be enough To bring them to putridity
This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to outflow
 How as to smearing
At the time of using it he smears his hands lips tongue and palate
and they become repulsive by being smeared with it And even when washed they have to be washed again and again in order to remove the smell
And just as when rice is being boiled the husks the red powder covering the grain etc rise up and smear the mouth rim and lid of the cauldron so too when eaten it rises up during its cooking and simmering by the bodily fire that pervades the whole body it turns into tartar which smears the teeth
and it turns into spittle phlegm etc which respectively smear the tongue palate etc and it turns into eyedirt eardirt snot urine excrement etc which respectively smear the eyes ears nose and nether passages
And when these doors are smeared by it they never become either clean or pleasing even though washed every day
And after one has washed a certain one of these the hand has to be washed again
And after one has washed a certain one of these the repulsiveness does not depart from it even after two or three washings with cow dung and clay and scented powder This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to smearing
As he reviews repulsiveness in this way in ten aspects and strikes at it with thought and applied thought physical nutriment becomes evident to him in its repulsive aspect
He cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices it
As he does so the hindrances are suppressed
and his mind is concentrated in access concentration but without reaching absorption because of the profundity of physical nutriment as a state with an individual essence
But perception is evident here in the apprehension of the repulsive aspect
which is why this meditation subject goes by the name of perception of repulsiveness in nutriment
 When a bhikkhu devotes himself to this perception of repulsiveness in nutriment his mind retreats retracts and recoils from craving for flavours
He nourishes himself with nutriment without vanity and only for the purpose of crossing over suffering as one who seeks to cross over the desert eats his own dead childs flesh 
Then his greed for the five cords of sense desire comes to be fully understood without difficulty by means of the full understanding of the physical nutriment
He fully understands the materiality aggregate by means of the fullunderstanding of the five cords of sense desire
Development of mindfulness occupied with the body comes to perfection in him through the repulsiveness of what is uncooked and the rest He has entered upon a way that is in conformity with the perception of foulness
And by keeping to this way even if he does not experience the deathless goal in this life he is at least bound for a happy destiny
This is the detailed explanation of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment
Now comes the description of the development of the definition of the four elements which was listed as the one defining next to the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment 
Herein defining is determining by characterizing individual essences The compound catudhātuvavatthāna is resolvable into catunnaṃ dhātūnaṃ vavatthānaṃ 
Attention given to elements the meditation subject consisting of elements and defining of the four elements all mean the same thing
This is given in two ways in brief and in detail
It is given in brief in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta 
and in detail in the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta  the Rāhulovāda Sutta  and the Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta 
Bhikkhus just as though a skilled butcher or butchers apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces so too bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this body however placed however disposed as consisting of elements In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element 
It is given in brief in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta for one of quick understanding whose meditation subject is elements as 
 The meaning is this just as though a clever butcher or his apprentice who worked for his keep had killed a cow and divided it up and were seated at the crossroads reckoned as the intersection of the main roads going in the four directions having laid it out part by part so too a bhikkhu reviews the body however placed because it is in some one of the four postures
and however disposed because it is so placed thus In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
What is meant
Just as the butcher while feeding the cow bringing it to the shambles keeping it tied up after bringing it there slaughtering it and seeing it slaughtered and dead does not lose the perception cow so long as he has not carved it up and divided it into parts
but when he has divided it up and is sitting there he loses the perception cow and the perception meat occurs
he does not think I am selling cow or They are carrying cow away
but rather he thinks I am selling meat or They are carrying meat away so too this bhikkhu while still a foolish ordinary personboth formerly as a layman and as one gone forth into homelessnessdoes not lose the perception living being or man or person so long as he does not by resolution of the compact into elements review this body however placed however disposed as consisting of elements
But when he does review it as consisting of elements he loses the perception living being and his mind establishes itself upon elements
That is why the Blessed One said Bhikkhus just as though a skilled butcher  were seated at the crossroads  so too bhikkhus a bhikkhu  air element 
In the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta as follows And what is the internal earth element friends
Whatever there is internally in oneself that is hard harsh and clung to 
that is to say head hairs body hairs teeth nails skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidney heart liver midriff spleen lungs bowels entrails gorge dung or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is hard harsh and clung to this is called the internal earth element 
And What is the internal water element friends
Whatever there is internally in oneself that is water watery and clung to
that is to say bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urine or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is water watery and clung tothis is called the internal water element 
And What is the internal fire element friends
Whatever there is internally in oneself that is fire fiery and clung to
that is to say that whereby one is warmed ages and burns up and whereby what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted gets completely digested or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is fire fiery and clung tothis is called the internal fire element 
And What is the internal air element friends
Whatever there is internally in oneself that is air airy and clung to
that is to say upgoing winds down going winds winds in the belly winds in the bowels winds that course through all the limbs inbreath and outbreath or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is air airy and clung tothis is called the internal air element 
 it is given in detail for one of not over quick understanding whose meditation subject is elements
and as here so also in the Rāhulovāda and Dhātuvibhaṅga Suttas
Here is the commentary on the words that are not clear Internally in oneself  both these words are terms for what is ones own  since what is ones own is what is produced in ones own self 
the meaning is included in ones continuity 
This is called internal because it occurs in self just as in the world speech among women is called speech belongingtowomen  And it is called in oneself because it occurs owing to self 
Hard rigid
Harsh rough
Herein the first is a word for the characteristic while the second is a word for the mode for the earth element is characterized as hard but its mode is rough which is why it is called harsh
Clung to taken firmly by kamma the meaning is firmly taken seized adhered to as I mine 
That is to say the word seyyathidaṃ is a particle
its meaning is What is that
Next showing what that is head hairs body hairs etc is said
And here the brain must be added since it has to be understood that the earth element needs to be described in twenty modes
Or whatever else the earth element included in the remaining three portions
 It flows  flows on  to such and such a place as a state of streaming thus it is water 
The watery is what is gone among such various kinds of water as the kammaoriginated and so on
What is that
It is what has the water elements characteristic of cohesion
 Fire is definable as heating  The fiery is what is gone  in the way already described among the kinds of fire 
What is that
It is what has the characteristic of heat
Whereby by means of which the fire element when excited this body is warmed becomes heated by the state of one day fever and so on
Ages whereby this body grows old reaches the decline of the faculties loss of strength wrinkles grayness and so on
Burns up whereby when excited it causes this body to burn
and the person cries out I am burning I am burning and longs for ghee a hundred times washed and for gosīsa sandalwood ointment etc and for the breeze of a fan
And whereby what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted gets completely digested whereby the boiled rice etc that is eaten or the beverage etc that is drunk or the hard food consisting of flour biscuits etc that is chewed the mango fruit honey molasses etc that is tasted gets completely cooked gets its juice etc extracted is the meaning
And here the first three kinds of fire element that is to say is warmed ages and burns up are of fourfold origination 
while the last is only kammaoriginated
Air is definable as blowing  The airy is what is gone  in the way already described among the kinds of air
What is that
It is what has the characteristic of distension
Upgoing winds winds mounting upwards that cause the occurrence of vomiting belching and so on
Downgoing winds winds descending downwards that expel excrement and urine
Winds in the belly winds outside the bowels
Winds in the bowels winds inside the bowels
Winds that course through all the limbs winds that produce flexing extending etc and are distributed over the limbs and the whole body by means of the network of veins 
Inbreath wind in the nostrils entering in
Outbreath wind in the nostrils issuing out
And here the first five are of fourfold origination
Inbreath and outbreath are consciousnessoriginated
In each instance the phrase or whatever else comprises respectively the water element the fire element or the air element included in the other three portions
So the four elements have been detailed in fortytwo aspects that is to say the earth element in twenty aspects the water element in twelve the fire element in four and the air element in six This firstly is the commentary on the texts here
As regards the method of development here however to discern the elements in detail in this way The head hairs are the earth element the body hairs are the earth element appears redundant to a bhikkhu of quick understanding
What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element
what has the characteristic of cohesion is the water element
what has the characteristic of ripening is the fire element
what has the characteristic of distending is the air element  though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in this way
But when one of not overquick understanding gives his attention to it in this way it appears obscure and unevident
and it only becomes plain to him if he gives his attention to it in the firstmentioned way
Why
Suppose two bhikkhus are reciting a text with many elided repetitions then the bhikkhu with the quicker understanding fills out the elided repetitions once or twice after which he goes on doing the recital with only the two end parts of the elisions
Here the one of less quick understanding says What is he reciting Why he does not even give one time to move ones lips If the recitation is done like this when shall we ever get familiar with the text
and so he does his recitation filling out each elision as it comes
Then the other says What is he reciting Why he never lets one get to the end of it If the recitation is done like this when shall we ever get to the end of it
So too the detailed discerning of the elements by head hairs etc appears redundant to one of quick understanding
though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in brief in this way What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element and so on
But when the other gives his attention to it in this way it appears obscure and unevident
and it only becomes plain to him if he gives his attention in detail by head hairs and so on
So firstly one of quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should go into solitary retreat Then he should advert to his own entire material body and discern the elements in brief in this way In this body what is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element
what is cohesion or fluidity is the water element
what is maturing or heat is the fire element
what is distension or movement is the air element And he should advert and give attention to it and review it again and again as earth element water element that is to say as mere elements not a living being and soulless
As he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in him which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of the elements and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual essences as its object
Or alternatively there are these four bodily parts mentioned by the General of the Dhamma the Elder Sāriputta for the purpose of showing the absence of any living being in the four great primary elements thus When a space is enclosed with bones and sinews and flesh and skin there comes to be the term material form  
And he should resolve each of these as a separate entity separating them out by the hand of knowledge and then discern them in the way already stated thus In these what is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element  And he should again and again advert to them give attention to them and review them as mere elements not a living being not a soul
As he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in him which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of the elements and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual essences as its object
This is the method of development when the definition of the elements is given in brief
The method given in detail should be understood in this way
A meditator of not overquick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should learn the elements in detail in the fortytwo aspects from a teacher and he should live in an abode of the kind already described Then when he has done all the duties he should go into solitary retreat and develop the meditation subject in four ways thus with constituents in brief with constituents by analysis with characteristics in brief and with characteristics by analysis
Herein how does he develop it with constituents in brief
Here a bhikkhu does his defining in this way In twenty of the parts what has the stiffened mode is the earth element
and he does his defining thus In twelve parts the liquid called water with the mode of cohesion is the water element
 and he does his defining thus In four parts what matures is the fire element
and he does his defining thus In six parts what has the mode of distending is the air element
As he defines them in this way they become evident to him
As he again and again adverts to them and gives his attention to them concentration arises as access only
However if his meditation subject is not successful while he develops it in this way then he should develop it with constituents by analysis
How
Firstly the bhikkhu should carry out all the directions given for the thirtytwofold aspect in the description of mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject  namely the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving attention
and he should start with the verbal recitation in direct and reverse order of the skin pentad and so on without omitting any of it
The only difference is this there after giving attention to the head hairs etc as to colour shape direction location and delimitation the mind had to be fixed by means of repulsiveness  but here it is done by means of elements
Therefore at the end of each part after giving attention to head hairs etc each in the five ways beginning with colour  attention should be given as follows
 These things called head hairs grow on the inner skin that envelops the skull
Herein just as when kuṇṭha grasses grow on the top of an anthill the top of the termitemound does not know Kuṇṭha grasses are growing on me nor do the kuṇṭha grasses know We are growing on the top of a termitemound so too the inner skin that covers the skull does not know Head hairs grow on me nor do the head hairs know We grow on inner skin that envelops a skull  These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what are called head hairs are a particular component of this body without thought morally indeterminate void not a living being rigid earth element
Body hairs grow on the inner skin that envelops the body
Herein just as when dabba grasses grow on the square in an empty village the square in the empty village does not know Dabba grasses grow on me nor do the dabba grasses know We grow on the square in an empty village so too the inner skin that envelops the body does not know Body hairs grow on me

Herein just as when a tree oozes gum through being hit by say an axe the parts of the tree that have been hit do not know Gum is in us nor does the gum know I am in a part of a tree that has been hit so too the parts of the body wounded by splinters thorns etc do not know Pus is in us
nor does the pus know I am in such places
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what is called pus is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being liquid water element in the mode of cohesion
As to blood the mobile blood is to be found like the bile soaking the whole body
The stored blood is to be found filling the lower part of the livers site to the extent of a bowlful wetting the kidney heart liver and lungs
Herein the definition of the mobile blood is similar to that of the free bile
But as to the other just as when rain water seeps through an old pot and wets clods and stumps below the clods and stumps do not know We are being wetted with water
nor does the water know I am wetting clods and stumps so too the lower part of the livers site or the kidneys etc respectively do not know Blood is in me or We are being wetted
nor does the blood know I fill the lower part of a livers site am wetting a kidney and so on
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what is called blood is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being liquid water element in the mode of cohesion
Sweat is to be found filling the openings of the pores of the head hairs and body hairs when there is heat due to fires etc and it trickles out of them
Herein just as when bunches of lily bud stems and lotus stalks are pulled up out of water the openings in the bunches of lilies etc do not know Water trickles from us
nor does the water trickling from the openings in the bunches of lilies etc know I am trickling from openings in bunches of lilies etc so too the openings of the pores of the head hairs and body hairs do not know Sweat trickles from us
nor does the sweat know I trickle from openings of pores of head hairs and body hairs
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what is called sweat is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being liquid water element in the mode of cohesion
Fat is the thick unguent to be found pervading the whole body of one who is stout and on the shank flesh etc of one who is lean
Herein just as when a heap of meat is covered by a yellow rag the heap of meat does not know A yellow rag is next to me
nor does the yellow rag know I am next to a heap of meat so too the flesh to be found on the whole body or on the shanks etc does not know Fat is next to me
nor does the fat knowI am next to flesh on a whole body or on the shanks and so on
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what is called fat is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being thickliquid water element in the mode of cohesion
Tears when produced are to be found filling the eye sockets or trickling out of them
Herein just as when the sockets of young palm kernels are filled with water the sockets of the young palm kernels do not know Water is in us
nor does the water in the sockets of the young palm kernels know I am in sockets of young palm kernels so too the eye sockets do not know Tears are in us
nor do the tears know We are in eye sockets
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what is called tears is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being liquid water element in the mode of cohesion
Grease is the melted unguent to be found on the palms and backs of the hands on the soles and backs of the feet on the nose and forehead and on the points of the shoulders when heated by fire and so on
Herein just as when rice gruel has oil put on it the rice gruel does not know Oil is spread over me
nor does the oil know I am spread over rice gruel so too the place consisting of the palm of the hand etc does not know Grease is spread over me
nor does the grease know I am spread over places consisting of the palm of the hand and so on
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what is called grease is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being liquid water element in the mode of cohesion
Spittle is to be found on the surface of the tongue after it has descended from the cheeks on both sides when there is a condition for the arising of spittle
Herein just as when a hollow in a river bank is constantly oozing with water the surface of the hollow does not know Water lies on me
nor does the water know I lie on the surface of a hollow so too the surface of the tongue does not know Spittle that has descended from cheeks on both sides is on me
nor does the spittle know I have descended from cheeks on both sides and am on the surface of a tongue

So what is called spittle is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being liquid water element in the mode of cohesion
Snot when produced is to be found filling the nostrils or trickling out of them
Herein just as when a bag is loaded with rotting curd the bag does not know Rotting curd is in me
nor does the rotting curd know I am in a bag so too the nostrils do not know Snot is in us

Oil of the joints is to be found in the hundred and eighty joints serving the function of lubricating the joints of the bones
Herein just as when an axle is lubricated with oil the axle does not know Oil lubricates me
nor does the oil know I lubricate an axle so too the hundred and eighty joints do not know Oil of the joints lubricates us
nor does the oil of the joints know I lubricate a hundred and eighty joints

So what is called oil of the joints is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being liquid water element in the mode of cohesion
Urine is to be found inside the bladder
Herein just as when a porous pot is put upside down in a cesspool the porous pot does not know Cesspool filtrate is in me
nor does the cesspool filtrate know I am in a porous pot so too the bladder does not know Urine is in me
nor does the urine know I am in a bladder
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing

When he has given his attention in this way to the body hairs etc he should then give his attention to the four fire components thus That whereby one is warmed this is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is fire element in the mode of maturing  That whereby one ages  That whereby one burns up  That whereby what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted becomes completely digested this is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is fire element in the mode of maturing 
 After that having discovered the upgoing winds as upgoing the downgoing winds as downgoing the winds in the belly as in the belly the winds in the bowels as in the bowels the winds that course through all the limbs as coursing through all the limbs and inbreath and out breath as inbreath and outbreath he should give his attention to these six air components in this way What is called upgoing winds is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is air element in the mode of distending What is called downgoing winds  What is called winds in the belly  What is called winds in the bowels  What is called winds that course through all the limbs  What is called inbreath and outbreath is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is air element in the mode of distending
As he gives his attention in this way the elements become evident to him
As he adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already described
But if his meditation subject is still not successful when he gives his attention to it in this way then he should develop it with characteristics in brief
How
In the twenty components the characteristic of stiffenedness should be defined as the earth element
and the characteristic of cohesion which is there too as the water element
and the characteristic of maturing  which is there too as the fire element
and the characteristic of distension which is there too as the air element
In the twelve components the characteristic of cohesion should be defined as the water
element the characteristic of maturing  which is there too as the fire element
the characteristic of distension which is there too as the air element
and the characteristic of stiffenedness which is there too as the earth element
In the four components the characteristic of maturing should be defined as the fire element
the characteristic of distension unresolvable from it as the air element
the characteristic of stiffenedness as the earth element
and the characteristic of cohesion as the water element
In the six components the characteristic of distension should be defined as the air element
the characteristic of stiffenedness there too as the earth element
the characteristic of cohesion as the water element
and the characteristic of maturing as the fire element
As he defines them in this way the elements become evident to him
As he adverts to them and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already stated
However if he still does not succeed with his meditation subject when he gives his attention to it in this way then he should develop it with characteristics by analysis
How
After discerning head hairs etc in the way already described the characteristic of stiffenedness in head hairs should be defined as the earth element
the characteristic of cohesion there too as the water element
the characteristic of maturing as the fire element
and the characteristic of distension as the air element
The four elements should be defined in this way in the case of each component
As he defines them in this way the elements become evident to him
As he adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already described
In addition attention should be given to the elements in the following ways as to word meaning by groups by particles by characteristic etc as to how originated as to variety and unity as to resolution and nonresolution  as to the similar and the dissimilar as to distinction between internal and external as to inclusion as to condition as to lack of conscious reaction as to analysis of conditions
 Herein one who gives his attention to them as to word meaning should do so separately and generally thus separately it is earth because it is spread out 
it flows or it glides or it satisfies  thus it is water 
it heats  thus it is fire 
it blows  thus it is air 
But without differentiation they are elements because of bearing their own characteristics because of grasping suffering and because of sorting out suffering 
This is how they should be given attention as to word meaning
 By groups there is the earth element described under the twenty aspects beginning with head hairs body hairs and also the water element described under the twelve aspects beginning with bile phlegm etc Now as to these
Colour odour taste and nutritive essence and the four elements
From combination of these eight there comes the common usage head hairs
And separately from these eight there is no common usage head hairs
Consequently head hairs are only a mere group of eight states
Likewise body hairs and the rest
A component here that is kammaoriginated is a group of ten states that is to say the former eight together with the life faculty and sex
But it is on account of respective prominence of stiffenedness or cohesion that it comes to be styled earth element or water element
This is how they should be given attention to by groups
 By particles in this body the earth element taken as reduced to fine dust and powdered to the size of the smallest atom might amount to an average doṇa measure full
and that is held together by the water element measuring half as much Being maintained by the fire element and distended by the air element it does not get scattered or dissipated Instead of getting scattered or dissipated it arrives at the alternative states of the female and male sex etc and manifests smallness bigness length shortness toughness rigidity and so on
 The liquid water element that is the mode of cohesion being founded on earth maintained by fire and distended by air does not trickle or run away Instead of trickling or running away it provides continued refreshments
And here the fire element that cooks what is eaten drunk etc and is the mode of warming and has the characteristic of heat being established on earth held together by water and distended by air maintains this body and ensures its proper appearance
And this body being maintained by it shows no putrefaction
The air element that courses through all the limbs and has the characteristic of moving and distending being founded upon earth held together by water and maintained by fire distends this body
And this body being distended by the latter kind of air does not collapse but stands erect
and being propelled by the other motile air it shows intimation and it flexes and extends and it wriggles the hands and feet doing so in the postures comprising of walking standing sitting and lying down
So this mechanism of elements carries on like a magic trick deceiving foolish people with the male and female sex and so on This is how they should be given attention by particles
 As to characteristic etc he should advert to the four elements in this way The earth elementwhat are its characteristic function manifestation defining them in this way The earth element has the characteristic of hardness Its function is to act as a foundation It is manifested as receiving
The water element has the characteristic of trickling Its function is to intensify It is manifested as holding together
The fire element has the characteristic of heat Its function is to mature  It is manifested as a continued supply of softness
The air element has the characteristic of distending Its function is to cause motion It is manifested as conveying
This is how they should be given attention to by characteristic and so on
 As to how originated among the fortytwo components beginning with head hairs shown in the detailed treatment of the earth element etc
the four consisting of gorge dung pus and urine are temperatureoriginated only
the four consisting of tears sweat spittle and snot are temperatureoriginated and consciousnessoriginated only
The fire that cooks what is eaten etc is kamma originated only
inbreath and outbreath are consciousnessoriginated only
all the rest are of fourfold origination This is how they should be given attention as to how originated
 As to variety and unity there is variety in the specific characteristics etc of all the elements
for the characteristic function and manifestation of the earth element is one
and those of the water element etc are different
But there is unity in them as materiality great primary element state  imperma nence etc notwithstanding the fact that they are various according to specific characteristic etc and according to origination by kamma and so on
All these elements are instances of materiality because they do not exceed the characteristic of being molested 
They are great primaries by reason of great manifestation and so on
By reason of great manifestation and so on means that these elements are called great primaries for the following reasons namely manifestation of greatness likeness to great creatures great maintenance great alteration and because they are great and because they are entities
Herein manifestation of greatness they are manifested as great both in a continuity that is not clung to and in a continuity that is clung to
For their manifestation of greatness in a continuity that is not clung to is given
Two times a hundred thousand leagues and then four nahutas as well
This earth this bearer of all wealth Has that much thickness as they tell 
in the description of the recollection of the Buddha in the way beginning 
And they are manifested on a great scale also in a continuity that is clung to for instance in the bodies of fishes turtles deities Dānava demons and so on
For this is said Bhikkhus there are individual creatures of a hundred leagues in the great ocean  and so on
 Likeness to great creatures just as a magician turns water that is not crystal into crystal and turns a clod that is not gold into gold and shows them
and being himself neither a spirit nor a bird shows himself as a spirit or a bird so too being themselves not blueblack they turn themselves into blueblack derived materiality being themselves not yellow  not red  not white they turn themselves into white derived materiality and show that In this way they are great primaries in being like the great creatures of a magician
 And just as whomsoever the great creatures such as the spirits grasp hold of  they have no standing place either inside him or outside him and yet they have no standing independently of him so too these elements are not found to stand either inside or outside each other yet they have no standing independently of one another Thus they are also great primaries in being equal to the great creatures such as the spirits because they have no thinkable standing place relative to each other
 And just as the great creatures known as female spirits conceal their own fearfulness with a pleasing colour shape and gesture to deceive beings so too these elements conceal each their own characteristic and function classed as hardness etc by means of a pleasing skin colour of womens and mens bodies etc and pleasing shapes of limbs and pleasing gestures of fingers toes and eyebrows and they deceive simple people by concealing their own functions and characteristics beginning with hardness and do not allow their individual essences to be seen Thus they are great primaries in being equal to the great creatures  the female spirits since they are deceivers
 Great maintenance this is because they have to be sustained by the great requisites
For these elements are great primaries since they have become  have occurred by means of the food clothing etc which are great in importance because they have to be found every day
Or alternatively they are great primaries since they are primaries whose maintenance is great
 Great alteration the unclungto and the clungto are the basis of great alterations
Herein the great alteration of the unclungto evidences itself in the emergence of an aeon 
and that of the clungto in the disturbance of the elements in the body
For accordingly
Out of the ground and races higher And higher right to the Brahmā heaven
The conflagrations flame bursts up When the world is burnt up by fire
A whole world system measuring One hundred thousand millions wide
Subsides as with its furious waters The flood dissolves the world beside
One hundred thousand million leagues A whole world systems broad extent
Is rent and scattered when the world Succumbs to the air element
The bite of woodenmouths can make The body stiff to all intent
When roused is its earth element It might be gripped by such a snake
The bite of rottenmouths can make The body rot to all intent
When roused its water element It might be gripped by such a snake
The bite of fierymouths can make The body burn to all intent
When roused is its fire element It might be gripped by such a snake
The bite of daggermouths can make The body burst to all intent
When roused is its air element It might be gripped by such a snake
So they are great primaries because they have become the basis of great alteration
 Because they are great and because they are entities great because they need great effort to discern them and entities because they are existent thus they are great primaries because they are great and because they are entities 
This is how all these elements are great primaries by reason of great manifestation and so on
Again they are elements because of bearing their own characteristics because of grasping suffering and because of sorting out suffering  and because none of them are exempt from the characteristic of being elements
They are states owing to bearing their own characteristics and owing to their so bearing for the length of the moment appropriate to them
They are impermanent in the sense of liability to destruction
they are painful in the sense of causing terror
they are not self in the sense of having no core of permanence and so on
Thus there is unity of all since all are materiality great primaries elements states impermanent and so on This is how they should be given attention as to variety and unity
 As to resolution and nonresolution  they are positionally unresolvable since they always arise together in every single minimal material group consisting of the bare octad and the others
but they are resolvable by characteristic This is how they should be given attention as to resolution and nonresolution 
 As to the similar and dissimilar and although they are unresolved in this way yet the first two similar in heaviness
and so are the last two in lightness
but for this reason the first two are dissimilar to the last two and the last two to the first two This is how they should be given attention as to the similar and dissimilar
 As to distinction between internal and external the internal elements are the material support for the physical bases of consciousness for the kinds of intimation and for the material faculties They are associated with postures and they are of fourfold origination
The external elements are of the opposite kind This is how they should be given attention as to distinction between internal and external
 As to inclusion kammaoriginated earth element is included together with the other kammaoriginated elements because there is no difference in their origination
Likewise the consciousnessoriginated is included together with other consciousnessoriginated elements This is how they should be given attention as to inclusion
 As to condition the earth element which is held together by water maintained by fire and distended by air is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their foundation
The water element which is founded on earth maintained by fire and distended by air is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their cohesion
The fire element which is founded on earth held together by water and distended by air is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their maintaining
The air element which is founded on earth held together by water and maintained by fire is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their distension This is how they should be given attention as to condition
 As to lack of conscious reaction here too the earth element does not know I am the earth element or I am a condition by acting as a foundation for three great primaries And the other three do not know The earth element is a condition for us by acting as a foundation for three great primaries
And the other three do not know The earth element is a condition for us by acting as our foundation
And similarly in each instance This is how they should be given attention as to lack of conscious reaction
 As to analysis of conditions there are four conditions for the elements that is to say kamma consciousness nutriment and temperature
Herein kamma only is the condition for the kammaoriginated elements consciousness  etc ie nutriment and temperature are not
Consciousness etc only are the conditions for the consciousnessoriginated elements the others are not
Kamma is the producing condition for the kammaoriginated elements for the rest it is indirectly the decisivesupportive condition
Consciousness is the producing condition for the consciousnessoriginated elements for the rest it is the postnascence condition presence condition and nondisappearance condition
Nutriment is the producing condition for the nutrimentoriginated elements for the rest it is the nutriment condition presence condition and nondisappearance condition
Temperature is the productive condition for the temperatureoriginated elements for the rest it is the presence condition and nondisappearance condition
Herein the kammaoriginated great primary is the condition for the kamma originated great primaries and also for the consciousnessoriginated great primaries
Likewise are the consciousnessoriginated great primary and the nutriment originated great primary
The temperatureoriginated great primary is the condition for the temperatureoriginated great primaries and also for the kammaoriginated great primaries and so on 
 Herein the kammaoriginated earth element is a condition for the other kammaoriginated elements both as conascence mutuality support presence and nondisappearance conditions and as foundation but not as producing condition
It is a condition for the other three great primaries in a triple continuity as support presence and nondisappearance conditions but not as foundation or producing condition
And here the water element is a condition for the remaining three elements both as conascence etc conditions and as cohesion but not as producing condition
And for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support presence and nondisappearance conditions too but not as cohesion or producing condition
And the fire element here is a condition for the other three elements both as conascence etc conditions and as maintaining but not as producing condition
And for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support presence and nondisappearance conditions too but not as maintaining or producing condition
And the air element here is a condition for the other three elements both as conascence etc conditions and as distension but not as producing condition
And for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support presence and non disappearance conditions too but not as distension or producing condition
The same method applies in the case of the consciousnessoriginated the nutrimentoriginated and the temperatureoriginated earth element and the rest
 And when these elements have been made to occur through the influence of the conascence etc conditions
With three in four ways to one due And likewise with one due to three
With two in six ways due to twoThus their occurrence comes to be
 Taking each one beginning with earth there are three others whose occurrence is due to that one thus with three due to one their occurrence takes place in four ways
Likewise each one beginning with earth occurs in dependence on the other three thus with one due to three their occurrence takes place in four ways
But with the last two dependent on the first two with the first two dependent on the last two with the second and fourth dependent on the first and third with the first and third dependent on the second and fourth with the second and third dependent on the first and fourth and with the first and fourth dependent on the second and third they occur in six ways with two elements due to two
 At the time of moving forward and moving backward  the earth element among these is a condition for pressing
That seconded by the water element is a condition for establishing on a foundation
But the water element seconded by the earth element is a condition for lowering down
The fire element seconded by the air element is a condition for lifting up
The air element seconded by the fire element is a condition for shifting forwards and shifting sideways  This is how they should be given attention as to analysis of conditions
 As he gives his attention to them as to word meaning etc in this way the elements become evident to him under each heading
As he again and again adverts and gives attention to them access concentration arises in the way already described
And this concentration too is called definition of the four elements because it arises in one who defines the four elements owing to the influence of his knowledge
 This bhikkhu who is devoted to the defining of the four elements immerses himself in voidness and eliminates the perception of living beings
Since he does not entertain false notions about wild beasts spirits ogres etc because he has abolished the perception of living beings he conquers fear and dread and conquers delight and aversion  he is not exhilarated or depressed by agreeable and disagreeable things
and as one of great understanding he either ends in the deathless or he is bound for a happy destiny
The noble meditator lion Will make this mighty theme his sport
Defining the four elements Is ever the wise mans resort
This is the description of the development of the defining of the four elements
This completes in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the clause How should it be developed in the set of questions beginning with What is concentration which was formulated in order to show the method of development of concentration in detail 
 This concentration as intended here is twofold that is to say access concentration and absorption concentration
Herein the unification of mind in the case of ten meditation subjects and in the consciousness preceding absorption in the case of the remaining meditation subjects is access concentration
The unification of mind in the case of the remaining meditation subjects is absorption concentration
And so it is developed in two forms with the development of these meditation subjects
Hence it was said above This completes in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the clause How should it be developed
 The question what are the benefits of the development of concentration was also asked however  Herein the benefits of the development of concentration are fivefold as a blissful abiding here and now and so on
For the development of absorption concentration provides the benefit of a blissful abiding here and now for the Arahants with cankers destroyed who develop concentration thinking We shall attain and dwell with unified mind for a whole day
Hence the Blessed One said But Cunda it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline
these are called blissful abidings in the Noble Ones discipline 
 When ordinary people and trainers develop it thinking After emerging we shall exercise insight with concentrated consciousness the development of absorption concentration provides them with the benefit of insight by serving as the proximate cause for insight and so too does access concentration as a method of arriving at wide open conditions in crowded circumstances
Hence the Blessed One said Bhikkhus develop concentration
a bhikkhu who is concentrated understands correctly 
 But when they have already produced the eight attainments and then aspiring to the kinds of directknowledge described in the way beginning Having been one he becomes many  they produce them by entering upon jhāna as the basis for directknowledge and emerging from it then the development of absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of the kinds of directknowledge since it becomes the proximate cause for the kinds of directknowledge whenever there is an occasion
Hence the Blessed One said He attains the ability to be a witness through realization by directknowledge of any state realizable by directknowledge to which his mind inclines whenever there is an occasion 
 When ordinary people have not lost their jhāna and they aspire to rebirth in the Brahmāworld thus Let us be reborn in the Brahmāworld or even though they do not make the actual aspiration then the development of absorption concentration provides them with the benefits of an improved form of existence since it ensures that for them
Hence the Blessed One said Where do they reappear after developing the first jhāna limitedly
They reappear in the company of the deities of Brahmās Retinue  and so on
And even the development of access concentration ensures an improved form of existence in the happy destinies of the sensual sphere
 But when Noble Ones who have already produced the eight attainments develop concentration thinking We shall enter upon the attainment of cessation and by being without consciousness for seven days we shall abide in bliss here and now by reaching the cessation that is Nibbāna then the development of absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of cessation
Hence it is said Understanding as mastery owing to  sixteen kinds of behaviour of knowledge and to nine kinds of behaviour of concentration is knowledge of the attainment of cessation 
 That is how this benefit of the development of concentration is fivefold as a blissful abiding here and now and so on
It cleans defiling stains pollution And brings rewards past calculation
So wise men fail not in devotion To the pursuit of concentration
 And at this point in the Path of Purification which is taught under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding in the stanza When a wise man established well in virtue  concentration has been fully explained
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
