to the Wicked MāraYou should have little concern Wicked Onein no long time the Realised One will become completely emancipatedafter three months have passed from now the Realised One will attain Complete EmancipationThen at the Cāpāla shrine the Fortunate One mindfully with full awareness relinquished the life processWith the relinquishment of the life process by the Fortunate One there was a great earthquakeand a fearful horrifying crash of the devas thunder drumThen the Fortunate One having understood the significance of iton that occasion uttered this exalted utteranceMeasurable and immeasurable continuityAnd the continuationprocess the Sage relinquishedContent in himself and concentratedHe broke continuity of self like a coat of mailThus I heardat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthīat the Eastern Monastery in Migāras mothers mansionThen at that time Migāras mother Visākhāsgranddaughter who was beloved and dear had diedThen Migāras mother Visākhā with wet clothes and hairin the middle of the day went to the Fortunate Oneand after going and worshipping the Fortunate One she sat down on one sideWhile sat on one sidethe Fortunate One said this to Migāras

without despair I sayThen the Fortunate One having understood the significance of iton that occasion uttered this exalted utteranceWhatever griefs or lamentations there areAnd the many kinds of suffering in the worldThese all arise because of loveWithout loves these do not originateTherefore they are happy and free from griefWho are without love for anything in the worldTherefore those wanting what is griefless dustfreeShould not have love for anything in the worldThus I heardat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthīin Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen at that time the Fortunate One was instructing rousing enthusing and cheeringthe monks with a Dhamma talk connected with EmancipationThose monks after making it their goal applying their mindsconsidering it with all their mind were listening to Dhamma with an attentive earThen the Fortunate One having understood the significance of iton that occasion uttered this exalted utteranceFor the dependent there is agitation for the independent there is no agitationWhen there is no agitation there is calm when there is calm there is no incliningWhen there is no inclining there is no coming or goingWhen there is no coming or going there is no passing away and rebirthWhen there is no passing away and rebirth there is no here or hereafter or in between the twoThus I heardat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Uruvelāon the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the root of the Awakening tree in the first period after attaining AwakeningThen at that time the Fortunate Onewas sitting in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedomThen with the passing of those seven days the Fortunate Oneafter arising from that concentration for the last watch of the nightapplied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in forward and reverse orderThis being so that is from the arising of this that arisesthis not being so that is not from the ceasing of this

trainingThose who hold the training rules as the essence or virtue and practices right livelihood celibacy and attendance as the essence this is one endThose who say this There is no fault in sense

those who have understood these who were not in that and because of that do not conceive a conceit there is no Cycle of Sasāra to be assigned for themat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthīin Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen at that time venerable nandawent to the Fortunate Oneand after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one sideWhile sat on one side venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate OneFor as long as the Realised Ones reverend Sir do not arise in the worldthe Worthy Ones the Perfect Sambuddhasfor that long the wanderers from other

does not riseBut when the brilliant one the sun has risenThe glow worms light is destroyed and does not shine forthIn the same way the reasoners shine forthfor as long as the Perfect Sambuddhas do not arise in the worldThe reasoners are not purified nor are their disciplesof wrong view they are not released from sufferingThus I heardat one time the Fortunate One was walking on walking tour amongst the Mallaswith a great Community of monksand arrived at the brāhmaṇa village of the Mallas called ThūnaThe ascetic Gotama the son of the Sakyanswho has gone forth from the Sakyan clan is walking on walking tour amongst the Mallaswith a great Community of monks and has arrived at Thūnaand they completely filled the well to the top with grass and chaff thinkingMay these shaveling ascetics not drink our drinking waterThen the Fortunate One having gone down from the roadwent to the root of a certain treeand after going he sat down on the prepared seatWhile sat the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda sayingCome now nanda bring drinking water from that wellAfter that was said venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate OneNow the well reverend Sir has been filled to the top with grass and chaffby the brāhmaṇa householders of Thūna thinkingMay these shaveling ascetics not drink our drinking water For a second time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda sayingCome now nanda bring drinking water from that wellMay these shaveling ascetics not drink  our drinking water For a third time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda sayingCome now nanda bring drinking water from that wellYes reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate Oneand taking the bowl he went to the wellThen as venerable nanda was going to that wellall the grass and chaff was thrown away from the top of the welland it stood full of transparent undisturbed clear waterto the top so that one might think it was overflowingThen it occurred to venerable nandaSurely it is wonderful surely it is marvellousthe Realised Ones great power and great majestyin that as I was going to that wellall the grass and chaff was thrown away from the top of the welland it stood full of transparent undisturbed clear waterto the top so that one might think it was overflowingAfter taking drinking water with a bowl he went to the Fortunate Oneand after going he said this to the Fortunate OneIt is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sirthe Realised Ones great power and great majestyin that as I was going to that wellall the grass and chaff was thrown away from the top of the welland it stood full of transparent undisturbed clear waterto the top so that one might think it was overflowingPlease drink the drinking water Fortunate One Please drink the drinking water Happy OneThen the Fortunate One having understood the significance of iton that occasion uttered this exalted utteranceWhat will he do with a well  if there will be water at all timesHaving cut off craving at the root  who will go about seekingat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthīin Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen at that time amongst many monksafter returning from the almsround after the mealassembling together and sitting in the attendance hallthis conversation aroseNow venerable friends which of these two kings hasthe greater wealth the greater richesthe greater treasury the greater realmthe greater vehicles the greater strengththe greater power the greater majesty the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra or the Kosalan King PasenadiNow this conversation amongst those monks was left unfinishedThen the Fortunate One having risen from seclusion in the evening timewent to the assembly halland after going he sat down on the prepared seatHaving sat down the Fortunate One addressed the monks sayingWhat is the talk about monks amongst those who have assembled together and are sitting here at presentand what is the conversation that you left unfinishedHere reverend Sir after returning from the almsround after the mealassembling together and sitting in the attendance hallthis conversation aroseNow venerable friends which of these two kings hasthe greater wealth the greater richesthe greater treasury the greater realmthe greater vehicles the greater strengththe greater power the greater majesty the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra or the Kosalan King PasenadiThis is the conversation reverend Sir that we left unfinishedthen the Fortunate One arrivedThis is certainly not suitable monks for yousons of good family who through faith have gone forth from the home to homelessnessthat you should talk such talkWhen you have assembled together monks there are two things that you ought to dotalk about the Dhamma or maintain noble silenceThen the Fortunate One having understood the significance of iton that occasion uttered this exalted utteranceThat which is sensual happiness in the world   and that happiness which is divineTo the happiness of the destruction of craving these  are not worth a sixteenth partWhen a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understandingThen as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangle This was said But why was it said While the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī it seems a certain deity came to him in the night and in order to do away with his doubtsThe inner tangle and the outer tangle This generation is entangled in a tangleAnd so I ask of Gotama this question Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle  he asked this question Here is the meaning in brief Tangle is a term for the network of cravingFor that is a tangle in the sense of lacing together like the tangle called network of branches in bamboo thickets etc because it goes on arising again and again up and down among the objects of consciousness beginning with what is visible But it is called the inner tangle and the outer tangle because it arises as craving for ones own requisites and anothers for ones own person and anothers and for the internal and external bases for consciousnessSince it arises in this way this generation is entangled in a tangleAs the bamboos etc are entangled by the bamboo tangle etc so too this generation in other words this order of living beings is all entangled by the tangle of cravingthe meaning is that it is intertwined interlaced by itAnd because it is entangled like thisso I ask of Gotama this question that is why I ask thisHe addressed the Blessed One by his clan name as GotamaWho succeeds in disentangling this tangle who may disentangle this tangle that keeps the three kinds of existence entangled in this way What he asks is who is capable of disentangling itHowever when questioned thus the Blessed One whose knowledge of all things is unimpeded deity of deities excelling Sakka  excelling Brahmā fearless in the possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence wielder of the ten powers allseer with unobstructed knowledge in reply to explain the meaningWhen a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understandingThen as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangleuttered this stanza  Of this same verse composed by the Great SageMy task is now to set out the true sense Divided into virtue and the restRight hard to find  There are here in the Victors Dispensation Seekers gone forth from home to homelessnessof the sure straight way Comprising virtue and the other two that leads to purityHave no right knowledge And who although desiring purityWho though they strive here gain no purityTo them pure in expositionsRelying on the teaching of the dwellers In the Great Monastery let all thoseI shall expound the comforting Path Of PurificationGood men who do desire purity Listen intently to my expositionHerein purification should be understood as Nibbāna which being devoid of all stains is utterly pureThe path of purification is the path to that purificationit is the means of approach that is called the pathThe meaning is I shall expound that path of purificationIn some instances this path of purification is taught by insight aloneaccording as it is saidFormations are all impermanent When he sees thus with understandingAnd turns away from what is ill That is the path to purity And in some instances by jhāna and understandingaccording as it is saidHe is near unto Nibbāna In whom are jhāna and understanding And in some instances by deeds  etcaccording as it is saidBy deeds vision and righteousness By virtue the sublimest lifeBy these are mortals purified And not by lineage and wealth And in some instances by virtue etc according as it is saidHe who is possessed of constant virtueWho has understanding and is concentratedWho is strenuous and diligent as wellWill cross the flood so difficult to cross And in some instances by the foundations of mindfulness etc according as it is said Bhikkhus this path is the only way for the purification of beings  for the realization of Nibbāna that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness and similarly in the case of the right efforts and so onBut in the answer to this question it is taught by virtue and the other twoHere is a brief commentary on the stanza Established well in virtue standing on virtue It is only one actually fulfilling virtue who is here said to stand on virtueSo the meaning here is this being established well in virtue by fulfilling virtueA man a living beingWise possessing the kind of understanding that is born of kamma by means of a rebirthlinking with triple rootcauseDevelops consciousness and understanding develops both concentration and insight For it is concentration that is described here under the heading of consciousnessand insight under that of understandingArdent  possessing energyFor it is energy that is called ardour in the sense of burning up and consuming defilementsHe has that thus he is ardentSagacious it is understanding that is called sagacity possessing that is the meaningThis word shows protective understandingFor understanding is mentioned three times in the reply to the questionHerein the first is nave understanding the second is understanding consisting in insight while the third is the protective understanding that guides all affairsHe sees fear in the round of rebirths thus he is a bhikkhuHe succeeds in disentangling this tangle this bhikkhu who possesses the six things namely this virtue and this concentration described under the heading of consciousness and this threefold understanding and this ardourJust as a man standing on the ground and taking up a wellsharpened knife might disentangle a great tangle of bamboos so too hestanding on the ground of virtue and taking up with the hand of protectiveunderstanding exerted by the power of energy the knife of insightunderstanding wellsharpened on the stone of concentration might disentangle cut away and demolish all the tangle of craving that had overgrown his own lifes continuityBut it is at the moment of the path that he is said to be disentangling that tangleat the moment of fruition he has disentangled the tangle and is worthy of the highest offerings in the world with its deitiesThat is why the Blessed One saidWhen a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understandingThen as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangle Herein there is nothing for him to do about the nave understanding on account of which he is called wisefor that has been established in him simply by the influence of previous kammaBut the words ardent and sagacious mean that by persevering with energy of the kind here described and by acting in full awareness with understanding he should having become well established in virtue develop the serenity and insight that are described as concentration and understanding This is how the Blessed One shows the path of purification under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding thereWhat has been shown so far is the three trainings the dispensation that is good in three ways the necessary condition for the threefold clearvision etc the avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way the means to surmounting the states of loss etc the abandoning of defilements in three aspects prevention of transgression etc purification from the three kinds of defilements and the reason for the states of streamentry and so onHowHere the training of higher virtue is shown by virtue the training of higher consciousness by concentration and the training of higher understanding by understandingThe dispensations goodness in the beginning is shown by virtueBecause of the passage And what is the beginning of profitable things Virtue that is quite purified  and because of the passage beginning The not doing of any evil  virtue is the beginning of the dispensation And that is good because it brings about the special qualities of nonremorse and so onIts goodness in the middle is shown by concentrationBecause of the passage beginning Entering upon the profitable  concentration is the middle of the dispensation And that is good because it brings about the special qualities of supernormal power and so onIts goodness in the end is shown by understandingBecause of the passage The purifying of ones own mindthis is the Buddhas dispensation  and because understanding is its culmination understanding is the end of the dispensation And that is good because it brings about equipoise with respect to the desired and the undesiredJust as a solid massive rock Remains unshaken by the windSo too in face of blame and praise The wise remain immovable For this is said Likewise the necessary condition for the triple clearvision is shown by virtueFor with the support of perfected virtue one arrives at the three kinds of clear vision but nothing besides thatThe necessary condition for the six kinds of direct knowledge is shown by concentrationFor with the support of perfected concentration one arrives at the six kinds of directknowledge but nothing besides thatThe necessary condition for the categories of discrimination is shown by understandingFor with the support of perfected understanding one arrives at the four kinds of discrimination but not for any other reasonAnd the avoidance of the extreme called devotion to indulgence of sense desires is shown by virtue The avoidance of the extreme called devotion to mortification of self is shown by concentrationThe cultivation of the middle way is shown by understandingLikewise the means for surmounting the states of loss is shown by virtue the means for surmounting the element of sense desires by concentration and the means for surmounting all becoming by understandingAnd the abandoning of defilements by substitution of opposites is shown by virtue that by suppression is shown by concentration and that by cutting off is shown by understandingLikewise prevention of defilements transgression is shown by virtue prevention of obsession is shown by concentration prevention of inherent tendencies is shown by understandingAnd purification from the defilement of misconduct is shown by virtue purification from the defilement of craving by concentration and purification from the defilement of views by understandingLikewise the reason for the states of streamentry and oncereturn is shown by virtue that for the state of nonreturn by concentration that for Arahantship by understandingFor the streamenterer is called perfected in the kinds of virtue and likewise the oncereturnerBut the nonreturner is called perfected in concentrationAnd the Arahant is called perfected in understanding So thus far these nine and other like triads of special qualities have been shown that is the three trainings the dispensation that is good in three ways the necessary condition for the threefold clearvision the avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way the means for surmounting the states of loss etc the abandoning of defilements in three aspects prevention of transgression etc purification from the three kinds of defilements and the reason for the states of streamentry and so onHowever even when this path of purification is shown in this way under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding each comprising various special qualities it is still only shown extremely brieflyAnd so since that is insufficient to help all there is in order to show it in detail the following set of questions dealing in the first place with virtue What is virtue In what sense is it virtue What are its characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause What are the benefits of virtue How many kinds of virtue are there What is the defiling of it What is the cleansing of itHere are the answers WHAT IS VIRTUE It is the states beginning with volition present in one who abstains from killing living things etc or in one who fulfils the practice of the dutiesFor this is said in the Paṭisambhidā What is virtue There is virtue as volition virtue as consciousnessconcomitant virtue as restraint virtue as non transgression Herein virtue as volition is the volition present in one who abstains from killing living things etc or in one who fulfils the practice of the dutiesVirtue as consciousness concomitant is the abstinence in one who abstains from killing living things and so onFurthermore virtue as volition is the seven volitions that accompany the first seven of the ten courses of action in one who abandons the killing of living things and so onVirtue as consciousnessconcomitant is the three remaining states consisting of noncovetousness nonill will and right view stated in the way beginning Abandoning covetousness he dwells with a mind free from covetousness Virtue as restraint should be understood here as restraint in five ways restraint by the rules of the community  restraint by mindfulness restraint by knowledge restraint by patience and restraint by energyHerein restraint by the Pātimokkha is this He is furnished fully furnished with this Pātimokkha restraintRestraint by mindfulness is this He guards the eye faculty enters upon restraint of the eye faculty The currents in the world that flow Ajita said the Blessed OneAre stemmed by means of mindfulnessRestraint of currents I proclaim By understanding they are dammed Restraint by knowledge is this and use of requisites is here combined with thisBut what is called restraint by patience is that given in the way beginning He is one who bears cold and heat And what is called restraint by energy is that given in the way beginning He does not endure a thought of sense desires when it arises purification of livelihood is here combined with thisSo this fivefold restraint and the abstinence in clansmen who dread evil from any chance of transgression met with should all be understood to be virtue as restraintVirtue as nontransgression is the nontransgression by body or speech of precepts of virtue that have been undertakenThis in the first place is the answer to the question What is virtue Now as to the rest IN WHAT SENSE IS IT VIRTUE It is virtue in the sense of composing What is this composingIt is either a coordinating  meaning non inconsistency of bodily action etc due to virtuousnessor it is an upholding  meaning a state of basis owing to its serving as foundation for profitable statesFor those who understand etymology admit only these two meaningsOthers however comment on the meaning here in the way beginning The meaning of virtue is the meaning of head  the meaning of virtue is the meaning of cool  Now WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION MANIFESTATION AND PROXIMATE CAUSE HereThe characteristic of it is composing Even when analyzed in various waysAs visibility is of visible data Even when analyzed in various waysJust as visibleness is the characteristic of the visibledata base even when analyzed into the various categories of blue yellow etc because even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed visiblenessso also this same composing described above as the coordinating of bodily action etc and as the foundation of profitable states is the characteristic of virtue even when analyzed into the various categories of volition etc because even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed the state of coordination and foundationWhile such is its characteristicAction to stop misconduct then Of blamelessness in virtuous menAchievement as the quality Its function has a double senseSo what is called virtue should be understood to have the function of stopping misconduct as its function in the sense of action and a blameless function as its function in the sense of achievementFor under these headings of characteristic etc it is action or it is achievement that is called function  Now virtue so say those who know Itself as purity will showAnd for its proximate cause they tell The pair conscience and shame as wellThis virtue is manifested as the kinds of purity stated thus Bodily purity verbal purity mental purity  it is manifested comes to be apprehended as a pure stateBut conscience and shame are said by those who know to be its proximate cause its near reason is the meaningFor when conscience and shame are in existence virtue arises and persistsand when they are not it neither arises nor persistsThis is how virtues characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause should be understood WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF VIRTUE Its benefits are the acquisition of the several special qualities beginning with nonremorseFor this is said nanda profitable habits have nonremorse as their aim and nonremorse as their benefit Also it is said further Householder there are these five benefits for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtueWhat fiveHere householder one who is virtuous possessed of virtue obtains a large fortune as a consequence of diligence this is the first benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtueAgain of one who is virtuous possessed of virtue a fair name is spread abroad this is the second benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtueAgain whenever one who is virtuous possessed of virtue enters an assembly whether of khattiyas or brahmans or householders or ascetics he does so without fear or hesitation this is the third benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtueAgain one who is virtuous possessed of virtue dies unconfused this is the fourth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtueAgain one who is virtuous possessed of virtue on the breakup of the body after death reappears in a happy destiny in the heavenly world this is the fifth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue There are also the many benefits of virtue beginning with being dear and loved and ending with destruction of cankers described in the passage beginning If a bhikkhu should wish May I be dear to my fellows in the life of purity and loved by them held in respect and honoured by them let him perfect the virtues This is how virtue has as its benefits the several special qualities beginning with nonremorseFurthermoreWithout which virtue clansmen find No footing in the dispensationDare anyone a limit place On benefits that virtue bringsNo Ganges and no Yamunā No Sarabhū SarassathīOr flowing Aciravatī Or noble River of MahīIs able to wash out the stain In things that breathe here in the worldFor only virtues water can Wash out the stain in living thingsNo breezes that come bringing rain No balm of yellow sandalwoodNo necklaces beside or gems Or soft effulgence of moonbeamsCan here avail to calm and soothe Mens fevers in this world whereasThis noble this supremely cool Wellguarded virtue quells the flameWhere is there to be found the scent That can with virtues scent compareAnd that is borne against the wind As easily as with itWhere Can such another stair be found That climbs as virtue does to heavenOr yet another door that gives Onto the City of NibbānaShine as they may there are no kings Adorned with jewellery and pearlsThat shine as does a man restrained Adorned with virtues ornamentVirtue entirely does away With dread of selfblame and the likeTheir virtue to the virtuous Gives gladness always by its fameThis root of all good qualities Robs of its power every faultFrom this brief sketch it may be known How virtue brings reward and how Now here is the answer to the question HOW MANY KINDS OF VIRTUE ARE THEREFirstly all this virtue is of one kind by reason of its own characteristic of composingIt is of two kinds as keeping and avoidingLikewise as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of purity As abstinence and nonabstinence As dependent and independent As temporary and lifelong As limited and unlimited As mundane and supramundaneIt is of three kinds as inferior medium and superiorLikewise as giving precedence to self giving precedence to the world and giving precedence to the Dhamma As adhered to not adhered to and tranquillized As purified unpurified and dubious As that of the trainer that of the nontrainer and that of the neithertrainer nornontrainerIt is of four kinds as partaking of diminution of stagnation of distinction of penetrationLikewise as that of bhikkhus of bhikkhunīs of the notfullyadmitted of the laity As natural customary necessary due to previous causes As virtue of Pātimokkha restraint of restraint of sense faculties of purification of livelihood and that concerning requisitesIt is of five kinds as virtue consisting in limited purification etcfor this is said in the Paṭisambhidā Five kinds of virtue virtue consisting in limited purification virtue consisting in unlimited purification virtue consisting in fulfilled purification virtue consisting in unadheredto purification virtue consisting in tranquillized purification Likewise as abandoning refraining volition restraint and nontransgression Herein in the section dealing with that of one kind the meaning should be understood as already stated In the section dealing with that of two kinds fulfilling a training precept announced by the Blessed One thus This should be done is keepingnot doing what is prohibited by him thus This should not be done is avoidingHerein the word meaning is thisthey keep within that they proceed as people who fulfil the virtues thus it is keeping they preserve they protect they avoid thus it is avoidingHerein keeping is accomplished by faith and energy avoiding by faith and mindfulnessThis is how it is of two kinds as keeping and avoiding In the second dyad good behaviour is the best kind of behaviourGood behaviour itself is that of good behaviouror what is announced for the sake of good behaviour is that of good behaviourThis is a term for virtue other than that which has livelihood as eighth It is the initial stage of the life of purity consisting in the path thus it is that of the beginning of the life of purity This is a term for the virtue that has livelihood as eighthIt is the initial stage of the path because it has actually to be purified in the prior stage tooHence it is said But his bodily action his verbal action and his livelihood have already been purified earlier Or the training precepts called lesser and minor are that of good behaviourthe rest are that of the beginning of the life of purityOr what is included in the Double Code is that of the beginning of the life of purityand that included in the duties set out in the Khandhakas of Vinaya is that of good behaviourThrough its perfection that of the beginning of the life of purity comes to be perfectedHence it is said also that this bhikkhu shall fulfil the state consisting in the beginning of the life of purity without having fulfilled the state consisting in good behaviourthat is not possible So it is of two kinds as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of purityIn the third dyad virtue as abstinence is simply abstention from killing living things etcthe other kinds consisting in volition etc are virtue as nonabstinence So it is of two kinds as abstinence and nonabstinenceIn the fourth dyad there are two kinds of dependence dependence through craving and dependence through false viewsHerein that produced by one who wishes for a fortunate kind of becoming thus Through this virtuous conduct rite I shall become a great deity or some minor deity  is dependent through cravingThat produced through such false view about purification as Purification is through virtuous conduct is dependent through false viewBut the supramundane and the mundane that is the prerequisite for the aforesaid supramundane are independent So it is of two kinds as dependent and independent In the fifth dyad temporary virtue is that undertaken after deciding on a time limitLifelong virtue is that practiced in the same way but undertaking it for as long as life lasts So it is of two kinds as temporary and lifelongIn the sixth dyad the limited is that seen to be limited by gain fame relatives limbs or lifeThe opposite is unlimitedAnd this is said in the Paṭisambhidā What is the virtue that has a limitThere is virtue that has gain as its limit there is virtue that has fame as its limit there is virtue that has relatives as its limit there is virtue that has limbs as its limit there is virtue that has life as its limitWhat is virtue that has gain as its limitHere someone with gain as cause with gain as condition with gain as reason transgresses a training precept as undertaken that virtue has gain as its limit and the rest should be elaborated in the same wayAlso in the answer dealing with the unlimited it is said What is virtue that does not have gain as its limitHere someone does not with gain as cause with gain as condition with gain as reason even arouse the thought of transgressing a training precept as undertaken how then shall he actually transgress it That virtue does not have gain as its limit and the rest should be elaborated in the same waySo it is of two kinds as limited and unlimitedIn the seventh dyad all virtue subject to cankers is mundanethat not subject to cankers is supramundaneHerein the mundane brings about improvement in future becoming and is a prerequisite for the escape from becomingaccording as it is said Discipline is for the purpose of restraint restraint is for the purpose of non remorse nonremorse is for the purpose of gladdening gladdening is for the purpose of happiness happiness is for the purpose of tranquillity tranquillity is for the purpose of bliss bliss is for the purpose of concentration concentration is for the purpose of correct knowledge and vision correct knowledge and vision is for the purpose of dispassion dispassion is for the purpose of fading away of greed fading away is for the purpose of deliverance deliverance is for the purpose of knowledge and vision of deliverance knowledge and vision of deliverance is for the purpose of complete extinction of craving etc through not clinging Talk has that purpose counsel has that purpose support has that purpose giving ear has that purpose that is to say the liberation of the mind through not clinging The supramundane brings about the escape from becoming and is the plane of reviewing knowledge So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane In the first of the triads the inferior is produced by inferior zeal purity of consciousness energy or inquirythe medium is produced by medium zeal etcthe superior by superior That undertaken out of desire for fame is inferiorthat undertaken out of desire for the fruits of merit is mediumthat undertaken for the sake of the noble state thus This has to be done is superiorOr again that defiled by selfpraise and disparagement of others etc thus I am possessed of virtue but these other bhikkhus are illconducted and evilnatured  is inferiorundefiled mundane virtue is mediumsupramundane is superiorOr again that motivated by craving the purpose of which is to enjoy continued existence is inferiorthat practiced for the purpose of ones own deliverance is mediumthe virtue of the perfections practiced for the deliverance of all beings is superior So it is of three kinds as inferior medium and superior In the second triad that practiced out of selfregard by one who regards self and desires to abandon what is unbecoming to self is virtue giving precedence to selfThat practiced out of regard for the world and out of desire to ward off the censure of the world is virtue giving precedence to the worldThat practiced out of regard for the Dhamma and out of desire to honour the majesty of the Dhamma is virtue giving precedence to the Dhamma So it is of three kinds as giving precedence to self and so on In the third triad the virtue that in the dyads was called dependent is adheredto because it is adheredto through craving and false viewThat practiced by the magnanimous ordinary man as the prerequisite of the path and that associated with the path in trainers are notadheredtoThat associated with trainers and nontrainers fruition is tranquillized So it is of three kinds as adheredto and so on In the fourth triad that fulfilled by one who has committed no offence or has made amends after committing one is pureSo long as he has not made amends after committing an offence it is impureVirtue in one who is dubious about whether a thing constitutes an offence or about what grade of offence has been committed or about whether he has committed an offence is dubiousHerein the meditator should purify impure virtue If dubious he should avoid cases about which he is doubtful and should get his doubts cleared up In this way his mind will be kept at rest So it is of three kinds as pure and so on In the fifth triad the virtue associated with the four paths and with the first three fruitions is that of the trainerThat associated with the fruition of Arahantship is that of the nontrainerThe remaining kinds are that of the neither trainernornontrainer So it is of three kinds as that of the trainer and so onBut in the world the nature of such and such beings is called their habit of which they say This one is of happy habit  this one is of unhappy habit this one is of quarrelsome habit this one is of dandified habit Because of that it is said in the Paṭisambhidā figuratively Three kinds of virtue  profitable virtue unprofitable virtue indeterminate virtue So it is also called of three kinds as profitable and so onOf these the unprofitable is not included here since it has nothing whatever to do with the headings beginning with the characteristic which define virtue in the sense intended in this chapter So the threefoldness should be understood only in the way already stated In the first of the tetradsThe unvirtuous he cultivates He visits not the virtuousAnd in his ignorance he sees No fault in a transgression hereWith wrong thoughts often in his mind His faculties he will not guardVirtue in such a constitution Comes to partake of diminutionBut he whose mind is satisfied With virtue that has been achievedWho never thinks to stir himself And take a meditation subject upContented with mere virtuousness Nor striving for a higher stateHis virtue bears the appellation Of that partaking of stagnationBut who possessed of virtue strives With concentration for his aimThat bhikkhus virtue in its function Is called partaking of distinctionWho finds mere virtue not enough But has dispassion for his goalHis virtue through such aspiration Comes to partake of penetrationSo it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution and so on In the second tetrad there are training precepts announced for bhikkhus to keep irrespective of what is announced for bhikkhunīs This is the virtue of bhikkhusThere are training precepts announced for bhikkhunīs to keep irrespective of what is announced for bhikkhus This is the virtue of bhikkhunīsThe ten precepts of virtue for male and female novices are the virtue of the not fully admittedThe five training preceptsten when possibleas a permanent undertaking and eight as the factors of the Uposatha Day for male and female lay followers are the virtue of the laity So it is of four kinds as the virtue of bhikkhus and so on In the third tetrad the nontransgression on the part of Uttarakuru human beings is natural virtueEach clans or localitys or sects own rules of conduct are customary virtueThe virtue of the Bodhisattas mother described thus It is the necessary rule nanda that when the Bodhisatta has descended into his mothers womb no thought of men that is connected with the cords of sense desire comes to her  is necessary virtueBut the virtue of such pure beings as Mahā Kassapa etc and of the Bodhisatta in his various births is virtue due to previous causes So it is of four kinds as natural virtue and so on In the fourth tetrad The virtue described by the Blessed One thus Here a bhikkhu dwells restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint possessed of the proper conduct and resort and seeing fear in the slightest fault he trains himself by undertaking the precepts of training  is virtue of Pātimokkha restraint That described thus On seeing a visible object with the eye he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which if he left the eye faculty unguarded evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might invade him he enters upon the way of its restraint he guards the eye faculty undertakes the restraint of the eye facultyOn hearing a sound with the ear  On smelling an odour with the nose  On tasting a flavour with the tongue  On touching a tangible object with the body  On cognizing a mental object with the mind he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which if he left the mind faculty unguarded evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might invade him he enters upon the way of its restraint he guards the mind faculty undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty  is virtue of restraint of the sense faculties Abstinence from such wrong livelihood as entails transgression of the six training precepts announced with respect to livelihood and entails the evil states beginning with Scheming talking hinting belittling pursuing gain with gain is virtue of livelihood purification Use of the four requisites that is purified by the reflection stated in the way beginning Reflecting wisely he uses the robe only for protection from cold is called virtue concerning requisitesHere is an explanatory exposition together with a word commentary starting from the beginning Here in this dispensationA bhikkhu a clansman who has gone forth out of faith and is so styled because he sees fear in the round of rebirths or because he wears cloth garments that are torn and pieced together and so onRestrained with the Pātimokkha restraint here Pātimokkha is the virtue of the training preceptsfor it frees him who protects it guards it it sets him free from the pains of the states of loss etc that is why it is called PātimokkhaRestraint is restraining this is a term for bodily and verbal nontransgressionThe Pātimokkha itself as restraint is Pātimokkha restraintRestrained with the Pātimokkha restraint is restrained by means of the restraint consisting in that Pātimokkha he has it possesses it is the meaningDwells bears himself in one of the postures The meaning of possessed of the proper conduct and resort etc should be understood in the way in which it is given in the textFor this is saidPossessed of the proper conduct and resort there is proper conduct and improper conductHerein what is improper conductBodily transgression verbal transgression bodily and verbal transgressionthis is called improper conductAlso all unvirtuousness is improper conductHere someone makes a livelihood by gifts of bamboos or by gifts of leaves or by gifts of flowers fruits bathing powder and tooth sticks or by flattery or by beansoupery or by fondling or by going on errands on foot or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhasthis is called improper conductHerein what is proper conductBodily nontransgression verbal nontransgression bodily and verbal nontransgression this is called proper conductAlso all restraint through virtue is proper conductHere someone does not make a livelihood by gifts of bamboos or by gifts of leaves or by gifts of flowers fruits bathing powder and tooth sticks or by flattery or by beansoupery or by fondling or by going on errands on foot or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhasthis is called proper conductProper resort there is proper resort and improper resortHerein what is improper resortHere someone has prostitutes as resort or he has widows old maids eunuchs bhikkhunīs or taverns as resort or he dwells associated with kings kings ministers sectarians sectarians disciples in unbecoming association with laymen or he cultivates frequents honours such families as are faithless untrusting abusive and rude who wish harm wish ill wish woe wish no surcease of bondage for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs for male and female devotees this is called improper resortHerein what is proper resortHere someone does not have prostitutes as resort  or taverns as resort he does not dwell associated with kings  sectarians disciples in unbecoming association with laymen he cultivates frequents honours such families as are faithful and trusting who are a solace where the yellow cloth glows where the breeze of sages blows who wish good wish well wish joy wish surcease of bondage for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs for male and female devoteesthis is called proper resortThus he is furnished with fully furnished with provided with fully provided with supplied with possessed of endowed with this proper conduct and this proper resort Hence it is said Possessed of the proper conduct and resort Furthermore proper conduct and resort should also be understood here in the following wayfor improper conduct is twofold as bodily and verbalHerein what is bodily improper conductHere someone acts disrespectfully before the Community and he stands jostling elder bhikkhus sits jostling them stands in front of them sits in front of them sits on a high seat sits with his head covered talks standing up talks waving his arms  walks with sandals while elder bhikkhus walk without sandals walks on a high walk while they walk on a low walk walks on a walk while they walk on the ground  stands pushing elder bhikkhus sits pushing them prevents new bhikkhus from getting a seat  and in the bath house  without asking elder bhikkhus he puts wood on the stove  bolts the door  and at the bathing place he enters the water jostling elder bhikkhus enters it in front of them bathes jostling them bathes in front of them comes out jostling them comes out in front of them  and entering inside a house he goes jostling elder bhikkhus goes in front of them pushing forward he goes in front of them  and where families have inner private screened rooms in which the women of the family  the girls of the family sit there he enters abruptly and he strokes a childs head  This is called bodily improper conductHerein what is verbal improper conductHere someone acts disrespectfully before the Community Without asking elder bhikkhus he talks on the Dhammaanswers questions recites the Pātimokkha talks standing up talks waving his arms  having entered inside a house he speaks to a woman or a girl thus You so andso of suchandsuch a clan what is there Is there rice gruel Is there cooked rice Is there any hard food to eat What shall we drink What hard food shall we eat What soft food shall we eatOr what will you give me he chatters like this  This is called verbal improper conduct Proper conduct should be understood in the opposite sense to thatFurthermore a bhikkhu is respectful deferential possessed of conscience and shame wears his inner robe properly wears his upper robe properly his manner inspires confidence whether in moving forwards or backwards looking ahead or aside bending or stretching his eyes are downcast he has deportment he guards the doors of his sense faculties knows the right measure in eating is devoted to wakefulness possesses mindfulness and full awareness wants little is contented is strenuous is a careful observer of good behaviour and treats the teachers with great respect This is called conductThis firstly is how conduct should be understood resort is of three kinds resort as support resort as guarding and resort as anchoringHerein what is resort as supportA good friend who exhibits the instances of talk in whose presence one hears what has not been heard corrects what has been heard gets rid of doubt rectifies ones view and gains confidenceor by training under whom one grows in faith virtue learning generosity and understandingthis is called resort as supportWhat is resort as guardingHere A bhikkhu having entered inside a house having gone into a street goes with downcast eyes seeing the length of a plough yoke restrained not looking at an elephant not looking at a horse a carriage a pedestrian a woman a man not looking up not looking down not staring this way and that  This is called resort as guardingWhat is resort as anchoringIt is the four foundations of mindfulness on which the mind is anchoredfor this is said by the Blessed One Bhikkhus what is a bhikkhus resort his own native placeIt is these four foundations of mindfulness  This is called resort as anchoringBeing thus furnished with  endowed with this conduct and this resorthe is also on that account called one possessed of conduct and resortSeeing fear in the slightest fault  one who has the habit of seeing fear in faults of the minutest measure of such kinds as unintentional contravening of a minor training rule of the Pātimokkha or the arising of unprofitable thoughtsHe trains himself by undertaking the precepts of training whatever there is among the precepts of training to be trained in in all that he trains by taking it up rightly And here as far as the words one restrained by the Pātimokkha restraint virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is shown by discourse in terms of personsBut all that beginning with the words possessed of proper conduct and resort should be understood as said in order to show the way of practice that perfects that virtue in him who so practices it Now as regards the virtue of restraint of faculties shown next to that in the way beginning on seeing a visible object with the eye herein he is a bhikkhu established in the virtue of Pātimokkha restraintOn seeing a visible object with the eye on seeing a visible object with the eyeconsciousness that is capable of seeing visible objects and has borrowed the name eye from its instrumentBut the Ancients said The eye does not see a visible object because it has no mind The mind does not see because it has no eyes But when there is the impingement of door and object he sees by means of the consciousness that has eyesensitivity as its physical basisNow such as this is called an accessory locution  like He shot him with his bow and so onSo the meaning here is this On seeing a visible object with eyeconsciousnessApprehends neither the signs he does not apprehend the sign of woman or man or any sign that is a basis for defilement such as the sign of beauty etc he stops at what is merely seenNor the particulars he does not apprehend any aspect classed as hand foot smile laughter talk looking ahead looking aside etc which has acquired the name particular because of its particularizing defilements because of its making them manifest themselves He only apprehends what is really there Like the Elder Mahā Tissa who dwelt at CetiyapabbataIt seems that as the elder was on his way from Cetiyapabbata to Anurādhapura for alms a certain daughterinlaw of a clan who had quarrelled with her husband and had set out early from Anurādhapura all dressed up and tricked out like a celestial nymph to go to her relatives home saw him on the road and being low minded she laughed a loud laughWondering What is that the elder looked up and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness  he reached ArahantshipHence it was saidHe saw the bones that were her teeth And kept in mind his first perceptionAnd standing on that very spot The elder became an ArahantBut her husband who was going after her saw the elder and asked Venerable sir did you by any chance see a woman The elder told himWhether it was a man or woman That went by I noticed notBut only that on this high road There goes a group of bonesAs to the words through which etc the meaning is by reason of which because of which nonrestraint of the eye faculty if he if that person left the eye faculty unguarded remained with the eye door unclosed by the doorpanel of mindfulness these states of covetousness etc might invade might pursue might threaten himHe enters upon the way of its restraint he enters upon the way of closing that eye faculty by the doorpanel of mindfulnessIt is the same one of whom it is said he guards the eye faculty undertakes the restraint of the eye facultyHerein there is neither restraint nor nonrestraint in the actual eye facultysince neither mindfulness nor forgetfulness arises in dependence on eyesensitivityOn the contrary when a visible datum as object comes into the eyes focus then after the lifecontinuum has arisen twice and ceased the functional mindelement accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceasesAfter that eye consciousness with the function of seeingafter that resultant mindelement with the function of receivingafter that resultant rootcauseless mindconsciousness element with the function of investigatingafter that functional rootcauseless mindconsciousnesselement accomplishing the function of determining arises and ceases Next to that impulsion impelsHerein there is neither restraint nor non restraint on the occasion of the lifecontinuum or on any of the occasions beginning with advertingBut there is nonrestraint if unvirtuousness or forgetfulness or unknowing or impatience or idleness arises at the moment of impulsionWhen this happens it is called nonrestraint in the eye facultyWhy is thatBecause when this happens the door is not guarded nor are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive seriesLike whatJust as when a citys four gates are not secured although inside the city house doors storehouses rooms etc are secured yet all property inside the city is unguarded and unprotectedsince robbers coming in by the city gates can do as they please so too when unvirtuousness etc arise in impulsion in which there is no restraint then the door too is unguarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with advertingBut when virtue etc has arisen in it then the door too is guarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with advertingLike whatJust as when the city gates are secured although inside the city the houses etc are not secured yet all property inside the city is well guarded well protectedsince when the city gates are shut there is no ingress for robbers so too when virtue etc have arisen in impulsion the door too is guarded and so also are the lifecontinuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with advertingThus although it actually arises at the moment of impulsion it is nevertheless called restraint in the eye facultySo also as regards the phrases on hearing a sound with the ear and so onSo it is this virtue which in brief has the characteristic of avoiding apprehension of signs entailing defilement with respect to visible objects etc that should be understood as virtue of restraint of faculties Now as regards the virtue of livelihood purification mentioned above next to the virtue of restraint of the faculties  the words of the six precepts announced on account of livelihood mean of the following six training precepts announced thus With livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason one of evil wishes a prey to wishes lays claim to a higher than human state that is nonexistent not a fact the contravention of which is defeat with livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason he acts as gobetween the contravention of which is an offence entailing a meeting of the Orderwith livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason he says A bhikkhu who lives in your monastery is an Arahant the contravention of which is a serious offence in one who is aware of itwith livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason a bhikkhu who is not sick eats superior food that he has ordered for his own use the contravention of which is an offence requiring expiationWith livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason a bhikkhunī who is not sick eats superior food that she has ordered for her own use the contravention of which is an offence requiring confessionwith livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason one who is not sick eats curry or boiled rice that he has ordered for his own use the contravention of which is an offence of wrongdoing  Of these six preceptsAs regards scheming etc  this is the text Herein what is schemingIt is the grimacing grimacery scheming schemery schemedness by

material goods by means of material goods such as carrying there goods that have been got from hereor carrying here goods that have been got from there by one bent on gain honour and renown by one of evil wishes a prey to wishesthis is called pursuing gain with gainThe meaning of this text should be understood as followsFirstly as regards description of scheming on the part of one bent on gain honour and renown is on the part of one who is bent on gain on honour and on reputation on the part of one who longs for them is the meaningOf one of evil wishes of one who wants to show qualities that he has not gotA prey to wishes the meaning is of one who is attacked by themAnd after this the passage beginning or by what is called rejection of requisites is given in order to show the three instances of scheming given in the Mahāniddesa as rejection of requisites indirect talk and that based on deportmentHerein a bhikkhu is invited to accept robes etc and precisely because he wants them he refuses them out of evil wishes And then since he knows that those householders believe in him implicitly when they think Oh how few are our lords wishes He will not accept a thing  and they put fine robes etc before him by various means he then accepts making a show that he wants to be compassionate towards themit is this hypocrisy of his which becomes the cause of their subsequently bringing them even by cartloads that should be understood as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisitesFor this is said in the MahāniddesaWhat is the instance of scheming called rejection of requisitesHere householders invite bhikkhus to accept robes alms food resting place and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sickOne who is of evil wishes a prey to wishes wanting robes  alms

sick Then householders think This ascetic has few wishes is content is secluded keeps aloof from company is strenuous is a preacher of asceticismand they invite him more and more to accept robes alms food resting places and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sickHe says With three things present a faithful clansman produces much meritwith faith present a faithful clansman produces much meritwith goods to be given present a faithful clansman produces much merit with those worthy to receive present a faithful clansman produces much meritYou have faith the goods to be given are here and I am here to accept If I do not accept then you will be deprived of the merit That is no good to meRather will I accept out of compassion for youAccordingly he accepts many robeshe accepts much alms food he accepts many resting places he accepts many requisites of medicine as cure for the sickSuch grimacing grimacery scheming schemery schemedness is known as the instance of scheming called

is progressively involving people thus Lay followers formerly you used to give firstfruit alms at such a time why do you not do so now  until they say We shall give venerable sir we have had no opportunity etc entangling is what is meantOr alternatively seeing someone with sugarcane in his hand he asks Where are you coming from lay followerFrom the sugarcane field venerable sirIs the sugarcane sweet thereOne can find out by eating venerable sirIt is not allowed lay follower for bhikkhus to say Give me some sugarcane Such entangling talk from such an entangler is persuadingPersuading again and again in all ways is continual persuadingSuggesting is insinuating by specifying thus That family alone understands meif there is anything to be given there they give it

it is said They are milk cows calves venerable sir he remarks They are not milk cows calves If they were milk cows calves the bhikkhus would be getting milk etc and his getting it to the knowledge of the boys parents in this way and so making them give milk is giving indicationIndirect talk is talk that keeps near to the subjectAnd here there should be told the story of the bhikkhu supported by a familyA bhikkhu it seems who was supported by a family went into the house wanting to eat and sat downThe mistress of the house was unwilling to give On seeing him she said There is no rice and she went to a neighbours house as though to get riceThe bhikkhu went into the storeroom Looking round he saw sugarcane in the corner behind the door sugar in a bowl a string of salt fish in a basket rice in a jar and ghee in a pot He came out and sat downWhen the housewife came back she said I did not get any riceThe bhikkhu said Lay follower I saw a sign just now that alms will not be easy to get todayWhat venerable sir I saw a snake that was like sugarcane put in the corner behind the door looking for something to hit it with I saw a stone like a lump of sugar in a bowl When the snake had been hit with the clod it spread out a hood like a string of salt fish in a basket and its teeth as it tried to bite the clod were like rice grains in a jar Then the saliva mixed with poison that came out to its mouth in its fury was like ghee put in a potShe thought There is no hoodwinking the shaveling so she gave him the sugarcane and she cooked the rice and gave it all to him with the ghee the sugar and the fishSuch talk that keeps near to the subject should be understood as indirect talkRoundabout talk is talking round and round the subject as much as is allowedIn the description of belittling abusing is abusing by means of the ten instances of abuseDisparaging is contemptuous talkReproaching is enumeration of faults such as He is faithless he is an unbelieverSnubbing is taking up verbally thus Dont say that hereSnubbing in all ways giving grounds and reasons is continual snubbingOr alternatively when someone does not give taking him up thus Oh the prince of givers is snubbingand the thorough snubbing thus A mighty prince of givers  is continual snubbingRidicule is making fun of someone thus What sort of a life has this man who eats up his seed grainContinual ridicule is making fun of him more thoroughly thus What you say this man is not a giver who always gives the words There is nothing to everyone Denigration is denigrating someone by saying that he is not a giver or by censuring himAllround denigration is continual denigrationTalebearing is bearing tales from house to house from village to village from district to district thinking So they will give to me out of fear of my bearing talesBackbiting is speaking censoriously behind anothers back after speaking kindly to his facefor this is like biting the flesh of anothers back when he is not looking on the part of one who is unable to look him in the face therefore it is called backbitingThis is called belittling because it scrapes off  wipes off the virtuous qualities of others as a bamboo scraper does unguent or because it is a pursuit of gain by grinding and pulverizing others virtuous qualities like the pursuit of perfume by grinding perfumed substances that is why it is called belittlingIn the description of pursuing gain with gain pursuing is hunting afterGot from here is got from this houseThere is into that houseSeeking is wantingSeeking for is hunting afterSeeking out is hunting after again and againThe story of the bhikkhu who went round giving away the alms he had got at first to children of families here and there and in the end got milk and gruel should be told hereSearching etc are synonyms for seeking etc going in search of is seekingsearching for is seeking for searching out is seeking outand so the construction here should be understood thus This is the meaning of scheming and so onNow as regards the words The evil states beginning with  here the words beginning with should be understood to include the many evil states given in the Brahmajāla Sutta in the way beginning Or just as some worthy ascetics while eating the food given by the faithful make a living by wrong livelihood by such low arts as thesethat is to say by palmistry by fortunetelling by divining omens by interpreting dreams marks on the body holes gnawed by mice by fire sacrifice by spoon oblation  So this wrong livelihood entails the transgression of these six training precepts announced on account of livelihood and it entails the evil states beginning with Scheming talking hinting belittling pursuing gain with gain And so it is the abstinence from all sorts of wrong livelihood that is virtue of livelihood purificationthe wordmeaning of which is thison account of it they live thus it is livelihoodWhat is that It is the effort consisting in the search for requisitesPurification is purifiednessLivelihood purification is purification of livelihood As regards the next kind called virtue concerning requisites Herein reflecting wisely is reflecting as the means and as the way by knowing by reviewing is the meaningAnd here it is the reviewing stated in the way beginning For protection from cold that should be understood as reflecting wisely Herein the robe is any one of those beginning with the inner clothHe uses he employs dresses in as inner cloth or puts on as upper garmentOnly is a phrase signifying invariability in the definition of a limit of a purpose the purpose in the meditators making use of the robes is that much only namely protection from cold etc not more than thatFrom cold from any kind of cold arisen either through disturbance of elements internally or through change in temperature externallyFor protection for the purpose of warding offfor the purpose of eliminating it so that it may not arouse affliction in the bodyFor when the body is afflicted by cold the distracted mind cannot be wisely exerted That is why the Blessed One permitted the robe to be used for protection from coldSo in each instanceexcept that from heat means from the heat of firethe origin of which should be understood as forest fires and so onFrom contact with gadflies and flies wind and burning and creeping things here gadflies are flies that bite they are also called blind fliesFlies are just fliesWind is distinguished as that with dust and that without dustBurning is burning of the sunCreeping things are any long creatures such as snakes and so on that move by crawling Contact with them is of two kinds contact by being bitten and contact by being touched And that does not worry him who sits with a robe on So he uses it for the purpose of protection from such thingsOnly the word is repeated in order to define a subdivision of the invariable purpose for the concealment of the private parts is an invariable purpose the others are purposes periodicallyHerein private parts are any parts of the pudendumFor when a member is disclosed conscience is disturbed  offended It is called private parts because of the disturbance of conscience For the purpose of concealing the private parts for the purpose of the concealment of those private partsAs well as the reading hirikopīnapaṭicchādanatthaṃ there is a reading hirikopīnaṃ paṭicchādanatthaṃ Alms food is any sort of foodFor any sort of nutriment is called alms food because of its having been dropped into a bhikkhus bowl during his alms round Or alms food is the dropping of the lumps  it is the concurrence  the collection of alms obtained here and there is what is meantNeither for amusement neither for the purpose of amusement as with village boys etc for the sake of sport is what is meantNor for intoxication not for the purpose of intoxication as with boxers etc for the sake of intoxication with strength and for the sake of intoxication with manhood is what is meantNor for smartening not for the purpose of smartening as with royal concubines courtesans etc for the sake of plumpness in all the limbs is what is meantNor for embellishment not for the purpose of embellishment as with actors dancers etc for the sake of a clear skin and complexion is what is meant And here the clause neither for amusement is stated for the purpose of abandoning support for delusionnor for intoxication is said for the purpose of abandoning support for hatenor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the purpose of abandoning support for greedAnd neither for amusement nor for intoxication is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for oneselfNor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for anotherAnd the abandoning of both unwise practice and devotion to indulgence of sense pleasures should be understood as stated by these fourOnly has the meaning already statedOf this body of this material body consisting of the four great primariesFor the endurance for the purpose of continued enduranceAnd continuance for the purpose of not interrupting lifes continued occurrence or for the purpose of endurance for a long timeHe makes use of the alms food for the purpose of the endurance for the purpose of the continuance of the body as the owner of an old house uses props for his house and as a carter uses axle grease not for the purpose of amusement intoxication smartening and embellishmentFurthermore endurance is a term for the life faculty So what has been said as far as the words for the endurance and continuance of this body can be understood to mean for the purpose of maintaining the occurrence of the life faculty in this body For the ending of discomfort hunger is called discomfort in the sense of afflictingHe makes use of alms food for the purpose of ending that like anointing a wound like counteracting heat with cold and so onFor assisting the life of purity for the purpose of assisting the life of purity consisting in the whole dispensation and the life of purity consisting in the pathFor while this bhikkhu is engaged in crossing the desert of existence by means of devotion to the three trainings depending on bodily strength whose necessary condition is the use of alms food he makes use of it to assist the life of purity just as those seeking to cross the desert used their childs flesh just as those seeking to cross a river use a raft and just as those seeking to cross the ocean use a shipThus I shall put a stop to old feelings and shall not arouse new feelings thus as a sick man uses medicine he uses alms food thinking By use of this alms food I shall put a stop to the old feeling of hunger and I shall not arouse a new feeling by immoderate eating like one of the proverbial brahmans that is one who eats till he has to be helped up by hand or till his clothes will not meet or till he rolls there on the ground or till crows can peck from his mouth or until he vomits what he has eatenOr alternatively there is that which is called old feelings because being conditioned by former kamma it arises now in dependence on unsuitable immoderate eatingI shall put a stop to that old feeling forestalling its condition by suitable moderate eatingAnd there is that which is called new feeling because it will arise in the future in dependence on the accumulation of kamma consisting in making improper use of the requisite of alms food nowI shall also not arouse that new feeling avoiding by means of proper use the production of its root This is how the meaning should be understood hereWhat has been shown so far can be understood to include proper use of requisites abandoning of devotion to selfmortification and not giving up lawful bliss And I shall be healthy In this body which exists in dependence on requisites I shall by moderate eating have health called long endurance since there will be no danger of severing the life faculty or interrupting the continuity of the postures  Reflecting in this way he makes use of the alms food as a sufferer from a chronic disease does of his medicineAnd blameless and live in comfort  he makes use of them thinking I shall have blamelessness by avoiding improper search acceptance and eating and I shall have a comfortable abiding by moderate eatingOr he does so thinking I shall have blamelessness due to absence of such faults as boredom sloth sleepiness blame by the wise etc that have unseemly immoderate eating as their condition and I shall have a comfortable abiding by producing bodily strength that has seemly moderate eating as its conditionOr he does so thinking I shall have blamelessness by abandoning the pleasure of lying down lolling and torpor through refraining from eating as much as possible to stuff the belly and I shall have a comfortable abiding by controlling the four postures through eating four or five mouthfuls less than the maximumFor this is saidWith four or five lumps still to eat Let him then end by drinking waterFor energetic bhikkhus needs This should suffice to live in comfort Now what has been shown at this point can be understood as discernment of purpose and practice of the middle wayResting place  this is the bed and seat For wherever one sleeps  whether in a monastery or in a leanto etc that is the bed wherever one seats oneself  sits  that is the seat Both together are called restingplace For the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and enjoying retreat the climate itself in the sense of imperilling is perils of climate Unsuitable climatic conditions that cause mental distraction due to bodily affliction can be warded off by making use of the resting place it is for the purpose of warding off these and for the purpose of the pleasure of solitude is what is meantOf course the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by the phrase protection from cold etc toobut just as in the case of making use of the robes the concealment of the private parts is stated as an invariable purpose while the others are periodical purposes so here also this last should be understood as mentioned with reference to the invariable warding off of the perils of climateOr alternatively this climate of the kind stated is just climatebut perils are of two kinds evident perils and concealed perils Herein evident perils are lions tigers etcwhile concealed perils are greed hate and so onWhen a bhikkhu knows and reflects thus in making use of the kind of resting place where these perils do not owing to unguarded doors and sight of unsuitable visible objects etc cause affliction he can be understood as one who reflecting wisely makes use of the resting place for the purpose of warding off the perils of climateThe requisite of medicine as cure for the sick here cure is in the sense of going against illness in the sense of countering is the meaningThis is a term for any suitable remedyIt is the medical mans work because it is permitted by him thus it is medicine Or the cure for the sick itself as medicine is medicine as cure for the sick  Any work of a medical man such as oil honey ghee etc that is suitable for one who is sick is what is meantA requisite  however in such passages as It is well supplied with the requisites of a city is equipmentin such passages as The chariot has the requisite of virtue the axle of jhāna the wheel of energy it is an ornamentin such passages as The requisites for the life of one who has gone into homelessness that should be available  it is an accessoryBut here both equipment and accessory are applicableFor that medicine as a cure for the sick is equipment for maintaining life because it protects by preventing the arising of affliction destructive to lifeand it is an accessory too because it is an instrument for prolonging life That is why it is called requisiteSo it is medicine as cure for the sick and that is a requisite thus it is a requisite of medicine as cure for the sickHe makes use of that requisite of medicine as cure for the sickany requisite for life consisting of oil honey molasses ghee etc that is allowed by a medical man as suitable for the sick is what is meantFrom arisen from born become producedHurtful here hurt  is a disturbance of elements and it is the leprosy tumours boils etc originated by that disturbanceHurtful because arisen in the form of hurt Feelings painful feelings feelings resulting from unprofitable kammafrom those hurtful feelingsFor complete immunity from affliction for complete freedom from painso that all that is painful is abandoned is the meaningThis is how this virtue concerning requisites should be understood In brief its characteristic is the use of requisites after wise reflectionThe wordmeaning here is this because breathing things go  move proceed using what they use in dependence on these robes etc these robes etc are therefore called requisites concerning requisites is concerning those requisites So in this fourfold virtue Pātimokkha restraint has to be undertaken by means of faithFor that is accomplished by faith since the announcing of training precepts is outside the disciples provinceand the evidence here is the refusal of the request to allow disciples to announce training precepts Having therefore undertaken through faith the training precepts without exception as announced one should completely perfect them without regard for lifeFor this is saidAs a hen guards her eggs Or as a yak her tailOr like a darling child Or like an only eyeSo you who are engaged Your virtue to protectBe prudent at all times And ever scrupulousAlso it is said further So too sire when a training precept for disciples is announced by me my disciples do not transgress it even for the sake of life And the story of the elders bound by robbers in the forest should be understood in this senseIt seems that robbers in the Mahāvaṭṭanī Forest bound an elder with black creepers and made him lie downWhile he lay there for seven days he augmented his insight and after reaching the fruition of nonreturn he died there and was reborn in the BrahmāworldAlso they bound another elder in Tambapaṇṇi Island with string creepers and made him lie downWhen a forest fire came and the creepers were not cut he established insight and attained Nibbāna simultaneously with his deathWhen the Elder Abhaya a preacher of the Dīgha Nikāya passed by with five hundred bhikkhus he saw what had happened and he had the elders body cremated and a shrine builtTherefore let other clansmen alsoMaintain the rules of conduct pure Renouncing life if there be needRather than break virtues restraint By the Worlds Saviour decreed And as Pātimokkha restraint is undertaken out of faith so restraint of the sense faculties should be undertaken with mindfulnessFor that is accomplished by mindfulness because when the sense faculties functions are founded on mindfulness there is no liability to invasion by covetousness and the restSo recollecting the Fire Discourse which begins thus Better bhikkhus the extirpation of the eye faculty by a redhot burning blazing glowing iron spike than the apprehension of signs in the particulars of visible objects cognizable by the eye  this restraint should be properly undertaken by preventing with unremitting mindfulness any apprehension in the objective fields consisting of visible data etc of any signs etc likely to encourage covetousness etc to invade consciousness occurring in connection with the eye door and so on When not undertaken thus virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is unenduring it does not last like a crop not fenced in with branchesAnd it is raided by the robber defilements as a village with open gates is by thievesAnd lust leaks into his mind as rain does into a badlyroofed houseFor this is saidAmong the visible objects sounds and smellsAnd tastes and tangibles guard the facultiesFor when these doors are open and unguardedThen thieves will come and raid as twere a village And just as with an illroofed house The rain comes leaking in so tooWill lust come leaking in for sure Upon an undeveloped mind  When it is undertaken thus virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is enduring it lasts like a crop well fenced in with branchesAnd it is not raided by the robber defilements as a village with wellguarded gates is not by thievesAnd lust does not leak into his mind as rain does not into a wellroofed houseFor this is saidAmong the visible objects sounds and smellsAnd tastes and tangibles guard the facultiesFor when these doors are closed and truly guardedThieves will not come and raid as twere a village And just as with a wellroofed house No rain comes leaking in so tooNo lust comes leaking in for sure Upon a welldeveloped mind  This however is the teaching at its very highestThis mind is called quickly transformed  so restraint of the faculties should be undertaken by removing arisen lust with the contemplation of foulness as was done by the Elder Vaṅgīsa soon after he had gone forthAs the elder was wandering for alms it seems soon after going forth lust arose in him on seeing a womanThereupon he said to the venerable nandaI am afire with sensual lust And burning flames consume my mindIn pity tell me Gotama How to extinguish it for good The elder saidYou do perceive mistakenly That burning flames consume your mindLook for no sign of beauty there For that it is which leads to lustSee foulness there and keep your mind Harmoniously concentratedFormations see as alien As ill not self so this great lustMay be extinguished and no more Take fire thus ever and again The elder expelled his lust and then went on with his alms roundMoreover a bhikkhu who is fulfilling restraint of the faculties should be like the Elder Cittagutta resident in the Great Cave at Kuraṇḍaka and like the Elder Mahā Mitta resident at the Great Monastery of CorakaIn the Great Cave of Kuraṇḍaka it seems there was a lovely painting of the Renunciation of the Seven Buddhas A number of bhikkhus wandering about among the dwellings saw the painting and said What a lovely painting venerable sir The elder said For more than sixty years friends I have lived in the cave and I did not know whether there was any painting there or notNow today I know it through those who have eyes The elder it seems though he had lived there for so long had never raised his eyes and looked up at the caveAnd at the door of his cave there was a great ironwood treeAnd the elder had never looked up at that eitherHe knew it was in flower when he saw its petals on the ground each year The king heard of the elders great virtues and he sent for him three times desiring to pay homage to him When the elder did not go he had the breasts of all the women with infants in the town bound and sealed off saying As long as the elder does not come let the children go without milkOut of compassion for the children the elder went to MahāgāmaWhen the king heard that he had come he said Go and bring the elder in I shall take the precepts Having had him brought up into the inner palace he paid homage to him and provided him with a meal Then saying Today venerable sir there is no opportunity I shall take the precepts tomorrow he took the elders bowl After following him for a little he paid homage with the queen and turned backwhether it was the king who paid homage or whether it was the queen the elder said May the king be happyAs seven days went by thus  Bhikkhus asked Why is it venerable sir that whether it is the king who pays the homage or the queen you say May the king be happy The elder replied Friends I do not notice whether it is the king or the queen At the end of seven days when it was found that the elder was not happy living there he was dismissed by the king He went back to the Great Cave at Kuraṇḍaka When it was night he went out onto his walkA deity who dwelt in the ironwood tree stood by with a torch of sticksThen his meditation subject became quite clear and plainThe elder thinking How clear my meditation subject is today  was glad and immediately after the middle watch he reached Arahantship making the whole rock resound So when another clansman seeks his own goodLet him not be hungryeyed Like a monkey in the grovesLike a wild deer in the woods Like a nervous little childLet him go with eyes downcast Seeing a plough yokes length beforeThat he fall not in the power Of the forestmonkey mind The Elder Mahā Mittas mother was sick with a poisoned tumour She told her daughter who as a bhikkhunī had also gone forthplienmatchesvisudhijson        en Lady go to your brother Tell him my trouble and bring back some medicine She went and told himThe elder said I do not know how to gather root medicines and such things and concoct a medicine from them But rather I will tell you a medicine since I went forth I have not broken my virtue of restraint of the sense faculties by looking at the bodily form of the opposite sex with a lustful mind By this declaration of truth may my mother get well Go and tell the lay devotee and rub her bodyShe went and told her what had happened and then did as she had been instructedAt that very moment the lay devotees tumour vanished shrinking away like a lump of froth She got up and uttered a cry of joy If the Fully Enlightened One were still alive why should he not stroke with his netadorned hand the head of a bhikkhu like my sonSo Let another noble clansman Gone forth in the DispensationKeep as did the Elder Mitta Perfect faculty restraint As restraint of the faculties is to be undertaken by means of mindfulness so livelihood purification is to be undertaken by means of energyFor that is accomplished by energy because the abandoning of wrong livelihood is effected in one who has rightly applied energyAbandoning therefore unbefitting wrong search this should be undertaken with energy by means of the right kind of search consisting in going on alms round etc avoiding what is of impure origin as though it were a poisonous snake and using only requisites of pure originHerein for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices any requisites obtained from the Community from a group of bhikkhus or from laymen who have confidence in his special qualities of teaching the Dhamma etc are called of pure originBut those obtained on alms round etc are of extremely pure originFor one who has taken up the ascetic practices those obtained on alms round etc andas long as this is in accordance with the rules of the ascetic practicesfrom people who have confidence in his special qualities of asceticism are called of pure originAnd if he has got putrid urine with mixed gall nuts and foursweets for the purpose of curing a certain affliction and he eats only the broken gall nuts thinking Other companions in the life of purity will eat the foursweets his undertaking of the ascetic practices is befittingfor he is then called a bhikkhu who is supreme in the Noble Ones heritages  As to the robe and the other requisites no hint indication roundabout talk or intimation about robes and alms food is allowable for a bhikkhu who is purifying his livelihoodBut a hint indication or roundabout talk about a resting place is allowable for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices Herein a hint is when one who is getting the preparing of the ground etc done for the purpose of making a resting place is asked What is being done venerable sir Who is having it done  and he replies No one or any other such giving of hintsAn indication is saying Lay follower where do you liveIn a mansion venerable sirBut lay follower a mansion is not allowed for bhikkhus Or any other such giving of indicationRoundabout talk is saying The resting place for the Community of Bhikkhus is crowded or any other such oblique talk All however is allowed in the case of medicineBut when the disease is cured is it or is it not allowed to use the medicine obtained in this wayHerein the Vinaya specialists say that the opening has been given by the Blessed One therefore it is allowableBut the Suttanta specialists say that though there is no offence nevertheless the livelihood is sullied therefore it is not allowable But one who does not use hints indications roundabout talk or intimation though these are permitted by the Blessed One and who depends only on the special qualities of fewness of wishes etc and makes use only of requisites obtained otherwise than by indication etc even when he thus risks his life is called supreme in living in effacement like the venerable Sāriputta It seems that the venerable one was cultivating seclusion at one time living in a certain forest with the Elder Mahā Moggallāna One day an affliction of colic arose in him causing him great painIn the evening the Elder Mahā Moggallāna went to attend upon him Seeing him lying down he asked what the reason was And then he asked What used to make you better formerly friendThe elder said When I was a layman friend my mother used to mix ghee honey sugar and so on and give me rice gruel with pure milk That used to make me betterThen the other said So be it friend If either you or I have merit perhaps tomorrow we shall get some Now a deity who dwelt in a tree at the end of the walk overheard their conversation Thinking I will find rice gruel for the lord tomorrow he went meanwhile to the family who was supporting the elder and entered into the body of the eldest son causing him discomfortThen he told the assembled relatives the price of the cure If you prepare rice gruel of such a kind tomorrow for the elder I will set this one freeThey said Even without being told by you we regularly supply the elders needs and on the following day they prepared rice gruel of the kind neededThe Elder Mahā Moggallāna came in the morning and said Stay here friend till I come back from the alms round Then he went into the villageThose people met him They took his bowl filled it with the stipulated kind of rice gruel and gave it back to himThe elder made as though to gobut they said Eat venerable sir we shall give you more When the elder had eaten they gave him another bowlfulThe elder left Bringing the alms food to the venerable Sāriputta he said Here friend Sāriputta eatWhen the elder saw it he thought The gruel is very nice How was it got  and seeing how it had been obtained he said Friend the alms food cannot be used Instead of thinking He does not eat alms food brought by the likes of me the other at once took the bowl by the rim and turned it over on one sideAs the rice gruel fell on the ground the elders affliction vanished From then on it did not appear again during fortyfive yearsThen he said to the venerable Mahā Moggallāna Friend even if ones bowels come out and trail on the ground it is not fitting to eat gruel got by verbal intimationand he uttered this exclamationThe honey and the gruel obtained By influence of verbal hintsIf I were to consent to eat My livelihood might well be blamedAnd even if my bowels obtrude And trail outside and even thoughMy life is to be jeopardized I will not blot my livelihood For I will satisfy my heart By shunning all wrong kinds of searchAnd never will I undertake The search the Buddhas have condemned And here too should be told the story of the Elder Mahā Tissa the Mango eater who lived at Cīragumba So in all respectsAnd seeing clearly give no thought To any search that is not goodA man who has gone forth in faith Should purify his livelihood And as livelihood purification is to be undertaken by means of energy so virtue dependent on requisites is to be undertaken by means of understandingFor that is accomplished by understanding because one who possesses understanding is able to see the advantages and the dangers in requisitesSo one should abandon greed for requisites and undertake that virtue by using requisites obtained lawfully and properly after reviewing them with understanding in the way aforesaid Herein reviewing is of two kinds at the time of receiving requisites and at the time of using themFor use is blameless in one who at the time of receiving robes etc reviews them either as mere elements or as repulsive and puts them aside for later use and in one who reviews them thus at the time of using them Here is an explanation to settle the matterThere are four kinds of use use as theft use as a debt  use as an inheritance use as a masterHerein use by one who is unvirtuous and makes use of requisites even sitting in the midst of the Community is called use as theftUse without reviewing by one who is virtuous is use as a debttherefore the robe should be reviewed every time it is used and the alms food lump by lump One who cannot do this should review it before the meal after the meal in the first watch in the middle watch and in the last watchIf dawn breaks on him without his having reviewed it he finds himself in the position of one who has used it as a debtAlso the resting place should be reviewed each time it is usedRecourse to mindfulness both in the accepting and the use of medicine is properbut while this is so though there is an offence for one who uses it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance there is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness Purification is of four kinds purification by the Teaching purification by restraint purification by search and purification by reviewingHerein virtue of the Pātimokkha restraint is called purification by the Teaching for that is so called because it purifies by means of teachingVirtue of restraint of faculties is called purification by restraintfor that is so called because it purifies by means of the restraint in the mental resolution I shall not do so againVirtue of livelihood purification is called purification by searchfor that is so called because search is purified in one who abandons wrong search and gets requisites lawfully and properlyVirtue dependent on requisites is called purification by reviewingfor that is so called because it purifies by the reviewing of the kind already describedHence it was said above  There is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness Use of the requisites by the seven kinds of trainers is called use as an inheritancefor they are the Buddhas sons therefore they make use of the requisites as the heirs of requisites belonging to their fatherBut how then is it the Blessed Ones requisites or the laitys requisites that are usedAlthough given by the laity they actually belong to the Blessed One because it is by the Blessed One that they are permitted That is why it should be understood that the Blessed Ones requisites are usedThe confirmation here is in the Dhammadāyāda Sutta Use by those whose cankers are destroyed is called use as a masterfor they make use of them as masters because they have escaped the slavery of craving As regards these kinds of use use as a master and use as an inheritance are allowable for allUse as a debt is not allowableto say nothing of use as theftBut this use of what is reviewed by one who is virtuous is use freed from debt because it is the opposite of use as a debt or is included in use as an inheritance tooFor one possessed of virtue is called a trainer too because of possessing this training As regards these three kinds of use since use as a master is best when a bhikkhu undertakes virtue dependent on requisites he should aspire to that and use them after reviewing them in the way describedAnd this is saidOf alms food and of dwelling And of a resting placeAnd also of the water For washing dirt from robesWho listens to the Dhamma As taught by the Sublime OneThe truly wise disciple Makes use after reviewing By alms food and by dwelling And by a resting placeAnd also by the water For washing dirt from robesunsullied By any of these mattersA bhikkhu is like a drop of water Lying on leaves of lotusSince aid it is and timely Procured from anotherIn chewing and in eating In tasting food besidesThe right amount he reckons Mindful without remittingHe treats it as an ointment Applied upon a woundSo like the childs flesh in the desert Like the greasing for the axleHe should eat without delusion Nutriment to keep alive And in connection with the fulfilling of this virtue dependent on requisites there should be told the story of the novice Saṅgharakkhita the NephewFor he made use of requisites after reviewingaccording as it is saidSeeing me eat a dish of rice Quite cold my preceptor observedNovice if you are not restrained Be careful not to burn your tongueOn hearing my Preceptors words I then and there felt urged to actAnd sitting in a single session I reached the goal of ArahantshipSince I am now waxed full in thought Like the full moon of the fifteenth And all my cankers are destroyed There is no more becoming nowAnd so should any other man Aspiring to end sufferingMake use of all the requisites Wisely after reviewing themSo virtue is of four kinds as virtue of Pātimokkha restraint and so on In the first pentad in the fivefold section the meaning should be understood in accordance with the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order and so onFor this is said in the Paṭisambhidā What is virtue consisting in limited purificationThat of the training precepts for those not fully admitted to the Order such is virtue consisting in limited purification What is virtue consisting in unlimited purificationThat of the training precepts for those fully admitted to the Order such is virtue consisting in unlimited purification What is virtue consisting in fulfilled purificationThat of magnanimous ordinary men devoted to profitable things who are perfecting the course that ends in trainership regardless of the physical body and life having given up attachment to life such is virtue of fulfilled purification What is virtue consisting in purification not adhered toThat of the seven kinds of trainer such is virtue consisting in purification not adhered to What is virtue consisting in tranquillized purificationThat of the Perfect Ones disciples with cankers destroyed of the Paccekabuddhas of the Perfect Ones accomplished and fully enlightened such is virtue consisting in tranquillized purification  Herein the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order should be understood as virtue consisting in limited purification because it is limited by the number of training precepts that is five or eight or ten That of those fully admitted to the Order is describable thusNine thousand millions and a hundred And eighty millions then as wellAnd fifty plus a hundred thousand And thirtysix again to swellThe total restraint disciplines These rules the Enlightened One explainsTold under heads for filling out Which the Discipline restraint containsSo although limited in number it should yet be understood as virtue consisting in unlimited purification since it is undertaken without reserve and has no obvious limit such as gain fame relatives limbs or life Like the virtue of the Elder Mahā Tissa the Mangoeater who lived at Cīragumba  For that venerable one never abandoned the following good mans recollectionWealth for a sound limbs sake should be renounced And one who guards his life gives up his limbsAnd wealth and limbs and life each one of these A man gives up who practices the DhammaAnd he never transgressed a training precept even when his life was in the balance and in this way he reached Arahantship with that same virtue of unlimited purification as his support while he was being carried on a lay devotees backAccording to as it is saidNor your mother nor your father Nor your relatives and kinHave done as much as this for you Because you are possessed of virtueSo stirred with urgency and wisely Comprehending with insightWhile carried on his helpers back He reached the goal of Arahantship The magnanimous ordinary mans virtue which from the time of admission to the Order is devoid even of the stain of a wrong thought because of its extreme purity like a gem of purest water like wellrefined gold becomes the proximate cause for Arahantship itself which is why it is called consisting of fulfilled purification like that of the lders Saṅgharakkhita the Great and Saṅgharakkhita the Nephew The Elder Saṅgharakkhita the Great  aged over sixty was lying it seems on his deathbed The Order of Bhikkhus questioned him about attainment of the supramundane stateThe elder said I have no supramundane stateThen the young bhikkhu who was attending on him said Venerable sir people have come as much as twelve leagues thinking that you have reached Nibbāna It will be a disappointment for many if you die as an ordinary man Friend thinking to see the Blessed One Metteyya I did not try for insightSo help me to sit up and give me the chanceHe helped the elder to sit up and went outAs he went out the elder reached Arahantship and he gave a sign by snapping his fingersThe Order assembled and said to him Venerable sir you have done a difficult thing in achieving the supramundane state in the hour of deathThat was not difficult friends But rather I will tell you what is difficult Friends I see no action done by me without mindfulness and unknowingly since the time I went forthHis nephew also reached Arahantship in the same way at the age of fifty years Now if a man has little learning And he is careless of his virtueThey censure him on both accounts For lack of virtue and of learningBut if he is of little learning Yet he is careful of his virtueThey praise him for his virtue so It is as though he too had learningAnd if he is of ample learning Yet he is careless of his virtueThey blame him for his virtue so It is as though he had no learningBut if he is of ample learning And he is careful of his virtueThey give him praise on both accounts For virtue and as well for learningThe Buddhas pupil of much learning Who keeps the Law with understandingA jewel of Jambu River gold Who is here fit to censure himDeities praise him constantly By Brahmā also is he praised  What should be understood as virtue consisting in purification not adhered to is trainers virtue because it is not adhered to by false view and ordinary mens virtue when not adhered to by greed Like the virtue of the Elder Tissa the Landowners Son Wanting to become established in Arahantship in dependence on such virtue this venerable one told his enemiesI broke the bones of both my legs To give the pledge you asked from meI am revolted and ashamed At death accompanied by greedAnd after I had thought on this And wisely then applied insightWhen the sun rose and shone on me I had become an Arahant  Also there was a certain senior elder who was very ill and unable to eat with his own hand He was writhing smeared with his own urine and excrement Seeing him a certain young bhikkhu said Oh what a painful process life isThe senior elder told him If I were to die now friend I should obtain the bliss of heaven I have no doubt of that But the bliss obtained by breaking this virtue would be like the lay state obtained by disavowing the training and he added I shall die together with my virtue As he lay there he comprehended that same illness with insight and he reached Arahantship Having done so he pronounced these verses to the Order of BhikkhusI am victim of a sickening diseaseThat racks me with its burden of cruel painSo this my corpse will soon have withered upAs flowers in the dust burnt by the sunUnbeautiful called beautiful Unclean while reckoned as if cleanThough full of ordure seeming fair To him that cannot see it clearSo out upon this ailing rotting body Fetid and filthy punished with afflictionDoting on which this silly generation Has lost the way to be reborn in heaven  It is the virtue of the Arahants etc that should be understood as tranquillized purification because of tranquillization of all disturbance and because of purifiednessSo it is of five kinds as consisting in limited purification and so on In the second pentad the meaning should be understood as the abandoning etc of killing living things etcfor this is said in the PaṭisambhidāFive kinds of virtue In the case of killing living things abandoning is virtue abstention is virtue volition is virtue restraint is virtue non transgression is virtue In the case of taking what is not given  In the case of sexual misconduct  In the case of false speech  In the case of malicious speech  In the case of harsh speech  In the case of gossip  In the case of covetousness  In the case of ill will  In the case of wrong view  Through renunciation in the case of lust abandoning is virtue  Through nonillwill in the case of illwill  Through perception of light in the case of stiffnessandtorpor  Through nondistraction  agitation  Through definition of states  uncertainty  Through knowledge  ignorance  Through gladdening in the case of boredom  Through the first jhāna in the case of the hindrances abandoning is virtue  Through the second jhāna  applied and sustained thought  Through the third jhāna  happiness  Through the fourth jhāna in the case of pleasure and pain abandoning is virtue  Through the attainment of the base consisting of boundless space in the case of perceptions of matter perceptions of resistance and perceptions of variety abandoning is virtue  Through the attainment of the base consisting of boundless consciousness in the case of the perception of the base consisting of boundless space  Through the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness in the case of the perception of the base consisting of boundless consciousness  Through the attainment of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception in the case of the perception of the base consisting of nothingness  Through the contemplation of impermanence in the case of the perception of permanence abandoning is virtue  Through the contemplation of pain in the case of the perception of pleasure  Through the contemplation of notself in the case of the perception of self  Through the contemplation of dispassion in the case of the perception of delighting  Through the contemplation of fading away in the case of greed  Through the contemplation of cessation in the case of originating  Through the contemplation of relinquishment in the case of grasping  Through the contemplation of destruction in the case of the perception of compactness abandoning is virtue  Through the contemplation of fall of formations in the case of accumulating kamma  Through the contemplation of change in the case of the perception of lastingness  Through the contemplation of the signless in the case of a sign  Through the contemplation of the desireless in the case of desire  Through the contemplation of voidness in the case of misinterpreting  Through insight into states that is higher understanding in the case of misinterpreting due to grasping  Through correct knowledge and vision in the case of misinterpreting due to confusion  Through the contemplation of danger in the case of misinterpreting due to reliance on formations  Through reflection in the case of nonreflection  Through the contemplation of turning away in the case of misinterpreting due to bondage  Through the path of streamentry in the case of defilements coefficient with false view abandoning is virtue  Through the path of oncereturn in the case of gross defilements  Through the path of nonreturn in the case of residual defilements  Through the path of Arahantship in the case of all defilements abandoning is virtue abstention is virtue volition is virtue restraint is virtue nontransgression is virtue Such virtues lead to nonremorse in the mind to gladdening to happiness to tranquillity to joy to repetition to development to cultivation to embellishment to the requisite for concentration to the equipment of concentration to fulfilment to complete dispassion to fading away to cessation to peace to directknowledge to enlightenment to NibbānaAnd here there is no state called abandoning other than the mere nonarising of the killing of living things etc as statedBut the abandoning of a given unprofitable state upholds a given profitable state in the sense of providing a foundation for it and concentrates it by preventing waveringso it is called virtue in the sense of composing  reckoned as upholding and concentrating as stated earlier The other four things mentioned refer to the presence of occurrence of will as abstention from such and such as restraint of such and such as the volition associated with both of these and as nontransgression in one who does not transgress such and suchBut their meaning of virtue has been explained alreadySo it is of five kinds as virtue consisting in abandoning and so on At this point What is virtueIn what sense is it virtueWhat are its characteristic function manifestation and proximate causeWhat are the benefits of virtueHow many kinds of virtue are therethe answers to the questions are complete However it was also asked WHAT IS THE DEFILING OF IT and WHAT IS THE CLEANSING OF ITWe answer that virtues tornness etc is its defiling and that its untornness etc is its cleansingNow that tornness etc are comprised under the breach that has gain fame etc as its cause and under the seven bonds of sexualityWhen a man has broken the training course at the beginning or at the end in any instance of the seven classes of offences his virtue is called torn like a cloth that is cut at the edgeBut when he has broken it in the middle it is called rent like a cloth that is rent in the middleWhen he has broken it twice or thrice in succession it is called blotched like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with a discrepant colour appearing on the back or the bellyWhen he has broken it all over at intervals it is called mottled like a cow speckled all over with discrepant coloured spots at intervalsThis in the first place is how there comes to be tornness with the breach that has gain etc as its causeAnd likewise with the seven bonds of sexualityfor this is said by the Blessed OneHere brahman some ascetic or brahman claims to lead the life of purity rightly for he does not enter into actual sexual intercourse with women Yet he agrees to massage manipulation bathing and rubbing down by women He enjoys it desires it and takes satisfaction in it This is what is torn rent blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of purityThis man is said to lead a life of purity that is unclean As one who is bound by the bond of sexuality he will not be released from birthageing and death  he will not be released from suffering I say Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these thingsyet he jokes plays and amuses himself with women  Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these thingsyet he gazes and stares at women eye to eye  Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these thingsyet he listens to the sound of women through a wall or through a fence as they laugh or talk or sing or weep  Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these things yet herecalls laughs and talks and games that he formerly had with women  Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these thingsyet he sees a householder or a householders son possessed of endowed with and indulging in the five cords of sense desire  Furthermore brahman while he does not agree to these thingsyet he leads the life of purity aspiring to some order of deities thinking Through this rite or this ritual or this asceticism I shall become a great deity or some lesser deityHe enjoys it desires it and takes satisfaction in itThis brahman is what is torn rent blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of purity This man  will not be released from suffering I say This is how tornness etc should be understood as included under the breach that has gain etc as its cause and under the seven bonds of sexualityUntornness however is accomplished by the complete nonbreaking of the training precepts by making amends for those broken for which amends should be made by the absence of the seven bonds of sexuality and as well by the non arising of such evil things as anger enmity contempt domineering envy avarice deceit fraud obduracy presumption pride  haughtiness conceit  and negligence  and by the arising of such qualities as fewness of wishes contentment and effacement  Virtues not broken for the purpose of gain etc and rectified by making amends after being broken by the faults of negligence etc and not damaged by the bonds of sexuality and by such evil things as anger and enmity are called entirely untorn unrent unblotched and unmottledAnd those same virtues are liberating since they bring about the state of a freeman and praised by the wise since it is by the wise that they are praised and unadheredto since they are not adhered to by means of craving and views and conducive to concentration since they conduce to access concentration or to absorption concentrationThat is why their untornness etc should be understood as cleansing This cleansing comes about in two ways through seeing the danger of failure in virtue and through seeing the benefit of perfected virtueHerein the danger of failure in virtue can be seen in accordance with such suttas as that beginning Bhikkhus there are these five dangers for the unvirtuous in the failure of virtue  Furthermore on account of his unvirtuousness an unvirtuous person is displeasing to deities and human beings is uninstructable by his fellows in the life of purity suffers when unvirtuousness is censured and is remorseful when the virtuous are praised Owing to that unvirtuousness he is as ugly as hemp clothContact with him is painful because those who fall in with his views are brought to longlasting suffering in the states of lossHe is worthless because he causes no great fruit to accrue to those who give him giftsHe is as hard to purify as a cesspit many years oldHe is like a log from a pyre  for he is outside both recluseship and the lay stateThough claiming the bhikkhu state he is no bhikkhu so he is like a donkey following a herd of cattleHe is always nervous like a man who is everyones enemyHe is as unfit to live with as a dead carcaseThough he may have the qualities of learning etc he is as unfit for the homage of his fellows in the life of purity as a charnelground fire is for that of brahmansHe is as incapable of reaching the distinction of attainment as a blind man is of seeing a visible objectHe is as careless of the Good Law as a guttersnipe is of a kingdomThough he fancies he is happy yet he suffers because he reaps suffering as told in the Discourse on the Mass of Fire Now the Blessed One has shown that when the unvirtuous have their minds captured by pleasure and satisfaction in the indulgence of the five cords of sense desires in receiving salutation in being honoured etc the result of that kamma directly visible in all ways is very violent pain with that kamma as its condition capable of producing a gush of hot blood by causing agony of heart with the mere recollection of itHere is the text Bhikkhus do you see that great mass of fire burning blazing and glowing Yes venerable sirWhat do you think bhikkhus which is better that one gone forth should sit down or lie down embracing that mass of fire burning blazing and glowing or that he should sit down or lie down embracing a warriornoble maiden or a brahman maiden or a maiden of householder family with soft delicate hands and feetIt would be better venerable sir that he should sit down or lie down embracing a warriornoble maiden It would be painful venerable sir if he sat down or lay down embracing that great mass of fire burning blazing and glowing I say to you bhikkhus I declare to you bhikkhus that it would be better for one gone forth who is unvirtuous who is evilnatured of unclean and suspect habits secretive of his acts who is not an ascetic and claims to be one who does not lead the life of purity and claims to do so who is rotten within lecherous and full of corruption to sit down or lie down embracing that great mass of fire burning blazing and glowingWhy is thatBy his doing so bhikkhus he might come to death or deadly suffering yet he would not on that account on the breakup of the body after death reappear in states of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell But if one who is unvirtuous evilnatured  and full of corruption should sit down or lie down embracing a warriornoble maiden  that would be long for his harm and suffering on the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in states of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell Having thus shown by means of the analogy of the mass of fire the suffering that is bound up with women and has as its condition the indulgence of the five cords of sense desires by the unvirtuousWhat do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong horse hair rope twisted round both legs by a strong man and tightened so that it cut through the outer skin and having cut through the outer skin it cut through the inner skin and having cut through the inner skin it cut through the flesh and having cut through the flesh it cut through the sinews and having cut through the sinews it cut through the bones and having cut through the bones it remained crushing the bone marrowor that he should consent to the homage of great warriornobles great brahmans great householders  And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong man wound ones breast with a sharp spear tempered in oilor that he should consent to the reverential salutation of great warriornobles great brahmans great householders  And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that ones body should be wrapped by a strong man in a redhot iron sheet burning blazing and glowing or that he should use robes given out of faith by great warriornobles great brahmans great householders  And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that ones mouth should be prised open by a strong man with redhot iron tongs burning blazing and glowing and that into his mouth should be put a redhot iron ball burning blazing and glowing which burns his lips and burns his mouth and tongue and throat and belly and passes out below carrying with it his bowels and entrailsor that he should use alms food given out of faith by great warriornobles   And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong man seize him by the head or seize him by the shoulders and seat him or lay him on a redhot iron bed or iron chair burning blazing and glowingor that he should use a bed or chair given out of faith by great warriornobles   And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong man take him feet up and head down and plunge him into a redhot metal cauldron burning blazing and glowing to be boiled there in a swirl of froth and as he boils in the swirl of froth to be swept now up now down and now acrossor that he should use a dwelling given out of faith by great warriornobles   to the same intent he showed by the following similes of the horsehair rope the sharp spear the iron sheet the iron ball the iron bed the iron chair and the iron cauldron the pain that has as its condition acceptance of homage and reverential salutation and the use of robes alms food bed and chair and dwelling by unvirtuous bhikkhus  Of pain more violent even than the pain In the embracing of a mass of fireWhat pleasure has a man of broken virtue Forsaking not sense pleasures which bear fruitWhat pleasure has he in accepting homage Who having failed in virtue must partakeOf pain that will excel in agony The crushing of his legs with horsehair ropesWhat pleasure has a man devoid of virtue Accepting salutations of the faithfulWhich is the cause of pain acuter still Than pain produced by stabbing with a spearWhat is the pleasure in the use of garments For one without restraint whereby in hellHe will for long be forced to undergo The contact of the blazing iron sheetAlthough to him his alms food may seem tasty Who has no virtue it is direst poisonBecause of which he surely will be made For long to swallow burning iron ballsAnd when the virtueless make use of couches And chairs though reckoned pleasing it is painBecause they will be tortured long indeed On redhot blazing iron beds and chairsThen what delight is there for one unvirtuous Inhabiting a dwelling given in faithSince for that reason he will have to dwell Shut up inside a blazing iron panDescribed him in these terms Of suspect habits Full of corruption lecherous as well By nature evilrotten too within The Teacher of the world in him condemning So out upon the life of him abiding Without restraint of him that wears the guiseOf the ascetic that he will not be And damages and undermines himselfAvoids it here as those that would look well Keep far away from dung or from a corpseWhat is the life he leads since any person No matter who with virtue to his creditHe is not free from any sort of terror Though free enough from pleasure of attainmentWhile heavens door is bolted fast against him He is well set upon the road to hellWho else if not one destitute of virtue More fit to be the object of compassionMany indeed and grave are the defects That brand a man neglectful of his virtueSeeing danger in the failure of virtue should be understood as reviewing in such ways as these And seeing benefits in perfected virtue should be understood in the opposite sense FurthermoreHis virtue is immaculate His wearing of the bowl and robesGives pleasure and inspires trust His going forth will bear its fruitA bhikkhu in his virtue pure Has never fear that selfreproachWill enter in his heart indeed There is no darkness in the sunA bhikkhu in his virtue bright Shines forth in the Ascetics WoodAs by the brightness of his beams The moon lights up the firmamentNow if the bodily perfume Of virtuous bhikkhus can succeedIn pleasing even deities What of the perfume of his virtueIt is more perfect far than all The other perfumes in the worldBecause the perfume virtue gives Is borne unchecked in all directionsThe deeds done for a virtuous man Though they be few will bear much fruitAnd so the virtuous man becomes A vessel of honour and renownThere are no cankers here and now To plague the virtuous man at allThe virtuous man digs out the root Of suffering in lives to comePerfection among human kind And even among deitiesIf wished for is not hard to gain For him whose virtue is perfectedThan the perfection of Nibbāna The state where utter peace prevailsBut once his virtue is perfected His mind then seeks no other kindSo let a wise man know it well This root of all perfections branchesSuch is the blessed fruit of virtue Showing full many a varied form The mind of one who understands thus shudders at failure in virtue and reaches out towards the perfecting of virtueSo virtue should be cleansed with all care seeing this danger of failure in virtue and this benefit of the perfection of virtue in the way statedAnd at this point in the Path of Purification which is shown under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding by the stanza When a wise man established well in virtue  virtue firstly has been fully illustratedin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peopleThe first chapter called The Description of VirtueNow while a meditator is engaged in the pursuit of virtue he should set about undertaking the ascetic practices in order to perfect those special qualities of fewness of wishes contentment etc by which the virtue of the kind already described is cleansedFor when his virtue is thus washed clean of stains by the waters of such special qualities as fewness of wishes contentment effacement seclusion dispersal energy and modest needs it will become quite purified and his vows will succeed as wellAnd so when his whole behaviour has been purified by the special quality of blameless virtue and vows and he has become established in the first three of the ancient Noble Ones heritages he may become worthy to attain to the fourth called delight in development We shall therefore begin the explanation of the ascetic practicesThirteen kinds of ascetic practices have been allowed by the Blessed One to clansmen who have given up the things of the flesh and regardless of body and life are desirous of undertaking a practice in conformity with their aimHerein As to meaning characteristic et cetera The undertaking and directionsAnd then the grade and breach as well And benefits of each besides As to the profitable triad Ascetic and so on distinguished And as to groups and also singly The exposition should be known Herein as to meaning in the first place It is refuse since owing to its being found on refuse in any such place as a street a charnel ground or a midden it belongs as it were to the refuse in the sense of being dumped in anyone of these places Or alternatively like refuse it gets to a vile state  thus it is refuse  it goes to a vile state is what is meantThe wearing of a refuserag which has acquired its derivative name in this way is refuserag wearing  That is his habit thus he is a refuseragwearer The practice of the refuseragwearer is the refuserag wearers practice It is the action that is called the practiceTherefore it should be understood as a term for that by undertaking which one becomes a refuseragwearerii In the same way he has the habit of wearing the triple robe in other words the cloak of patches the upper garment and the inner clothing thus he is a triplerobewearer His practice is called the triple robewearers practiceiii The dropping of the lumps of material sustenance called alms is alms food  the falling into the bowl of lumps given by others is what is meantHe gleans that alms food  he seeks it by approaching such and such a family thus he is called an almsfood eater Or his vow is to gather the lump  thus he is a lumpgatherer  To gather is to wander for A lumpgatherer is the same as an almsfoodeater The practice of the almsfoodeater is the almsfoodeaters practiceiv It is a hiatus that is called a gap  It is removed from a gap thus it is called gapless  the meaning is it is without hiatusIt is together with what is gapless  thus it is with the gapless  devoid of hiatusfrom house to houseis what is meantHis habit is to wander on whatiswiththegapless thus he is a gapless wanderer  A gapless wanderer is the same as a housetohouseseeker His practice is the housetohouseseekers practicev Eating in one session is onesession He has that habit thus he is a one sessionerHis practice is the onesessioners practicevi Alms in one bowl only because of refusing a second vessel is bowlalms Now making bowl alms the name for the taking of alms food in the bowl bowlalmsfood is his habit thus he is a bowl foodeater His practice is the bowlfoodeaters practicevii No is a particle in the sense of refusingFood obtained later by one who has shown that he is satisfied is called laterfood  The eating of that later food is laterfoodeating Making laterfood the name for that laterfoodeating laterfood is his habit thus he is a later foodeater Not a laterfoodeater is a nolaterfoodeater  that is a laterfoodrefuserThis is the name for one who as an undertaking refuses extra foodBut it is said in the commentary Khalu is a certain kind of birdWhen it has taken a fruit into its beak and that drops it does not eat any moreThis bhikkhu is like that Thus he is a laterfoodrefuser His practice is the laterfoodrefusers practiceviii His habit is dwelling in the forest thus he is a forestdwellerHis practice is the forestdwellers practiceix Dwelling at the root of a tree is treerootdwelling He has that habit thus he is a treerootdwellerThe practice of the treerootdweller is the treeroot dwellers practicex xi Likewise with the openairdweller and the charnelgrounddweller xii Only what has been distributed is as distributed  This is a term for the resting place first allotted thus This one falls to youHe has the habit of dwelling in that as distributed thus he is an as distributeduser  that is an anybeduserHis practice is the anybedusers practicexiii He has the habit of keeping to the sitting posture when resting refusing to lie down thus he is a sitterHis practice is the sitters practiceAll these however are the practices of a bhikkhu who is ascetic because he has shaken off defilement by undertaking one or other of them Or the knowledge that has got the name ascetic because it shakes off defilement is a practice belonging to these thus they are ascetic practices Or alternatively they are ascetic because they shake off opposition and they are practices because they are a way This firstly is how the exposition should be known here as to meaningAll of them have as their characteristic the volition of undertakingFor this is said in the commentary He who does the undertaking is a personThat whereby he does the undertaking is states of consciousness and consciousness concomitantsThe volition of the act of undertaking is the ascetic practiceWhat it rejects is the instanceAll have the function of eliminating cupidity and they manifest themselves with the production of noncupidity For their proximate cause they have the noble states consisting of fewness of wishes and so onThis is how the exposition should be known as to characteristic etc here As regards the five beginning with the undertaking and directions during the Blessed Ones lifetime all ascetic practices should be undertaken in the Blessed Ones presenceAfter his attainment of Nibbāna this should be done in the presence of a principal discipleWhen he is not available it should be done in the presence of one whose cankers are destroyed of a nonreturner of a oncereturner of a streamenterer of one who knows the three Piṭakas of one who knows two of the Piṭakas of one who knows one of the Piṭakas of one who knows one Collection of a teacher of the CommentariesWhen he is not available it should be done in the presence of an observer of an ascetic practice When he is not available then after one has swept out the shrine terrace they can be undertaken seated in a reverential posture as though pronouncing them in the Fully Enlightened Ones presence Also it is permitted to undertake them by oneselfAnd here should be told the story of the senior of the two brothers who were elders at Cetiyapabbata and their fewness of wishes with respect to the ascetic practices This firstly is what applies to all the practicesNow we shall proceed to comment on the undertaking directions grade breach and benefits of each one separatelyi First the refuseragwearers practice is undertaken with one of these two statements I refuse robes given by householders or I undertake the refuserag wearers practiceThis firstly is the undertakingOne who has done this should get a robe of one of the following kinds one from a charnel ground one from a shop a cloth from a street a cloth from a midden one from a childbed an ablution cloth a cloth from a washing place one worn going to and returning from the charnel ground one scorched by fire one gnawed by cattle one gnawed by ants one gnawed by rats one cut at the end one cut at the edge one carried as a flag a robe from a shrine an ascetics robe one from a consecration one produced by supernormal power one from a highway one borne by the wind one presented by deities one from the sea Taking one of these robe cloths he should tear off and throw away the weak parts and then wash the sound parts and make up a robe He can use it after getting rid of his old robe given by householdersHerein one from a charnel ground is one dropped on a charnel groundOne from a shop is one dropped at the door of a shopA cloth from a street is a cloth thrown into a street from inside a window by those who seek meritA cloth from a midden is a cloth thrown onto a place for rubbishOne from a childbed is a cloth thrown away after wiping up the stains of childbirth with itThe mother of Tissa the Minister it seems had the stains of childbirth wiped up with a cloth worth a hundred pieces and thinking The refuserag wearers will take it she had it thrown onto the Tālaveli RoadBhikkhus took it for the purpose of mending worn places An ablution cloth is one that people who are made by devil doctors to bathe themselves including their heads are accustomed to throw away as a cloth of ill luckA cloth from washing place is rags thrown away at a washing place where bathing is doneOne worn going to and coming from is one that people throw away after they have gone to a charnel ground and returned and bathedOne scorched by fire is one partly scorched by firefor people throw that awayOne gnawed by cattle etc are obviousfor people throw away such as these tooOne carried as a flag Those who board a ship do so after hoisting a flagIt is allowable to take this when they have gone out of sightAlso it is allowable when the two armies have gone away to take a flag that has been hoisted on a battlefield A robe from a shrine is an offering made by draping a termitemound in clothAn ascetics robe is one belonging to a bhikkhuOne from a consecration is one thrown away at the kings consecration placeOne produced by supernormal power is a comebhikkhu robeOne from a highway is one dropped in the middle of a roadBut one dropped by the owners negligence should be taken only after waiting a whileOne borne by the wind is one that falls a long way off having been carried by the wind It is allowable to take it if the owners are not in sightOne presented by deities is one given by deities like that given to the Elder Anuruddha One from the sea is one washed up on dry land by the sea wavesOne given thus We give it to the Order or got by those who go out for alms cloth is not a refuseragAnd in the case of one presented by a bhikkhu one given after it has been got at a presentation of robes by householders at the end of the Rains or a restingplace robe that is one automatically supplied by a householder to the occupant of a certain resting place is not a refuseragIt is a refuserag only when given after not having been so obtainedAnd herein that placed by the donors at a bhikkhus feet but given by that bhikkhu to the refuserag wearer by placing it in his hand is called pure in one wayThat given to a bhikkhu by placing it in his hand but placed by him at the refuserag wearers feet is also pure in one wayThat which is both placed at a bhikkhus feet and then given by him in the same way is pure in both waysOne obtained by being placed in the hand and given by being placed in the hand too is not a strict mans robeSo a refuserag wearer should use the robe after getting to know about the kinds of refuserags These are the directions for it in this instanceThe grades are these There are three kinds of refuserag wearers the strict the medium and the mildHerein one who takes it only from a charnel ground is strictOne who takes one left by someone thinking One gone forth will take it is mediumOne who takes one given by being placed at his feet by a bhikkhu is mildThe moment anyone of these of his own choice or inclination agrees to accept a robe given by a householder his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these He actually practices in conformity with the dependence because of the words The going forth by depending on the refuserag robe  he is established in the first of the Noble Ones heritages  there is no suffering due to protecting he exists independent of others there is no fear of robbers there is no craving connected with use of robes it is a requisite suitable for an ascetic it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus valueless easy to get and blameless  it inspires confidence it produces the fruits of fewness of wishes etc the right way is cultivated a good example is set to later generations While striving for Deaths armys rout The ascetic clad in ragrobe cloutGot from a rubbish heap shines bright As mailclad warrior in the fightLeaving rare Kāsi cloth and more This robe worethe worlds great teacher Of rags from off a rubbish heap Who would not have a robe to keepMinding the words he did profess When he went into homelessnessLet him to wear such rags delight As one in seemly garb bedightThis firstly is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the refuseragwearers practiceii Next there is the triplerobewearers practice This is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a fourth robe or I undertake the triple robewearers practiceWhen a triplerobe wearer has got cloth for a robe he can put it by for as long as owing to illhealth he is unable to make it up or for as long as he does not find a helper or lacks a needle etcand there is no fault in his putting it byBut it is not allowed to put it by once it has been dyed That is called cheating the ascetic practiceThese are the directions for itThis too has three gradesHerein one who is strict should at the time of dyeing first dye either the inner cloth or the upper garment and having dyed it he should wear that round the waist and dye the otherThen he can put that on over the shoulder and dye the cloak of patchesBut he is not allowed to wear the cloak of patches round the waistThis is the duty when in an abode inside a villageBut it is allowable for him in the forest to wash and dye two togetherHowever he should sit in a place near to the robes so that if he sees anyone he can pull a yellow cloth over himselfBut for the medium one there is a yellow cloth in the dyeing room for use while dyeing and it is allowable for him to wear that as an inner cloth or to put it on as an upper garment in order to do the work of dyeingFor the mild one it is allowable to wear or put on the robes of bhikkhus who are in communion in order to do the work of dyeingA bedspread that remains where it is is also allowable for himbut he must not take it about himAnd it is allowed for him to use from time to time the robes of bhikkhus who are in communionIt is allowed to one who wears the triple robe as an ascetic practice to have a yellow shouldercloth too as a fourthbut it must be only a span wide and three hands longThe moment anyone of these three agrees to accept a fourth robe his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these The bhikkhu who is a triplerobe wearer is content with the robe as a protection for the bodyHence he goes taking it with him as a bird does its wings  and such special qualities as having few undertakings avoidance of storage of cloth a frugal existence the abandoning of greed for many robes living in effacement by observing moderation even in what is permitted production of the fruits of fewness of wishes etc are perfected No risk of hoarding haunts the man of wit Who wants no extra cloth for requisiteUsing the triple robe whereer he goes The pleasant relish of content he knowsSo would the adept wander undeterred With naught else but his robes as flies the birdWith its own wings then let him too rejoice That frugalness in garments be his choiceThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the triplerobewearers practice iii The almsfoodeaters practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a supplementary food supply or I undertake the alms foodeaters practiceNow this almsfood eater should not accept the following fourteen kinds of meal a meal offered to the Order a meal offered to specified bhikkhus an invitation a meal given by a ticket one each halfmoon day one each Uposatha day one each first of the halfmoon a meal given for visitors a meal for travellers a meal for the sick a meal for sicknurses a meal supplied to a particular residence a meal given in a principal house a meal given in turnIf instead of saying Take a meal given to the Order meals are given saying The Order is taking alms in our house you may take alms too it is allowable to consentTickets from the Order that are not for actual food and also a meal cooked in a monastery are allowable as well These are the directions for itThis too has three gradesHerein one who is strict takes alms brought both from before and from behind and he gives the bowl to those who take it while he stands outside a door He also takes alms brought to the refectory and given there But he does not take alms by sitting and waiting for it to be brought later that dayThe medium one takes it as well by sitting and waiting for it to be brought later that day but he does not consent to its being brought the next dayThe mild one consents to alms being brought on the next day and on the day afterBoth these last miss the joy of an independent lifeThere is perhaps a preaching on the Noble Ones heritages in some village The strict one says to the others Let us go friends and listen to the DhammaOne of them says I have been made to sit and wait by a man venerable sirand the other I have consented to receive alms tomorrow venerable sirSo they are both losersThe other wanders for alms in the morning and then he goes and savours the taste of the DhammaThe moment anyone of these three agrees to the extra gain consisting of a meal given to the Order etc his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these He actually practices in conformity with the dependence because of the words The going forth by depending on the eating of lumps of alms food  he is established in the second of the Noble Ones heritages his existence is independent of others it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus Valueless easy to get blameless  idleness is eliminated livelihood is purified the practice of the minor training rule of the Pātimokkha is fulfilled he is not maintained by another he helps others pride is abandoned craving for tastes is checked the training precepts about eating as a group substituting one meal invitation for another  and good behaviour are not contravened his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes he cultivates the right way he has compassion for later generations The monk content with alms for food Has independent livelihoodAnd greed in him no footing finds He is as free as the four windsHe never need be indolent His livelihood is innocentSo let a wise man not disdain Almsgathering for his domainSince it is saidIf a bhikkhu can support himself on almsAnd live without anothers maintenanceThe very gods indeed might envy himAnd pay no heed as well to gain and fame This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the almsfoodeaters practiceiv The housetohouse seekers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a greedy alms round or I undertake the housetohouse seekers practiceNow the housetohouse seeker should stop at the village gate and make sure that there is no dangerIf there is danger in any street or village it is allowable to leave it out and wander for alms elsewhereWhen there is a house door or a street or a village where he regularly gets nothing at all he can go past it not counting it as a villageBut wherever he gets anything at all it is not allowed subsequently to go past there and leave it outThis bhikkhu should enter the village early so that he will be able to leave out any inconvenient place and go elsewhereBut if people who are giving a gift of a meal in a monastery or who are coming along the road take his bowl and give alms food it is allowableAnd as this bhikkhu is going along the road he should when it is the time wander for alms in any village he comes to and not pass it byIf he gets nothing there or only a little he should wander for alms in the next village in orderThese are the directions for it This too has three gradesHerein one who is strict does not take alms brought from before or brought from behind or brought to the refectory and given there He hands over his bowl at a door howeverfor in this ascetic practice there is none equal to the Elder Mahā Kassapayet an instance in which even he handed over his bowl is mentioned The medium one takes what is brought from before and from behind and what is brought to the refectory and he hands over his bowl at a door But he does not sit waiting for almsThus he conforms to the rule of the strict almsfood eaterThe mild one sits waiting for alms to be brought that dayThe ascetic practice of these three is broken as soon as the greedy alms round starts by going only to the houses where good alms food is givenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these He is always a stranger among families and is like the moon  he abandons avarice about families he is compassionate impartially he avoids the dangers in being supported by a family he does not delight in invitations he does not hope for meals to be brought his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes and so on Is moonlike ever new to familiesNor does he grudge to help all equallyFree from the risks of housedependencyThe monk who at each house his begging pliesWho would the selfindulgent round forsakeHis downcast eyes range a yokelength beforeAnd roam the world at will the while to makeThen let him wisely seek from door to doorThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the housetohouseseekers practicev The onesessioners practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse eating in several sessions or I undertake the onesessioners practiceWhen the onesessioner sits down in the sitting hall instead of sitting on an elders seat he should notice which seat is likely to fall to him and sit down on thatIf his teacher or preceptor arrives while the meal is still unfinished it is allowable for him to get up and do the dutiesBut the Elder Tipiṭaka CūlaAbhaya said He should either keep his seat and finish his meal or if he gets up he should leave the rest of his meal in order not to break the ascetic practice And this is one whose meal is still unfinished therefore let him do the duties but in that case let him not eat the rest of the mealThese are the directionsThis too has three gradesHerein one who is strict may not take anything more than the food that he has laid his hand on whether it is little or muchAnd if people bring him ghee etc thinking The elder has eaten nothing while these are allowable for the purpose of medicine they are not so for the purpose of foodThe medium one may take more as long as the meal in the bowl is not exhaustedfor he is called one who stops when the food is finishedThe mild one may eat as long as he does not get up from his seatHe is either one who stops with the water because he eats until he takes water for washing the bowl or one who stops with the session because he eats until he gets upThe ascetic practice of these three is broken at the moment when food has been eaten at more than one sessionThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these He has little affliction and little sickness he has lightness strength and a happy life there is no contravening rules about food that is not what is left over from a meal craving for tastes is eliminated his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes and so on Who gladly in one session takes his mealNo illness due to eating shall he feelNo longing to indulge his sense of tasteTempts him to leave his work to go to wasteHis own true happiness a monk may findIn eating in one session pure in mindPurity and effacement wait on thisFor it gives reason to abide in blissThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the onesessioners practicevi The bowlfoodeaters practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a second vessel or I undertake the bowlfoodeaters practiceWhen at the time of drinking rice gruel the bowlfood eater gets curry that is put in a dish he can first either eat the curry or drink the rice gruelIf he puts it in the rice gruel the rice gruel becomes repulsive when a curry made with cured fish etc is put into it So it is allowable to do this only in order to use it without making it repulsiveConsequently this is said with reference to such curry as thatBut what is unrepulsive such as honey sugar etc should be put into itAnd in taking it he should take the right amountIt is allowable to take green vegetables with the hand and eat themBut unless he does that they should be put into the bowlBecause a second vessel has been refused it is not allowable to use anything else not even the leaf of a tree These are its directionsThis too has three gradesHerein for one who is strict except at the time of eating sugarcane it is not allowed while eating to throw rubbish awayand it is not allowed while eating to break up ricelumps fish meat and cakes The rubbish should be thrown away and the ricelumps etc broken up before starting to eatThe medium one is allowed to break them up with one hand while eating and he is called a hand asceticThe mild one is called a bowl ascetic anything that can be put into his bowl he is allowed while eating to break up that is rice lumps etc with his hand or such things as palm sugar ginger etc with his teethThe moment anyone of these three agrees to a second vessel his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these Craving for variety of tastes is eliminatedexcessiveness of wishes is abandoned he sees the purpose and the right amount in nutriment he is not bothered with carrying saucers etc about his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes and so on He baffles doubts that might arise With extra dishes downcast eyesThe true devotedness imply Of one uprooting gluttonyWearing content as if twere part Of his own nature glad at heartNone but a bowlfood eater may Consume his food in such a wayThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the bowlfoodeaters practicevii The laterfoodrefusers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse additional food or I undertake the laterfoodrefusers practiceNow when that laterfood refuser has shown that he is satisfied he should not again have the food made allowable by having it put into his hands according to the rule for bhikkhus and eat itThese are the directions for itThis too has three gradesHerein there is no showing that he has had enough with respect to the first lump but there is when he refuses more while that is being swallowed So when one who is strict has thus shown that he has had enough with respect to the second lump he does not eat the second lump after swallowing the firstThe medium one eats also that food with respect to which he has shown that he has had enoughBut the mild one goes on eating until he gets up from his seatThe moment any one of these three has eaten what has been made allowable again after he has shown that he has had enough his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these One is far from committing an offence concerned with extra food there is no overloading of the stomach there is no keeping food back there is no renewed search for food he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so on He needs no extra search in weary mood Nor stores up food till later in the dayNor overloads his stomach in this way When a wise man refuses later foodPraised by the Blessed One which will augment The special qualities such as contentSo would the adept from such faults abstain Let him assume this practice for his gainThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the laterfoodrefusers practice viii The forestdwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse an abode in a village or I undertake the forestdwellers practiceNow that forest dweller must leave an abode in a village in order to meet the dawn in the forestHerein a village abode is the village itself with its precinctsA village may consist of one cottage or several cottages it may be enclosed by a wall or not have human inhabitants or not and it can also be a caravan that is inhabited for more than four monthsThe village precincts cover the range of a stone thrown by a man of medium stature standing between the gateposts of a walled village if there are two gateposts as at Anurādhapura The Vinaya experts say that this stones throw is characterized as up to the place where a thrown stone falls as for instance when young men exercise their arms and throw stones in order to show off their strengthBut the Suttanta experts say that it is up to where one thrown to scare crows normally fallsIn the case of an unwalled village the house precinct is where the water falls when a woman standing in the door of the outermost house of all throws water from a basinWithin a stones throw of the kind already described from that point is the village Within a second stones throw is the village precinctForest according to the Vinaya method firstly is described thus Except the village and its precincts all is forest According to the Abhidhamma method it is described thus Having gone out beyond the boundary post all that is forest But according to the Suttanta method its characteristic is this A forest abode is five hundred bowlengths distant That should be defined by measuring it with a strung instructors bow from the gatepost of a walled village or from the range of the first stones throw from an unwalled one up to the monastery wallBut if the monastery is not walled it is said in the Vinaya commentaries it should be measured by making the first dwelling of all the limit or else the refectory or regular meeting place or Bodhi Tree or shrine even if that is far from a dwelling belonging to the monasteryBut in the Majjhima commentary it is said that omitting the precincts of the monastery and the village the distance to be measured is that between where the two stones fallThis is the measure hereEven if the village is close by and the sounds of men are audible to people in the monastery still if it is not possible to go straight to it because of rocks rivers etcin between the five hundred bowlengths can be reckoned by that road even if one has to go by boatBut anyone who blocks the path to the village here and there for the purpose of lengthening it so as to be able to say that he is taking up the practice is cheating the ascetic practiceIf a forestdwelling bhikkhus preceptor or teacher is ill and does not get what he needs in the forest he should take him to a village abode and attend him thereBut he should leave in time to meet the dawn in a place proper for the practiceIf the affliction increases towards the time of dawn he must attend himand not bother about the purity of his ascetic practice These are the directionsThis too has three gradesHerein one who is strict must always meet the dawn in the forestThe medium one is allowed to live in a village for the four months of the RainsAnd the mild one for the winter months tooIf in the period defined any one of these three goes from the forest and hears the Dhamma in a village abode his ascetic practice is not broken if he meets the dawn therenor is it broken if he meets it as he is on his way back after hearing the DhammaBut if when the preacher has got up he thinks We shall go after lying down awhile and he meets the dawn while asleep or if of his own choice he meets the dawn while in a village abode then his ascetic practice is broken This is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these A forestdwelling bhikkhu who has given attention to the perception of forest can obtain hitherto unobtained concentration or preserve that already obtained And the Master is pleased with himaccording as it is said So Nāgita I am pleased with that bhikkhus dwelling in the forest And when he lives in a remote abode his mind is not distracted by unsuitable visible objects and so on He is free from anxiety he abandons attachment to life he enjoys the taste of the bliss of seclusion and the state of the refuserag wearer etc becomes him He lives secluded and apart Remote abodes delight his heartThe Saviour of the world besides He gladdens that in groves abidesThe hermit that in woods can dwell Alone may gain the bliss as wellWhose savour is beyond the price Of royal bliss in paradiseWearing the robe of rags he may Go forth into the forest fraySuch is his mail for weapons too The other practices will doOne so equipped can be assured Of routing Māra and his hordeSo let the forest glades delight A wise man for his dwellings siteThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the forestdwellers practice ix The treerootdwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a roof or I undertake the treerootdwellers practiceThe treeroot dweller should avoid such trees as a tree near a frontier a shrine tree a gum tree a fruit tree a bats tree a hollow tree or a tree standing in the middle of a monastery He can choose a tree standing on the outskirts of a monastery These are the directionsThis has three grades tooHerein one who is strict is not allowed to have a tree that he has chosen tidied upHe can move the fallen leaves with his foot while dwelling thereThe medium one is allowed to get it tidied up by those who happen to come alongThe mild one can take up residence there after summoning monastery attendants and novices and getting them to clear it up level it strew sand and make a fence round with a gate fixed in itOn a special day a treeroot dweller should sit in some concealed place elsewhere rather than thereThe moment any one of these three makes his abode under a roof his ascetic practice is brokenThe reciters of the Aṅguttara say that it is broken as soon as he knowingly meets the dawn under a roofThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these He practices in conformity with the dependence because of the words The going forth by depending on the root of a tree as an abode  it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus Valueless easy to get and blameless  perception of impermanence is aroused through seeing the continual alteration of young leaves avarice about abodes and love of building work are absent he dwells in the company of deities he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so on The Blessed One praised roots of trees As one of the dependencies Can he that loves secludedness Find such another dwelling placeSecluded at the roots of trees And guarded well by deitiesHe lives in true devotedness Nor covets any dwelling placeAnd when the tender leaves are seen Bright red at first then turning greenAnd then to yellow as they fall He sheds belief once and for all In permanenceNo wise man will disdain at all For contemplating rise and fallTree roots have been Bequeathed by him secluded sceneThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the treerootdwellers practice x The openairdwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a roof and a tree root or I undertake the openairdwellers practiceAn openair dweller is allowed to enter the Uposathahouse for the purpose of hearing the Dhamma or for the purpose of the UposathaIf it rains while he is inside he can go out when the rain is over instead of going out while it is still rainingHe is allowed to enter the eating hall or the fire room in order to do the duties or to go under a roof in order to ask elder bhikkhus in the eating hall about a meal or when teaching and taking lessons or to take beds chairs etc inside that have been wrongly left outsideIf he is going along a road with a requisite belonging to a senior and it rains he is allowed to go into a wayside rest houseIf he has nothing with him he is not allowed to hurry in order to get to a rest housebut he can go at his normal pace and enter it and stay there as long as it rains These are the directions for itAnd the same rule applies to the treeroot dweller tooThis has three grades tooHerein one who is strict is not allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a houseHe should make a robetent right out in the open and live in thatThe medium one is allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a house so long as he is not covered by themThe mild one is allowed these a rock overhang without a dripledge cut in it a hut of branches cloth stiffened with paste and a tent treated as a fixture that has been left by field watchers and so onThe moment any one of these three goes under a roof or to a tree root to dwell there his ascetic practice is brokenThe reciters of the Aṅguttara say that it is broken as soon as he knowingly meets the dawn thereThis is the breach in this caseThe benefits are these the impediment of dwellings is severed stiffness and torpor are expelled his conduct deserves the praise Like deer the bhikkhus live unattached and homeless  he is detached he is free to go in any direction he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so on That aids the homeless bhikkhus strife Easy to getThe moon and sun furnish his light Under the starbejewelled vaultThe open air provides a life and leaves his mind Alert as a deer so he shall findStiffness and torpor brought to halt And concentration his delightThe joy seclusions savour gives He shall discover soon who livesIn open air and that is why The wise prefer the open skyThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the openairdwellers practicexi The charnelgrounddwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse what is not a charnel ground or I undertake the charnel grounddwellers practiceNow the charnelground dweller should not live in some place just because the people who built the village have called it the charnel groundfor it is not a charnel ground unless a dead body has been burnt on it But as soon as one has been burnt on it it becomes a charnel ground And even if it has been neglected for a dozen years it is so still One who dwells there should not be the sort of person who gets walks pavilions etc built has beds and chairs set out and drinking and washing water kept ready and preaches Dhammafor this ascetic practice is a momentous thing Whoever goes to live there should be diligent And he should first inform the senior elder of the Order or the kings local representative in order to prevent troubleWhen he walks up and down he should do so looking at the pyre with half an eyeOn his way to the charnel ground he should avoid the main roads and take a bypathHe should define all the objects there while it is dayso that they will not assume frightening shapes for him at night Even if nonhuman beings wander about screeching he must not hit them with anythingIt is not allowed to miss going to the charnel ground even for a single dayThe reciters of the Aṅguttara say that after spending the middle watch in the charnel ground he is allowed to leave in the last watchHe should not take such foods as sesame flour pease pudding fish meat milk oil sugar etc which are liked by nonhuman beingsHe should not enter the homes of families These are the directions for itThis has three grades tooHerein one who is strict should live where there are always burnings and corpses and mourningThe medium one is allowed to live where there is one of these threeThe mild one is allowed to live in a place that possesses the bare characteristics of a charnel ground already statedWhen any one of these three makes his abode in some place not a charnel ground his ascetic practice is brokenIt is on the day on which he does not go to the charnel ground the Aṅguttara reciters sayThis is the breach in this caseThe benefits are these He acquires mindfulness of death he lives diligently the sign of foulness is available  greed for sense desires is removed he constantly sees the bodys true nature he has a great sense of urgency he abandons vanity of health etc he vanquishes fear and dread  nonhuman beings respect and honour him he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so on the dweller in a charnel ground for death is ever present to his thoughtEven in sleep shows naught Of negligencewith many corpses present to his gazeHe may be sure there is no lust after sense pleasure preys Upon his mindRightly he strives because he gains a sense of urgencyWhile in his search for final peace he curbs all vanityEmbrace this practice for it has rare virtues to impartLet him that feels a leaning to Nibbāna in his heartThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the charnelground dwellers practice xii The anybedusers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse greed for resting places or I undertake the anybedusers practiceThe anybed user should be content with whatever resting place he gets thus This falls to your lot He must not make anyone else shift from his bedThese are the directionsThis has three grades tooHerein one who is strict is not allowed to ask about the resting place that has fallen to his lot Is it far  or Is it too near  or Is it infested by nonhuman beings snakes and so on  or Is it hot  or Is it cold The medium one is allowed to askbut not to go and inspect itThe mild one is allowed to inspect it and if he does not like it to choose anotherAs soon as greed for resting places arises in any one of these three his ascetic practice is broken This is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these The advice He should be content with what he gets is carried out he regards the welfare of his fellows in the life of purity he gives up caring about inferiority and superiority approval and disapproval are abandoned the door is closed against excessive wishes he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so on One vowed to any bed will be Content with what he gets and heCan sleep in bliss without dismay On nothing but a spread of hayHe is not eager for the best No lowly couch does he detestHe aids his young companions too That to the monks good life are newSo for a wise man to delight In any kind of bed is rightA Noble One this custom loves As one the sages Lord approvesThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the anybedusers practicexiii The sitters practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse lying down or I undertake the sitters practiceThe sitter can get up in any one of three watches of the night and walk up and downfor lying down is the only posture not allowedThese are the directionsThis has three grades tooHerein one who is strict is not allowed a backrest or cloth band or bindingstrap to prevent falling while asleepThe medium one is allowed any one of these threeThe mild one is allowed a backrest a cloth band a bindingstrap a cushion a fivelimb and a sevenlimbA fivelimb is a chair made with four legs and a support for the backA sevenlimb is one made with four legs a support for the back and an arm support on each sideThey made that it seems for the Elder Pīṭhābhaya The elder became a nonreturner and then attained NibbānaAs soon as any one of these three lies down his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these The mental shackle described thus He dwells indulging in the pleasure of lying prone the pleasure of lolling the pleasure of torpor  is severed his state is suitable for devotion to any meditation subject his deportment inspires confidence his state favours the application of energy he develops the right practice The adept that can place crosswise His feet to rest upon his thighsAnd sit with back erect shall make Foul Māras evil heart to quakeNo more in supine joys to plump And wallow in lethargic dumpWho sits for rest and finds it good Shines forth in the Ascetics WoodThe happiness and bliss it brings Has naught to do with worldly thingsSo must the sitters vow befit The manners of a man of witThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the sitters practice As to the profitable triad Ascetic and so on distinguished As to groups and also singly The exposition should be known Now there is the commentary according to the stanza  Herein as to the profitable triad all the ascetic practices that is to say those of trainers ordinary men and men whose cankers have been destroyed may be either profitable or in the Arahants case indeterminate No ascetic practice is unprofitableBut if someone should say There is also an unprofitable ascetic practice because of the words One of evil wishes a prey to wishes becomes a forest dweller  etche should be told We have not said that he does not live in the forest with unprofitable consciousnessWhoever has his dwelling in the forest is a forest dwellerand he may be one of evil wishes or of few wishesBut as it was said above  they are the practices of a bhikkhu who is ascetic because he has shaken off defilement by undertaking one or other of them Or the knowledge that has got the name ascetic because it shakes off defilement is a practice belonging to these thus they are ascetic practices Or alternatively they are ascetic because they shake off opposition and they are practices because they are a way Now no one called ascetic on account of what is unprofitable could have these as his practices nor does what is unprofitable shake off anything so that those things to which it belonged as a practice could be called ascetic practicesAnd what is unprofitable does not both shake off cupidity for robes etc and become the practice of the wayConsequently it was rightly said that no ascetic practice is unprofitableAnd those who hold that an ascetic practice is outside the profitable triad have no ascetic practice as regards meaningOwing to the shaking off of what is nonexistent could it be called an ascetic practiceAlso there are the words Proceeded to undertake the ascetic qualities  and it follows that those words are contradicted So that should not be accepted This in the first place is the commentary on the profitable triad As to ascetic and so on distinguished the following things should be understood that is to say ascetica preacher of asceticismascetic statesascetic practicesand for whom the cultivation of ascetic practices is suitable Herein ascetic means either a person whose defilements are shaken off or a state that entails shaking off defilementsA preacher of asceticism one is ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism another is not ascetic but a preacher of asceticism another is neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticism and another is both ascetic and a preacher of asceticismHerein one who has shaken off his defilements with an ascetic practice but does not advise and instruct another in an ascetic practice like the Elder Bakkula is ascetic but not a preacher of asceticismaccording as it is said Now the venerable Bakkula was ascetic but not a preacher of asceticismOne who has not shaken off his own defilements but only advises and instructs another in an ascetic practice like the Elder Upananda is not ascetic but a preacher of asceticismaccording as it is said Now the venerable Upananda son of the Sakyans was not ascetic but a preacher of asceticismOne who has failed in both like Lāḷudāyin is neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticismaccording as it is said Now the venerable Lāḷudāyin was neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticismOne who has succeeded in both like the General of the Dhamma is both ascetic and a preacher of asceticismaccording as it is said Now the venerable Sāriputta was ascetic and a preacher of asceticismAscetic states the five states that go with the volition of an ascetic practice that is to say fewness of wishes contentment effacement seclusion and that specific quality are called ascetic states because of the words Depending on fewness of wishes  and so on Herein fewness of wishes and contentment are nongreedEffacement and seclusion belong to the two states nongreed and nondelusionThat specific quality is knowledgeHerein by means of nongreed a man shakes off greed for things that are forbidden By means of nondelusion he shakes off the delusion that hides the dangers in those same thingsAnd by means of nongreed he shakes off indulgence in pleasure due to sense desires that occurs under the heading of using what is allowed And by means of nondelusion he shakes off indulgence in self mortification that occurs under the heading of excessive effacement in the ascetic practicesThat is why these states should be understood as ascetic statesAscetic practices these should be understood as the thirteen that is to say the refuseragwearers practice  the sitters practicewhich have already been described as to meaning and as to characteristic and so forthFor whom the cultivation of ascetic practices is suitable they are suitable for one of greedy temperament and for one of deluded temperamentWhyBecause the cultivation of ascetic practices is both a difficult progress and an abiding in effacementand greed subsides with the difficult progresswhile delusion is got rid of in those diligent by effacementOr the cultivation of the forestdwellers practice and the treerootdwellers practice here are suitable for one of hating temperamentfor hate too subsides in one who dwells there without coming into conflict This is the commentary as to ascetic and so on distinguished and As to groups and also singly Now as to groups these ascetic practices are in fact only eight that is to say three principal and five individual practicesHerein the three namely the housetohouseseekers practice the onesessioners practice and the openairdwellers practice are principal practicesFor one who keeps the housetohouseseekers practice will keep the almsfoodeaters practiceand the bowlfoodeaters practice and the laterfoodrefusers practice will be well kept by one who keeps the onesessioners practiceAnd what need has one who keeps the openairdwellers practice to keep the treerootdwellers practice or the anybedusers practiceSo there are these three principal practices that together with the five individual practices that is to say the forestdwellers practice the refuseragwearers practice the triplerobewearers practice the sitters practice and the charnelgrounddwellers practice come to eight onlyAgain they come to four that is to say two connected with robes five connected with alms food five connected with the resting place and one connected with energyHerein it is the sitters practice that is connected with energythe rest are obviousAgain they all amount to two only since twelve are dependent on requisites and one on energyAlso they are two according to what is and what is not to be cultivatedFor when one cultivating an ascetic practice finds that his meditation subject improves he should cultivate itbut when he is cultivating one and finds that his meditation subject deteriorates he should not cultivate itBut when he finds that whether he cultivates one or not his meditation subject only improves and does not deteriorate he should cultivate them out of compassion for later generationsAnd when he finds that whether he cultivates them or not his meditation subject does not improve he should still cultivate them for the sake of acquiring the habit for the futureSo they are of two kinds as what is and what is not to be cultivated And all are of one kind as volitionFor there is only one ascetic practice namely that consisting in the volition of undertakingAlso it is said in the Commentary It is the volition that is the ascetic practice they say Singly with thirteen for bhikkhus eight for bhikkhunīs twelve for novices seven for female probationers and female novices and two for male and female lay followers there are thus fortytwoIf there is a charnel ground in the open that complies with the forestdwellers practice one bhikkhu is able to put all the ascetic practices into effect simultaneouslyBut the two namely the forestdwellers practice and the laterfoodrefusers practice are forbidden to bhikkhunīs by training precept And it is hard for them to observe the three namely the openairdwellers practice the treeroot dwellers practice and the charnelgrounddwellers practicebecause a bhikkhunī is not allowed to live without a companionand it is hard to find a female companion with like desire for such a placeand even if available she would not escape having to live in companyThis being so the purpose of cultivating the ascetic practice would scarcely be servedIt is because they are reduced by five owing to this inability to make use of certain of them that they are to be understood as eight only for bhikkhunīsExcept for the triplerobewearers practice all the other twelve as stated should be understood to be for novices and all the other seven for female probationers and female novicesThe two namely the onesessioners practice and the bowlfoodeaters practice are proper for male and female lay followers to employ In this way there are two ascetic practices This is the commentary as to groups and also singlyAnd this is the end of the treatise on the ascetic practices to be undertaken for the purpose of perfecting those special qualities of fewness of wishes contentment etc by means of which there comes about the cleansing of virtue as described in the Path of Purification which is shown under the three headings of virtue concentration and understanding contained in the stanza When a wise man established well in virtue  in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peopleThe second chapter called The Description of the Ascetic PracticesNow concentration is described under the heading of consciousness in the phrase develops consciousness and understanding  It should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that has been purified by means of the special qualities of fewness of wishes etc and perfected by observance of the ascetic practicesBut that concentration has been shown only very briefly and so it is not even easy to understand much less to develop There is therefore the following set of questions the purpose of which is to show the method of its development in detail What is concentration In what sense is it concentration What are its characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause How many kinds of concentration are there What is its defilement What is its cleansing How should it be developed What are the benefits of the development of concentrationHere are the answers WHAT IS CONCENTRATION Concentration is of many sorts and has various aspectsAn answer that attempted to cover it all would accomplish neither its intention nor its purpose and would besides lead to distraction so we shall confine ourselves to the kind intended here calling concentration profitable unification of mind IN WHAT SENSE IS IT CONCENTRATION It is concentration in the sense of concentrating What is this concentratingIt is the centring of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants evenly and rightly on a single object placing is what is meantSo it is the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object undistracted and unscattered that should be understood as concentrating WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION MANIFESTATION AND PROXIMATE CAUSE Concentration has nondistraction as its characteristic Its function is to eliminate distraction It is manifested as nonwaveringBecause of the words Being blissful his mind becomes concentrated  its proximate cause is bliss HOW MANY KINDS OF CONCENTRATION ARE THERE First of all it is of one kind with the characteristic of nondistraction Then it is of two kinds as access and absorption likewise as mundane and supramundane as with happiness and without happiness and as accompanied by bliss and accompanied by equanimityIt is of three kinds as inferior medium and superior likewise as with applied thought and sustained thought etc as accompanied by happiness etc and as limited exalted and measurelessIt is of four kinds as of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge etc likewise as limited with limited object etc according to the factors of the four jhānas as partaking of diminution etc as of the sense sphere etc and as predominance and so on It is of five kinds according to the factors of the five jhānas reckoned by the fivefold methodHerein the section dealing with that of one kind is evident in meaning In the section dealing with that of two kinds access concentration is the unification of mind obtained by the following that is to say the six recollections mindfulness of death the recollection of peace the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment and the defining of the four elements and it is the unification that precedes absorption concentrationAbsorption concentration is the unification that follows immediately upon the preliminarywork because of the words The firstjhāna preliminarywork is a condition as proximity condition for the first jhāna  So it is of two kinds as access and absorptionIn the second dyad mundane concentration is profitable unification of mind in the three planesSupramundane concentration is the unification associated with the noble paths So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundaneIn the third dyad concentration with happiness is the unification of mind in two jhānas in the fourfold reckoning and in three jhānas in the fivefold reckoningConcentration without happiness is the unification in the remaining two jhānasBut access concentration may be with happiness or without happiness So it is of two kinds as with happiness and without happinessIn the fourth dyad concentration accompanied by bliss is the unification in three jhānas in the fourfold and four in the fivefold reckoningThat accompanied by equanimity is that in the remaining jhānaAccess concentration may be accompanied by bliss or accompanied by equanimity So it is of two kinds as accompanied by bliss and accompanied by equanimity In the first of the triads what has only just been acquired is inferior What is not very well developed is medium What is well developed and has reached mastery is superior So it is of three kinds as inferior medium and superiorIn the second triad that with applied thought and sustained thought is the concentration of the first jhāna together with access concentrationThat without applied thought with sustained thought only is the concentration of the second jhāna in the fivefold reckoningFor when a man sees danger only in applied thought and not in sustained thought he aspires only to abandon applied thought when he passes beyond the first jhāna and so he obtains concentration without applied thought and with sustained thought onlyThis is said with reference to himConcentration without applied thought and sustained thought is the unification in the three jhānas beginning with the second in the fourfold reckoning and with the third in the fivefold reckoning  So it is of three kinds as with applied thought and sustained thought and so on In the third triad concentration accompanied by happiness is the unification in the two first jhānas in the fourfold reckoning and in the three first jhānas in the fivefold reckoningConcentration accompanied by bliss is the unification in those same jhānas and in the third and the fourth respectively in the two reckoningsThat accompanied by equanimity is that in the remaining jhānaAccess concentration may be accompanied by bliss and happiness or accompanied by equanimity So it is of three kinds as accompanied by happiness and so onIn the fourth triad limited concentration is unification on the plane of accessExalted concentration is unification in profitable consciousness etc of the fine material sphere and immaterial sphereMeasureless concentration is unification associated with the noble paths So it is of three kinds as limited exalted and measureless In the first of the tetrads there is concentration of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge There is that of difficult progress and swift direct knowledge There is that of easy progress and sluggish directknowledge And there is that of easy progress and swift directknowledgeHerein the development of concentration that occurs from the time of the first conscious reaction up to the arising of the access of a given jhāna is called progressAnd the understanding that occurs from the time of access until absorption is called directknowledgeThat progress is difficult for some being troublesome owing to the tenacious resistance of the inimical states beginning with the hindrances The meaning is that it is cultivated without easeIt is easy for others because of the absence of those difficultiesAlso the directknowledge is sluggish in some and occurs slowly not quicklyIn others it is swift and occurs rapidly not slowlyHerein we shall comment below upon the suitable and unsuitable  the preparatory tasks consisting in the severing of impediments  etc and skill in absorption  When a man cultivates what is unsuitable his progress is difficult and his directknowledge sluggishWhen he cultivates what is suitable his progress is easy and his directknowledge swiftBut if he cultivates the unsuitable in the earlier stage and the suitable in the later stage or if he cultivates the suitable in the earlier stage and the unsuitable in the later stage then it should be understood as mixed in his caseLikewise if he devotes himself to development without carrying out the preparatory tasks of severing impediments etc his progress is difficultIt is easy in the opposite caseAnd if he is not accomplished in skill in absorption his direct knowledge is sluggishIt is swift if he is so accomplished Besides they should be understood as classed according to craving and ignorance and according to whether one has had practice in serenity and insightFor if a man is overwhelmed by craving his progress is difficultIf not it is easyAnd if he is overwhelmed by ignorance his directknowledge is sluggishIf not it is swiftAnd if he has had no practice in serenity his progress is difficultIf he has it is easyAnd if he has had no practice in insight his directknowledge is sluggish If he has it is swiftAlso they should be understood as classed according to defilements and facultiesFor if a mans defilements are sharp and his faculties dull then his progress is difficult and his directknowledge sluggish but if his faculties are keen his directknowledge is swiftAnd if his defilements are blunt and his faculties dull then his progress is easy and his directknowledge sluggishbut if his faculties are keen his directknowledge is swiftSo as regards this progress and this directknowledge when a person reaches concentration with difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge his concentration is called concentration of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledgesimilarly in the cases of the remaining three So it is of four kinds as of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge and so on In the second tetrad there is limited concentration with a limited object there is limited concentration with a measureless object there is measureless concentration with a limited object and there is measureless concentration with a measureless objectHerein concentration that is unfamiliar and incapable of being a condition for a higher jhāna is limitedWhen it occurs with an unextended object  it is with a limited objectWhen it is familiar well developed and capable of being a condition for a higher jhāna it is measurelessAnd when it occurs with an extended object it is with a measureless objectThe mixed method can be understood as the mixture of the characteristics already statedSo it is of four kinds as limited with limited object and so on In the third tetrad the first jhāna has five factors that is to say applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss and concentration following suppression of the hindrances The second has the three factors remaining after the elimination of applied and sustained thought The third has two factors with the fading away of happiness The fourth where bliss is abandoned has two factors with concentration and the equanimous feeling that accompanies itThus there are four kinds of concentration according to the factors of these four jhānasSo it is of four kinds according to the factors of the four jhānas In the fourth tetrad there is concentration partaking of diminution there is concentration partaking of stagnation there is concentration partaking of distinction and there is concentration partaking of penetrationHerein it should be understood that the state of partaking of diminution is accessibility to opposition the state of partaking of stagnation is stationariness of the mindfulness that is in conformity with that concentration the state of partaking of distinction is the attaining of higher distinction and the state of partaking of penetration is accessibility to perception and attention accompanied by dispassionaccording as it is said When a man has attained the first jhāna and he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire then his understanding partakes of diminutionWhen his mindfulness that is in conformity with that stagnates then his understanding partakes of stagnationWhen he is accessible to perception and attention unaccompanied by applied thought then his understanding partakes of distinctionWhen he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by dispassion and directed to fading away then his understanding partakes of penetration The kinds of concentration associated with that fourfold understanding are also four in numberSo it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution and so on In the fifth tetrad there are the following four kinds of concentration that is to say sensesphere concentration finematerialsphere concentration immaterial sphere concentration and unincluded that is path concentrationHerein sense sphere concentration is all kinds of access unificationLikewise the other three are respectively profitable unification of mind associated with finematerial immaterial and path jhāna So it is of four kinds as of the sensesphere and so on In the sixth tetrad If a bhikkhu obtains concentration obtains unification of mind by making zeal predominant this is called concentration due to zeal If  by making energy predominant  If  by making natural purity of consciousness predominant If  by making inquiry predominant this is called concentration due to inquiry  So it is of four kinds as predominance In the pentad there are five jhānas by dividing in two what is called the second jhāna in the fourfold reckoning  taking the second jhāna to be due to the surmounting of only applied thought and the third jhāna to be due to the surmounting of both applied and sustained thought There are five kinds of concentration according to the factors of these five jhānasSo its fivefoldness should be understood according to the five sets of jhāna factors What is its defilement What is its cleansingHere the answer is given in the Vibhaṅga Defilement is the state partaking of diminutioncleansing is the state partaking of distinction Herein the state partaking of diminution should be understood in this way When a man has attained the first jhāna and he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire then his understanding partakes of diminution And the state partaking of distinction should be understood in this way When he is accessible to perception and attention unaccompanied by applied thought then his understanding partakes of distinction  How should it be developed The method of developing the kind of concentration associated with the noble paths mentioned under that of two kinds as mundane and supramundane etc is included in the method of developing understandingfor in developing path understanding that is developed tooSo we shall say nothing separately here about how that is to be developedBut mundane concentration should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that is quite purified in the way already stated He should sever any of the ten impediments that he may have He should then approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration andThe detail is this Firstly it was said above he should sever any of the ten impediments that he may haveA dwelling family and gain A class and building too as fifthAnd travel kin affliction books And supernormal powers tenNow the ten impediments are Herein the dwelling itself is the impediment due to the dwellingSo too with the family and so on Herein a single inner room or a single hut or a whole monastery for the Community is called a dwellingThis is not an impediment for everyoneIt is an impediment only for anyone whose mind is exercised about the building etc that goes on there or who has many belongings stored there or whose mind is caught up by some business connected with it For any other it is not an impediment Here is a relevant story Two clansmen left Anurādhapura it seems and eventually went forth at the ThūpārāmaOne of them made himself familiar with the Two Codes and when he had acquired five years seniority he took part in the Pavāraṇā and then left for the place called PācīnakhaṇḍarājīThe other stayed on where he wasNow when the one who had gone to Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī had lived there a long time and had become an elder he thought This place is good for retreat suppose I told my friend about itSo he set out and in due course he entered the ThūpārāmaAs he entered the elder of the same seniority saw him went to meet him took his bowl and robe and did the dutiesThe visiting elder went into his lodging He thought Now my friend will be sending me ghee or molasses or a drinkfor he has lived long in this cityHe got nothing that night and in the morning he thought Now he will be sending me rice gruel and solid food sent by his supportersWhen he saw none he thought There is no one to bring it No doubt they will give it when we go into the town Early in the morning they went into the town togetherWhen they had wandered through one street and had got only a ladleful of gruel they sat down in a sitting hall to drink itThen the visitor thought Perhaps there is no individual giving of gruel But as soon as it is the time for the meal people will give special food But when it was time for the meal they ate what they had got by wandering for alms Then the visitor said Venerable sir how is this Do you live in this way all the time Yes friendVenerable sir Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī is comfortable let us go thereNow as the elder came out from the city by the southern gate he took the Kumbhakāragāma road which leads to PācīnakhaṇḍarājīThe visitor asked But venerable sir why do you take this roadDid you not recommend Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī friendBut how is this venerable sir have you no extra belongings in the place you have lived in for so longThat is so friend The bed and chair belong to the Community and they are put away as usual There is nothing elseBut venerable sir I have left my staff and my oil tube and my sandal bag thereHave you already collected so much friend living there for just one dayYes venerable sirHe was glad in his heart and he paid homage to the elder For those like you venerable sir everywhere is a forest dwellingThe Thūpārāma is a place where the relics of four Buddhas are deposited there is suitable hearing of the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace there is the Great Shrine to be seen and one can visit elders It is like the time of the BuddhaIt is here that you should live On the following day he took his bowl and outer robe and went away by himselfIt is no impediment for one like that Family means a family consisting of relatives or of supportersFor even a family consisting of supporters is an impediment for someone who lives in close association with it in the way beginning He is pleased when they are pleased  and who does not even go to a neighbouring monastery to hear the Dhamma without members of the familyBut even mother and father are not an impediment for another as in the case of the young bhikkhu the nephew of the elder who lived at the Koraṇḍaka MonasteryHe went to Rohaṇa for instruction it seemsThe elders sister who was a lay devotee was always asking the elder how her son was getting onOne day the elder set out for Rohaṇa to fetch him backThe young bhikkhu too thought I have lived here for a long time Now I might go and visit my preceptor and find out how the lay devotee is and he left RohaṇaThe two met on the banks of the Mahaveli RiverHe did the duties to the elder at the foot of a tree When asked Where are you going  he told him his purposeThe elder said You have done well The lay devotee is always asking after you That was why I came You may go but I shall stay here for the Rains and he dismissed himHe arrived at the monastery on the actual day for taking up residence for the RainsThe lodging allotted to him happened to be the one for which his father had undertaken responsibilityHis father came on the following day and asked To whom was our lodging allotted venerable sirs  When he heard that it had fallen to a young visitor he went to him After paying homage to him he said Venerable sir there is an obligation for him who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging What is it lay followerIt is to take alms food only in our house for the three months and to let us know the time of departure after the Pavāraṇā ceremonyHe consented in silenceThe lay devotee went home and told his wife There is a visiting lord who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging He must be carefully looked afterand she agreed She prepared good food of various kinds for himThough the youth went to his relatives home at the time of the mealno one recognized him When he had eaten alms food there during the three months and had completed the residence for the Rains he announced his departureThen his relatives said Let it be tomorrow venerable sir and on the following day when they had fed him in their house and filled his oil tube and given him a lump of sugar and a ninecubit length of cloth they said Now you are leaving venerable sirHe gave his blessing and set out for RohaṇaHis preceptor had completed the Pavāraṇā ceremony and was on his way back They met at the same place as beforeHe did the duties to the elder at the foot of a treeThe elder asked him How was it my dear did you see the good woman lay devotee He replied Yes venerable sir and he told him all that had happened He then anointed the elders feet with the oil made him a drink with the sugar and presented him with the length of cloth He then after paying homage to the elder told him Venerable sir only Rohaṇa suits me and he departedThe elder too arrived back at his monastery and next day he went into the village of KoraṇḍakaThe lay devotee his sister had always kept looking down the road thinking My brother is now coming with my sonWhen she saw him coming alone she thought My son must be dead that is why the elder is coming alone and she fell at the elders feet lamenting and weepingSuspecting that it must have been out of fewness of wishes that the youth had gone away without announcing himself the elder comforted her and told her all that had happened and he took the length of cloth out of his bag and showed it to herShe was appeased She prostrated herself in the direction taken by her son and she said Surely the Blessed One taught the way of the Rathavinīta the way of the Nālaka the way of the Tuvaṭaka and the way of the great Noble Ones heritages showing contentment with the four requisites and delight in development making a bhikkhu such as my son a bodywitnessSo although for three months he ate in the house of the mother who bore him yet he never said I am your son you are my mother Oh admirable man Even mother and father are no impediment for one such as him so how much less any other family that supports him Gain is the four requisitesHow are they an impedimentWherever a meritorious bhikkhu goes people give him a large supply of requisitesWith giving blessings to them and teaching them the Dhamma he gets no chance to do the ascetics dutiesFrom sunrise till the first watch of the night he never breaks his association with peopleAgain even at dawn almsfood eaters fond of opulence come and say Venerable sir such and such a man lay follower woman lay follower friend friends daughter wants to see you and being ready to go he replies Take the bowl and robe friend So he is always on the alert Thus these requisites are an impediment for himHe should leave his group and wander by himself where he is not knownThis is the way his impediment is severed Class is a class of students of suttas or students of Abhidhamma If with the groups instruction and questioning he gets no opportunity for the ascetics duties then that group is an impediment for him He should sever that impediment in this wayif those bhikkhus have already acquired the main part and little still remains he should finish that off and then go to the forestIf they have only acquired little and much still remains he should without travelling more than a league approach another instructor of a class within the radius of a league and say Help those venerable ones with instruction etcIf he does not find anyone in this way he should take leave of the class saying I have a task to see to friends go where it suits you and he should do his own work Building is new building work Since one engaged in this must know about what material has and has not been got by carpenters etc and must see about what has and has not been done it is always an impedimentIt should be severed in this way If little remains it should be completedIf much remains it should be handed over to the Community or to bhikkhus who are entrusted with the Communitys affairs if it is a new building for the Communityor if it is for himself it should be handed over to those whom he entrusts with his own affairsbut if these are not available he should relinquish it to the Community and depart Travel is going on a journeyIf someone is expected to give the going forth somewhere else or if some requisite is obtainable thereand he cannot rest content without getting it that will be an impediment for even if he goes into the forest to do the ascetics duties he will find it hard to get rid of thoughts about the journey So one in this position should apply himself to the ascetics duties after he has done the journey and transacted the business Kin in the case of the monastery means teacher preceptor coresident pupil those with the same preceptor as oneself and those with the same teacher as oneself and in the case of the house it means mother father brother and so onWhen they are sick they are an impediment for him Therefore that impediment should be severed by curing them with nursingHerein when the preceptor is sick he must be cared for as long as life lasts if the sickness does not soon departLikewise the teacher at the going forth the teacher at the admission the coresident the pupils to whom one has given the admission and the going forth and those who have the same preceptorBut the teacher from whom one takes the dependence the teacher who gives one instruction the pupil to whom one has given the dependence the pupil to whom one is giving instruction and those who have that same teacher as oneself should be looked after as long as the dependence or the instruction has not been terminatedIf one is able to do so one should look after them even beyond that periodMother and father should be treated like the preceptorif they live within the kingdom and look to their son for help it should be givenAlso if they have no medicine he should give them his ownIf he has none he should go in search of it as alms and give thatBut in the case of brothers or sisters one should only give them what is theirsIf they have none then one should give ones own temporarily and later get it backbut one should not complain if one does not get it backIt is not allowed either to make medicine for or to give it to a sisters husband who is not related by bloodbut one can give it to ones sister saying Give it to your husbandThe same applies to ones brothers wifeBut it is allowed to make it for their children since they are blood relatives Affliction is any kind of illnessIt is an impediment when it is actually afflicting therefore it should be severed by treatment with medicineBut if it is not cured after taking medicine for a few days then the ascetics duties should be done after apostrophizing ones person in this way I am not your slave or your hireling I have come to suffering through maintaining you through the beginningless round of rebirths Books means responsibility for the scripturesThat is an impediment only for one who is constantly busy with recitations etc but not for othersHere are relevant storiesThe Elder Revata it seems the Majjhima reciter went to the Elder Revata the dweller in Malaya  and asked him for a meditation subjectThe elder asked him How are you in the scriptures friendI am studying the Majjhima Nikāya venerable sirThe Majjhima is a hard responsibility friend When a man is still learning the First Fifty by heart he is faced with the Middle Fifty and when he is still learning that by heart he is faced with the Last FiftyHow can you take up a meditation subjectVenerable sir when I have taken a meditation subject from you I shall not look at the scriptures again He took the meditation subject and doing no recitation for nineteen years he reached Arahantship in the twentieth year He told bhikkhus who came for recitation I have not looked at the scriptures for twenty years friends yet I am familiar with them You may begin And from beginning to end he had no hesitation even over a single syllableThe Elder MahāNāga too who lived at Karuliyagiri put aside the scriptures for eighteen years and then he recited the Dhātukathā to the bhikkhusWhen they checked this with the towndwelling elders of Anurādha pura not a single question was found out of its orderIn the Great Monastery too the Elder TipiṭakaCūḷaAbhaya had the golden drum struck saying I shall expound the three Piṭakas in the circle of experts in the Five Collections of discourses and this was before he had learnt the commentariesThe Community of Bhikkhus said Which teachers teaching is it Unless you give only the teaching of our own teachers we shall not let you speakAlso his preceptor asked him when he went to wait on him Did you have the drum beaten friendYes venerable sirFor what reasonI shall expound the scriptures venerable sirFriend Abhaya how do the teachers explain this passageThey explain it in this way venerable sirThe elder dissented saying HumAgain three times each time in a different way he said They explain it in this way venerable sirThe elder always dissented saying Hum Then he said Friend your first explanation was the way of the teachers But it is because you have not actually learnt it from the teachers lips that you are unable to maintain that the teachers say such and suchGo and learn it from our own teachersWhere shall I go venerable sirThere is an elder named Mahā Dhammarakkhita living in the Tulādhārapabbata Monastery in the Rohaṇa country beyond the Mahaveli River He knows all the scriptures Go to himSaying Good venerable sir he paid homage to the elder He went with five hundred bhikkhus to the Elder MahāDhammarakkhita and when he had paid homage to him he sat downThe elder asked Why have you comeTo hear the Dhamma venerable sirFriend Abhaya they ask me about the Dīgha and the Majjhima from time to timebut I have not looked at the others for thirty yearsStill you may repeat them in my presence by nightand I shall explain them to you by dayHe said Good venerable sir and he acted accordinglyThe inhabitants of the village had a large pavilion built at the door of his dwelling and they came daily to hear the Dhammawhat had been repeated by nightexplaining by day the Elder Dhammarakkhita eventually completed the instruction Then he sat down on a mat on the ground before the Elder Abhaya and said Friend explain a meditation subject to meWhat are you saying venerable sir have I not heard it all from youWhat can I explain to you that you do not already know The senior elder said This path is different for one who has actually travelled byThe Elder Abhaya was then it seems a streamentererWhen the Elder Abhaya had given his teacher a meditation subject he returned to Anurādhapura Later while he was expounding the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace he heard that the elder had attained NibbānaOn hearing this he said Bring me my robe friends Then he put on the robe and said The Arahant path befits our teacher friendsOur teacher was a true thoroughbredHe sat down on a mat before his own Dhamma pupil and said Explain a meditation subject to meThe Arahant path befits our teacher friendsFor such as these books are no impediment Supernormal powers are the supernormal powers of the ordinary manThey are hard to maintain like a prone infant or like young cornand the slightest thing breaks themBut they are an impediment for insight not for concentration since they are obtainable through concentrationSo the supernormal powers are an impediment that should be severed by one who seeks insight the others are impediments to be severed by one who seeks concentration This in the first place is the detailed explanation of the impedimentsApproach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject  meditation subjects are of two kinds that is generally useful meditation subjects and special meditation subjectsHerein lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus etc and also mindfulness of death are what are called generally useful meditation subjectsSome say perception of foulness too When a bhikkhu takes up a meditation subject he should first develop lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus within the boundary limiting it at first to all bhikkhus in this monastery in this way May they be happy and free from afflictionThen he should develop it towards all deities within the boundaryThen towards all the principal people in the village that is his alms resortthen to all human beings there and to all living beings dependent on the human beingsWith lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus he produces kindliness in his coresidentsthen they are easy for him to live withWith lovingkindness towards the deities within the boundary he is protected by kindly deities with lawful protectionWith loving kindness towards the principal people in the village that is his alms resort his requisites are protected by welldisposed principal people with lawful protectionWith lovingkindness to all human beings there he goes about without incurring their dislike since they trust himWith lovingkindness to all living beings he can wander unhindered everywhereWith mindfulness of death thinking I have got to die he gives up improper search  and with a growing sense of urgency he comes to live without attachmentWhen his mind is familiar with the perception of foulness then even divine objects do not tempt his mind to greedSo these are called generally useful and they are called meditation subjects since they are needed generally and desirable owing to their great helpfulness and since they are subjects for the meditation work intendedWhat is called a special meditation subject is that one from among the forty meditation subjects that is suitable to a mans own temperament It is special because he must carry it constantly about with him and because it is the proximate cause for each higher stage of developmentSo it is the one who gives this twofold meditation subject that is called the giver of a meditation subjectThe good friendHe is revered and dearly loved And one who speaks and suffers speechThe speech he utters is profound He does not urge without a reason and so on is one who possesses such special qualities as these  He is wholly solicitous of welfare and partial to progressBecause of the words beginning nanda it is owing to my being a good friend to them that living beings subject to birth are freed from birth  it is only the Fully Enlightened One who possesses all the aspects of the good friendSince that is so while he is available only a meditation subject taken in the Blessed Ones presence is well takenBut after his final attainment of Nibbāna it is proper to take it from anyone of the eighty great disciples still livingWhen they are no more available one who wants to take a particular meditation subject should take it from someone with cankers destroyed who has by means of that particular meditation subject produced the fourfold and fivefold jhāna and has reached the destruction of cankers by augmenting insight that had that jhāna as its proximate causeBut how then does someone with cankers destroyed declare himself thus I am one whose cankers are destroyed Why not He declares himself when he knows that his instructions will be carried outDid not the Elder Assagutta spread out his leather mat in the air and sitting crosslegged on it explain a meditation subject to a bhikkhu who was starting his meditation subject because he knew that that bhikkhu was one who would carry out his instructions for the meditation subjectSo if someone with cankers destroyed is available that is good If not then one should take it from a nonreturner a oncereturner a streamenterer an ordinary man who has obtained jhāna one who knows three Piṭakas one who knows two Piṭakas one who knows one Piṭaka in descending order according as availableIf not even one who knows one Piṭaka is available then it should be taken from one who is familiar with one Collection together with its commentary and one who is himself conscientiousFor a teacher such as this who knows the texts guards the heritage and protects the tradition will follow the teachers opinion rather than his ownHence the Ancient Elders said three times One who is conscientious will guard itNow those beginning with one whose cankers are destroyed mentioned above will describe only the path they have themselves reachedBut with a learned man his instructions and his answers to questions are purified by his having approached such and such teachers and so he will explain a meditation subject showing a broad track like a big elephant going through a stretch of jungle and he will select suttas and reasons from here and there adding explanations of what is suitable and unsuitableSo a meditation subject should be taken by approaching the good friend such as this the giver of a meditation subject and by doing all the duties to himIf he is available in the same monastery it is good If not one should go to where he livesWhen a bhikkhu goes to him he should not do so with feet washed and anointed wearing sandals with an umbrella surrounded by pupils and bringing oil tube honey molasses etche should do so fulfilling the duties of a bhikkhu setting out on a journey carrying his bowl and robes himself doing all the duties in each monastery on the way with few belongings and living in the greatest effacementWhen entering that monastery he should do so expecting nothing and even provided with a toothstick that he has had made allowable on the way according to the rules And he should not enter some other room thinking I shall go to the teacher after resting awhile and after washing and anointing my feet and so onWhyIf there are bhikkhus there who are hostile to the teacher they might ask him the reason for his coming and speak dispraise of the teacher saying You are done for if you go to him they might make him regret his coming and turn him back So he should ask for the teachers dwelling and go straight thereIf the teacher is junior he should not consent to the teachers receiving his bowl and robe and so onIf the teacher is senior then he should go and pay homage to him and remain standingWhen told Put down the bowl and robe friend he may put them downWhen told Have some water to drink he can drink if he wants toWhen told You may wash your feet he should not do so at oncefor if the water has been brought by the teacher himself it would be improperBut when told Wash friend it was not brought by me it was brought by others then he can wash his feet sitting in a screened place out of sight of the teacher or in the open to one side of the dwellingIf the teacher brings an oil tube he should get up and take it carefully with both handsIf he did not take it it might make the teacher wonder Does this bhikkhu resent sharing so soon but having taken it he should not anoint his feet at onceFor if it were oil for anointing the teachers limbs it would not be properSo he should first anoint his head then his shoulders etcbut when told This is meant for all the limbs friend anoint your feet he should put a little on his head and then anoint his feet Then he should give it back saying when the teacher takes it May I return this oil tube venerable sir He should not say Explain a meditation subject to me venerable sir on the very day he arrivesBut starting from the next day he can if the teacher has a habitual attendant ask his permission to do the dutiesIf he does not allow it when asked they can be done when the opportunity offersWhen he does them three toothsticks should be brought a small a medium and a big oneand two kinds of mouthwashing water and bathing water that is hot and cold should be set outWhichever of these the teacher uses for three days should then be brought regularlyIf the teacher uses either kind indiscriminately he can bring whatever is availableWhy so many wordsas by the Blessed One  Bhikkhus a pupil should perform the duties to the teacher rightlyHerein this is the right performance of duties He should rise early removing his sandals and arranging his robe on one shoulder he should give the toothsticks and the mouthwashing water and he should prepare the seatIf there is rice gruel he should wash the dish and bring the rice gruel  All should be done as prescribed in the Khandhakas as the right duties in the passage beginning To please the teacher by perfection in the duties he should pay homage in the evening and he should leave when dismissed with the words You may go When the teacher asks him Why have you come he can explain the reason for his comingIf he does not ask but agrees to the duties being done then after ten days or a fortnight have gone by he should make an opportunity by staying back one day at the time of his dismissal and announcing the reason for his comingor he should go at an unaccustomed time and when asked What have you come for  he can announce itIf the teacher says Come in the morning he should do soBut if his stomach burns with a bile affliction at that hour or if his food does not get digested owing to sluggish digestive heat or if some other ailment afflicts him he should let it be known and proposing a time that suits himself he should come at that timeFor if a meditation subject is expounded at an inconvenient time one cannot give attentionThis is the detailed explanation of the words approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subjectNow as to the words one that suits his temperament  there are six kinds of temperament that is greedy temperament hating temperament deluded temperament faithful temperament intelligent temperament and speculative temperamentSome would have fourteen taking these six single ones together with the four made up of the three double combinations and one triple combination with the greed triad and likewise with the faith triadBut if this classification is admitted there are many more kinds of temperament possible by combining greed etc with faith etc therefore the kinds of temperament should be understood briefly as only sixAs to meaning the temperaments are one that is to say personal nature idiosyncrasyAccording to these there are only six types of persons that is one of greedy temperament one of hating temperament one of deluded temperament one of faithful temperament one of intelligent temperament and one of speculative temperamentHerein one of faithful temperament is parallel to one of greedy temperament because faith is strong when profitable kamma occurs in one of greedy temperament owing to its special qualities being near to those of greedFor in an unprofitable way greed is affectionate and not overaustere and so in a profitable way is faithGreed seeks out sense desires as object while faith seeks out the special qualities of virtue and so onAnd greed does not give up what is harmful while faith does not give up what is beneficialOne of intelligent temperament is parallel to one of hating temperament because understanding is strong when profitable kamma occurs in one of hating temperament owing to its special qualities being near to those of hateFor in an unprofitable way hate is disaffected and does not hold to its object and so in a profitable way is understandingHate seeks out only unreal faults while understanding seeks out only real faultsAnd hate occurs in the mode of condemning living beings while understanding occurs in the mode of condemning formationsOne of speculative temperament is parallel to one of deluded temperament because obstructive applied thoughts arise often in one of deluded temperament who is striving to arouse unarisen profitable states owing to their special qualities being near to those of delusionFor just as delusion is restless owing to perplexity so are applied thoughts that are due to thinking over various aspectsAnd just as delusion vacillates owing to superficialityso do applied thoughts that are due to facile conjecturingOthers say that there are three more kinds of temperament with craving pride and viewsHerein craving is simply greed and pride is associated with that so neither of them exceeds greedAnd since views have their source in delusion the temperament of views falls within the deluded temperamentWhat is the source of these temperamentsAnd how is it to be known that such a person is of greedy temperament that such a person is of one of those beginning with hating temperamentWhat suits one of what kind of temperamentHerein as some say the first three kinds of temperament to begin with have their source in previous habit and they have their source in elements and humoursApparently one of greedy temperament has formerly had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying work to do or has reappeared here after dying in a heavenAnd one of hating temperament has formerly had plenty of stabbing and torturing and brutal work to do or has reappeared here after dying in one of the hells or the nāga existencesAnd one of deluded temperament has formerly drunk a lot of intoxicants and neglected learning and questioning or has reappeared here after dying in the animal existence It is in this way that they have their source in previous habit they say Then a person is of deluded temperament because two elements are prominent that is to say the earth element and the water elementHe is of hating temperament because the other two elements are prominentBut he is of greedy temperament because all four are equalAnd as regards the humours one of greedy temperament has phlegm in excessand one of deluded temperament has wind in excessOr one of deluded temperament has phlegm in excessand one of greedy temperament has wind in excess So they have their source in the elements and the humours they sayNow it can rightly be objected that not all of those who have had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying work to do and who have reappeared here after dying in a heaven are of greedy temperament or the others respectively of hating and deluded temperamentand there is no such law of prominence of elements as that assertedand only the pair greed and delusion are given in the law of humours and even that subsequently contradicts itselfand no source for even one among those beginning with one of faithful temperament is givenConsequently this definition is indecisiveThe following is the exposition according to the opinion of the teachers of the commentaries or this is said in the explanation of prominence The fact that these beings have prominence of greed prominence of hate prominence of delusion is governed by previous rootcauseFor when in one man at the moment of his accumulating rebirthproducing kamma greed is strong and nongreed is weak nonhate and nondelusion are strong and hate and delusion are weak then his weak nongreed is unable to prevail over his greedbut his nonhate and nondelusion being strong are able to prevail over his hate and delusionThat is why on being reborn through rebirthlinking given by that kamma he has greed is goodnatured and unangry and possesses understanding with knowledge like a lightning flashWhen at the moment of anothers accumulating kamma greed and hate are strong and nongreed and nonhate weak and nondelusion is strong and delusion weak then in the way already stated he has both greed and hatebut possesses understanding with knowledge like a lightning flash like the Elder DattaAbhayaWhen at the moment of his accumulating kamma greed nonhate and delusion are strong and the others are weak then in the way already stated he both has greed and is dull but is goodtempered and unangry like the Elder BahulaLikewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma the three namely greed hate and delusion are strong and nongreed etc are weak then in the way already stated he has both greed and hate and is deluded When at the moment of his accumulating kamma nongreed hate and delusion are strong and the others are weak then in the way already stated he has little defilement and is unshakable even on seeing a heavenly object but he has hate and is slow in understandingWhen at the moment of his accumulating kamma nongreed nonhate and nondelusion are strong and the rest weak then in the way already stated he has no greed and no hate and is goodtempered but slow in understandingLikewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma nongreed hate and nondelusion are strong and the rest weak then in the way already stated he both has no greed and possesses understanding but has hate and is irascibleLikewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma the three that is nonhate nongreed and nondelusion are strong and greed etc are weak then in the way already stated he has no greed and no hate and possesses understanding like the Elder MahāSaṅgharakkhita One who as it is said here has greed is one of greedy temperamentone who has hate and one who is dull are respectively of hating temperament and deluded temperamentOne who possesses understanding is one of intelligent temperamentOne who has no greed and one who has no hate are of faithful temperament because they are naturally trustfulOr just as one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by nondelusion is of intelligent temperament so one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by strong faith is of faithful temperamentone who is reborn through kamma accompanied by thoughts of sense desire is of speculative temperamentand one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by mixed greed etc is of mixed temperamentSo it is the kamma productive of rebirthlinking and accompanied by someone among the things beginning with greed that should be understood as the source of the temperaments But it was asked and how is it to be known that This person is of greedy temperament   and so onThis is explained as followsBy the posture by the action By eating seeing and so onBy the kind of states occurring May temperament be recognized Herein by the posture when one of greedy temperament is walking in his usual manner he walks carefully puts his foot down slowly puts it down evenly lifts it up evenly and his step is springyOne of hating temperament walks as though he were digging with the points of his feet puts his foot down quickly lifts it up quickly and his step is dragged alongOne of deluded temperament walks with a perplexed gait puts his foot down hesitantly lifts it up hesitantly and his step is pressed down suddenlyAnd this is said in the account of the origin of the Māgandiya SuttaThe step of one of greedy nature will be springyThe step of one of hating nature dragged alongDeluded he will suddenly press down his stepAnd one without defilement has a step like thisThe stance of one of greedy temperament is confident and graceful That of one of hating temperament is rigid That of one of deluded temperament is muddledlikewise in sittingAnd one of greedy temperament spreads his bed unhurriedly lies down slowly composing his limbs and he sleeps in a confident manner When woken instead of getting up quickly he gives his answer slowly as though doubtfulOne of hating temperament spreads his bed hastily anyhow with his body flung down he sleeps with a scowl When woken he gets up quickly and answers as though annoyedOne of deluded temperament spreads his bed all awry and sleeps mostly face downwards with his body sprawling When woken he gets up slowly saying Hum  Since those of faithful temperament etc are parallel to those of greedy temperament etc their postures are therefore like those described aboveThis firstly is how the temperaments may be recognized by the postureBy the action also in the acts of sweeping etc one of greedy temperament grasps the broom well and he sweeps cleanly and evenly without hurrying or scattering the sand as if he were strewing sinduvāra flowersOne of hating temperament grasps the broom tightly and he sweeps uncleanly and unevenly with a harsh noise hurriedly throwing up the sand on each sideOne of deluded temperament grasps the broom loosely and he sweeps neither cleanly nor evenly mixing the sand up and turning it overAs with sweeping so too with any action such as washing and dyeing robes and so on One of greedy temperament acts skilfully gently evenly and carefullyOne of hating temperament acts tensely stiffly and unevenlyOne of deluded temperament acts unskilfully as if muddled unevenly and indecisivelyAlso one of greedy temperament wears his robe neither too tightly nor too loosely confidently and level all roundOne of hating temperament wears it too tight and not level all roundOne of deluded temperament wears it loosely and in a muddled wayThose of faithful temperament etc should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallelThis is how the temperaments may be recognized by the actionsBy eating One of greedy temperament likes eating rich sweet food When eating he makes a round lump not too big and eats unhurriedly savouring the various tastes He enjoys getting something goodOne of hating temperament likes eating rough sour food When eating he makes a lump that fills his mouth and he eats hurriedly without savouring the taste He is aggrieved when he gets something not goodOne of deluded temperament has no settled choice When eating he makes a small unrounded lump and as he eats he drops bits into his dish smearing his face with his mind astray thinking of this and thatAlso those of faithful temperament etc should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallelThis is how the temperament may be recognized by eatingAnd by seeing and so on when one of greedy temperament sees even a slightly pleasing visible object he looks long as if surprised he seizes on trivial virtues discounts genuine faults and when departing he does so with regret as if unwilling to leaveWhen one of hating temperament sees even a slightly unpleasing visible object he avoids looking long as if he were tired he picks out trivial faults discounts genuine virtues and when departing he does so without regret as if anxious to leaveWhen one of deluded temperament sees any sort of visible object he copies what others do if he hears others criticizing he criticizes if he hears others praising he praises but actually he feels equanimity in himselfthe equanimity of unknowingSo too with sounds and so onAnd those of faithful temperament etc should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallelThis is how the temperaments may be recognized by seeing and so onBy the kind of states occurring in one of greedy temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as deceit fraud pride evilness of wishes greatness of wishes discontent foppery and personal vanityIn one of hating temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as anger enmity disparaging domineering envy and avariceIn one of deluded temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as stiffness torpor agitation worry uncertainty and holding on tenaciously with refusal to relinquishIn one of faithful temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as free generosity desire to see Noble Ones desire to hear the Good Dhamma great gladness ingenuousness honesty and trust in things that inspire trustIn one of intelligent temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as readiness to be spoken to possession of good friends knowledge of the right amount in eating mindfulness and full awareness devotion to wakefulness a sense of urgency about things that should inspire a sense of urgency and wisely directed endeavourIn one of speculative temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as talkativeness sociability boredom with devotion to the profitable failure to finish undertakings smoking by night and flaming by day  and mental running hither and thither This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the kind of states occurringHowever these directions for recognizing the temperaments have not been handed down in their entirety in either the texts or the commentaries they are only expressed according to the opinion of the teachers and cannot therefore be treated as authenticFor even those of hating temperament can exhibit postures etc ascribed to the greedy temperament when they try diligentlyAnd postures etc never arise with distinct characteristics in a person of mixed temperamentOnly such directions for recognizing temperament as are given in the commentaries should be treated as authenticfor this is said A teacher who has acquired penetration of minds will know the temperament and will explain a meditation subject accordingly one who has not should question the pupilSo it is by penetration of minds or by questioning the person that it can be knownwhether he is one of greedy temperament or one of those beginning with hating temperamentWhat suits one of what kind of temperament A suitable lodging for one of greedy temperament has an unwashed sill and stands level with the ground and it can be either an overhanging rock with an unprepared dripledge  a grass hut or a leaf house etc It ought to be spattered with dirt full of bats dilapidated too high or too low in bleak surroundings threatened by lions tigers etc with a muddy uneven path where even the bed and chair are full of bugs And it should be ugly and unsightly exciting loathing as soon as looked atSuitable inner and outer garments are those that have tornoff edges with threads hanging down all round like a net cake harsh to the touch like hemp soiled heavy and hard to wearAnd the right kind of bowl for him is an ugly clay bowl disfigured by stoppings and joints or a heavy and misshapen iron bowl as unappetizing as a skullThe right kind of road for him on which to wander for alms is disagreeable with no village near and unevenThe right kind of village for him in which to wander for alms is where people wander about as if oblivious of him where as he is about to leave without getting alms even from a single family people call him into the sitting hall saying Come venerable sir and give him gruel and rice but do so as casually as if they were putting a cow in a penSuitable people to serve him are slaves or workmen who are unsightly illfavoured with dirty clothes illsmelling and disgusting who serve him his gruel and rice as if they were throwing it rudely at himThe right kind of gruel and rice and hard food is poor unsightly made up of millet kudusaka broken rice etc stale buttermilk sour gruel curry of old vegetables or anything at all that is merely for filling the stomachThe right kind of posture for him is either standing or walkingThe object of his contemplation should be any of the colour kasiṇas beginning with the blue whose colour is not pure This is what suits one of greedy temperamentA suitable resting place for one of hating temperament is not too high or too low provided with shade and water with wellproportioned walls posts and steps with wellprepared frieze work and lattice work brightened with various kinds of painting with an even smooth soft floor adorned with festoons of flowers and a canopy of manycoloured cloth like a Brahmāgods divine palace with bed and chair covered with wellspread clean pretty covers smelling sweetly of flowers and perfumes and scents set about for homely comfort which makes one happy and glad at the mere sight of itThe right kind of road to his lodging is free from any sort of danger traverses clean even ground and has been properly preparedAnd here it is best that the lodgings furnishings are not too many in order to avoid hidingplaces for insects bugs snakes and rats even a single bed and chair onlyThe right kind of inner and outer garments for him are of any superior stuff such as China cloth Somāra cloth silk fine cotton fine linen of either single or double thickness quite light and well dyed quite pure in colour to befit an asceticThe right kind of bowl is made of iron as well shaped as a water bubble as polished as a gem spotless and of quite pure colour to befit an asceticThe right kind of road on which to wander for alms is free from dangers level agreeable with the village neither too far nor too nearThe right kind of village in which to wander for alms is where people thinking Now our lord is coming prepare a seat in a sprinkled swept place and going out to meet him take his bowl lead him to the house seat him on a prepared seat and serve him carefully with their own hands Suitable people to serve him are handsome pleasing well bathed well anointed scented with the perfume of incense and the smell of flowers adorned with apparel made of variouslydyed clean pretty cloth who do their work carefullyThe right kind of gruel rice and hard food has colour smell and taste possesses nutritive essence and is inviting superior in every way and enough for his wantsThe right kind of posture for him is lying down or sitting The object of his contemplation should be anyone of the colour kasiṇas beginning with the blue whose colour is quite pure This is what suits one of hating temperamentThe right lodging for one of deluded temperament has a view and is not shut in where the four quarters are visible to him as he sits there As to the postures walking is rightThe right kind of object for his contemplation is not small that is to say the size of a winnowing basket or the size of a saucerfor his mind becomes more confused in a confined space so the right kind is an amply large kasiṇaThe rest is as stated for one of hating temperament This is what suits one of deluded temperament For one of faithful temperament all the directions given for one of hating temperament are suitableAs to the object of his contemplation one of the recollections is right as wellFor one of intelligent temperament there is nothing unsuitable as far as concerns the lodging and so onFor one of speculative temperament an open lodging with a view where gardens groves and ponds pleasant prospects panoramas of villages towns and countryside and the blue gleam of mountains are visible to him as he sits there is not right for that is a condition for the running hither and thither of applied thought So he should live in a lodging such as a deep cavern screened by woods like the Overhanging Rock of the Elephants Belly  or Mahindas CaveAlso an amplesized object of contemplation is not suitable for himfor one like that is a condition for the running hither and thither of applied thoughtA small one is rightThe rest is as stated for one of greedy temperament This is what suits one of speculative temperamentThese are the details with definition of the kind source recognition and what is suitable as regards the various temperaments handed down here with the words that suits his own temperament  However the meditation subject that is suitable to the temperament has not been cleared up in all its aspects yetThis will become clear automatically when those in the following list are treated in detail Now it was said above and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament  Here the exposition of the meditation subject should be first understood in these ten ways as to enumeration as to which bring only access and which absorption at to the kinds of jhāna as to surmounting as to extension and nonextension as to object as to plane as to apprehending as to condition as to suitability to temperament Herein as to enumeration it was said above from among the forty meditation subjects  Herein the forty meditation subjects are these ten kasiṇas  ten kinds of foulness ten recollections four divine abidings four immaterial states one perception one defining Herein the ten kasiṇas are these earth kasiṇa water kasiṇa fire kasiṇa air kasiṇa blue kasiṇa yellow kasiṇa red kasiṇa white kasiṇa light kasiṇa and limitedspace kasiṇaThe ten kinds of foulness are these the bloated the livid the festering the cut up the gnawed the scattered the hacked and scattered the bleeding the worm infested and a skeletonThe ten kinds of recollection are these recollection of the Buddha  recollection of the Dhamma  recollection of the Sangha  recollection of virtue recollection of generosity recollection of deities recollection of death mindfulness occupied with the body mindfulness of breathing and recollection of peaceThe four divine abidings are these lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimityThe four immaterial states are these the base consisting of boundless space the base consisting of boundless consciousness the base consisting of nothingness and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperceptionThe one perception is the perception of repulsiveness in nutrimentThe one defining is the defining of the four elements This is how the exposition should be understood as to enumeration  As to which bring access only and which absorption the eight recollections excepting mindfulness occupied with the body and mindfulness of breathing the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment and the defining of the four elements are ten meditation subjects that bring access onlyThe others bring absorptionThis is as to which bring access only and which absorption  As to the kind of jhāna among those that bring absorption the ten kasiṇas together with mindfulness of breathing bring all four jhānasThe ten kinds of foulness together with mindfulness occupied with the body bring the first jhānaThe first three divine abidings bring three jhānasThe fourth divine abiding and the four immaterial states bring the fourth jhāna This is as to the kind of jhāna  As to surmounting there are two kinds of surmounting that is to say surmounting of factors and surmounting of objectHerein there is surmounting of factors in the case of all meditation subjects that bring three and four jhānas because the second jhāna etc have to be reached in those same objects by surmounting the jhāna factors of applied thought and sustained thought and so onLikewise in the case of the fourth divine abidingfor that has to be reached by surmounting joy in the same object as that of lovingkindness and so onBut in the case of the four immaterial states there is surmounting of the objectfor the base consisting of boundless space has to be reached by surmounting one or other of the first nine kasiṇasand the base consisting of boundless consciousness etc have respectively to be reached by surmounting space and so onWith the rest there is no surmounting This is as to surmounting  As to extension and nonextension only the ten kasiṇas among these forty meditation subjects need be extendedFor it is within just so much space as one is intent upon with the kasiṇa that one can hear sounds with the divine ear element see visible objects with the divine eye and know the minds of other beings with the mindMindfulness occupied with the body and the ten kinds of foulness need not be extendedWhyBecause they have a definite location and because there is no benefit in itThe definiteness of their location will become clear in explaining the method of development If the latter are extended it is only a quantity of corpses that is extended and there is no benefitAnd this is said in answer to the question of Sopāka Perception of visible forms is quite clear Blessed One perception of bones is not clear for here the perception of visible forms is called quite clear in the sense of extension of the signwhile the perception of bones is called not quite clear in the sense of its nonextension But the words I was intent upon this whole earth with the perception of a skeleton are said of the manner of appearance to one who has acquired that perceptionFor just as in the Emperor Dhammāsokas time the Karavīka bird uttered a sweet song when it saw its own reflection in the looking glass walls all round and perceived Karavīkas in every direction so the Elder Siṅgāla Pitar thought when he saw the sign appearing in all directions through his acquisition of the perception of a skeleton that the whole earth was covered with bones If that is so then is what is called the measurelessness of the object of jhāna produced on foulness contradictedIt is not contradictedFor one man apprehends the sign in a large bloated corpse or skeletonanother in a small oneIn this way the jhāna of the one has a limited objectand of the other a measureless objectOr alternatively With a measureless object is said of it referring to one who extends it seeing no disadvantage in doing soBut it need not be extended because no benefit results The rest need not be extended likewiseWhyWhen a man extends the sign of inbreaths and outbreaths only a quantity of wind is extended and it has a definite location the nosetipSo it need not be extended because of the disadvantage and because of the definiteness of the locationAnd the divine abidings have living beings as their object When a man extends the sign of these only the quantity of living beings would be extended and there is no purpose in that So that also need not be extendedWhen it is said Intent upon one quarter with his heart endued with loving kindness  etc that is said for the sake of comprehensive inclusionFor it is when a man develops it progressively by including living beings in one direction by one house by two houses etc that he is said to be intent upon one directionnot when he extends the signAnd there is no counterpart sign here that he might extendAlso the state of having a limited or measureless object can be understood here according to the way of inclusion too As regards the immaterial states as object space need not be extended since it is the mere removal of the kasiṇa materialityfor that should be brought to mind only as the disappearance of the kasiṇa materialityif he extends it nothing further happensAnd consciousness need not be extended since it is a state consisting in an individual essence and it is not possible to extend a state consisting in an individual essenceThe disappearance of consciousness need not be extended since it is mere nonexistence of consciousnessAnd the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception as object need not be extended since it too is a state consisting in an individual essence The rest need not be extended because they have no signFor it is the counterpart sign that would be extendableand the object of the recollection of the Buddha etc is not a counterpart sign Consequently there is no need for extension there This is as to extension and nonextension  As to object of these forty meditation subjects twentytwo have counterpart signs as object that is to say the ten kasiṇas the ten kinds of foulness mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied with the bodythe rest do not have counterpart signs as objectThen twelve have states consisting in individual essences as object that is to say eight of the ten recollectionsexcept mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied with the bodythe perception of repulsiveness in nutriment the defining of the elements the base consisting of boundless consciousness and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception and twentytwo have counterpart signs as objectthat is to say the ten kasiṇas the ten kinds of foulness mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied with the bodywhile the remaining six have notso classifiable objectsThen eight have mobile objects in the early stage though the counterpart is stationary that is to say the festering the bleeding the worminfested mindfulness of breathing the water kasiṇa the fire kasiṇa the air kasiṇa and in the case of the light kasiṇa the object consisting of a circle of sunlight etcthe rest have immobile objects This is as to object As to plane here the twelve namely the ten kinds of foulness mindfulness occupied with the body and perception of repulsiveness in nutriment do not occur among deitiesThese twelve and mindfulness of breathing do not occur in the BrahmāworldBut none except the four immaterial states occur in the immaterial becomingAll occur among human beings This is as to plane  As to apprehending here the exposition should be understood according to the seen the touched and the heardHerein these nineteen that is to say nine kasiṇas omitting the air kasiṇa and the ten kinds of foulness must be apprehended by the seenThe meaning is that in the early stage their sign must be apprehended by constantly looking with the eyeIn the case of mindfulness occupied with the body the five parts ending with skin must be apprehended by the seen and the rest by the heard so its object must be apprehended by the seen and the heardMindfulness of breathing must be apprehended by the touched the air kasiṇa by the seen and the touched the remaining eighteen by the heardThe divine abiding of equanimity and the four immaterial states are not apprehendable by a beginnerbut the remaining thirtyfive are This is as to apprehending  As to condition of these meditation subjects nine kasiṇas omitting the space kasiṇa are conditions for the immaterial states The ten kasiṇas are conditions for the kinds of directknowledge Three divine abidings are conditions for the fourth divine abiding Each lower immaterial state is a condition for each higher one The base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is a condition for the attainment of cessation All are conditions for living in bliss for insight and for the fortunate kinds of becoming This is as to condition  As to suitability to temperament here the exposition should be understood according to what is suitable to the temperamentsThat is to say first the ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness occupied with the body are eleven meditation subjects suitable for one of greedy temperamentThe four divine abidings and four colour kasiṇas are eight suitable for one of hating temperamentMindfulness of breathing is the one recollection as a meditation subject suitable for one of deluded temperament and for one of speculative temperamentThe first six recollections are suitable for one of faithful temperamentMindfulness of death the recollection of peace the defining of the four elements and the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment are four suitable for one of intelligent temperamentThe remaining kasiṇas and the immaterial states are suitable for all kinds of temperamentAnd anyone of the kasiṇas should be limited for one of speculative temperament and measureless for one of deluded temperamentThis is how the exposition should be understood here as to suitability to temperament  All this has been stated in the form of direct opposition and complete suitabilityBut there is actually no profitable development that does not suppress greed etc and help faith and so onAnd this is said in the Meghiya SuttaOne should in addition develop these four thingsfoulness should be developed for the purpose of abandoning greed Lovingkindness should be developed for the purpose of abandoning ill willMindfulness of breathing should be developed for the purpose of cutting off applied thoughtPerception of impermanence should be cultivated for the purpose of eliminating the conceit I am Also in the Rāhula Sutta in the passage beginning Develop lovingkindness Rāhula  seven meditation subjects are given for a single temperamentSo instead of insisting on the mere letter the intention should be sought in each instance This is the explanatory exposition of the meditation subject referred to by the words he should apprehendone meditation subject  Now the words and he should apprehend are illustrated as followsAfter approaching the good friend of the kind described in the explanation of the words then approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject  the meditator should dedicate himself to the Blessed One the Enlightened One or to a teacher and he should ask for the meditation subject with a sincere inclination of the heart and sincere resolutionHerein he should dedicate himself to the Blessed One the Enlightened One in this way Blessed One I relinquish this my person to youFor without having thus dedicated himself when living in a remote abode he might be unable to stand fast if a frightening object made its appearance and he might return to a village abode become associated with laymen take up improper search and come to ruinBut when he has dedicated himself in this way no fear arises in him if a frightening object makes its appearancein fact only joy arises in him as he reflects Have you not wisely already dedicated yourself to the Enlightened One Suppose a man had a fine piece of Kāsi cloth He would feel grief if it were eaten by rats or mothsbut if he gave it to a bhikkhu needing robes he would feel only joy if he saw the bhikkhu tearing it up to make his patched cloakAnd so it is with this When he dedicates himself to a teacher he should say I relinquish this my person to you venerable sirFor one who has not dedicated his person thus becomes unresponsive to correction hard to speak to and unamenable to advice or he goes where he likes without asking the teacher Consequently the teacher does not help him with either material things or the Dhamma and he does not train him in the cryptic booksFailing to get these two kinds of help he finds no footing in the Dispensation and he soon comes down to misconducting himself or to the lay stateBut if he has dedicated his person he is not unresponsive to correction does not go about as he likes is easy to speak to and lives only in dependence on the teacherHe gets the twofold help from the teacher and attains growth increase and fulfilment in the Dispensation Like the Elder Cūḷa PiṇḍapātikaTissas pupilsThree bhikkhus came to the elder it seemsOne of them said Venerable sir I am ready to fall from a cliff the height of one hundred men if it is said to be to your advantageThe second said Venerable sir I am ready to grind away this body from the heels up without remainder on a flat stone if it is said to be to your advantageThe third said Venerable sir I am ready to die by stopping breathing if it is said to be to your advantageObserving These bhikkhus are certainly capable of progress the elder expounded a meditation subject to themFollowing his advice the three attained Arahantship This is the benefit in selfdedicationHence it was said above dedicating himself to the Blessed One the Enlightened One or to a teacher  With a sincere inclination of the heart and sincere resolution  the meditators inclination should be sincere in the six modes beginning with non greedFor it is one of such sincere inclination who arrives at one of the three kinds of enlightenmentaccording as it is said Six kinds of inclination lead to the maturing of the enlightenment of the Bodhisattas With the inclination to non greed Bodhisattas see the fault in greed With the inclination to nonhate Bodhisattas see the fault in hate With the inclination to nondelusion Bodhisattas see the fault in delusion With the inclination to renunciation Bodhisattas see the fault in house life With the inclination to seclusion Bodhisattas see the fault in society With the inclination to relinquishment Bodhisattas see the fault in all kinds of becoming and destiny For streamenterers oncereturners nonreturners those with cankers destroyed  Paccekabuddhas and Fully Enlightened Ones whether past future or present all arrive at the distinction peculiar to each by means of these same six modesThat is why he should have sincerity of inclination in these six modes He should be wholeheartedly resolved on thatThe meaning is that he should be resolved upon concentration respect concentration incline to concentration be resolved upon Nibbāna respect Nibbāna incline to NibbānaWhen with sincerity of inclination and wholehearted resolution in this way he asks for a meditation subject then a teacher who has acquired the penetration of minds can know his temperament by surveying his mental conduct and a teacher who has not can know it by putting such questions to him asWhat is your temperamentor What states are usually present in youor What do you like bringing to mindor What meditation subject does your mind favour When he knows he can expound a meditation subject suitable to that temperamentAnd in doing so he can expound it in three waysit can be expounded to one who has already learnt the meditation subject by having him recite it at one or two sessionsit can be expounded to one who lives in the same place each time he comesand to one who wants to learn it and then go elsewhere it can be expounded in such a manner that it is neither too brief nor too long Herein when first he is explaining the earth kasiṇa there are nine aspects that he should explain They are the four faults of the kasiṇa the making of a kasiṇa the method of development for one who has made it the two kinds of sign the two kinds of concentration the seven kinds of suitable and unsuitable the ten kinds of skill in absorption evenness of energy and the directions for absorptionIn the case of the other meditation subjects each should be expounded in the way appropriate to itAll this will be made clear in the directions for developmentBut when the meditation subject is being expounded in this way the meditator must apprehend the sign as he listens Apprehend the sign means that he must connect each aspect thus This is the preceding clause this is the subsequent clause this is its meaning this is its intention this is the simileWhen he listens attentively apprehending the sign in this way his meditation subject is well apprehendedThen and because of that he successfully attains distinction but not otherwise This clarifies the meaning of the words and he must apprehend At this point the clauses approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament have been expounded in detail in all their aspectsin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Concentrationcalled The Description of Taking a Meditation SubjectThe third chapterIf it is inconvenient there he can live in another monastery a suitable onea quarter or a half or even a whole league distantIn that case when he finds he is in doubt about or has forgotten some passage in the meditation subject then he should do the duties in the monastery in good time and set out afterwards going for alms on the way and arriving at the teachers dwelling place after his meal He should make certain about the meditation subject that day in the teachers presence Next day after paying homage to the teacher he should go for alms on his way back and so he can return to his own dwelling place without fatigueBut one who finds no convenient place within even a league should clarify all difficulties about the meditation subject and make quite sure it has been properly attended to Then he can even go far away and avoiding a monastery unfavourable to development of concentration live in one that is favourableHerein one that is unfavourable has anyone of eighteen faultsThese are largeness newness dilapidatedness a nearby road a pond edible leaves flowers fruits famousness a nearby city nearby timber trees nearby arable fields presence of incompatible persons a nearby port of entry nearness to the border countries nearness to the frontier of a kingdom unsuitability lack of good friends One with any of these faults is not favourableHe should not live thereWhyFirstly people with varying aims collect in a large monastery They conflict with each other and so neglect the dutiesThe Enlightenmenttree terrace etc remain unsweptthe water for drinking and washing is not set outSo if he thinks I shall go to the almsresort village for alms and takes his bowl and robe and sets out perhaps he sees that the duties have not been done or that a drinkingwater pot is empty and so the duty has to be done by him unexpectedly Drinking water must be maintainedBy not doing it he would commit a wrongdoing in the breach of a dutyBut if he does it he loses time He arrives too late at the village and gets nothing because the alms giving is finishedAlso when he goes into retreat he is distracted by the loud noises of novices and young bhikkhus and by acts of the Community being carried outHowever he can live in a large monastery where all the duties are done and where there are none of the other disturbances In a new monastery there is much new building activity People criticize someone who takes no part in itBut he can live in such a monastery where the bhikkhus say Let the venerable one do the ascetics duties as much as he likes We shall see to the building work  In a dilapidated monastery there is much that needs repair People criticize someone who does not see about the repairing of at least his own lodging When he sees to the repairs his meditation subject suffers In a monastery with a nearby road by a main street visitors keep arriving night and dayHe has to give up his own lodging to those who come late and he has to go and live at the root of a tree or on top of a rockAnd next day it is the same So there is no opportunity to practice his meditation subjectBut he can live in one where there is no such disturbance by visitors A pond is a rock pool Numbers of people come there for drinking water Pupils of citydwelling elders supported by the royal family come to do dyeing work When they ask for vessels wood tubs etc they must be shown where these things are So he is kept all the time on the alert If he goes with his meditation subject to sit by day where there are many sorts of edible leaves then women vegetablegatherers singing as they pick leaves nearby endanger his meditation subject by disturbing it with sounds of the opposite sex And where there are many sorts of flowering shrubs in bloom there is the same danger too Where there are many sorts of fruits such as mangoes roseapples and jakfruits people who want fruits come and ask for them and they get angry if he does not give them any or they take them by force When walking in the monastery in the evening he sees them and asks Why do you do so lay followers  they abuse him as they pleaseand even try to evict him When he lives in a monastery that is famous and renowned in the world like Dakkhiṇagiri Hatthikucchi Cetiyagiri or Cittalapabbata there are always people coming who want to pay homage to him supposing that he is an Arahant which inconveniences him But if it suits him he can live there at night and go elsewhere by day In one with a nearby city objects of the opposite sex come into focus Womenpot carriers go by bumping into him with their jars and giving no room to pass Also important people spread out carpets in the middle of the monastery and sit down One with nearby timber trees where there are timber trees and osiers useful for making framework is inconvenient because of the woodgatherers there like the gatherers of branches and fruits already mentionedIf there are trees in a monastery people come and cut them down to build houses with When he has come out of his meditation room in the evening and is walking up and down in the monastery if he sees them and asks Why do you do so lay followers  they abuse him as they please and even try to evict him People make use of one with nearby arable fields quite surrounded by fields They make a threshing floor in the middle of the monastery itself They thresh corn there dry it in the forecourts and cause great inconvenienceAnd where there is extensive property belonging to the Community the monastery attendants impound cattle belonging to families and deny the water supply to their crops Then people bring an ear of paddy and show it to the Community saying Look at your monastery attendants workFor one reason or another he has to go to the portals of the king or the kings ministers This matter of property belonging to the Community is included by a monastery that is near arable fields Presence of incompatible persons where there are bhikkhus living who are incompatible and mutually hostile when they clash and it is protested Venerable sirs do not do so they exclaim We no longer count now that this refuserag wearer has come  One with a nearby water port of entry or land port of entry is made inconvenient by people constantly arriving respectively by ship or by caravan and crowding round asking for space or for drinking water or salt In the case of one near the border countries people have no trust in the Buddha etc there In one near the frontier of a kingdom there is fear of kingsFor perhaps one king attacks that place thinking It does not submit to my rule and the other does likewise thinking It does not submit to my ruleA bhikkhu lives there when it is conquered by one king and when it is conquered by the otherThen they suspect him of spying and they bring about his undoing Unsuitability is that due to the risk of encountering visible data etc of the opposite sex as objects or to haunting by nonhuman beingsHere is a storyAn elder lived in a forest it seemsThen an ogress stood in the door of his leaf hut and sangThe elder came out and stood in the door She went to the end of the walk and sangThe elder went to the end of the walkShe stood in a chasm a hundred fathoms deep and sangThe elder recoiledThen she suddenly grabbed him saying Venerable sir it is not just one or two of the likes of you I have eaten  Lack of good friends where it is not possible to find a good friend as a teacher or the equivalent of a teacher or a preceptor or the equivalent of a preceptorthe lack of good friends there is a serious fault One that has any of those eighteen faults should be understood as unfavourableAnd this is said in the commentariesA large abode a new abode One tumbling down one near a roadOne with a pond or leaves or flowers Or fruits or one that people seekIn cities among timber fields Where people quarrel in a portIn border lands on frontiers Unsuitableness and no good friendThese are the eighteen instances A wise man needs to recognizeAnd give them full as wide a berth As any footpadhunted roadOne that has the five factors beginning with not too far from and not too near to the alms resort is called favourableFor this is said by the Blessed One And how has a lodging five factors bhikkhusHere bhikkhus a lodging is not too far not too near and has a path for going and coming It is little frequented by day with little sound and few voices by night There is little contact with gadflies flies wind burning sun and creeping things One who lives in that lodging easily obtains robes alms food lodging and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick In that lodging there are elder bhikkhus living who are learned versed in the scriptures observers of the Dhamma observers of the Vinaya observers of the Codes and when from time to time one asks them questions How is this venerable sir What is the meaning of this  then those venerable ones reveal the unrevealed explain the unexplained and remove doubt about the many things that raise doubtsThis bhikkhus is how a lodging has five factorsThese are the details for the clause After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to live in one that is favourable  Then he should sever the lesser impediments  one living in such a favourable monastery should sever any minor impediments that he may still havethat is to say long head hair nails and body hair should be cutmending and patching of old robes should be doneor those that are soiled should be dyedIf there is a stain on the bowl the bowl should be bakedThe bed chair etc should be cleaned upThese are the details for the clause Then he should sever the lesser impediments  Now with the clause And not overlook any of the directions for development  the time has come for the detailed exposition of all meditation subjects starting with the earth kasiṇaTHE EARTH KASIA When a bhikkhu has thus severed the lesser impediments then on his return from his alms round after his meal and after he has got rid of drowsiness due to the meal he should sit down comfortably in a secluded place and apprehend the sign in earth that is either made up or not made up For this is saidOne who is learning the earth kasiṇa apprehends the sign in earth that is either made up or not made up that is bounded not unbounded limited not unlimited with a periphery not without a periphery circumscribed not uncircumscribed either the size of a bushel or the size of a saucer He sees to it that that sign is well apprehended well attended to well definedHaving done that and seeing its advantages and perceiving it as a treasure building up respect for it making it dear to him he anchors his mind to that object thinking Surely in this way I shall be freed from aging and deathSecluded from sense desires  he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna  Herein when in a previous becoming a man has gone forth into homelessness in the Dispensation or outside it with the rishis going forth and has already produced the jhāna tetrad or pentad on the earth kasiṇa and so has such merit and the support of past practice of jhāna as well then the sign arises in him on earth that is not made up that is to say on a ploughed area or on a threshing floor as in the Elder Mallakas caseIt seems that while that venerable one was looking at a ploughed area the sign arose in him the size of that areaHe extended it and attained the jhāna pentad Then by establishing insight with the jhāna as the basis for it he reached ArahantshipMAKING AN EARTH KASIA But when a man has had no such previous practice he should make a kasiṇa guarding against the four faults of a kasiṇa and not overlooking any of the directions for the meditation subject learnt from the teacherNow the four faults of the earth kasiṇa are due to the intrusion of blue yellow red or whiteSo instead of using clay of such colours he should make the kasiṇa of clay like that in the stream of the Gangā which is the colour of the dawnAnd he should make it not in the middle of the monastery in a place where novices etc are aboutbut on the confines of the monastery in a screened place either under an overhanging rock or in a leaf hut He can make it either portable or as a fixtureOf these a portable one should be made by tying rags of leather or matting onto four sticks and smearing thereon a disk of the size already mentioned using clay picked clean of grass roots gravel and sand and well kneadedAt the time of the preliminary work it should be laid on the ground and looked atA fixture should be made by knocking stakes into the ground in the form of a lotus calyx lacing them over with creepersIf the clay is insufficient then other clay should be put underneath and a disk a span and four fingers across made on top of that with the quite pure dawncoloured clayFor it was with reference only to measurement that it was said above either the size of a bushel or the size of a saucer But that is bounded not unbounded was said to show its delimitedness So having thus made it delimited and of the size prescribed he should scrape it down with a stone trowela wooden trowel turns it a bad colourso that should not be employedand make it as even as the surface of a drum Then he should sweep the place out and have a bath On his return he should seat himself on a wellcovered chair with legs a span and four fingers high prepared in a place that is two and a half cubits that is two and a half times elbow to fingertip from the kasiṇa diskFor the kasiṇa does not appear plainly to him if he sits further off than that and if he sits nearer than that faults in the kasiṇa appearIf he sits higher up he has to look at it with his neck bent and if he sits lower down his knees acheSTARTING CONTEMPLATION So after seating himself in the way stated he should review the dangers in sense desires in the way beginning Sense desires give little enjoyment and arouse longing for the escape from sense desires for the renunciation that is the means to the surmounting of all suffering He should next arouse joy of happiness by recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha then awe by thinking Now this is the way of renunciation entered upon by all Buddhas Paccekabuddhas and noble disciples and then eagerness by thinking In this way I shall surely come to know the taste of the bliss of seclusion After that he should open his eyes moderately apprehend the sign and so proceed to develop itIf he opens his eyes too wide they get fatigued and the disk becomes too obvious which prevents the sign becoming apparent to himIf he opens them too little the disk is not obvious enough and his mind becomes drowsy which also prevents the sign becoming apparent to himSo he should develop it by apprehending the sign  keeping his eyes open moderately as if he were seeing the reflection of his face on the surface of a looking glass The colour should not be reviewed The characteristic should not be given attentionBut rather while not ignoring the colour attention should be given by setting the mind on the name concept as the most outstanding mental datum relegating the colour to the position of a property of its physical supportThat conceptual state can be called by anyone he likes among the names for earth such as earth  the Great One  the Friendly One  ground  the Provider of Wealth  the Bearer of Wealth  etc whichever suits his manner of perceptionStill earth is also a name that is obvious so it can be developed with the obvious one by saying earth earthIt should be adverted to now with eyes open now with eyes shutAnd he should go on developing it in this way a hundred times a thousand times and even more than that until the learning sign arises When while he is developing it in this way it comes into focus as he adverts with his eyes shut exactly as it does with his eyes open then the learning sign is said to have been producedAfter its production he should no longer sit in that placehe should return to his own quarters and go on developing it sitting thereBut in order to avoid the delay of foot washing a pair of single soled sandals and a walking stick are desirableThen if the new concentration vanishes through some unsuitable encounter he can put his sandals on take his walking stick and go back to the place to reapprehend the sign there When he returns he should seat himself comfortably and develop it by reiterated reaction to it and by striking at it with thought and applied thoughtTHE COUNTERPART SIGN As he does so the hindrances eventually become suppressed the defilements subside the mind becomes concentrated with access concentration and the counterpart sign arisesThe difference between the earlier learning sign and the counterpart sign is this In the learning sign any fault in the kasiṇa is apparent But the counterpart sign appears as if breaking out from the learning sign and a hundred times a thousand times more purified like a lookingglass disk drawn from its case like a motherofpearl dish well washed like the moons disk coming out from behind a cloud like cranes against a thunder cloudBut it has neither colour nor shapefor if it had it would be cognizable by the eye gross susceptible of comprehension by insight and stamped with the three characteristics But it is not like thatFor it is born only of perception in one who has obtained concentration being a mere mode of appearanceBut as soon as it arises the hindrances are quite suppressed the defilements subside and the mind becomes concentrated in access concentrationTHE TWO KINDS OF CONCENTRATION Now concentration is of two kinds that is to say access concentration and absorption concentrationthe mind becomes concentrated in two ways that is on the plane of access and on the plane of obtainmentHerein the mind becomes concentrated on the plane of access by the abandonment of the hindrancesand on the plane of obtainment by the manifestation of the jhāna factorsThe difference between the two kinds of concentration is this The factors are not strong in access It is because they are not strong that when access has arisen the mind now makes the sign its object and now reenters the life continuum just as when a young child is lifted up and stood on its feet it repeatedly falls down on the groundBut the factors are strong in absorption It is because they are strong that when absorption concentration has arisen the mind having once interrupted the flow of the lifecontinuum carries on with a stream of profitable impulsion for a whole night and for a whole day just as a healthy man after rising from his seat could stand for a whole day The arousing of the counterpart sign which arises together with access concentration is very difficultTherefore if he is able to arrive at absorption in that same session by extending the sign it is goodIf not then he must guard the sign diligently as if it were the foetus of a Wheelturning Monarch So guard the sign nor count the cost And what is gained will not be lostWho fails to have this guard maintained Will lose each time what he has gainedHerein the way of guarding it is this Abode resort and speech and person The food the climate and the posture Eschew these seven different kinds Whenever found unsuitableBut cultivate the suitable For one perchance so doing findsHe need not wait too long until Absorption shall his wish fulfil Herein an abode is unsuitable if while he lives in it the unarisen sign does not arise in him or is lost when it arises and where unestablished mindfulness fails to become established and the unconcentrated mind fails to become concentratedThat is suitable in which the sign arises and becomes confirmed in which mindfulness becomes established and the mind becomes concentrated as in the Elder PadhāniyaTissa resident at NāgapabbataSo if a monastery has many abodes he can try them one by one living in each for three days and stay on where his mind becomes unifiedFor it was due to suitability of abode that five hundred bhikkhus reached Arahantship while still dwelling in the Lesser Nāga Cave in Tambapaṇṇi Island after apprehending their meditation subject thereThere is no counting the stream enterers who have reached Arahantship there after reaching the noble plane elsewhereso too in the monastery of Cittalapabbata and others An almsresort village lying to the north or south of the lodging not too far within one kosa and a half and where alms food is easily obtained is suitableThe opposite kind is unsuitable Speech that included in the thirtytwo kinds of aimless talk is unsuitable for it leads to the disappearance of the signBut talk based on the ten examples of talk is suitable though even that should be discussed with moderation Person one not given to aimless talk who has the special qualities of virtue etc by acquaintanceship with whom the unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or the concentrated mind becomes more so is suitableOne who is much concerned with his body who is addicted to aimless talk is unsuitablefor he only creates disturbances like muddy water added to clear water And it was owing to one such as this that the attainments of the young bhikkhu who lived at Koṭapabbata vanished not to mention the sign Food Sweet food suits one sour food another Climate a cool climate suits one a warm one anotherSo when he finds that by using certain food or by living in a certain climate he is comfortable or his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind becomes more so then that food or that climate is suitableAny other food or climate is unsuitable Postures walking suits one standing or sitting or lying down suits anotherSo he should try them like the abode for three days each and that posture is suitable in which his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind becomes more soAny other should be understood as unsuitableSo he should avoid the seven unsuitable kinds and cultivate the suitableFor when he practices in this way assiduously cultivating the sign then he need not wait too long until absorption shall his wish fulfil However if this does not happen while he is practicing in this way then he should have recourse to the ten kinds of skill in absorptionHere is the method Skill in absorption needs to be dealt with in ten aspects making the basis clean maintaining balanced faculties skill in the sign he exerts the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted he restrains the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained he encourages the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged he looks on at the mind with equanimity when it should be looked on at with equanimity avoidance of unconcentrated persons cultivation of concentrated persons resoluteness upon that  Herein making the basis clean is cleansing the internal and the external basisFor when his head hair nails and body hair are long or when the body is soaked with sweat then the internal basis is unclean and unpurifiedBut when an old dirty smelly robe is worn or when the lodging is dirty then the external basis is unclean and unpurifiedWhen the internal and external bases are unclean then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness concomitants that arise is unpurified like the light of a lamps flame that arises with an unpurified lampbowl wick and oil as its supportformations do not become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with unpurified knowledge and when he devotes himself to his meditation subject it does not come to growth increase and fulfilmentBut when the internal and external bases are clean then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants that arise is clean and purified like the light of a lamps flame that arises with a purified lamp bowl wick and oil as its supportformations become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with purified knowledge and as he devotes himself to his meditation subject it comes to growth increase and fulfilment Maintaining balanced faculties is equalizing the five faculties of faith and the restFor if his faith faculty is strong and the others weak then the energy faculty cannot perform its function of exerting the mindfulness faculty its function of establishing the concentration faculty its function of not distracting and the understanding faculty its function of seeing So in that case the faith faculty should be modified either by reviewing the individual essences of the states concerned that is the objects of attention or by not giving them attention in the way in which the faith faculty became too strongAnd this is illustrated by the story of the Elder Vakkali Then if the energy faculty is too strong the faith faculty cannot perform its function of resolving nor can the rest of the faculties perform their several functions So in that case the energy faculty should be modified by developing tranquillity and so onAnd this should be illustrated by the story of the Elder Soṇa So too with the rest for it should be understood that when anyone of them is too strong the others cannot perform their several functions However what is particularly recommended is balancing faith with understanding and concentration with energyFor one strong in faith and weak in understanding has confidence uncritically and groundlesslyOne strong in understanding and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as hard to cure as one sick of a disease caused by medicineWith the balancing of the two a man has confidence only when there are grounds for itThen idleness overpowers one strong in concentration and weak in energy since concentration favours idlenessAgitation overpowers one strong in energy and weak in concentration since energy favours agitationBut concentration coupled with energy cannot lapse into idlenessand energy coupled with concentration cannot lapse into agitation So these two should be balancedfor absorption comes with the balancing of the two Again concentration and faith should be balanced One working on concentration needs strong faithsince it is with such faith and confidence that he reaches absorptionThen there is balancing of concentration and understanding One working on concentration needs strong unificationsince that is how he reaches absorptionand one working on insight needs strong understandingsince that is how he reaches penetration of characteristicsbut with the balancing of the two he reaches absorption as well Strong mindfulness however is needed in all instancesfor mindfulness protects the mind from lapsing into agitation through faith energy and understanding which favour agitation and from lapsing into idleness through concentration which favours idleness So it is as desirable in all instances as a seasoning of salt in all sauces as a prime minister in all the kings businessHence it is said in the commentaries  And mindfulness has been called universal by the Blessed OneFor what reasonBecause the mind has mindfulness as its refuge and mindfulness is manifested as protection and there is no exertion and restraint of the mind without mindfulness  Skill in the sign is skill in producing the as yet unproduced sign of unification of mind through the earth kasiṇa etc and it is skill in developing the sign when produced and skill in protecting the sign when obtained by development The last is what is intended here How does he exert the mind on an occasion when it should be exertedWhen his mind is slack with overlaxness of energy etc then instead of developing the three enlightenment factors beginning with tranquillity he should develop those beginning with investigationofstatesFor this is said by the Blessed OneBhikkhus suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up and he put wet grass on it put wet cowdung on it put wet sticks on it sprinkled it with water and scattered dust on it would that man be able to make the small fire burn upNo venerable sirSo too bhikkhus when the mind is slack that is not the time to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor or the equanimity enlightenment factorWhy is thatBecause a slack mind cannot well be roused by those statesWhen the mind is slack that is the time to develop the investigationofstates enlightenment factor the energy enlightenment factor and the happiness enlightenment factorWhy is thatBecause a slack mind can well be roused by those statesBhikkhus suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up and he put dry grass on it put dry cowdung on it put dry sticks on it blew on it with his mouth and did not scatter dust on it would that man be able to make that small fire burn upYes venerable sir  And here the development of the investigationofstates enlightenment factor etc should be understood as the nutriment for each one respectivelyfor this is saidBhikkhus there are profitable and unprofitable states reprehensible and blameless states inferior and superior states dark and bright states the counterpart of each otherWise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen investigationofstates enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen investigationofstates enlightenment factorLikewise Bhikkhus there is the element of initiative the element of launching and the element of persistenceWise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen energy enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen energy enlightenment factorsLikewise Bhikkhus there are states productive of the happiness enlightenment factorWise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen happiness enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen happiness enlightenment factor  Herein wise attention given to the profitable etc is attention occurring in penetration of individual essences and of the three general characteristicsWise attention given to the element of initiative etc is attention occurring in the arousing of the element of initiative and so onHerein initial energy is called the element of initiativeThe element of launching is stronger than that because it launches out from idlenessThe element of persistence is still stronger than that because it goes on persisting in successive later stagesStates productive of the happiness enlightenment factor is a name for happiness itselfand attention that arouses that is wise attentionThere are besides seven things that lead to the arising of the investigation ofstates enlightenment factor asking questions making the basis clean balancing the faculties avoidance of persons without understanding cultivation of persons with understanding reviewing the field for the exercise of profound knowledge resoluteness upon that investigation of states Eleven things lead to the arising of the energy enlightenment factor reviewing the fearfulness of the states of loss such as the hell realms etc seeing benefit in obtaining the mundane and supramundane distinctions dependent on energy reviewing the course of the journey to be travelled thus The path taken by the Buddhas Paccekabuddhas and the great disciples has to be taken by me and it cannot be taken by an idler being a credit to the alms food by producing great fruit for the givers reviewing the greatness of the Master thus My Master praises the energetic and this unsurpassable Dispensation that is so helpful to us is honoured in the practice not otherwise reviewing the greatness of the heritage thus It is the great heritage called the Good Dhamma that is to be acquired by me and it cannot be acquired by an idler removing stiffness and torpor by attention to perception of light change of postures frequenting the open air etc avoidance of idle persons cultivation of energetic persons reviewing the right endeavours resoluteness upon that energy Eleven things lead to the arising of the happiness enlightenment factor the recollections of the Buddha of the Dhamma of the Sangha of virtue of generosity and of deities the recollection of peace avoidance of rough persons cultivation of refined persons reviewing encouraging discourses resoluteness upon that happinessSo by arousing these things in these ways he develops the investigationof states enlightenment factor and the othersThis is how he exerts the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted How does he restrain the mind on an occasion when it should be restrainedWhen his mind is agitated through overenergeticness etc then instead of developing the three enlightenment factors beginning with investigationof states he should develop those beginning with tranquillityfor this is said by the Blessed OneBhikkhus suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire and he put dry grass on it  and did not scatter dust on it would that man be able to extinguish that great mass of fireNo venerable sirSo too bhikkhus when the mind is agitated that is not the time to develop the investigationofstates enlightenment factor the energy enlightenment factor or the happiness enlightenment factorWhy is thatBecause an agitated mind cannot well be quieted by those statesWhen the mind is agitated that is the time to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor and the equanimity enlightenment factorWhy is thatBecause an agitated mind can well be quieted by those states Bhikkhus suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire and he put wet grass on it  and scattered dust on it would that man be able to extinguish that great mass of fireYes venerable sir  And here the development of the tranquillity enlightenment factor etc should be understood as the nutriment for each one respectivelyfor this is saidBhikkhus there is bodily tranquillity and mental tranquillity Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen tranquillity enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen tranquillity enlightenment factorLikewise Bhikkhus there is the sign of serenity the sign of nondiversionWise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen concentration enlightenment factor or it leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen concentration enlightenment factorLikewise Bhikkhus there are states productive of the equanimity enlightenment factorWise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen equanimity enlightenment factor or it leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen equanimity enlightenment factor Herein wise attention given to the three instances is attention occurring in arousing tranquillity etc by observing the way in which they arose in him earlierThe sign of serenity is a term for serenity itselfand nondiversion is a term for that too in the sense of nondistractionThere are besides seven things that lead to the arising of the tranquillity enlightenment factor using superior food living in a good climate maintaining a pleasant posture keeping to the middle avoidance of violent persons cultivation of persons tranquil in body resoluteness upon that tranquillityEleven things lead to the arising of the concentration enlightenment factor making the basis clean skill in the sign balancing the faculties restraining the mind on occasion exerting the mind on occasion encouraging the listless mind by means of faith and a sense of urgency looking on with equanimity at what is occurring rightly avoidance of unconcentrated persons cultivation of concentrated persons reviewing of the jhānas and liberations resoluteness upon that concentrationFive things lead to the arising of the equanimity enlightenment factor maintenance of neutrality towards living beings maintenance of neutrality towards formations  avoidance of persons who show favouritism towards beings and formations cultivation of persons who maintain neutrality towards beings and formations resoluteness upon that equanimitySo by arousing these things in these ways he develops the tranquillity enlightenment factor as well as the othersThis is how he restrains the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained How does he encourage the mind on an occasion when it should be encouragedWhen his mind is listless owing to sluggishness in the exercise of understanding or to failure to attain the bliss of peace then he should stimulate it by reviewing the eight grounds for a sense of urgencyThese are the four namely birth aging sickness and death with the suffering of the states of loss as the fifth and also the suffering in the past rooted in the round of rebirths the suffering in the future rooted in the round of rebirths and the suffering in the present rooted in the search for nutrimentAnd he creates confidence by recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaThis is how he encourages the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged How does he look on at the mind with equanimity on an occasion when it should be looked on at with equanimityWhen he is practicing in this way and his mind follows the road of serenity occurs evenly on the object and is unidle unagitated and not listless then he is not interested to exert or restrain or encourage it he is like a charioteer when the horses are progressing evenlyThis is how he looks on at the mind with equanimity on an occasion when it should be looked on at with equanimity Avoidance of unconcentrated persons is keeping far away from persons who have never trodden the way of renunciation who are busy with many affairs and whose hearts are distracted Cultivation of concentrated persons is approaching periodically persons who have trodden the way of renunciation and obtained concentration Resoluteness upon that is the state of being resolute upon concentration the meaning is giving concentration importance tending leaning and inclining to concentrationThis is how the tenfold skill in concentration should be undertakenAny man who acquires this sign This tenfold skill will need to heedIn order for absorption to gain Thus achieving his bolder goalBut if in spite of his efforts No result comes that might requiteHis work still a wise wight persists Never this task relinquishingSince a tiro if he gives up Thinking not to continue inThe task never gains distinction Here no matter how small at allA man wise in temperament Notices how his mind inclinesEnergy and serenity Always he couples each to eachNow his mind seeing that it holds back He prods now the restraining reinTightening seeing it pull too hard Guiding with even pace the raceWellcontrolled bees get the pollen Wellbalanced efforts meet to treatLeaves thread and ships and oiltubes too Gain thus not otherwise the prizeLet him set aside this lax Also this agitated stateSteering here his mind at the sign As the bee and the rest suggestHere is the explanation of the meaning When a too clever bee learns that a flower on a tree is blooming it sets out hurriedly overshoots the mark turns back and arrives when the pollen is finishedand another not clever enough bee who sets out with too slow a speed arrives when the pollen is finished toobut a clever bee sets out with balanced speed arrives with ease at the cluster of flowers takes as much pollen as it pleases and enjoys the honeydewAgain when a surgeons pupils are being trained in the use of the scalpel on a lotus leaf in a dish of water one who is too clever applies the scalpel hurriedly and either cuts the lotus leaf in two or pushes it under the waterand another who is not clever enough does not even dare to touch it with the scalpel for fear of cutting it in two or pushing it underbut one who is clever shows the scalpel stroke on it by means of a balanced effort and being good at his craft he is rewarded on such occasions Again when the king announces Anyone who can draw out a spiders thread four fathoms long shall receive four thousand one man who is too clever breaks the spiders thread here and there by pulling it hurriedlyand another who is not clever enough does not dare to touch it with his hand for fear of breaking itbut a clever man pulls it out starting from the end with a balanced effort winds it on a stick and so wins the prizeAgain a too clever skipper hoists full sails in a high wind and sends his ship adriftand another not clever enough skipper lowers his sails in a light wind and remains where he isbut a clever skipper hoists full sails in a light wind takes in half his sails in a high wind and so arrives safely at his desired destinationAgain when a teacher says Anyone who fills the oiltube without spilling any oil will win a prize one who is too clever fills it hurriedly out of greed for the prize and he spills the oiland another who is not clever enough does not dare to pour the oil at all for fear of spilling itbut one who is clever fills it with a balanced effort and wins the prizeJust as in these five similes so too when the sign arises one bhikkhu forces his energy thinking I shall soon reach absorption Then his mind lapses into agitation because of his minds overexerted energy and he is prevented from reaching absorptionAnother who sees the defect in overexertion slacks off his energy thinking What is absorption to me now Then his mind lapses into idleness because of his minds too lax energy and he too is prevented from reaching absorptionYet another who frees his mind from idleness even when it is only slightly idle and from agitation when only slightly agitated confronting the sign with balanced effort reaches absorption One should be like the lastnamedIt was with reference to this meaning that it was said aboveWellcontrolled bees get the pollen Wellbalanced efforts meet to treatLeaves thread and ships and oiltubes too Gain thus not otherwise the prizeLet him set aside then this lax Also this agitated stateSteering here his mind at the sign As the bee and the rest suggest So while he is guiding his mind in this way confronting the sign then knowing Now absorption will succeed there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the occurrence of consciousness as lifecontinuum and evoked by the constant repeating of earth earthAfter that either four or five impulsions impel on that same objectthe last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere The rest are of the sense spherebut they have stronger applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss and unification of mind than the normal ones They are called preliminary work consciousnesses because they are the preliminary work for absorption and they are also called access consciousnesses because of their nearness to absorption because they happen in its neighbourhood just as the words village access and city access are used for a place near to a village etc and they are also called conformity consciousnesses because they conform to those that precede the preliminary work consciousnesses and to the absorption that followsAnd the last of these is also called change oflineage because it transcends the limited sensesphere lineage and brings into being the exalted finematerialsphere lineage But omitting repetitions then either the first is the preliminary work the second access the third conformity and the fourth changeoflineageor else the first is access the second conformity and the third changeof lineage Then either the fourth in the latter case or the fifth in the former case is the absorption consciousnessFor it is only either the fourth or the fifth that fixes in absorption And that is according as there is swift or sluggish direct knowledgeBeyond that impulsion lapsesand the lifecontinuum takes overBut the Abhidhamma scholar the Elder Godatta quoted this text Preceding profitable states are a condition as repetition condition for succeeding profitable states  Adding It is owing to the repetition condition that each succeeding state is strong so there is absorption also in the sixth and seventh  That is rejected by the commentaries with the remark that it is merely that elders opinionadding that It is only either in the fourth or the fifth that there is absorptionBeyond that impulsion lapses It is said to do so because of nearness of the lifecontinuumAnd that has been stated in this way after consideration so it cannot be rejectedFor just as a man who is running towards a precipice and wants to stop cannot do so when he has his foot on the edge but falls over it so there can be no fixing in absorption in the sixth or the seventh because of the nearness to the lifecontinuumThat is why it should be understood that there is absorption only in the fourth or the fifth But that absorption is only of a single conscious momentFor there are seven instances in which the normal extent of the cognitive series does not apply They are in the cases of the first absorption the mundane kinds of direct knowledge the four paths fruition next after the path lifecontinuum jhāna in the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception as condition for cessation of perception and feeling and the fruition attainment in one emerging from cessationHere the fruition next after the path does not exceed three consciousnesses in numberthe consciousnesses of the base consisting of neither perception nor non perception as condition for cessation do not exceed two in number there is no measure of the number of consciousnesses in the lifecontinuum in the fine material and immaterial kinds of becomingIn the remaining instances the number of consciousnesses is one onlySo absorption is of a single consciousness momentAfter that it lapses into the lifecontinuumThen the lifecontinuum is interrupted by adverting for the purpose of reviewing the jhāna next to which comes the reviewing of the jhānaTHE FIRST JHNA At this point Quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with happiness and bliss born of seclusion and so he has attained the first jhāna which abandons five factors possesses five factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa Herein quite secluded from sense desires means having secluded himself from having become without having gone away from sense desiresNow this word quite should be understood to have the meaning of absolutenessPrecisely because it has the meaning of absoluteness it shows how on the actual occasion of entering upon and dwelling in the first jhāna sense desires as well as being nonexistent then are the first jhānas contrary opposite and it also shows that the arrival takes place only through the letting go of sense desiresHowWhen absoluteness is introduced thus quite secluded from sense desires what is expressed is this sense desires are certainly incompatible with this jhāna when they exist it does not occur just as when there is darkness there is no lamplightand it is only by letting go of them that it is reached just as the further bank is reached only by letting go of the near bankThat is why absoluteness is introducedHere it might be asked But why is this word quite mentioned only in the first phrase and not in the second How is this might he enter upon and dwell in the first jhāna even when not secluded from unprofitable thingsIt should not be regarded in that wayIt is mentioned in the first phrase as the escape from themfor this jhāna is the escape from sense desires since it surmounts the sensedesire element and since it is incompatible with greed for sense desiresaccording as it is said The escape from sense desires is this that is to say renunciation But in the second phrase the word eva should be adduced and taken as said as in the passage Bhikkhus only here is there an ascetic here a second ascetic For it is impossible to enter upon and dwell in jhāna unsecluded also from unprofitable things in other words the hindrances other than that sense desireSo this word must be read in both phrases thus Quite secluded from sense desires quite secluded from unprofitable thingsAnd although the word secluded as a general term includes all kinds of seclusion that is to say seclusion by substitution of opposites etc and bodily seclusion etc still only the three namely bodily seclusion mental seclusion and seclusion by suppression should be regarded here But this term sense desires should be regarded as including all kinds that is to say sense desires as object as given in the Niddesa in the passage beginning What are sense desires as object They are agreeable visible objects   and the sense desires as defilement given there too and in the Vibhaṅga thus Zeal as sense desire  greed as sense desire zeal and greed as sense desire thinking as sense desire greed as sense desire thinking and greed as sense desire That being so the words quite secluded from sense desires properly mean quite secluded from sense desires as object and express bodily seclusionwhile the words secluded from unprofitable things properly mean secluded from sense desires as defilement or from all unprofitable things and express mental seclusionAnd in this case giving up of pleasure in sense desires is indicated by the first since it only expresses seclusion from sense desires as object while acquisition of pleasure in renunciation is indicated by the second since it expresses seclusion from sense desire as defilementAnd with sense desires as object and sense desires as defilement expressed in this way it should also be recognized that the abandoning of the objective basis for defilement is indicated by the first of these two phrases and the abandoning of the subjective defilement by the secondalso that the giving up of the cause of cupidity is indicated by the first and the giving up of the cause of stupidity by the secondalso that the purification of ones occupation is indicated by the first and the educating of ones inclination by the secondThis firstly is the method here when the words from sense desires are treated as referring to sense desires as objectBut if they are treated as referring to sense desires as defilement then it is simply just zeal for sense desires in the various forms of zeal  greed  etc that is intended as sense desires And although that lust is also included by the word unprofitable it is nevertheless stated separately in the Vibhaṅga in the way beginning Herein what are sense desires Zeal as sense desire  because of its incompatibility with jhānaOr alternatively it is mentioned in the first phrase because it is sense desire as defilement and in the second phrase because it is included in the unprofitableAnd because this lust has various forms therefore from sense desires is said instead of from sense desire  And although there may be unprofitableness in other states as well nevertheless only the hindrances are mentioned subsequently in the Vibhaṅga thus Herein what states are unprofitable Lust   etc in order to show their opposition to and incompatibility with the jhāna factorsFor the hindrances are the contrary opposites of the jhāna factors what is meant is that the jhāna factors are incompatible with them eliminate them abolish themAnd it is said accordingly in the Peṭaka  Concentration is incompatible with lust happiness with ill will applied thought with stiffness and torpor bliss with agitation and worry and sustained thought with uncertainty  So in this case it should be understood that seclusion by suppression of lust is indicated by the phrase quite secluded from sense desiresand seclusion by suppression of all five hindrances by the phrase secluded from unprofitable things But omitting repetitions that of lust is indicated by the first and that of the remaining hindrances by the secondSimilarly with the three unprofitable roots that of greed which has the five cords of sense desire as its province is indicated by the first and that of hate and delusion which have as their respective provinces the various grounds for annoyance  etc by the secondOr with the states consisting of the floods etc that of the flood of sense desires of the bond of sense desires of the canker of sense desires of sensedesire clinging of the bodily tie of covetousness and of the fetter of greed for sense desires is indicated by the first and that of the remaining floods bonds cankers clingings ties and fetters is indicated by the secondAgain that of craving and of what is associated with craving is indicated by the first and that of ignorance and of what is associated with ignorance is indicated by the secondFurthermore that of the eight thought arisings associated with greed is indicated by the first and that of the remaining kinds of unprofitable thoughtarisings is indicated by the secondThis in the first place is the explanation of the meaning of the words quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things So far the factors abandoned by the jhāna have been shown And now in order to show the factors associated with it which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought is saidHerein applied thinking is applied thought  hitting upon is what is meantIt has the characteristic of directing the mind on to an object  Its function is to strike at and threshfor the meditator is said in virtue of it to have the object struck at by applied thought threshed by applied thoughtIt is manifested as the leading of the mind onto an objectSustained thinking is sustained thought  continued sustainment  is what is meantIt has the characteristic of continued pressure on the object Its function is to keep conascent mental states occupied with that It is manifested as keeping consciousness anchored on that objectAnd though sometimes not separate applied thought is the first impact of the mind in the sense that it is both gross and inceptive like the striking of a bellSustained thought is the act of keeping the mind anchored in the sense that it is subtle with the individual essence of continued pressure like the ringing of the bellApplied thought intervenes being the interference of consciousness at the time of first arousing thought like a birds spreading out its wings when about to soar into the air and like a bees diving towards a lotus when it is minded to follow up the scent of itThe behaviour of sustained thought is quiet being the near noninterference of consciousness like the birds planing with outspread wings after soaring into the air and like the bees buzzing above the lotus after it has dived towards it In the commentary to the Book of Twos this is said Applied thought occurs as a state of directing the mind onto an object like the movement of a large bird taking off into the air by engaging the air with both wings and forcing them downwards For it causes absorption by being unifiedSustained thought occurs with the individual essence of continued pressure like the birds movement when it is using its wings for the purpose of keeping hold on the air For it keeps pressing the object That fits in with the latters occurrence as anchoringThis difference of theirs becomes evident in the first and second jhānas in the fivefold reckoningFurthermore applied thought is like the hand that grips firmly and sustained thought is like the hand that rubs when one grips a tarnished metal dish firmly with one hand and rubs it with powder and oil and a woollen pad with the other handLikewise when a potter has spun his wheel with a stroke on the stick and is making a dish  his supporting hand is like applied thought and his hand that moves back and forth is like sustained thoughtLikewise when one is drawing a circle the pin that stays fixed down in the centre is like applied thought which directs onto the object and the pin that revolves round it is like sustained thought which continuously pressesSo this jhāna occurs together with this applied thought and this sustained thought and it is called accompanied by applied and sustained thought as a tree is called accompanied by flowers and fruitsBut in the Vibhaṅga the teaching is given in terms of a person in the way beginning He is possessed fully possessed of this applied thought and this sustained thought The meaning should be regarded in the same way there tooBorn of seclusion here secludedness is seclusion  the meaning is disappearance of hindrancesOr alternatively it is secluded  thus it is seclusion the meaning is the collection of states associated with the jhāna is secluded from hindrancesBorn of seclusion is born of or in that kind of seclusionHappiness and bliss it refreshes  thus it is happiness It has the characteristic of endearing  Its function is to refresh the body and the mind or its function is to pervade  It is manifested as elationBut it is of five kinds as minor happiness momentary happiness showering happiness uplifting happiness and pervading happinessHerein minor happiness is only able to raise the hairs on the bodyMomentary happiness is like flashes of lightning at different momentsShowering happiness breaks over the body again and again like waves on the sea shore Uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body and make it spring up into the airFor this was what happened to the Elder MahāTissa resident at Puṇṇavallika He went to the shrine terrace on the evening of the fullmoon day Seeing the moonlight he faced in the direction of the Great Shrine at Anurādhapura thinking At this very hour the four assemblies are worshipping at the Great Shrine By means of objects formerly seen there he aroused uplifting happiness with the Enlightened One as object and he rose into the air like a painted ball bounced off a plastered floor and alighted on the terrace of the Great Shrine And this was what happened to the daughter of a clan in the village of Vattakālaka near the Girikaṇḍaka Monastery when she sprang up into the air owing to strong uplifting happiness with the Enlightened One as objectAs her parents were about to go to the monastery in the evening it seems in order to hear the Dhamma  they told her My dear you are expecting a child you cannot go out at an unsuitable time We shall hear the Dhamma and gain merit for you  So they went outAnd though she wanted to go too she could not well object to what they said She stepped out of the house onto a balcony and stood looking at the kāsacetiya Shrine at Girikaṇḍaka lit by the moon She saw the offering of lamps at the shrine and the four communities as they circumambulated it to the right after making their offerings of flowers and perfumes and she heard the sound of the massed recital by the Community of BhikkhusThen she thought How lucky they are to be able to go to the monastery and wander round such a shrine terrace and listen to such sweet preaching of Dhamma Seeing the shrine as a mound of pearls and arousing uplifting happinessshe sprang up into the air and before her parents arrived she came down from the air into the shrine terrace where she paid homage and stood listening to the DhammaWhen her parents arrived they asked her What road did you come byShe said I came through the air not by the road and when they told her My dear those whose cankers are destroyed come through the air But how did you come  she replied As I was standing looking at the shrine in the moonlight a strong sense of happiness arose in me with the Enlightened One as its objectThen I knew no more whether I was standing or sitting but only that I was springing up into the air with the sign that I had grasped and I came to rest on this shrine terrace So uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body make it spring up into the air But when pervading happiness arises the whole body is completely pervaded like a filled bladder like a rock cavern invaded by a huge inundationNow this fivefold happiness when conceived and matured perfects the twofold tranquillity that is bodily and mental tranquillityWhen tranquillity is conceived and matured it perfects the twofold bliss that is bodily and mental blissWhen bliss is conceived and matured it perfects the threefold concentration that is momentary concentration access concentration and absorption concentrationOf these what is intended in this context by happiness is pervading happiness which is the root of absorption and comes by growth into association with absorption But as to the other word pleasing is bliss  Or alternatively it thoroughly devours  consumes  bodily and mental affliction thus it is bliss  It has gratifying as its characteristic Its function is to intensify associated states It is manifested as aidAnd wherever the two are associated happiness is the contentedness at getting a desirable objectand bliss is the actual experiencing of it when gotWhere there is happiness there is bliss but where there is bliss there is not necessarily happinessHappiness is included in the formations aggregatebliss is included in the feeling aggregateIf a man exhausted in a desert saw or heard about a pond on the edge of a wood he would have happinessif he went into the woods shade and used the water he would have blissAnd it should be understood that this is said because they are obvious on such occasions Accordingly this happiness and this bliss are of this jhāna or in this jhāna so in this way this jhāna is qualified by the words with happiness and bliss and also born of seclusionOr alternatively the words happiness and bliss can be taken as the happiness and the bliss independently like the Dhamma and the Discipline and so then it can be taken as seclusionborn happinessandbliss of this jhāna or in this jhāna so in this way it is the happiness and bliss rather than the jhāna that are born of seclusionFor just as the words born of seclusion can as at be taken as qualifying the word jhāna so too they can be taken here as at as qualifying the expression happiness and bliss and then that total expression is predicated of this jhāna So it is also correct to call happinessandbliss bornofseclusion a single expressionIn the Vibhaṅga it is stated in the way beginning This bliss accompanied by this happiness The meaning should be regarded in the same way there too First jhāna this will be explained below Enters upon  arrives at reaches is what is meantor else taking it as makes enter  then producing is what is meantIn the Vibhaṅga this is said Enters upon the gaining the regaining the reaching the arrival at the touching the realizing of the entering upon the meaning of which should be regarded in the same way And dwells in  by becoming possessed of jhāna of the kind described above through dwelling in a posture favourable to that jhāna he produces a posture a procedure a keeping an enduring a lasting a behaviour a dwelling of the personFor this is said in the Vibhaṅga Dwells in poses proceeds keeps endures lasts behaves dwells hence dwells is said Now it was also said above which abandons five factors possesses five factors  Herein the abandoning of the five factors should be understood as the abandoning of these five hindrances namely lust ill will stiffness and torpor agitation and worry and uncertaintyfor no jhāna arises until these have been abandonedand so they are called the factors of abandoningFor although other unprofitable things too are abandoned at the moment of jhāna still only these are specifically obstructive to jhāna The mind affected through lust by greed for varied objective fields does not become concentrated on an object consisting in unityor being overwhelmed by lust it does not enter on the way to abandoning the sensedesire elementWhen pestered by ill will towards an object it does not occur uninterruptedlyWhen overcome by stiffness and torpor it is unwieldyWhen seized by agitation and worry it is unquiet and buzzes aboutWhen stricken by uncertainty it fails to mount the way to accomplish the attainment of jhānaSo it is these only that are called factors of abandoning because they are specifically obstructive to jhāna But applied thought directs the mind onto the object sustained thought keeps it anchored there Happiness produced by the success of the effort refreshes the mind whose effort has succeeded through not being distracted by those hindrances and bliss intensifies it for the same reasonThen unification aided by this directing onto this anchoring this refreshing and this intensifying evenly and rightly centres the mind with its remaining associated states on the object consisting in unity Consequently possession of five factors should be understood as the arising of these five namely applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss and unification of mind For it is when these are arisen that jhāna is said to be arisenwhich is why they are called the five factors of possessionTherefore it should not be assumed that the jhāna is something other which possesses themBut just as The army with the four factors and Music with the five factors and The path with the eight factors  are stated simply in terms of their factors so this too should be understood as stated simply in terms of its factors when it is said to have five factors or possess five factors  And while these five factors are present also at the moment of access and are stronger in access than in normal consciousnessthey are still stronger here than in access and acquire the characteristic of the finematerial sphereFor applied thought arises here directing the mind on to the object in an extremely lucid mannerand sustained thought does so pressing the object very hardand the happiness and bliss pervade the entire bodyHence it is said And there is nothing of his whole body not permeated by the happiness and bliss born of seclusion And unification too arises in the complete contact with the object that the surface of a boxs lid has with the surface of its base This is how they differ from the others Although unification of mind is not actually listed among these factors in the summary version beginning which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought  nevertheless it is mentioned later in the Vibhaṅga as follows Jhāna it is applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss unification and so it is a factor toofor the intention with which the Blessed One gave the summary is the same as that with which he gave the exposition that follows it Is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics  the goodness in three ways is in the beginning middle and endThe possession of the ten characteristics should be understood as the characteristics of the beginning middle and end tooHere is the text Of the first jhāna purification of the way is the beginning intensification of equanimity is the middle and satisfaction is the end Of the first jhāna purification of the way is the beginning how many characteristics has the beginningThe beginning has three characteristics the mind is purified of obstructions to that jhāna because it is purified the mind makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity because it has made way the mind enters into that stateAnd it is since the mind becomes purified of obstructions and through being purified makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity and having made way enters into that statethat the purification of the way is the beginning of the first jhāna These are the three characteristics of the beginningHence it is said The first jhāna is good in the beginning which possesses three characteristics  Of the first jhāna intensification of equanimity is the middle how many characteristics has the middleThe middle has three characteristics He now looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity he looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unityAnd in that he now looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified and looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity and looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unitythat intensification of equanimity is the middle of the first jhāna These are the three characteristics of the middleHence it is said The first jhāna is good in the middle which possesses three characteristics  Of the first jhāna satisfaction is the end how many characteristics has the endThe end has four characteristics The satisfaction in the sense that there was nonexcess of any of the states arisen therein and the satisfaction in the sense that the faculties had a single function and the satisfaction in the sense that the appropriate energy was effective and the satisfaction in the sense of repetitionare the satisfaction in the end of the first jhāna These are the four characteristics of the endHence it is said The first jhāna is good in the end which possesses four characteristics  Herein purification of the way is access together with its concomitantsIntensification of equanimity is absorptionSatisfaction is reviewing So some commentBut it is said in the text The mind arrived at unity enters into purification of the way is intensified in equanimity and is satisfied by knowledge  and therefore it is from the standpoint within actual absorption that purification of the way firstly should be understood as the approach with intensification of equanimity as the function of equanimity consisting in specific neutrality and satisfaction as the manifestation of clarifying knowledges function in accomplishing nonexcess of statesHow Firstly in a cycle of consciousness in which absorption arises the mind becomes purified from the group of defilements called hindrances that are an obstruction to jhānaBeing devoid of obstruction because it has been purified it makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenityNow it is the absorption concentration itself occurring evenly that is called the sign of serenityBut the consciousness immediately before that reaches that state by way of change in a single continuity  and so it is said that it makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity And it is said that it enters into that state by approaching it through having made way for itThat is why in the first place purification of the way while referring to aspects existing in the preceding consciousness should nevertheless be understood as the approach at the moment of the first jhānas actual arising Secondly when he has more interest in purifying since there is no need to repurify what has already been purified thus it is said that he looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purifiedAnd when he has no more interest in concentrating again what has already made way for serenity by arriving at the state of serenity it is said that he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenityAnd when he has no more interest in again causing appearance of unity in what has already appeared as unity through abandonment of its association with defilement in making way for serenity it is said that he looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unityThat is why intensification of equanimity should be understood as the function of equanimity that consists in specific neutrality And lastly when equanimity was thus intensified the states called concentration and understanding produced there occurred coupled together without either one exceeding the other And also the five faculties beginning with faith occurred with the single function of deliverance owing to deliverance from the various defilements And also the energy appropriate to that which was favourable to their state of nonexcess and single function was effective And also its repetition occurs at that moment Now all these four aspects are only produced because it is after seeing with knowledge the various dangers in defilement and advantages in cleansing that satisfiedness purifiedness and clarifiedness ensue accordingly That is the reason why it was said that satisfaction should be understood as the manifestation of clarifying knowledges function in accomplishing nonexcess etc of states  Herein satisfaction as a function of knowledge is called the end since the knowledge is evident as due to onlooking equanimityaccording as it is said He looks on with complete equanimity at the mind thus exerted then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to equanimity Owing to equanimity the mind is liberated from the many sorts of defilements then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to liberationBecause of being liberated these states come to have a single functionthen the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to development in the sense of the single function  Now as to the words and so he has attained the first jhāna  of the earth kasiṇa  Here it is first because it starts a numerical series also it is first because it arises firstIt is called jhāna because of lighting the object and because of burning up opposition The disk of earth is called earth kasiṇa in the sense of entirety and the sign acquired with that as its support and also the jhāna acquired in the earthkasiṇa sign are so called tooSo that jhāna should be understood as of the earth kasiṇa in this sensewith reference to which it was said above and so he has attained to the first jhāna  of the earth kasiṇa When it has been attained in this way the mode of its attainment must be discerned by the meditator as if he were a hairsplitter or a cookFor when a very skilful archer who is working to split a hair actually splits the hair on one occasion he discerns the modes of the position of his feet the bow the bowstring and the arrow thusI split the hair as I stood thus with the bow thus the bowstring thus the arrow thusFrom then on he recaptures those same modes and repeats the splitting of the hair without failSo too the meditator must discern such modes as that of suitable food etc thus I attained this after eating this food attending on such a person in such a lodging in this posture at this timeIn this way when that absorption is lost he will be able to recapture those modes and renew the absorption or while familiarizing himself with it he will be able to repeat that absorption again and again And just as when a skilled cook is serving his employer he notices whatever he chooses to eat and from then on brings only that sort and so obtains a reward so too this meditator discerns such modes as that of the food etc at the time of the attaining and he recaptures them and reobtains absorption each time it is lostSo he must discern the modes as a hairsplitter or a cook doesAnd this has been said by the Blessed OneBhikkhus suppose a wise clever skilful cook set various kinds of sauces before a king or a kings minister such as sour bitter sharp sweet peppery and unpeppery salty and unsalty saucesthen the wise clever skilful cook learned his masters sign thus today this sauce pleased my master or he held out his hand for this one or he took a lot of this one or he praised this one or today the sour kind pleased my master or he held out his hand for the sour kind or he took a lot of the sour kind or he praised the sour kind  or he praised the unsalty kindthen the wise clever skilful cook is rewarded with clothing and wages and presentsWhy is thatBecause that wise clever skilful cook learned his masters sign in this waySo too bhikkhus here a wise clever skilful bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body as a body  He dwells contemplating feelings as feelings  consciousness as consciousness  mental objects as mental objects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the worldAs he dwells contemplating mental objects as mental objects his mind becomes concentrated his defilements are abandoned He learns the sign of thatThen that wise clever skilful bhikkhu is rewarded with a happy abiding here and now he is rewarded with mindfulness and full awarenessWhy is thatBecause that wise clever skilful bhikkhu learned his consciousnesss sign  And when he recaptures those modes by apprehending the sign he just succeeds in reaching absorption but not in making it lastIt lasts when it is absolutely purified from states that obstruct concentration When a bhikkhu enters upon a jhāna without first completely suppressing lust by reviewing the dangers in sense desires etc and without first completely tranquillizing bodily irritability by tranquillizing the body and without first completely removing stiffness and torpor by bringing to mind the elements of initiative etc  and without first completely abolishing agitation and worry by bringing to mind the sign of serenity etc and without first completely purifying his mind of other states that obstruct concentration then that bhikkhu soon comes out of that jhāna again like a bee that has gone into an unpurified hive like a king who has gone into an unclean park But when he enters upon a jhāna after first completely purifying his mind of states that obstruct concentration then he remains in the attainment even for a whole day like a bee that has gone into a completely purified hive like a king who has gone into a perfectly clean parkHence the Ancients saidSo let him dispel any sensual lust and resentmentAgitation as well and then torpor and doubt as the fifthThere let him find joy with a heart that is glad in seclusionLike a king in a garden where all and each corner is clean So if he wants to remain long in the jhāna he must enter upon it after first purifying his mind from obstructive statesEXTENSION OF THE SIGN In order to perfect the development of consciousness he should besides extend the counterpart sign according as acquiredNow there are two planes for extension namely access and absorptionfor it is possible to extend it on reaching access and on reaching absorptionBut the extending should be done consistently in one or the otherwhich is why it was said he should besides extend the counterpart sign according as acquired The way to extend it is thisThe meditator should not extend the sign as a clay bowl or a cake or boiled rice or a creeper or a piece of cloth is extended He should first delimit with his mind successive sizes for the sign according as acquired that is to say one finger two fingers three fingers four fingers and then extend it by the amount delimited just as a ploughman delimits with the plough the area to be ploughed and then ploughs within the area delimited or just as bhikkhus fixing a boundary first observe the marks and then fix itHe should not in fact extend it without having delimited the amount it is to be extended byAfter that has been done he can further extend it doing so by delimiting successive boundaries of say a span a ratana  the veranda the surrounding space the monastery and the boundaries of the village the town the district the kingdom and the ocean making the extreme limit the worldsphere or even beyond Just as young swans first starting to use their wings soar a little distance at a time and by gradually increasing it eventually reach the presence of the moon and sun so too when a bhikkhu extends the sign by successive delimitations in the way described he can extend it up to the limit of the world sphere or even beyond Then that sign appears to him like an ox hide stretched out with a hundred pegs over the earths ridges and hollows river ravines tracts of scrub and thorns and rocky inequalities in any area to which it has been extendedWhen a beginner has reached the first jhāna in this sign he should enter upon it often without reviewing it muchFor the first jhāna factors occur crudely and weakly in one who reviews it muchThen because of that they do not become conditions for higher endeavourWhile he is endeavouring for the unfamiliar higher jhāna he falls away from the first jhāna and fails to reach the second Hence the Blessed One saidBhikkhus suppose there were a foolish stupid mountain cow with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountainswho thought What if I walked in a direction I never walked in before ate grass I never ate before drank water I never drank beforeand without placing her forefoot properly she lifted up her hind foot then she would not walk in the direction she never walked in before or eat the grass she never ate before or drink the water she never drank beforeWhat if I walked in a direction I never walked in before  drank water I never drank beforeand also she would not get back safely to the place where she had thoughtWhy is thatBecause that mountain cow was foolish and stupid with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains So too bhikkhus here is a certain foolish stupid bhikkhu with no knowledge of fields and no skill quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things in entering upon and dwelling in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought with happiness and bliss born of seclusionhe does not repeat develop or cultivate that sign or properly establish it He thinks What if with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought I entered upon and dwelt in the second jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of concentrationHe is unable with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought to enter upon and dwell in the second jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of concentrationThen he thinks What if quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things I entered upon and dwelt in the first jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of seclusionHe is unable quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things to enter upon and dwell in the first jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of seclusionThis bhikkhu is called one who has slipped between the two who has fallen between the two just like the foolish stupid mountain cow with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains   Therefore he should acquire mastery in the five ways first of all with respect to the first jhānaHerein these are the five kinds of mastery mastery in adverting mastery in attaining mastery in resolving  mastery in emerging and mastery in reviewingHe adverts to the first jhāna where when and for as long as he wishes he has no difficulty in adverting thus it is mastery in advertingHe attains the first jhāna where  he has no difficulty in attaining thus it is mastery in attaining and all the rest should be quoted in detail  The explanation of the meaning here is this When he emerges from the first jhāna and first of all adverts to the applied thought then next to the adverting that arose interrupting the lifecontinuum either four or five impulsions impel with that applied thought as their objectThen there are two lifecontinuum consciousnesses Then there is adverting with the sustained thought as its object and followed by impulsions in the way just stated When he is able to prolong his conscious process uninterruptedly in this way with the five jhāna factors then his mastery of adverting is successfulBut this mastery is found at its acme of perfection in the Blessed Ones Twin Marvel  or for others on the aforesaid occasionsThere is no quicker mastery in adverting than that The venerable MahāMoggallānas ability to enter upon jhāna quickly as in the taming of the royal nāgaserpent Nandopananda  is called mastery in attaining Ability to remain in jhāna for a moment consisting in exactly a finger snap or exactly ten fingersnaps is called mastery in resolving Ability to emerge quickly in the same way is called mastery in emerging The story of the Elder Buddharakkhita may be told in order to illustrate both these lastEight years after his admission to the Community that elder was sitting in the midst of thirty thousand bhikkhus possessed of supernormal powers who had gathered to attend upon the sickness of the Elder Mahā Rohanagutta at Therambatthala He saw a royal supaṇṇa swooping down from the sky intending to seize an attendant royal nāgaserpent as he was getting ricegruel accepted for the elder The Elder Buddharakkhita created a rock meanwhile and seizing the royal nāga by the arm he pushed him inside itThe royal supaṇṇa gave the rock a blow and made offThe senior elder remarked Friends if Rakkhita had not been there we should all have been put to shame  Mastery in reviewing is described in the same way as mastery in advertingfor the reviewing impulsions are in fact those next to the adverting mentioned there  When he has once acquired mastery in these five ways then on emerging from the now familiar first jhāna he can regard the flaws in it in this way This attainment is threatened by the nearness of the hindrances and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the applied and sustained thought He can bring the second jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the first jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the second When he has emerged from the first jhāna applied and sustained thought appear gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness while happiness and bliss and unification of mind appear peaceful Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factors and obtaining the peaceful factors knowing now the second jhāna will arise there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the lifecontinuumAfter that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere belonging to the second jhānaThe rest are of the sense sphere of the kinds already stated THE SECOND JHNA And at this point With the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and dwells in the second jhāna which has internal confidence and singleness of mind without applied thought without sustained thought with happiness and bliss born of concentration and so he has attained the second jhāna which abandons two factors possesses three factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa Herein with the stilling of applied and sustained thought with the stilling with the surmounting of these two namely applied thought and sustained thought with their nonmanifestation at the moment of the second jhāna is what is meantHerein although none of the states belonging to the first jhāna exist in the second jhānafor the contact etc  in the first jhāna are one and here they are anotherit should be understood all the same that the phrase with the stilling of applied and sustained thought is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the attaining of the other jhānas beginning with that of the second from the first is effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case Internal here ones own internal is intendedbut that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too with the words internally in oneself And since ones own internal is intended the meaning here is this born in oneself generated in ones own continuity Confidence it is faith that is called confidenceThe jhāna has confidence because it is associated with confidenceas a cloth has blue colour because it is associated with blue colourOr alternatively that jhāna is stated to have confidence because it makes the mind confident with the confidence possessed by it and by stilling the disturbance created by applied and sustained thoughtAnd with this conception of the meaning the word construction must be taken as confidence of mindBut with the firstmentioned conception of the meaning the words of mind must be construed with singleness Here is the construction of the meaning in that case Unique it comes up  thus it is single  the meaning is it comes up as the superlative the best because it is not overtopped by applied and sustained thoughtfor the best is called unique in the worldOr it is permissible to say that when deprived of applied and sustained thought it is unique without companionOr alternatively it evokes associated states thus it is an evoker  the meaning is it arousesAnd that is unique in the sense of best and it is an evoker  thus it is a unique evoker  This is a term for concentrationThen since the second jhāna gives existingness to  augments this single thing it gives singleness But as this single thing is a minds not a beings or a souls so singleness of mind is said It might be asked But does not this faith exist in the first jhāna too and also this concentration with the name of the single thing Then why is only this second jhāna said to have confidence and singleness of mindIt may be replied as follows It is because that first jhāna is not fully confident owing to the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought like water ruffled by ripples and wavelets That is why although faith does exist in it it is not called confidenceAnd there too concentration is not fully evident because of the lack of full confidence That is why it is not called singleness thereBut in this second jhāna faith is strong having got a footing in the absence of the impediments of applied and sustained thought and concentration is also evident through having strong faith as its companion That may be understood as the reason why only this jhāna is described in this way But that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too with the words Confidence is faith having faith trust full confidenceSingleness of mind is steadiness of consciousness  right concentration And this commentary on the meaning should not be so understood as to conflict with the meaning stated in that way but on the contrary so as to agree and concur with it Without applied thought without sustained thought since it has been abandoned by development there is no applied thought in this or of this jhāna thus it is without applied thoughtThe same explanation applies to sustained thoughtAlso it is said in the Vibhaṅga So this applied thought and this sustained thought are quieted quietened stilled set at rest set quite at rest done away with quite done away with dried up quite dried up made an end of hence it is said without applied thought without sustained thought Here it may be asked Has not this meaning already been established by the words with the stilling of applied and sustained thoughtSo why is it said again without applied thought without sustained thoughtsIt may be replied Yes that meaning has already been established But this does not indicate that meaning Did we not say earlier The phrase with the stilling of applied and sustained thought is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the act of attaining the other jhānas beginning with that of the second from the first is effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case   Besides this confidence comes about with the act of stilling not the darkness of defilement but the applied and sustained thoughtAnd the singleness comes about not as in access jhāna with the abandoning of the hindrances nor as in the first jhāna with the manifestation of the factors but with the act of stilling the applied and sustained thought So that first clause indicates the cause of the confidence and singlenessIn the same way this jhāna is without applied thought and without sustained thought not as in the third and fourth jhānas or as in eyeconsciousness etc with just absence but with the actual act of stilling the applied and sustained thought So that first clause also indicates the cause of the state without applied and sustained thought it does not indicate the bare absence of applied and sustained thoughtThe bare absence of applied and sustained thought is indicated by this second clause namely without applied thought without sustained thoughtConsequently it needs to be stated notwithstanding that the first has already been stated Born of concentration born of the firstjhāna concentration or born of associated concentration is the meaningHerein although the first was born of associated concentration too still it is only this concentration that is quite worthy to be called concentration because of its complete confidence and extreme immobility due to absence of disturbance by applied and sustained thought So only this jhāna is called born of concentration and that is in order to recommend itWith happiness and bliss is as already explainedSecond second in numerical seriesAlso second because entered upon second Then it was also said above which abandons two factors possesses three factors  Herein the abandoning of two factors should be understood as the abandoning of applied thought and sustained thoughtBut while the hindrances are abandoned at the moment of the access of the first jhāna in the case of this jhāna the applied thought and sustained thought are not abandoned at the moment of its accessIt is only at the moment of actual absorption that the jhāna arises without themHence they are called its factors of abandoning Its possession of three factors should be understood as the arising of the three that is happiness bliss and unification of mindSo when it is said in the Vibhaṅga Jhāna confidence happiness bliss unification of mind  this is said figuratively in order to show that jhāna with its equipmentBut excepting the confidence this jhāna has literally three factors qua factors that have attained to the characteristic of lighting according as it is said What is jhāna of three factors on that occasion It is happiness bliss unification of mind The rest is as in the case of the first jhānaOnce this has been obtained in this way and he has mastery in the five ways already described then on emerging from the now familiar second jhāna he can regard the flaws in it thus This attainment is threatened by the nearness of applied and sustained thought Whatever there is in it of happiness of mental excitement proclaims its grossness  and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the happiness so expressed He can bring the third jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the second jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the third When he has emerged from the second jhāna happiness appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness while bliss and unification appear peacefulThen as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors knowing now the third jhāna will arise there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the lifecontinuumAfter that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere belonging to the third jhāna The rest are of the kinds already stated THE THIRD JHNA And at this point With the fading away of happiness as well he dwells in equanimity and mindful and fully aware he feels bliss with his body he enters upon and dwells in the third jhāna on account of which the Noble Ones announce He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful and so he has attained the third jhāna which abandons one factor possesses two factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇaHerein with the fading away of happiness as well  fading away is distaste for or surmounting of happiness of the kind already describedBut the words as well between the two words pītiyā and virāgā have the meaning of a conjunction they conjoin to them either the word stilling or the expression the stilling of applied and sustained thought in the description of the second jhānaHerein when taken as conjoining stilling the construction to be understood is with the fading away and what is more with the stilling of happinessWith this construction fading away has the meaning of distaste so the meaning can be regarded as with distaste for and with the stilling of happinessBut when taken as conjoining the words stilling of applied and sustained thought then the construction to be understood is with the fading of happiness and further with the stilling of applied and sustained thoughtWith this construction fading away has the meaning of surmounting so this meaning can be regarded as with the surmounting of happiness and with the stilling of applied and sustained thought  Of course applied and sustained thought have already been stilled in the second jhāna too However this is said in order to show the path to this third jhāna and in order to recommend itFor when with the stilling of applied and sustained thought is said it is declared that the path to this jhāna is necessarily by the stilling of applied and sustained thoughtAnd just as although mistaken view of individuality etc are not abandoned in the attaining of the third noble path but in the first yet when it is recommended by describing their abandonment thus With the abandoning of the five lower fetters  then it awakens eagerness in those trying to attain that third noble path so too when the stilling of applied and sustained thought is mentioned though they are not actually stilled here but in the second this is a recommendationHence the meaning expressed is this With the surmounting of happiness and with the stilling of applied and sustained thought  He dwells in equanimity it watches things as they arise  thus it is equanimity it sees fairly sees without partiality  is the meaningA possessor of the third jhāna is said to dwell in equanimity since he possesses equanimity that is clear abundant and soundEquanimity is of ten kinds sixfactored equanimity equanimity as a divine abiding equanimity as an enlightenment factor equanimity of energy equanimity about formations equanimity as a feeling equanimity about insight equanimity as specific neutrality equanimity of jhāna and equanimity of purification Herein six factored equanimity is a name for the equanimity in one whose cankers are destroyed It is the mode of nonabandonment of the natural state of purity when desirable or undesirable objects of the six kinds come into focus in the six doors described thus Here a bhikkhu whose cankers are destroyed is neither glad nor sad on seeing a visible object with the eye he dwells in equanimity mindful and fully aware  Equanimity as a divine abiding is a name for equanimity consisting in the mode of neutrality towards beings described thus He dwells intent upon one quarter with his heart endued with equanimity  Equanimity as an enlightenment factor is a name for equanimity consisting in the mode of neutrality in conascent states described thus He develops the equanimity enlightenment factor depending on relinquishment  Equanimity of energy is a name for the equanimity otherwise known as neither overstrenuous nor overlax energy described thus From time to time he brings to mind the sign of equanimity  Equanimity about formations is a name for equanimity consisting in neutrality about apprehending reflexion and composure regarding the hindrances etc described thus How many kinds of equanimity about formations arise through concentration How many kinds of equanimity about formations arise through insight Eight kinds of equanimity about formations arise through concentration Ten kinds of equanimity about formations arise through insight  Equanimity as a feeling is a name for the equanimity known as neither painnorpleasure described thus On the occasion on which a sensesphere profitable consciousness has arisen accompanied by equanimity  Equanimity about insight is a name for equanimity consisting in neutrality about investigation described thus What exists what has become that he abandons and he obtains equanimity  Equanimity as specific neutrality is a name for equanimity consisting in the equal efficiency of conascent states it is contained among the orwhatever states beginning with zeal  Equanimity of jhāna is a name for equanimity producing impartiality towards even the highest bliss described thus He dwells in equanimity  Purifying equanimity is a name for equanimity purified of all opposition and so consisting in uninterestedness in stilling opposition described thus The fourth jhāna which  has mindfulness purified by equanimity  Herein sixfactored equanimity equanimity as a divine abiding equanimity as an enlightenment factor equanimity as specific neutrality equanimity of jhāna and purifying equanimity are one in meaning that is equanimity as specific neutralityTheir difference however is one of positionlike the difference in a single being as a boy a youth an adult a general a king and so onTherefore of these it should be understood that equanimity as an enlightenment factor etc are not found where there is sixfactored equanimityor that sixfactored equanimity etc are not found where there is equanimity as an enlightenment factorAnd just as these have one meaning so also equanimity about formations and equanimity about insight have one meaning toofor they are simply understanding classed in these two ways according to function Just as when a man has seen a snake go into his house in the evening and has hunted for it with a forked stick and then when he has seen it lying in the grain store and has looked to discover whether it is actually a snake or not and then by seeing three marks has no more doubt and so there is neutrality in him about further investigating whether or not it is a snake so too when a man has begun insight and he sees with insight knowledge the three characteristics then there is neutrality in him about further investigating the impermanence etc of formations and that neutrality is called equanimity about insight But just as when the man has caught hold of the snake securely with the forked stick and thinks How shall I get rid of the snake without hurting it or getting bitten by it then as he is seeking only the way to get rid of it there is neutrality in him about the catching hold of itso too when a man through seeking the three characteristics sees the three kinds of becoming as if burning then there is neutrality in him about catching hold of formations and that neutrality is called equanimity about formations So when equanimity about insight is established equanimity about formations is established tooBut it is divided into two in this way according to function in other words according to neutrality about investigating and about catching holdEquanimity of energy and equanimity as feeling are different both from each other and from the rest So of these kinds of equanimity it is equanimity of jhāna that is intended hereThat has the characteristic of neutrality Its function is to be unconcerned It is manifested as uninterestedness Its proximate cause is the fading away of happinessHere it may be said Is this not simply equanimity as specific neutrality in the meaning And that exists in the first and second jhānas as wellso this clause He dwells in equanimity ought to be stated of those also Why is it notIt may be replied Because its function is unevident there since it is overshadowed by applied thought and the restBut it appears here with a quite evident function with head erect as it were because it is not overshadowed by applied thought and sustained thought and happiness That is why it is stated here He dwells in equanimity the commentary on the meaning of the clause is thus completed in all its aspects Now as to mindful and fully aware here he remembers  thus he is mindful He has full awareness  thus he is fully aware This is mindfulness and full awareness stated as personal attributesHerein mindfulness has the characteristic of remembering Its function is not to forget It is manifested as guardingFull awareness has the characteristic of nonconfusion Its function is to investigate  It is manifested as scrutiny Herein although this mindfulness and this full awareness exist in the earlier jhānas as wellfor one who is forgetful and not fully aware does not attain even access let alone absorptionyet because of the comparative grossness of those jhānas the minds going is easy there like that of a man on level ground and so the functions of mindfulness and full awareness are not evident in themBut it is only stated here because the subtlety of this jhāna which is due to the abandoning of the gross factors requires that the minds going always includes the functions of mindfulness and full awareness like that of a man on a razors edgeWhat is more just as a calf that follows a cow returns to the cow when taken away from her if not prevented so too when this third jhāna is led away from happiness it would return to happiness if not prevented by mindfulness and full awareness and would rejoin happinessAnd besides beings are greedy for bliss and this kind of bliss is exceedingly sweet since there is none greaterBut here there is nongreed for the bliss owing to the influence of the mindfulness and full awareness not for any other reason And so it should also be understood that it is stated only here in order to emphasize this meaning too Now as to the clause he feels bliss with his body here although in one actually possessed of the third jhāna there is no concern about feeling blissnevertheless he would feel the bliss associated with his mental bodyand after emerging from the jhāna he would also feel bliss since his material body would have been affected by the exceedingly superior matter originated by that bliss associated with the mental bodyIt is in order to point to this meaning that the words he feels bliss with his body are said Now as to the clause that  on account of which the Noble Ones announce He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful here it is the jhāna on account of which as cause on account of which as reason the Noble Ones that is to say the Enlightened Ones etc announce teach declare establish reveal expound explain clarify that person who possesses the third jhānathey praise is what is intendedWhyBecause he dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindfulHe enters upon and dwells in that third jhāna is how the construction should be understood hereBut why do they praise him thusBecause he is worthy of praise For this man is worthy of praise since he has equanimity towards the third jhāna though it possesses exceedingly sweet bliss and has reached the perfection of bliss and he is not drawn towards it by a liking for the blissand he is mindful with the mindfulness established in order to prevent the arising of happiness and he feels with his mental body the undefiled bliss beloved of Noble Ones cultivated by Noble OnesBecause he is worthy of praise in this way it should be understood Noble Ones praise him with the words He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful thus declaring the special qualities that are worthy of praiseThird it is the third in the numerical series and it is third because it is entered upon third Then it was said which abandons one factor possesses two factors  here the abandoning of the one factor should be understood as the abandoning of happinessBut that is abandoned only at the moment of absorption as applied thought and sustained thought are at that of the second jhānahence it is called its factor of abandoning The possession of the two factors should be understood as the arising of the two namely bliss and unificationSo when it is said in the Vibhaṅga Jhāna equanimity mindfulness full awareness bliss unification of mind  this is said figuratively in order to show that jhāna with its equipmentBut excepting the equanimity and mindfulness and full awareness this jhāna has literally only two factors qua factors that have attained to the characteristic of lighting according as it is said What is the jhāna of two factors on that occasion It is bliss and unification of mind The rest is as in the case of the first jhāna Once this has been obtained in this way and once he has mastery in the five ways already described then on emerging from the now familiar third jhāna he can regard the flaws in it thus This attainment is threatened by the nearness of happiness Whatever there is in it of mental concern about bliss proclaims its grossness  and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the bliss so expressed  He can bring the fourth jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the third jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the fourth When he has emerged from the third jhāna the bliss in other words the mental joy appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness while the equanimity as feeling and the unification of mind appear peaceful Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors knowing now the fourth jhāna will arise there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the lifecontinuumAfter that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere belonging to the fourth jhāna The rest are of the kinds already stated  But there is this difference blissful feeling is not a condition as repetition condition for neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling and the preliminary work must be aroused in the case of the fourth jhāna with neither painfulnorpleasant feeling consequently these consciousnesses of the preliminary work are associated with neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingand here happiness vanishes simply owing to their association with equanimityTHE FOURTH JHNA And at this point With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna which has neitherpainnorpleasure and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity  and so he has attained the fourth jhāna which abandons one factor possesses two factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa Herein with the abandoning of pleasure and pain with the abandoning of bodily pleasure and bodily painWith the previous which took place before not in the moment of the fourth jhānaDisappearance of joy and grief with the previous disappearance of the two that is mental bliss and mental pain with the abandoning is what is meant But when does the abandoning of these take placeAt the moment of access of the four jhānasFor mental joy is only abandoned at the moment of the fourthjhāna accesswhile bodily pain mental grief and bodily bliss are abandoned respectively at the moments of access of the first second and third jhānasSo although the order in which they are abandoned is not actually mentioned nevertheless the abandoning of the pleasure pain joy and grief is stated here according to the order in which the faculties are summarized in the Indriya Vibhaṅga  But if these are only abandoned at the moments of access of the several jhānas why is their cessation said to take place in the jhāna itself in the following passage And where does the arisen pain faculty cease without remainder Here bhikkhus quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna which is  born of seclusionIt is here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder  Where does the arisen grief faculty cease without remainder  in the second jhāna  Where does the arisen pleasure faculty cease without remainder  in the third jhāna  Where does the arisen joy faculty cease without remainder Here bhikkhus with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna which  has mindfulness purified by equanimity It is here that the arisen joy faculty ceases without remainder  It is said in that way there referring to reinforced cessationFor in the first jhāna etc it is their reinforced cessation not just their cessation that takes placeAt the moment of access it is just their cessation not their reinforced cessation that takes place For accordingly during the first jhāna access which has multiple adverting there could be rearising of the bodily pain faculty due to contact with gadflies flies etc or the discomfort of an uneven seat though that pain faculty had already ceased but not so during absorptionOr else though it has ceased during access it has not absolutely ceased there since it is not quite beaten out by oppositionBut during absorption the whole body is showered with bliss owing to pervasion by happiness And the pain faculty has absolutely ceased in one whose body is showered with bliss since it is beaten out then by oppositionAnd during the secondjhāna access too which has multiple advertings there could be rearising of the mental grief faculty although it had already ceased there because it arises when there is bodily weariness and mental vexation which have applied thought and sustained thought as their conditionbut it does not arise when applied and sustained thought are absentWhen it arises it does so in the presence of applied and sustained thought and they are not abandoned in the secondjhāna access but this is not so in the second jhāna itself because its conditions are abandoned there Likewise in the thirdjhāna access there could be rearising of the abandoned bodily pleasure faculty in one whose body was pervaded by the superior materiality originated by the consciousness associated with the happiness But not so in the third jhāna itselfFor in the third jhāna the happiness that is a condition for the bodily bliss has ceased entirelyLikewise in the fourthjhāna access there could be rearising of the abandoned mental joy faculty because of its nearness and because it has not been properly surmounted owing to the absence of equanimity brought to absorption strength But not so in the fourth jhāna itselfAnd that is why in each case the words without remainder are included thus It is here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder  Here it may be asked Then if these kinds of feeling are abandoned in the access in this way why are they brought in hereIt is done so that they can be readily graspedFor the neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling described here by the words which has neitherpainnorpleasure is subtle hard to recognize and not readily grasped So just as when a cattleherd wants to catch a refractory ox that cannot be caught at all by approaching it he collects all the cattle into one pen and lets them out one by one and then he says That is it catch it and so it gets caught as well so too the Blessed One has collected all these five kinds of feeling together so that they can be grasped readilyfor when they are shown collected together in this way then what is not bodily pleasure or bodily pain or mental joy or mental grief can still be grasped in this way This is neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling  Besides this may be understood as said in order to show the condition for the neitherpainfulnorpleasant minddeliveranceFor the abandoning of bodily pain etc are conditions for thataccording as it is said There are four conditions friend for the attainment of the neitherpainfulnorpleasant mind deliveranceHere friend with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna  equanimityThese are the four conditions for the attainment of the neitherpainfulnorpleasant minddeliverance  Or alternatively just as although mistaken view of individuality etc have already been abandoned in the earlier paths they are nevertheless mentioned as abandoned in the description of the third path for the purpose of recommending it  so too these kinds of feeling can be understood as mentioned here for the purpose of recommending this jhānaOr alternatively they can be understood as mentioned for the purpose of showing that greed and hate are very far away owing to the removal of their conditionsfor of these pleasure is a condition for joy and joy for greedpain is a condition for grief and grief for hateSo with the removal of pleasure  etc greed and hate are very far away since they are removed along with their conditions Which has neitherpainnorpleasure no pain owing to absence of painno pleasure owing to absence of pleasure By this he indicates the third kind of feeling that is in opposition both to pain and to pleasure not the mere absence of pain and pleasureThis third kind of feeling named neitherpainnorpleasure is also called equanimityIt has the characteristic of experiencing what is contrary to both the desirable and the undesirable Its function is neutral Its manifestation is unevident Its proximate cause should be understood as the cessation of pleasure  And has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity has purity of mindfulness brought about by equanimityFor the mindfulness in this jhāna is quite purified and its purification is effected by equanimity not by anything elseThat is why it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimityAlso it is said in the Vibhaṅga This mindfulness is cleared purified clarified by equanimityhence it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity And the equanimity due to which there comes to be this purity of mindfulness should be understood as specific neutrality in meaningAnd not only mindfulness is purified by it here but also all associated states However the teaching is given under the heading of mindfulnessHerein this equanimity exists in the three lower jhānas toobut just as although a crescent moon exists by day but is not purified or clear since it is outshone by the suns radiance in the daytime or since it is deprived of the night which is its ally owing to gentleness and owing to helpfulness to it so too this crescent moon of equanimity consisting in specific neutrality exists in the first jhāna etc but it is not purified since it is outshone by the glare of the opposing states consisting in applied thought etc and since it is deprived of the night of equanimityasfeeling for its allyand because it is not purified the conascent mindfulness and other states are not purified either like the unpurified crescent moons radiance by dayThat is why no one among these first three jhānas is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimityBut here this crescent moon consisting in specific neutrality is utterly pure because it is not outshone by the glare of the opposing states consisting in applied thought etc and because it has the night of equanimityasfeeling for its allyAnd since it is purified the conascent mindfulness and other states are purified and clear also like the purified crescent moons radianceThat it should be understood is why only this jhāna is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimityFourth it is fourth in numerical seriesand it is fourth because it is entered upon fourth Then it was said which abandons one factor possesses two factors  here the abandoning of the one factor should be understood as the abandoning of joyBut that joy is actually abandoned in the first impulsions of the same cognitive series Hence it is called its factor of abandoningThe possession of the two factors should be understood as the arising of the two namely equanimity as feeling and unification of mindThe rest is as stated in the case of the first jhānaThis in the first place is according to the fourfold reckoning of jhāna When however he is developing fivefold jhāna then on emerging from the now familiar first jhāna he can regard the flaws in it in this way This attainment is threatened by the nearness of the hindrances and its factors are weakened by the grossness of applied thought  He can bring the second jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the first jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the second Now he emerges from the first jhāna mindfully and fully aware and only applied thought appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors while the sustained thought etc appear peacefulThen as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors the second jhāna arises in him in the way already describedIts factor of abandoning is applied thought onlyThe four beginning with sustained thought are the factors that it possessesThe rest is as already stated When this has been obtained in this way and once he has mastery in the five ways already described then on emerging from the now familiar second jhāna he can regard the flaws in it in this way This attainment is threatened by the nearness of applied thought and its factors are weakened by the grossness of sustained thought  He can bring the third jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the second jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the third Now he emerges from the second jhāna mindfully and fully aware only sustained thought appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors while happiness etc appear peacefulThen as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors the third jhāna arises in him in the way already describedIts factor of abandoning is sustained thought only The three beginning with happiness as in the second jhāna in the fourfold reckoning are the factors that it possessesThe rest is as already stated So that which is the second in the fourfold reckoning becomes the second and third in the fivefold reckoning by being divided into twoAnd those which are the third and fourth in the former reckoning become the fourth and fifth in this reckoningThe first remains the first in each casein the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Concen trationcalled The Description of the Earth KasiṇaThe fourth chapterNow the water kasiṇa comes next after the earth kasiṇa Here is the detailed explanation One who wants to develop the water kasiṇa should as in the case of the earth kasiṇa seat himself comfortably and apprehend the sign in water that is either made up or not made up etc and so all the rest should be repeated in detail And as in this case so with all those that follow in this chapterWe shall in fact not repeat even this much and shall only point out what is differentHere too when someone has had practice in previous lives the sign arises for him in water that is not made up such as a pool a lake a lagoon or the ocean as in the case of the Elder CūḷaSīvaThe venerable one it seems thought to abandon gain and honour and live a secluded life He boarded a ship at Mahātittha and sailed to Jambudīpa  As he gazed at the ocean meanwhile the kasiṇa sign the counterpart of that ocean arose in him Someone with no such previous practice should guard against the four faults of a kasiṇa and not apprehend the water as one of the colours blue yellow red or white He should fill a bowl or a fourfooted water pot to the brim with water uncontaminated by soil taken in the open through a clean cloth strainer or with any other clear unturbid water He should put it in a screened place on the outskirts of the monastery as already described and seat himself comfortably He should neither review its colournor bring its characteristic to mindApprehending the colour as belonging to its physical support he should set his mind on the name concept as the most outstanding mental datum and using any among the various names for water such as rain  liquid  dew  fluid  he should develop the kasiṇa by using preferably the obvious water waterAs he develops it in this way the two signs eventually arise in him in the way already describedHere however the learning sign has the appearance of moving If the water has bubbles of froth mixed with it the learning sign has the same appearance and it is evident as a fault in the kasiṇaBut the counterpart sign appears inactive like a crystal fan set in space like the disk of a looking glass made of crystalWith the appearance of that sign he reaches access jhāna and the jhāna tetrad and pentad in the way already describedAnyone who wants to develop the fire kasiṇa should apprehend the sign in fireHerein when someone with merit having had previous practice is apprehending the sign it arises in him in any sort of fire not made up as he looks at the fiery combustion in a lamps flame or in a furnace or in a place for baking bowls or in a forest conflagration as in the Elder Cittaguttas caseThe sign arose in that elder as he was looking at a lamps flame while he was in the Uposatha house on the day of preaching the DhammaAnyone else should make one upHere are the directions for making it He should split up some damp heartwood dry it and break it up into short lengths He should go to a suitable tree root or to a shed and there make a pile in the way done for baking bowls and have it lit He should make a hole a span and four fingers wide in a rush mat or a piece of leather or a clothand after hanging it in front of the fire he should sit down in the way already described Instead of giving attention to the grass and sticks below or the smoke above he should apprehend the sign in the dense combustion in the middle He should not review the colour as blue or yellow etc or give attention to its characteristic as heat etcbut taking the colour as belonging to its physical support and setting his mind on the name concept as the most outstanding mental datum and using any among the names for fire such as the Bright One  the Leaver of the Black Trail  the Knower of Creatures  the Altar of Sacrifice  etc he should develop the kasiṇa by using preferably the obvious fire fireAs he develops it in this way the two signs eventually arise in him as already describedHerein the learning sign appears like the fire to keep sinking down as the flame keeps detaching itselfBut when someone apprehends it in a kasiṇa that is not made up any fault in the kasiṇa is evident in the learning sign and any firebrand or pile of embers or ashes or smoke appears in itThe counterpart sign appears motionless like a piece of red cloth set in space like a gold fan like a gold columnWith its appearance he reaches access jhāna and the jhāna tetrad and pentad in the way already describedAnyone who wants to develop the air kasiṇa should apprehend the sign in airAnd that is done either by sight or by touchFor this is said in the Commentaries One who is learning the air kasiṇa apprehends the sign in air He notices the tops of growing sugarcane moving to and fro or he notices the tops of bamboos or the tops of trees or the ends of the hair moving to and fro or he notices the touch of it on the bodySo when he sees sugarcanes with dense foliage standing with tops level or bamboos or trees or else hair four fingers long on a mans head being struck by the wind he should establish mindfulness in this way This wind is striking on this place Or he can establish mindfulness where the wind strikes a part of his body after entering by a window opening or by a crack in a wall and using any among the names for wind beginning with wind  breeze  blowing  he should develop the kasiṇa by using preferably the obvious air airHere the learning sign appears to move like the swirl of hot steam on rice gruel just withdrawn from an ovenThe counterpart sign is quiet and motionlessThe rest should be understood in the way already describedNext it is said in the Commentaries One who is learning the blue kasiṇa apprehends the sign in blue whether in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour element Firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a bush with blue flowers or such flowers spread out on a place of offering or any blue cloth or gem But anyone else should take flowers such as blue lotuses girikaṇṇikā flowers etc and spread them out to fill a tray or a flat basket completely so that no stamen or stalk shows or with only their petals Or he can fill it with blue cloth bunched up togetheror he can fasten the cloth over the rim of the trayor basket like the covering of a drumOr he can make a kasiṇa disk either portable as described under the earth kasiṇa or on a wall with one of the colour elements such as bronzegreen leafgreen añjanaointment black surrounding it with a different colourAfter that he should bring it to mind as blue blue in the way already described under the earth kasiṇa And here too any fault in the kasiṇa is evident in the learning sign the stamens and stalks and the gaps between the petals etc are apparentThe counterpart sign appears like a crystal fan in space free from the kasiṇa diskThe rest should be understood as already describedLikewise with the yellow kasiṇafor this is said One who is learning the yellow kasiṇa apprehends the sign in yellow either in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour elementTherefore here too when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a flowering bush or flowers spread out or yellow cloth or colour element as in the case of the Elder CittaguttaThat venerable one it seems saw an offering being made on the flower altar with pattaṅga flowers at Cittalapabbata and as soon as he saw it the sign arose in him the size of the flower altarAnyone else should make a kasiṇa in the way described for the blue kasiṇa with kaṇikāra flowers etc or with yellow cloth or with a colour element He should bring it to mind as yellow yellowThe rest is as beforeLikewise with the red kasiṇafor this is said One who is learning the red kasiṇa apprehends the sign in red either in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour elementTherefore here too when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a bandhujīvaka bush etc in flower or such flowers spread out or a red cloth or gem or colour elementBut anyone else should make a kasiṇa in the way already described for the blue kasiṇa with jayasumana flowers or bandhujīvaka or red koraṇḍaka flowers etc or with red cloth or with a colour elementHe should bring it to mind as red red The rest is as before Of the white kasiṇa it is said One who is learning the white kasiṇa apprehends the sign in white either in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour element So firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a flowering bush of such a kind or vassikasumana flowers etc spread out or a heap of white lotuses or lilies white cloth or colour element and it also arises in a tin disk a silver disk and the moons disk Anyone else should make a kasiṇa in the way already described for the blue kasiṇa with the white flowers already mentioned or with cloth or colour element He should bring it to mind as white whiteThe rest is as before Of the light kasiṇa it is said One who is learning the light kasiṇa apprehends the sign in light in a hole in a wall or in a keyhole or in a window opening So firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees the circle thrown on a wall or a floor by sunlight or moonlight entering through a hole in a wall etc or when he sees a circle thrown on the ground by sunlight or moonlight coming through a gap in the branches of a denseleaved tree or through a gap in a hut made of closely packed branchesAnyone else should use that same kind of circle of luminosity just described developing it as luminosity luminosity or light lightIf he cannot do so he can light a lamp inside a pot close the pots mouth make a hole in it and place it with the hole facing a wallThe lamplight coming out of the hole throws a circle on the wall He should develop that as light lightThis lasts longer than the other kindsHere the learning sign is like the circle thrown on the wall or the groundThe counterpart sign is like a compact bright cluster of lightsThe rest is as before Of the limitedspace kasiṇa it is said One who is learning the space kasiṇa apprehends the sign in a hole in a wall or in a keyhole or in a window opening So firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees any such gap as a hole in a wallAnyone else should make a hole a span and four fingers broad in a well thatched hut or in a piece of leather or in a rush mat and so on He should develop one of these or a hole such as a hole in a wall as space spaceHere the learning sign resembles the hole together with the wall etc that surrounds it Attempts to extend it failThe counterpart sign appears only as a circle of space Attempts to extend it succeedThe rest should be understood as described under the earth kasiṇa He with Ten Powers ten kasiṇasTells who all things did see each of which can beThe cause of fourfold and of fivefold jhāna The finematerial spheres own master keyTo tackle each andhow they are developed Now knowing their descriptions and the waywith its special part to playStudy each There are some further points that will repayOf these the earth kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as the state described as Having been one he becomes many  etc and stepping or standing or sitting on space or on water by creating earth and the acquisition of the bases of mastery by the limited and measureless methodThe water kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as diving in and out of the earth  causing rain storms creating rivers and seas making the earth and rocks and palaces quake The fire kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as smoking flaming causing showers of sparks countering fire with fire ability to burn only what one wants to burn  causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eye burning up the body by means of the fire element at the time of attaining Nibbāna The air kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as going with the speed of the wind causing wind stormsThe blue kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating black forms causing darkness acquisition of the bases of mastery by the method of fairness and ugliness and attainment of the liberation by the beautiful The yellow kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating yellow forms resolving that something shall be gold  acquisition of the bases of mastery in the way stated and attainment of the liberation by the beautifulThe red kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating red forms acquisition of the bases of mastery in the way stated and attainment of the liberation by the beautiful The white kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating white forms banishing stiffness and torpor dispelling darkness causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eyeThe light kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating luminous forms banishing stiffness and torpor dispelling darkness causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eye The space kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as revealing the hidden maintaining postures inside the earth and rocks by creating space inside them travelling unobstructed through walls and so on The classification above below around exclusive measureless applies to all kasiṇasfor this is said He perceives the earth kasiṇaabove below around exclusive measureless  and so on Herein above is upwards towards the skys levelBelow is downwards towards the earths levelAround is marked off all around like the perimeter of a fieldFor one extends a kasiṇa upwards only another downwards another all roundor for some reason another projects it thusas one who wants to see visible objects with the divine eye projects lightHence above below around is saidThe word exclusive however shows that anyone such state has nothing to do with any otherJust as there is water and nothing else in all directions for one who is actually in water so too the earth kasiṇa is the earth kasiṇa only it has nothing in common with any other kasiṇaSimilarly in each instanceMeasureless means measureless intentnessHe is intent upon the entirety with his mindtaking no measurements in this way This is its beginning this is its middle No kasiṇa can be developed by any living being described as follows Beings hindered by kamma by defilement or by kammaresult who lack faith zeal and understanding will be incapable of entering into the certainty of rightness in profitable states Herein the words hindered by kamma refer to those who possess bad kamma entailing immediate effect on rebirthBy defilement who have fixed wrong view or are hermaphrodites or eunuchsBy kammaresult who have had a rebirth linking with no profitable rootcause or with only two profitable rootcausesLack faith are destitute of faith in the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaZeal are destitute of zeal for the unopposed wayUnderstanding are destitute of mundane and supramundane right viewWill be incapable of entering into the certainty of rightness in profitable states means that they are incapable of entering into the noble path called certainty and rightness in profitable statesAnd this does not apply only to kasiṇas for none of them will succeed in developing any meditation subject at allSo the task of devotion to a meditation subject must be undertaken by a clansman who has no hindrance by kamma result who shuns hindrance by kamma and by defilement and who fosters faith zeal and understanding by listening to the Dhamma frequenting good men and so onin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Concentrationcalled The Description of the Remaining KasiṇasThe fifth chapter Now ten kinds of foulness as corpses without consciousness were listed next after the kasiṇas thus the bloated the livid the festering the cut up the gnawed the scattered the hacked and scattered the bleeding the worm infested a skeleton  The bloated it is bloated because bloated by gradual dilation and swelling after the close of life as a bellows is with wind What is bloated is the same as the bloated Or alternatively what is bloated is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the bloated This is a term for a corpse in that particular state The livid what has patchy discolouration is called livid  What is livid is the same as the livid Or alternatively what is livid is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the livid This is a term for a corpse that is reddishcoloured in places where flesh is prominent whitishcoloured in places where pus has collected but mostly blueblack  as if draped with blueblack cloth in the blueblack placesThe festering what is trickling with pus in broken places is festering  What is festering is the same as the festering Or alternatively what is festering is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the festering This is a term for a corpse in that particular stateThe cut up what has been opened up by cutting it in two is called cut up  What is cut up is the same as the cut up Or alternatively what is cut up is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the cut up This is a term for a corpse cut in the middleThe gnawed what has been chewed here and there in various ways by dogs jackals etc is what is gnawed  What is gnawed is the same as the gnawed Or alternatively what is gnawed is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the gnawed This is a term for a corpse in that particular stateThe scattered what is strewed about is scattered  What is scattered is the same as the scattered Or alternatively what is scattered is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the scattered This is a term for a corpse that is strewed here and there in this way Here a hand there a foot there the head  The hacked and scattered it is hacked and it is scattered in the way just described thus it is hacked and scattered This is a term for a corpse scattered in the way just described after it has been hacked with a knife in a crowsfoot pattern on every limb The bleeding it sprinkles  scatters blood  and it trickles here and there thus it is the bleeding This is a term for a corpse smeared with trickling bloodThe worminfested it is maggots that are called worms  it sprinkles worms  thus it is worminfested This is a term for a corpse full of maggots A skeleton bone is the same as skeleton Or alternatively bone is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is a skeleton This is a term both for a single bone and for a framework of bonesThese names are also used both for the signs that arise with the bloated etc as their support and for the jhānas obtained in the signsHerein when a meditator wants to develop the jhāna called of the bloated by arousing the sign of the bloated on a bloated body he should in the way already described approach a teacher of the kind mentioned under the earth kasiṇa and learn the meditation subject from himIn explaining the meditation subject to him the teacher should explain it all that is the directions for going with the aim of acquiring the sign of foulness the characterizing of the surrounding signs the eleven ways of apprehending the sign the reviewing of the path gone by and come by concluding with the directions for absorptionAnd when the meditator has learnt it all well he should go to an abode of the kind already described and live there while seeking the sign of the bloatedMeanwhile when he hears people saying that at some village gate or on some road or at some forests edge or at the base of some rock or at the root of some tree or on some charnel ground a bloated corpse is lying he should not go there at once like one who plunges into a river where there is no ford Why notBecause this foulness is beset by wild beasts and nonhuman beingsand he might risk his life thereOr perhaps the way to it goes by a village gate or a bathing place or an irrigated fieldand there a visible object of the opposite sex might come into focus Or perhaps the body is of the opposite sexfor a female body is unsuitable for a man and a male body for a woman If only recently dead it may even look beautiful hence there might be danger to the life of purityBut if he judges himself thus This is not difficult for one like me then he can go thereAnd when he goes he should do so only after he has spoken to the senior elder of the Community or to some wellknown bhikkhu WhyBecause if all his limbs are seized with shuddering at the charnel ground or if his gorge rises when he is confronted with disagreeable objects such as the visible forms and sounds of nonhuman beings lions tigers etc or something else afflicts himthen he whom he told will have his bowl and robe well looked after in the monasteryor he will care for him by sending young bhikkhus or novices to himBesides robbers may meet there thinking a charnel ground a safe place for them whether or not they have done anything wrongAnd when men chase them they drop their goods near the bhikkhu and run awayPerhaps the men seize the bhikkhu saying We have found the thief with the goods and bully himThen he whom he told will explain to the men Do not bully him he went to do this special work after telling me and he will rescue himThis is the advantage of going only after informing someoneTherefore he should inform a bhikkhu of the kind described and then set out eager to see the sign and as happy and joyful as a warriornoble on his way to the scene of anointing as one going to offer libations at the hall of sacrifice or as a pauper on his way to unearth a hidden treasure And he should go there in the way advised by the Commentaries For this is saidOne who is learning the bloated sign of foulness goes alone with no companion with unremitting mindfulness established with his sense faculties turned inwards with his mind not turned outwards reviewing the path gone by and come byIn the place where the bloated sign of foulness has been left he notes any stone or termitemound or tree or bush or creeper there each with its particular sign and in relation to the objectWhen he has done this he characterizes the bloated sign of foulness by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essence by its colour by its mark by its shape by its direction by its location by its delimitation by its joints by its openings by its concavities by its convexities and all roundThen he sees that the sign is properly apprehended that it is properly remembered that it is properly defined  When he has properly apprehended the sign properly remembered it properly defined it he goes alone with no companion with unremitting mindfulness established with his sense faculties turned inwards with his mind not turned outwards reviewing the path gone by and come byWhen he walks he resolves that his walk is oriented towards itwhen he sits he prepares a seat that is oriented towards it What is the purpose what is the advantage of characterizing the surrounding signsCharacterizing the surrounding signs has nondelusion for its purpose it has nondelusion for its advantageWhat is the purpose what is the advantage of apprehending the sign in the other eleven waysApprehending the sign in the other eleven ways has anchoring the mind for its purpose it has anchoring the mind for its advantageWhat is the purpose what is the advantage of reviewing the path gone by and come byReviewing the path gone by and come by has keeping the mind on the track for its purpose it has keeping the mind on the track for its advantageWhen he has established reverence for it by seeing its advantages and by perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love it he anchors his mind upon that object Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and deathQuite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna  seclusionHe has arrived at the first jhāna of the finematerial sphere His is a heavenly abiding and an instance of the meritorious action consisting in meditative developmentSo if he goes to the charnel ground to test his control of mind let him do so after striking the gong or summoning a chapterIf he goes there mainly for developing that meditation subject let him go alone with no companion without renouncing his basic meditation subject and keeping it always in mind taking a walking stick or a staff to keep off attacks by dogs etc ensuring unremitting mindfulness by establishing it well with his mind not turned outwards because he has ensured that his faculties of which his mind is the sixth are turned inwardsAs he goes out of the monastery he should note the gate I have gone out in such a direction by such a gateAfter that he should define the path by which he goes This path goes in an easterly direction  westerly  northerly  southerly direction or It goes in an intermediate directionand In this place it goes to the left in this place to the right and In this place there is a stone in this a termite mound in this a tree in this a bush in this a creeperHe should go to the place where the sign is defining in this way the path by which he goesAnd he should not approach it upwindfor if he did so and the smell of corpses assailed his nose his brain might get upset or he might throw up his food or he might repent his coming thinking What a place of corpses I have come toSo instead of approaching it upwind he should go downwindIf he cannot go by a downwind pathif there is a mountain or a ravine or a rock or a fence or a patch of thorns or water or a bog in the waythen he should go stopping his nose with the corner of his robeThese are the duties in goingWhen he has gone there in this way he should not at once look at the sign of foulnesshe should make sure of the directionFor perhaps if he stands in a certain direction the object does not appear clearly to him and his mind is not wieldySo rather than there he should stand where the object appears clearly and his mind is wieldyAnd he should avoid standing to leeward or to windward of itFor if he stands to leeward he is bothered by the corpse smell and his mind straysand if he stands to windward and nonhuman beings are dwelling there they may get annoyed and do him a mischiefSo he should move round a little and not stand too much to windwardThen he should stand not too far off or too near or too much towards the feet or the headFor if he stands too far off the object is not clear to himand if he stands too near he may get frightenedIf he stands too much towards the feet or the head not all the foulness becomes manifest to him equallySo he should stand not too far off or too near opposite the middle of the body in a place convenient for him to look at itThen he should characterize the surrounding signs in the way stated thus In the place where the bloated sign of foulness has been left he notes any stone  or creeper there with its sign  These are the directions for characterizing them If there is a rock in the eyes focus near the sign he should define it in this way This rock is high or low small or large brown or black or white long or roundafter which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a rock this is the sign of foulness this is the sign of foulness this is a rockIf there is a termitemound he should define it in this way This is high or low small or large brown or black or white long or roundafter which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a termite mound this is the sign of foulnessIf there is a tree he should define it in this way This is a pipal fig tree or a banyan fig tree or a kacchaka fig tree or a kapittha fig tree it is tall or short small or large black or whiteafter which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a tree this is the sign of foulnessIf there is a bush he should define it in this way This is a sindi bush or a karamanda bush or a kaṇavīra bush or a koraṇḍaka bush it is tall or short small or largeafter which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a bush this is the sign of foulnessIf there is a creeper he should define it in this way This is a pumpkin creeper or a gourd creeper or a brown creeper or a black creeper or a stinking creeperafter which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a creeper this is the sign of foulness this is the sign of foulness this is a creeper Also with its particular sign and in relation to the object was said  but that is included by what has just been saidfor he characterizes it with its particular sign when he defines it again and againand he characterizes it in relation to the object when he defines it by combining it each time in pairs thus This is a rock this is the sign of foulness this is the sign of foulness this is a rock Having done this again he should bring to mind the fact that it has an individual essence its own state of being bloated which is not common to anything else since it was said that he defines it by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essenceThe meaning is that it should be defined according to individual essence according to its own nature as the inflated the bloatedHaving defined it in this way he should apprehend the sign in the following six ways that is to say by its colour by its mark by its shape by its direction by its location by its delimitationHow The meditator should define it by its colour thus This is the body of one who is black or white or yellowskinned Instead of defining it by the female mark or the male mark he should define it by its mark thus This is the body of one who was in the first phase of life in the middle phase in the last phase By its shape he should define it only by the shape of the bloated thus This is the shape of its head this is the shape of its neck this is the shape of its hand this is the shape of its chest this is the shape of its belly this is the shape of its navel this is the shape of its hips this is the shape of its thigh this is the shape of its calf this is the shape of its foot He should define it by its direction thus There are two directions in this body that is down from the navel as the lower direction and up from it as the upper directionOr alternatively he can define it thus I am standing in this direction the sign of foulness is in that direction He should define it by its location thus The hand is in this location the foot in this the head in this the middle of the body in thisOr alternatively he can define it thus I am in this location the sign of foulness is in that He should define it by its delimitation thus This body is delimited below by the soles of the feet above by the tips of the hair all round by the skin the space so delimited is filled up with thirtytwo pieces of corpseOr alternatively he can define it thus This is the delimitation of its hand this is the delimitation of its foot this is the delimitation of its head this is the delimitation of the middle part of its bodyOr alternatively he can delimit as much of it as he has apprehended thus Just this much of the bloated is like this However a female body is not appropriate for a man or a male one for a womanfor the object namely the repulsive aspect does not make its appearance in a body of the opposite sex which merely becomes a condition for the wrong kind of excitementTo quote the Majjhima Commentary Even when decaying a woman invades a mans mind and stays thereThat is why the sign should be apprehended in the six ways only in a body of the same sex But when a clansman has cultivated the meditation subject under former Enlightened Ones kept the ascetic practices threshed out the great primary elements discerned formations defined mentalitymateriality eliminated the perception of a being done the ascetics duties lived the moral life and developed the development when he contains the seed of turning away from formations and has mature knowledge and little defilement then the counterpart sign appears to him in the place while he keeps lookingIf it does not appear in that way then it appears to him as he is apprehending the sign in the six waysBut if it does not appear to him even then he should apprehend the sign again in five more ways by its joints by its openings by its concavities by its convexities and all roundHerein by its joints is properly by its hundred and eighty jointsBut how can he define the hundred and eighty joints in the bloatedConsequently he can define it by its fourteen major joints thus Three joints in the right arm three in the left arm three in the right leg three in the left leg one neck joint one waist joint By its openings an opening is the hollow between the arm and the side the hollow between the legs the hollow of the stomach the hollow of the ear He should define it by its openings in this wayOr alternatively the opened or closed state of the eyes and the opened or closed state of the mouth can be defined By its concavities he should define any concave place on the body such as the eye sockets or the inside of the mouth or the base of the neckOr he can define it thus I am standing in a concave place the body is in a convex place By its convexities he should define any raised place on the body such as the knee or the chest or the foreheadOr he can define it thus I am standing in a convex place the body is in a concave place All round the whole body should be defined all roundAfter working over the whole body with knowledge he should establish his mind thus The bloated the bloated upon any part that appears clearly to himIf it has not appeared even yet and if there is special intensity of the bloatedness in the belly he should establish his mind thus The bloated the bloated on that Now as to the words he sees that the sign is properly apprehended etc the explanation is thisThe meditator should apprehend the sign thoroughly in that body in the way of apprehending the sign already describedHe should advert to it with wellestablished mindfulnessHe should see that it is properly remembered properly defined by doing that again and againStanding in a place not too far from and not too near to the body he should open his eyes look and apprehend the signHe should open his eyes and look a hundred times a thousand times thinking Repulsiveness of the bloated repulsiveness of the bloated and he should close his eyes and advert to it As he does so again and again the learning sign becomes properly apprehended by himWhen is it properly apprehendedWhen it comes into focus alike whether he opens his eyes and looks or closes his eyes and adverts then it is called properly apprehendedWhen he has thus properly apprehended the sign properly remembered it and properly defined it then if he is unable to conclude his development on the spot he can go to his own lodging alone in the same way as described of his coming with no companion keeping that same meditation subject in mind with mindfulness well established and with his mind not turned outwards owing to his faculties being turned inwardsAs he leaves the charnel ground he should define the path he comes back by thus The path by which I have left goes in an easterly direction westerly  northerly  southerly direction or It goes in an intermediate directionor In this place it goes to the left in this place to the right and In this place there is a stone in this a termitemound in this a tree in this a bush in this a creeper When he has defined the path he has come back by and when once back he is walking up and down he should see that his walk is oriented towards it too the meaning is that he should walk up and down on a piece of ground that faces in the direction of the sign of foulnessAnd when he sits he should prepare a seat oriented towards it too But if there is a bog or a ravine or a tree or a fence or a swamp in that direction if he cannot walk up and down on a piece of ground facing in that direction if he cannot prepare his seat thus because there is no room for itthen he can both walk up and down and sit in a place where there is room even though it does not face that waybut he should turn his mind in that directionNow as to the questions beginning with what is the purpose  characterizing the surrounding signsThe intention of the answer that begins with the words has nondelusion for its purpose is this If someone goes at the wrong time to the place where the sign of the bloated is and opens his eyes for the purpose of apprehending the sign by characterizing the surrounding signs then as soon as he looks the dead body appears as if it were standing up and threatening and pursuing him and when he sees the hideous and fearful object his mind reels he is like one demented gripped by panic fear and terror and his hair stands on endFor among the thirtyeight meditation subjects expounded in the texts no object is so frightening as this oneThere are some who lose jhāna in this meditation subjectWhyBecause it is so frightening So the meditator must stand firm Establishing his mindfulness well he should remove his fears in this way No dead body gets up and pursues oneIf that stone or that creeper close to it were to come the body might come toobut since that stone or that creeper does not come the body will not come eitherIts appearance to you in this way is born of your perception created by your perception Today your meditation subject has appeared to you Do not be afraid bhikkhu He should laugh it off and direct his mind to the signIn that way he will arrive at distinctionThe words Characterizing the surrounding signs has nondelusion for its purpose are said on this accountTo succeed in apprehending the sign in the eleven ways is to anchor the meditation subjectFor the opening of his eyes and looking conditions the arising of the learning signand as he exercises his mind on that the counterpart sign arisesand as he exercises his mind on that he reaches absorptionWhen he is sure of absorption he works up insight and realizes ArahantshipHence it was said apprehending the sign in the other eleven ways has anchoring the mind for its purposeThe reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping the mind on the track for its purpose the meaning is that the reviewing of the path gone by and of the path come back by mentioned is for the purpose of keeping properly to the track of the meditation subjectFor if this bhikkhu is going along with his meditation subject and people on the way ask him about the day What is today venerable sir  or they ask him some question about Dhamma or they welcome him he ought not to go on in silence thinking I have a meditation subjectThe day must be told the question must be answeredeven by saying I do not know if he does not knowa legitimate welcome must be responded toAs he does so the newly acquired sign vanishesBut even if it does vanish he should still tell the day when askedif he does not know the answer to the question he should still say I do not knowand if he does know it he should explain it surely and he must respond to a welcomeAlso reception of visitors must be attended to on seeing a visiting bhikkhuand all the remaining duties in the Khandhakas must be carried out too that is the duties of the shrine terrace the duties of the Bodhitree terrace the duties of the Uposatha house the duties of the refectory and the bath house and those to the teacher the preceptor visitors departing bhikkhus and the restAnd the newly acquired sign vanishes while he is carrying out these too When he wants to go again thinking I shall go and take up the sign he finds he cannot go to the charnel ground because it has been invaded by nonhuman beings or by wild beasts or the sign has disappearedFor a bloated corpse only lasts one or two days and then turns into a livid corpseOf all the meditation subjects there is none so hard to come by as thisSo when the sign has vanished in this way the bhikkhu should sit down in his night quarters or in his day quarters and first of all review the path gone by and come by up to the place where he is actually sitting crosslegged doing it in this way I went out of the monastery by this gate I took a path leading in such and such a direction I turned left at such and such a place I turned right at such and such a placein one part of it there was a stone in another a termitemound or a tree or a bush or a creeperhaving gone by that path I saw the foulness in such and such a placeI stood there facing in such and such a direction and observed such and such surrounding signs I apprehended the sign of foulness in this way I left the charnel ground in such and such a direction I came back by such and such a path doing this and this and I am now sitting here As he reviews it in this way the sign becomes evident and appears as if placed in front of himthe meditation subject rides in its track as it did beforeHence it was said the reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping the mind on the track for its purposeNow as to the words when he has established reverence for it by seeing its advantages and by perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love it he anchors the mind on that object here having gained jhāna by exercising his mind on the repulsiveness in the bloated he should increase insight with the jhāna as its proximate cause and then he should see the advantages in this way Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and deathJust as a pauper who acquired a treasure of gems would guard and love it with great affection feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of it I have got what is hard indeed to get  so too this bhikkhu I have got this meditation subject which is indeed as hard to get as a very valuable treasure is for a pauper to getFor one whose meditation subject is the four elements discerns the four primary elements in himself one whose meditation subject is breathing discerns the wind in his own nostrils and one whose meditation subject is a kasiṇa makes a kasiṇa and develops it at his ease so these other meditation subjects are easily gotBut this one lasts only one or two days after which it turns into a livid corpse There is none harder to get than this one  should guard the sign loving it and feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of itIn his night quarters and in his day quarters he should keep his mind anchored there thus Repulsiveness of the bloated repulsiveness of the bloatedAnd he should advert to the sign bring it to mindand strike at it with thought and applied thought over and over againAs he does so the counterpart sign arisesHere is the difference between the two signs The learning sign appears as a hideous dreadful and frightening sightbut the counterpart sign appears like a man with big limbs lying down after eating his fill Simultaneously with his acquiring the counterpart sign his lust is abandoned by suppression owing to his giving no attention externally to sense desires as objectAnd owing to his abandoning of approval ill will is abandoned too as pus is with the abandoning of bloodLikewise stiffness and torpor are abandoned through exertion of energy agitation and worry are abandoned through devotion to peaceful things that cause no remorse and uncertainty about the Master who teaches the way about the way and about the fruit of the way is abandoned through the actual experience of the distinction attained So the five hindrances are abandonedAnd there are present applied thought with the characteristic of directing the mind on to that same sign and sustained thought accomplishing the function of pressing on the sign and happiness due to the acquisition of distinction and tranquillity due to the production of tranquillity in one whose mind is happy and bliss with that tranquillity as its sign and unification that has bliss as its sign due to the production of concentration in one whose mind is blissful So the jhāna factors become manifestThus access which is the obverse of the first jhāna is produced in him too at that same momentAll after that up to absorption in the first jhāna and mastery in it should be understood as described under the earth kasiṇa As regards the livid and the rest the characterizing already described starting with the going in the way beginning One who is learning the bloated sign of foulness goes alone with no companion with unremitting mindfulness established  should all be understood with its exposition and intention substituting for the word bloated the appropriate word in each case thus One who is learning the livid sign of foulness  One who is learning the festering sign of foulness But the differences are as follows The livid should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the livid repulsiveness of the lividHere the learning sign appears blotchycolouredbut the counterpart signs appearance has the colour which is most prevalentThe festering should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the festering repulsiveness of the festeringHere the learning sign appears as though tricklingbut the counterpart sign appears motionless and quietThe cut up is found on a battlefield or in a robbers forest or on a charnel ground where kings have robbers cut upor in the jungle in a place where men are torn up by lions and tigersSo if when he goes there it comes into focus at one adverting although lying in different places that is goodIf not then he should not touch it with his own handfor by doing so he would become familiar with itHe should get a monastery attendant or one studying to become an ascetic or someone else to put it together in one placeIf he cannot find anyone to do it he should put it together with a walking stick or a staff in such a way that there is only a fingers breadth separating the partsHaving put it together thus he should bring it to mind as Repulsiveness of the cut up repulsiveness of the cut upHerein the learning sign appears as though cut in the middlebut the counterpart sign appears whole The gnawed should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the gnawed repulsiveness of the gnawedHere the learning sign appears as though gnawed here and therebut the counterpart sign appears whole After getting the scattered put together or putting it together in the way described under the cut up so that there is only a fingers breadth separating the pieces it should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the scattered repulsiveness of the scatteredHere the learning sign appears with the gaps evidentbut the counterpart sign appears whole The hacked and scattered is found in the same places as those described under the cut upTherefore after going there and getting it put together or putting it together in the way described under the cut up so that there is only a fingers breadth separating the pieces it should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the hacked and scattered repulsiveness of the hacked and scatteredHere when the learning sign becomes evident it does so with the fissures of the woundsbut the counterpart sign appears wholeThe bleeding is found at the time when blood is trickling from the openings of wounds received on battlefields etc or from the openings of burst boils and abscesses when the hands and feet have been cut offSo on seeing that it should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the bleeding repulsiveness of the bleedingHere the learning sign appears to have the aspect of moving like a red banner struck by windbut the counterpart sign appears quietThere is a worminfested corpse when at the end of two or three days a mass of maggots oozes out from the corpses nine orificesand the mass lies there like a heap of paddy or boiled rice as big as the body whether the body is that of a dog a jackal a human being an ox a buffalo an elephant a horse a python or what you willIt can be brought to mind with respect to anyone of these as Repulsiveness of the worminfested repulsiveness of the worminfestedFor the sign arose for the Elder CūḷaPiṇḍapātikaTissa in the corpse of an elephants carcass in the Kāḷadīghavāpi reservoirHere the learning sign appears as though movingbut the counterpart sign appears quiet like a ball of boiled riceA skeleton is described in various aspects in the way beginning As though he were looking at a corpse thrown onto a charnel ground a skeleton with flesh and blood held together by sinews So he should go in the way already described to where it has been put and noticing any stones etc with their surrounding signs and in relation to the object he should characterize it by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essence thus This is a skeleton and he should apprehend the sign in the eleven ways by colour and the restBut if he looks at it apprehending it only by its colour as white it does not appear to him with its individual essence as repulsive but only as a variant of the white kasiṇaConsequently he should only look at it as a skeleton in the repulsive aspectMark is a term for the hand etc hereso he should define it by its mark according to hand foot head chest arm waist thigh and shinHe should define it by its shape however according as it is long short square round small or largeBy its direction and by its location are as already described Having defined it by its delimitation according to the periphery of each bone he should reach absorption by apprehending whichever appears most evident to himBut it can also be defined by its concavities and by its convexities according to the concave and convex places in each boneAnd it can also be defined by position thus I am standing in a concave place the skeleton is in a convex place or I am standing in a convex place the skeleton is in a concave placeIt should be defined by its joints according as any two bones are joined togetherIt should be defined by its openings according to the gaps separating the bonesIt should be defined all round by directing knowledge to it comprehensively thus In this place there is this skeletonIf the sign does not arise even in this way then the mind should be established on the frontal boneAnd in this case just as in the case of those that precede it beginning with the worminfested the apprehending of the sign should be observed in this elevenfold manner as appropriateThis meditation subject is successful with a whole skeleton frame and even with a single bone as wellSo having learnt the sign in anyone of these in the eleven ways he should bring it to mind as Repulsiveness of a skeleton repulsiveness of a skeletonHere the learning sign and the counterpart sign are alike so it is said That is correct for a single boneBut when the learning sign becomes manifest in a skeleton frame what is correct to say is that there are gaps in the learning signwhile the counterpart sign appears wholeAnd the learning sign even in a single bone should be dreadful and terrifyingbut the counterpart sign produces happiness and joy because it brings access What is said in the Commentaries in this context allows that deductionFor there after saying this There is no counterpart sign in the four divine abidings and in the ten kinds of foulnessfor in the case of the divine abidings the sign is the breaking down of boundaries itselfand in the case of the ten kinds of foulness the sign comes into being as soon as the repulsiveness is seen without any thinking about it it is again said immediately next Here the sign is twofold the learning sign and the counterpart signThe learning sign appears hideous dreadful and terrifying and so onSo what we said was well considered And it is only this that is correct hereBesides the appearance of a womans whole body as a collection of bones to the Elder MahāTissa through his merely looking at her teeth demonstrates this here  The Divine Ruler with ten hundred eyes Did him  fair in fame This foulness of ten species in such wisewith the Ten Powers eulogize Who made known as cause of jhānaTo tackle each and how they are developed Now knowing their description and the wayThere are some further points that will repay Study each with its special part to playOne who has reached jhāna in anyone of these goes free from cupidity he resembles an Arahant without greed because his greed has been well suppressedAt the same time however this classification of foulness should be understood as stated in accordance with the particular individual essences successively reached by the dead body and also in accordance with the particular subdivisions of the greedy temperamentWhen a corpse has entered upon the repulsive state it may have reached the individual essence of the bloated or anyone of the individual essences beginning with that of the lividSo the sign should be apprehended as Repulsiveness of the bloated Repulsiveness of the livid according to whichever he has been able to find This it should be understood is how the classification of foulness comes to be tenfold with the bodys arrival at each particular individual essenceAnd individually the bloated suits one who is greedy about shape since it makes evident the disfigurement of the bodys shapeThe livid suits one who is greedy about the bodys colour since it makes evident the disfigurement of the skins colourThe festering suits one who is greedy about the smell of the body aroused by scents perfumes etc since it makes evident the evil smells connected with this sore the bodyThe cut up suits one who is greedy about compactness in the body since it makes evident the hollowness inside itThe gnawed suits one who is greedy about accumulation of flesh in such parts of the body as the breasts since it makes it evident how a fine accumulation of flesh comes to nothingThe scattered suits one who is greedy about the grace of the limbs since it makes it evident how limbs can be scatteredThe hacked and scattered suits one who is greedy about a fine body as a whole since it makes evident the disintegration and alteration of the body as a wholeThe bleeding suits one who is greedy about elegance produced by ornaments since it makes evident its repulsiveness when smeared with bloodThe worminfested suits one who is greedy about ownership of the body since it makes it evident how the body is shared with many families of wormsA skeleton suits one who is greedy about fine teeth since it makes evident the repulsiveness of the bones in the bodyThis it should be understood is how the classification of foulness comes to be tenfold according to the subdivisions of the greedy temperament But as regards the tenfold foulness just as it is only by virtue of its rudder that a boat keeps steady in a river with turbulent waters and a rapid current and it cannot be steadied without a rudder so too here owing to the weak hold on the object consciousness when unified only keeps steady by virtue of applied thought and it cannot be steadied without applied thought which is why there is only the first jhāna here not the second and the restAnd repulsive as this object is still it arouses joy and happiness in him by his seeing its advantages thus Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and death and by his abandoning the hindrances oppression just as a garbage heap does in a flowerscavenger by his seeing the advantages thus Now I shall get a high wage and as the workings of purges and emetics do in a man suffering the pains of sicknessThis foulness while of ten kinds has only one characteristicFor though it is of ten kinds nevertheless its characteristic is only its impure stinking disgusting and repulsive state And foulness appears with this characteristic not only in a dead body but also in a living one as it did to the Elder MahāTissa who lived at Cetiyapabbata  and to the novice attendant on the Elder Saṅgharakkhita while he was watching the king riding an elephantFor a living body is just as foul as a dead oneonly the characteristic of foulness is not evident in a living body being hidden by adventitious embellishments This is the bodys nature it is a collection of over three hundred bones jointed by one hundred and eighty joints bound together by nine hundred sinews plastered over with nine hundred pieces of flesh enveloped in the moist inner skin enclosed in the outer cuticle with orifices here and there constantly dribbling and trickling like a grease pot inhabited by a community of worms the home of disease the basis of painful states perpetually oozing from the nine orifices like a chronic open carbunclefrom both of whose eyes eyefilth trickles from whose ears comes earfilth from whose nostrils snot from whose mouth food and bile and phlegm and blood from whose lower outlets excrement and urine and from whose ninetynine thousand pores the broth of stale sweat seepswith bluebottles and their like buzzing round itwhich when untended with tooth sticks and mouthwashing and headanointing and bathing and underclothing and dressing would judged by the universal repulsiveness of the body make even a king if he wandered from village to village with his hair in its natural wild disorder no different from a flowerscavenger or an outcaste or what you will So there is no distinction between a kings body and an outcastes in so far as its impure stinking nauseating repulsiveness is concerned But by rubbing out the stains on its teeth with tooth sticks and mouth washing and all that by concealing its private parts under several cloths by daubing it with various scents and salves by pranking it with nosegays and such things it is worked up into a state that permits of its being taken as I and mineSo men delight in women and women in men without perceiving the true nature of its characteristic foulness now masked by this adventitious adornmentBut in the ultimate sense there is no place here even the size of an atom fit to lust afterAnd then when any such bits of it as head hairs body hairs nails teeth spittle snot excrement or urine have dropped off the body beings will not touch them they are ashamed humiliated and disgustedBut as long as anyone of these things remains in it though it is just as repulsive they take it as agreeable desirable permanent pleasant self because they are wrapped in the murk of ignorance and dyed with affection and greed for selfTaking it as they do they resemble the old jackal who saw a flower not yet fallen from a kiṃsuka tree in a forest and yearned after it thinking This is a piece of meat it is a piece of meat There was a jackal chanced to see A flowering kiṃsuka in a woodIn haste he went to where it stood I have found a meatbearing tree He chewed the blooms that fell but couldOf course find nothing fit to eat He took it thus Unlike the meat There on the tree this is no goodA wise man will not think to treat As foul only the part that fellBut treats as foul the part as well That in the body has its seatAnd soon get caught in Evils snare They take the body to be fairFools cannot in their folly tell Nor can escape its painful spellBut since the wise have thus laid bare Be it alive or dead they knowThis filthy bodys nature so There is no beauty lurking there For this is saidThis filthy body stinks outright Like ordure like a privys siteThis body men that have insight Condemn as object of a fools delightA tumour where nine holes abide Wrapped in a coat of clammy hideAnd trickling filth on every side Polluting the air with stenches far and wideIf it perchance should come about That what is inside it came outSurely a man would need a knout With which to put the crows and dogs to rout So a capable bhikkhu should apprehend the sign whether in a living bodyor in a dead one wherever the aspect of foulness is manifest and he should make the meditation subject reach absorptionin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Concentrationcalled The Description of Foulness as a Meditation SubjectThe sixth chapter Now ten recollections were listed next after the ten kinds of foulness  As to these Mindfulness itself is recollection because it arises again and again or alternatively the mindfulness that is proper for a clansman gone forth out of faith since it occurs only in those instances where it should occur is recollection  The recollection arisen inspired by the Enlightened One is the recollection of the Buddha This is a term for mindfulness with the Enlightened Ones special qualities as its objectThe recollection arisen inspired by the Law is the recollection of the Dhamma This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of the Laws being well proclaimed etc as its objectThe recollection arisen inspired by the Community is the recollection of the Saṅgha This is a term for mindfulness with the Communitys special qualities of being entered on the good way etc as its objectThe recollection arisen inspired by virtue is the recollection of virtue This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of virtues untornness etc as its objectThe recollection arisen inspired by generosity is the recollection of generosity This is a term for mindfulness with generositys special qualities of free generosity etc as its objectThe recollection arisen inspired by deities is the recollection of deities This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of ones own faith etc as its object with deities standing as witnessesThe recollection arisen inspired by death is the recollection of death This is a term for mindfulness with the termination of the life faculty as its objectMindfulness occupied with the body  it is gone to the material body that is analyzed into head hairs etc or it is gone into the body thus it is bodygone  It is bodygone and it is mindfulness  thus it is bodygone mindfulness  but instead of shortening the vowel thus in the usual way bodygone mindfulness is said This is a term for mindfulness that has as its object the sign of the bodily parts consisting of head hairs and the restThe mindfulness arisen inspired by breathing is mindfulness of breathing This is a term for mindfulness that has as its object the sign of in breaths and outbreathsThe recollection arisen inspired by peace is the recollection of peace This is a term that has as its object the stilling of all suffering Now a meditator with absolute confidence who wants to develop firstly the recollection of the Enlightened One among these ten should go into solitary retreat in a favourable abode and recollect the special qualities of the Enlightened One the Blessed One as follows That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished fully enlightened endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct sublime the knower of worlds the incomparable leader of men to be tamed the teacher of gods and men enlightened and blessed Here is the way he recollects That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished he is such since he is fully enlightened  he is such since he is blessed he is so for these several reasons is what is meantHerein what he recollects firstly is that the Blessed One is accomplished for the following reasons because of remoteness  and because of his enemies and the spokes having been destroyed  and because of his worthiness of requisites etc and because of absence of secret evildoing He stands utterly remote and far away from all defilements because he has expunged all trace of defilement by means of the pathbecause of such remoteness he is accomplished A man remote indeed we call From something he has not at allThe Saviour too that has no stain May well the name accomplished gain And these enemies  these defilements are destroyed by the pathbecause the enemies are thus destroyed he is accomplished alsoThe enemies that were deployed Greed and the rest have been destroyedBy his the Helpers wisdoms sword So he is accomplished  all accord Now this wheel of the round of rebirths with its hub made of ignorance and of craving for becoming with its spokes consisting of formations of merit and the rest with its rim of ageing and death which is joined to the chariot of the triple becoming by piercing it with the axle made of the origins of cankers  has been revolving throughout time that has no beginning All of this wheels spokes were destroyed by him at the Place of Enlightenment as he stood firm with the feet of energy on the ground of virtue wielding with the hand of faith the axe of knowledge that destroys kamma because the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished alsoOr alternatively it is the beginningless round of rebirths that is called the wheel of the round of rebirthsIgnorance is its hub because it is its rootAgeinganddeath is its rim because it terminates itThe remaining ten states of the dependent origination are its spokes because ignorance is their root and ageinganddeath their termination Herein ignorance is unknowing about suffering and the restAnd ignorance in sensual becoming is a condition for formations in sensual becoming Ignorance in finematerial becoming is a condition for formations in finematerial becoming Ignorance in immaterial becoming is a condition for formations in immaterial becoming Formations in sensual becoming are a condition for rebirthlinking consciousness in sensual becoming And similarly with the rest Rebirthlinking consciousness in sensual becoming is a condition for mentalitymateriality in sensual becoming Similarly in finematerial becomingIn immaterial becoming it is a condition for mentality only Mentalitymateriality in sensual becoming is a condition for the sixfold base in sensual becoming Mentalitymateriality in finematerial becoming is a condition for three bases in finematerial becoming Mentality in immaterial becoming is a condition for one base in immaterial becomingThe sixfold base in sensual becoming is a condition for six kinds of contact in sensual becoming Three bases in finematerial becoming are conditions for three kinds of contact in finematerial becoming The mind base alone in immaterial becoming is a condition for one kind of contact in immaterial becomingThe six kinds of contact in sensual becoming are conditions for six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming Three kinds of contact in finematerial becoming are conditions for three kinds of feeling there too One kind of contact in immaterial becoming is a condition for one kind of feeling there too The six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming are conditions for the six groups of craving in sensual becoming Three in the finematerial becoming are for three there too One kind of feeling in the immaterial becoming is a condition for one group of craving in the immaterial becomingThe craving in the several kinds of becoming is a condition for the clinging there Clinging etc are the respective conditions for becoming and the restIn what wayHere someone thinks I shall enjoy sense desires and with sense desire clinging as condition he misconducts himself in body speech and mind Owing to the fulfilment of his misconduct he reappears in a state of loss The kamma that is the cause of his reappearance there is kamma process becoming the aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirthprocess becoming the generating of the aggregates is birth their maturing is ageing their dissolution is deathAnother thinks I shall enjoy the delights of heaven and in the parallel manner he conducts himself well Owing to the fulfilment of his good conduct he reappears in a sensualsphere heavenThe kamma that is the cause of his reappearance there is kammaprocess becoming and the rest as beforeAnother thinks I shall enjoy the delights of the Brahmāworld and with sensedesire clinging as condition he develops lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity Owing to the fulfilment of the meditative development he is reborn in the BrahmāworldThe kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kammaprocess becoming and the rest is as before Yet another thinks I shall enjoy the delights of immaterial becoming and with the same condition he develops the attainments beginning with the base consisting of boundless space Owing to the fulfilment of the development he is reborn in one of these statesThe kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kammaprocess becoming the aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth process becoming the generating of the aggregates is birth their maturing is ageing their dissolution is death The remaining kinds of clinging are construable in the same way So Understanding of discernment of conditions thus Ignorance is a cause formations are causally arisen and both these states are causally arisen is knowledge of the causal relationship of statesUnderstanding of discernment of conditions thus In the past and in the future ignorance is a cause formations are causally arisen and both these states are causally arisen is knowledge of the causal relationship of states  and all the clauses should be given in detail in this way Herein ignorance and formations are one summarization consciousness mentalitymateriality the sixfold base contact and feeling are another craving clinging and becoming are another and birth and ageinganddeath are anotherHere the first summarization is past the two middle ones are present and birth and ageinganddeath are futureWhen ignorance and formations are mentioned then also craving clinging and becoming are included too so these five states are the round of kamma in the past The five beginning with consciousness are the round of the kammaresult in the present When craving clinging and becoming are mentioned then also ignorance and formations are included too so these five states are the round of kamma in the present And because the five beginning with consciousness are described under the heading of birth and ageinganddeath these five states are the round of kammaresult in the futureThese make twenty aspects in this wayAnd here there is one link between formations and consciousness one between feeling and craving one between becoming and birth  Now the Blessed One knew saw understood and penetrated in all aspects this dependent origination with its four summarizations its three times its twenty aspects and its three linksKnowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that Hence it was said Understanding of discernment of conditions is knowledge of the causal relationship of states Thus when the Blessed One by correctly knowing these states with knowledge of relations of states became dispassionate towards them when his greed faded away when he was liberated then he destroyed quite destroyed abolished the spokes of this wheel of the round of rebirths of the kind just describedBecause the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished alsoThe spokes of rebirths wheel have been Destroyed with wisdoms weapon keenBy him the Helper of the World And so accomplished he is called And he is worthy of the requisites of robes etc and of the distinction of being accorded homage because it is he who is most worthy of offeringsFor when a Perfect One has arisen important deities and human beings pay homage to none elsefor Brahmā Sahampati paid homage to the Perfect One with a jewelled garland as big as Sineruand other deities did so according to their means as well as human beings as King Bimbisāra of Magadha and the king of KosalaAnd after the Blessed One had finally attained Nibbāna King Asoka renounced wealth to the amount of ninetysix million for his sake and founded eightfour thousand monasteries throughout all Jambudīpa And so with all these what need to speak of others Because of worthiness of requisites he is accomplished also And he does not act like those fools in the world who vaunt their cleverness and yet do evil but in secret for fear of getting a bad name Because of absence of secret evildoing he is accomplished alsoNo secret evil deed may claim An author so august the nameAccomplished is his deservedly By absence of such secrecy So in all waysThe Sage of remoteness unalloyed Vanquished defiling foes deployedThe spokes of rebirths wheel destroyed Worthy of requisites employedSecret evil he does avoid For these five reasons he may claim This word accomplished for his name He is fully enlightened because he has discovered all things rightly and by himself In fact all things were discovered by him rightly by himself in that he discovered of the things to be directly known that they must be directly known  of the things to be fully understood that they must be fully understood  of the things to be abandoned that they must be abandoned  of the things to be realized that they must be realized  and of the things to be developed that they must be developed Hence it is saidWhat must be directly known is directly known What has to be developed has been developedWhat has to be abandoned has been abandoned And that brahman is why I am enlightened  Besides he has discovered all things rightly by himself step by step thus The eye is the truth of suffering the prior craving that originates it by being its rootcause is the truth of origin the nonoccurrence of both is the truth of cessation the way that is the act of understanding cessation is the truth of the path And so too in the case of the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mindAnd the following things should be construed in the same way the six bases beginning with visible objects the six groups of consciousness beginning with eyeconsciousness the six kinds of contact beginning with eyecontact the six kinds of feeling beginning with the eyecontactborn the six kinds of perception beginning with perception of visible objects the six kinds of volition beginning with volition about visible objects the six groups of craving beginning with craving for visible objects the six kinds of applied thought beginning with applied thought about visible objects the six kinds of sustained thought beginning with sustained thought about visible objects the five aggregates beginning with the aggregate of matter the ten kasiṇas the ten recollections the ten perceptions beginning with perception of the bloated the thirtytwo aspects of the body beginning with head hairs the twelve bases the eighteen elements the nine kinds of becoming beginning with sensual becoming the four jhānas beginning with the first the four measureless states beginning with the development of lovingkindness the four immaterial attainments the factors of the dependent origination in reverse order beginning with ageinganddeath and in forward order beginning with ignorance  Herein this is the construction of a single clause of the dependent origination Ageinganddeath is the truth of suffering birth is the truth of origin the escape from both is the truth of cessation the way that is the act of understanding cessation is the truth of the path In this way he has discovered progressively discovered completely discovered all states rightly and by himself step by stepHence it was said above He is fully enlightened because he has discovered all things rightly and by himself He is endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct vijjācaraṇasampanno  vijjāhi caraṇena ca sampanno Herein as to clear vision there are three kinds of clear vision and eight kinds of clear visionThe three kinds should be understood as stated in the Bhayabherava Sutta  and the eight kinds as stated in the Ambattha Sutta For there eight kinds of clear vision are stated made up of the six kinds of directknowledge together with insight and the supernormal power of the mindmade body Virtuous conduct should be understood as fifteen things that is to say restraint by virtue guarding of the sense faculties knowledge of the right amount in eating devotion to wakefulness the seven good states and the four jhānas of the finematerial sphereFor it is precisely by means of these fifteen things that a noble disciple conducts himself that he goes towards the deathless That is why it is called virtuous conductaccording as it is said Here Mahānāma a noble disciple has virtue  etc the whole of which should be understood as given in the Middle Fifty of the Majjhima Nikāya Now the Blessed One is endowed with these kinds of clear vision and with this conduct as wellhence he is called endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct  Herein the Blessed Ones possession of clear vision consists in the fulfilment of omniscience while his possession of conduct consists in the fulfilment of the great compassion He knows through omniscience what is good and harmful for all beings and through compassion he warns them of harm and exhorts them to do goodThat is how he is possessed of clear vision and conductwhich is why his disciples have entered upon the good way instead of entering upon the bad way as the selfmortifying disciples of those who are not possessed of clear vision and conduct have doneHe is called sublime because of a manner of going that is good  because of being gone to an excellent place  because of having gone rightly  and because of enunciating rightly  A manner of going is called gone and that in the Blessed One is good  purified blamelessBut what is thatIt is the noble pathfor by means of that manner of going he has gone without attachment in the direction of safetythus he is sublime because of a manner of going that is good And it is to the excellent place that he has gone  to the deathless Nibbānathus he is sublime also because of having gone to an excellent place And he has rightly gone  without going back again to the defilements abandoned by each pathFor this is said He does not again turn return go back to the defilements abandoned by the stream entry path thus he is sublime  he does not again turn return go back to the defilements abandoned by the Arahant path thus he is sublime  Or alternatively he has rightly gone from the time of making his resolution at the feet of Dīpaṅkara up till the Enlightenment Session by working for the welfare and happiness of the whole world through the fulfilment of the thirty perfections and through following the right way without deviating towards either of the two extremes that is to say towards eternalism or annihilationism towards indulgence in sense pleasures or selfmortificationthus he is sublime also because of having gone rightly And he enunciates rightly  he speaks only fitting speech in the fitting placethus he is sublime also because of enunciating rightlyHere is a sutta that confirms this Such speech as the Perfect One knows to be untrue and incorrect conducive to harm and displeasing and unwelcome to others that he does not speakAnd such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct but conducive to harm and displeasing and unwelcome to others that he does not speak And such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct conducive to good but displeasing and unwelcome to others that speech the Perfect One knows the time to expoundSuch speech as the Perfect One knows to be untrue and incorrect and conducive to harm but pleasing and welcome to others that he does not speakAnd such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct but conducive to harm though pleasing and welcome to others that he does not speakAnd such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct conducive to good and pleasing and welcome to others that speech the Perfect One knows the time to expound thus he is sublime also because of enunciating rightlyHe is the knower of worlds because he has known the world in all waysFor the Blessed One has experienced known and penetrated the world in all ways to its individual essence its arising its cessation and the means to its cessationaccording as it is said Friend that there is a worlds end where one neither is born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor reappears which is to be known or seen or reached by travelthat I do not say Yet I do not say that there is ending of suffering without reaching the worlds endRather it is in this fathomlong carcass with its perceptions and its consciousness that I make known the world the arising of the world the cessation of the world and the way leading to the cessation of the worldTis utterly impossible To reach by travel the worlds endBut there is no escape from pain Until the worlds end has been reachedIt is a sage a knower of the worldsWho gets to the worlds end and it is he Whose life divine is lived out to its termHe is at peace who the worlds end has knownAnd hopes for neither this world nor the next Moreover there are three worlds the world of formations the world of beings and the world of locationHerein in the passage One world all beings subsist by nutriment  the world of formations is to be understoodIn the passage The world is eternal or The world is not eternal it is the world of beingsIn the passage As far as moon and sun do circulate Shining and lighting up the four directionsOver a thousand times as great a world Your power holds unquestionable sway it is the world of locationThe Blessed One has known that in all ways tooLikewise because of the words One world all beings subsist by nutrimentTwo worlds mentality and materialityThree worlds three kinds of feelingFour worlds four kinds of nutrimentFive worlds five aggregates as objects of clingingSix worlds six internal basesSeven worlds seven stations of consciousnessEight worlds eight worldly statesNine worlds nine abodes of beingsTen worlds ten basesTwelve worlds twelve basesEighteen worlds eighteen elements  this world of formations was known to him in all ways But he knows all beings habits knows their inherent tendencies knows their temperaments knows their bents knows them as with little dust on their eyes and with much dust on their eyes with keen faculties and with dull faculties with good behaviour and with bad behaviour easy to teach and hard to teach capable and incapable of achievement therefore this world of beings was known to him in all waysAnd as the world of beings so also the world of locationFor accordingly this world measures as follows One worldsphere is twelve hundred thousand leagues and thirtyfour hundred and fifty leagues in breadth and widthIn circumference howeverThe measure of it all around Is six and thirty hundred thousandAnd then ten thousand in addition Four hundred too less half a hundred  HereinTwo times a hundred thousand leagues And then four nahutas as well This earth this Bearer of All Wealth Has that much thickness as they tellAnd its supportFour times a hundred thousand leagues And then eight nahutas as well The water resting on the air Has that much thickness as they tellAnd the support of thatNine times a hundred thousand goes The air out in the firmamentAnd sixty thousand more besides So this much is the worlds extentSuch is its extent And these features are to be found in itplunges down into the sea Full four and eighty thousand leaguesSineru tallest of all mountains and towers up in like degreeSeven concentric mountain rings surround Sineru in suchwise That each of them in depth and height is half its predecessors sizeYugandhara sadhara Karavīka SudassanaNemindhara Vinataka Assakaṇṇa  Vast ranges calledHeavenly breezes fan their cliffs agleam with gems and here resideThe Four Kings of the Cardinal Points and other gods and sprites besideHimālayas lofty mountain mass rises in height five hundred leaguesAnd in its width and in its breadth it covers quite three thousand leaguesAnd then it is bedecked besides with four and eighty thousand peaksThe Jambu Tree called Nāga lends the name by its magnificence To Jambudīpas land its trunk thrice five leagues in circumference Soars fifty leagues and bears all round branches of equal amplitude So that a hundred leagues define diameter and altitude And the size of the Jambu Tree is the same as that of the Citrapāṭaliya Tree of the Asura demons the Simbali Tree of the Garuḷa demons the Kadamba Tree in the western continent of Aparagoyana the Kappa Tree in the northern continent of the Uttarakurus the Sirīsa Tree in the eastern continent of Pubbavideha and the Pāricchattaka Tree in the heaven of the Deities of the Thirtythree Hence the Ancients saidThe Pāṭali Simbali and Jambu the deities PāricchattakaThe Kadamba the Kappa Tree and the Sirīsa as the seventhThe Worldsphere Mountains line of summits plunges down into the sea Just two and eighty thousand leagues and towers up in like degree Enringing one worldelement all round in its entirety Herein the moons disk is fortynine leagues acrossand the suns disk is fifty leaguesThe realm of Tāvatiṃsa is ten thousand leaguesLikewise the realm of the Asura demons the great Avīci Hell and Jambudīpa Aparagoyāna is seven thousand leaguesLikewise PubbavidehaUttarakurū is eight thousand leaguesAnd herein each great continent is surrounded by five hundred small islandsAnd the whole of that constitutes a single worldsphere a single worldelementBetween this and the adjacent worldspheres are the Lokantarika hellsSo the worldspheres are infinite in number the world elements are infinite and the Blessed One has experienced known and penetrated them with the infinite knowledge of the Enlightened OnesTherefore this world of location was known to him in all ways tooSo he is knower of worlds because he has seen the world in all ways In the absence of anyone more distinguished for special qualities than himself there is no one to compare with him thus he is incomparableFor in this way he surpasses the whole world in the special quality of virtue and also in the special qualities of concentration understanding deliverance and knowledge and vision of deliveranceIn the special quality of virtue he is without equal he is the equal only of those other Enlightened Ones without equal he is without like without double without counterpart  in the special quality of knowledge and vision of deliverance he is  without counterpartaccording as it is said I do not see in the world with its deities its Māras and its Brahmās in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans with its princes and men anyone more perfect in virtue than myself  with the rest in detailand likewise in the Aggappasāda Sutta  and so on and in the stanzas beginning I have no teacher and my like does not exist in all the world  all of which should be taken in detail He guides men to be tamed  thus he is leader of men to be tamed he tames he disciplines is what is meantHerein animal males and human males and nonhuman males that are not tamed but fit to be tamed are men to be tamed For the animal males namely the royal nāga Apalāla Cūḷodara Mahodara Aggisikha Dhūmasikha the royal nāga ravāḷa the elephant Dhanapālaka and so on were tamed by the Blessed One freed from the poison of defilement and established in the refuges and the precepts of virtue and also the human males namely Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son the brahman student Ambaṭṭha Pokkharasāti Soṇadaṇḍa Kūṭadanta and so on and also the nonhuman males namely the spirits ḷavaka Sūciloma and Kharaloma Sakka Ruler of Gods etc were tamed and disciplined by various disciplinary meansAnd the following sutta should be given in full here I discipline men to be tamed sometimes gently Kesi and I discipline them sometimes roughly and I discipline them sometimes gently and roughly Then the Blessed One moreover further tames those already tamed doing so by announcing the first jhāna etc respectively to those whose virtue is purified etc and also the way to the higher path to stream enterers and so onOr alternatively the words incomparable leader of men to be tamed can be taken together as one clauseFor the Blessed One so guides men to be tamed that in a single session they may go in the eight directions by the eight liberations without hesitationThus he is called the incomparable leader of men to be tamedAnd the following sutta passage should be given in full here Guided by the elephanttamer bhikkhus the elephant to be tamed goes in one direction  He teaches by means of the here and now of the life to come and of the ultimate goal according as befits the case thus he is the Teacher And furthermore this meaning should be understood according to the Niddesa thus Teacher  the Blessed One is a caravan leader since he brings home caravans Just as one who brings a caravan home gets caravans across a wilderness gets them across a robberinfested wilderness gets them across a wildbeastinfested wilderness gets them across a foodless wilderness gets them across a waterless wilderness gets them right across gets them quite across gets them properly across gets them to reach a land of safety so too the Blessed One is a caravan leader one who brings home the caravans he gets them across a wilderness gets them across the wilderness of birth Of gods and men devamanussānaṃ  devānañ ca manussānañ ca This is said in order to denote those who are the best and also to denote those persons capable of progressFor the Blessed One as a teacher bestowed his teaching upon animals as wellFor when animals can through listening to the Blessed Ones Dhamma acquire the benefit of a suitable rebirth as support for progress and with the benefit of that same support they come in their second or third rebirth to partake of the path and its fruitionMaṇḍūka the deitys son and others illustrate thisWhile the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma to the inhabitants of the city of Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lake it seems a frog apprehended a sign in the Blessed Ones voice A cowherd who was standing leaning on a stick put his stick on the frogs head and crushed itHe died and was straight away reborn in a gilded divine palace twelve leagues broad in the realm of the Thirty three He found himself there as if waking up from sleep amidst a host of celestial nymphs and he exclaimed So I have actually been reborn here What deed did I do  When he sought for the reason he found it was none other than his apprehension of the sign in the Blessed Ones voiceHe went with his divine palace at once to the Blessed One and paid homage at his feetThough the Blessed One knew about it he asked himWho now pays homage at my feet Shining with glory of successIlluminating all around With beauty so outstanding In my last life I was a frog The waters of a pond my homeA cowherds crook ended my life While listening to your Dhamma The Blessed One taught him the DhammaEightyfour thousand creatures gained penetration to the DhammaAs soon as the deitys son became established in the fruition of streamentry he smiled and then vanishedHe is enlightened with the knowledge that belongs to the fruit of liberation since everything that can be known has been discovered by himOr alternatively he discovered the four truths by himself and awakened others to them thus and for other such reasons he is enlightened And in order to explain this meaning the whole passage in the Niddesa beginning thus He is the discoverer of the truths thus he is enlightened He is the awakened of the generation thus he is enlightened   or the same passage from the Paṭisambhidā  should be quoted in detail Blessed is a term signifying the respect and veneration accorded to him as the highest of all beings and distinguished by his special qualitiesHence the Ancients saidBlessed is the best of words Blessed is the finest wordDeserving awe and veneration Blessed is the name thereforeOr alternatively names are of four kinds denoting a period of life describing a particular mark signifying a particular acquirement and fortuitously arisenwhich last in the current usage of the world is called capriciousHerein names denoting a period of life are those such as yearling calf  steer to be trained  yoke ox  and the likeNames describing a particular mark are those such as staffbearer  umbrellabearer  topknotwearer  hand possessor  and the likeNames signifying a particular acquirement are those such as possessor of the threefold clear vision  possessor of the six directknowledges  and the likeSuch names are Sirivaḍḍhaka  Dhanavaḍḍhaka  etc are fortuitously arisen names they have no reference to the wordmeanings This name Blessed is one signifying a particular acquirement it is not made by MahāMāyā or by King Suddhodana or by the eighty thousand kinsmen or by distinguished deities like Sakka Santusita and othersAnd this is said by the General of the Law Blessed this is not a name made by a mother  This name Buddha which signifies final liberation is a realistic description of Buddhas  the Blessed Ones together with their obtainment of omniscient knowledge at the root of an Enlightenment Tree Now in order to explain also the special qualities signified by this name they cite the following stanzaThe reverend one has blessings  is a frequenter  a partaker  a possessor of what has been analyzed He has caused abolishing  he is fortunate He has fully developed himself in many waysHe has gone to the end of becoming  thus is called Blessed The meaning of these words should be understood according to the method of explanation given in the Niddesa But there is this other wayHe is fortunate  possessed of abolishment  associated with blessings  and a possessor of what has been analyzed He has frequented  and he has rejected going in the kinds of becoming  thus he is Blessed  Herein by using the characteristic of language beginning with vowel augmentation of syllable elision of syllable  or by using the characteristic of insertion beginning with the example of pisodara etc  it may be known that he can also be called blessed when he can be called fortunate owing to the fortunateness to have reached the further shore of the ocean of perfection of giving virtue etc which produce mundane and supramundane bliss  for he has abolished all the hundred thousand kinds of trouble anxiety and defilement classed as greed as hate as delusion and as misdirected attention as consciencelessness and shamelessness as anger and enmity as contempt and domineering as envy and avarice as deceit and fraud as obduracy and presumption as pride and haughtiness as vanity and negligence as craving and ignorance as the three roots of the unprofitable kinds of misconduct defilement stains fictitious perceptions applied thoughts and diversifications as the four perversenesses cankers ties floods bonds bad ways cravings and clingings as the five wildernesses in the heart shackles in the heart hindrances and kinds of delight as the six roots of discord and groups of craving as the seven inherent tendencies as the eight wrongnesses as the nine things rooted in craving as the ten courses of unprofitable action as the sixtytwo kinds of false view as the hundred and eight ways of behaviour of cravingor in brief the five Māras that is to say the Māras of defilement of the aggregates and of kammaformations Māra as a deity and Māra as deathSimilarly he can also be called blessed when he can be called possessed of abolishment owing to the following menaces having been abolishedAnd in this context it is saidHe has abolished greed and hate Delusion too he is cankerfreeAbolished every evil state Blessed his name may rightly be And by his fortunateness is indicated the excellence of his material body which bears a hundred characteristics of meritand by his having abolished defects is indicated the excellence of his Dhamma bodyLikewise by his fortunateness is indicated the esteem of worldly people and by his having abolished defects the esteem of those who resemble him And by his fortunateness it is indicated that he is fit to be relied on by laymen and by his having abolished defects that he is fit to be relied on by those gone forth into homelessness and when both have relied on him they acquire relief from bodily and mental pain as well as help with both material and Dhamma gifts and they are rendered capable of finding both mundane and supramundane blissNow in the world the word blessing is used for six things namely lordship Dhamma fame glory wish and endeavour He has supreme lordship over his own mind either of the kind reckoned as mundane and consisting in minuteness lightness etc or that complete in all aspectsand likewise the supramundane DhammaAnd he has exceedingly pure fame spread through the three worlds acquired though the special quality of veracityAnd he has glory of all limbs perfect in every aspect which is capable of comforting the eyes of people eager to see his material bodyAnd he has his wish in other words the production of what is wanted since whatever is wanted and needed by him as beneficial to himself or others is then and there produced for himAnd he has the endeavour in other words the right effort which is the reason why the whole world venerates himHe is also called blessed since he is associated with blessings such as those of the following kind in the sense that he has those blessings owing to his having analyzed and clarified all states into the three classes beginning with the profitable or profitable etc states into such classes as aggregates bases elements truths faculties dependent origination etc or the noble truth of suffering into the senses of oppressing being formed burning and changing and that of origin into the senses of accumulating source bond and impediment and that of cessation into the senses of escape seclusion being unformed and deathless and that of the path into the senses of outlet cause seeing and predominance Having analyzed having revealed having shown them is what is meantHe can also be called blessed when he can be called a possessor of what has been analyzed He can also be called blessed when he can be called one who has frequented owing to his having frequented  cultivated repeatedly practiced such mundane and supramundane higherthanhuman states as the heavenly the divine and the noble abidings as bodily mental and existential seclusion as the void the desireless and the signless liberations and others as wellHe can also be called blessed when he can be called one who has rejected going in the kinds of becoming because in the three kinds of becoming  the going  in other words craving has been rejected by him And the syllables bha from the word bhava and ga from the word gamana and va from the word vanta with the letter a lengthened make the word bhagavā just as is done in the world of the grammarians outside the Dispensation with the word mekhalā since garland for the private parts can be said As long as the meditator recollects the special qualities of the Buddha in this way For this and this reason the Blessed One is accomplished  for this and this reason he is blessed then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusionhis mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Perfect One  So when he has thus suppressed the hindrances by preventing obsession by greed etc and his mind faces the meditation subject with rectitude then his applied thought and sustained thought occur with a tendency toward the Enlightened Ones special qualitiesAs he continues to exercise applied thought and sustained thought upon the Enlightened Ones special qualities happiness arises in himWith his mind happy with happiness as a proximate cause his bodily and mental disturbances are tranquilized by tranquillityWhen the disturbances have been tranquilized bodily and mental bliss arise in himWhen he is blissful his mind with the Enlightened Ones special qualities for its object becomes concentrated and so the jhāna factors eventually arise in a single momentBut owing to the profundity of the Enlightened Ones special qualities or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of the Buddha too because it arises with the recollection of the Enlightened Ones special qualities as the meansWhen a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Buddha he is respectful and deferential towards the Master He attains fullness of faith mindfulness understanding and merit He has much happiness and gladness He conquers fear and dread He is able to endure pain He comes to feel as if he were living in the Masters presenceAnd his body when the recollection of the Buddhas special qualities dwells in it becomes as worthy of veneration as a shrine roomHis mind tends toward the plane of the BuddhasWhen he encounters an opportunity for transgression he has awareness of conscience and shame as vivid as though he were face to face with the MasterAnd if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinyNow when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely beThis recollection of the Buddha Blessed with such mighty potencyThis firstly is the section dealing with the recollection of the Enlightened One in the detailed explanationOne who wants to develop the recollection of the Dhamma should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of both the Dhamma of the scriptures and the ninefold supramundane Dhamma as follows The Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One visible here and now not delayed  inviting of inspection onwardleading and directly experienceable by the wise Well proclaimed in this clause the Dhamma of the scriptures is included as well as the other in the rest of the clauses only the supramundane Dhamma is includedHerein the Dhamma of the scriptures is well proclaimed because it is good in the beginning the middle and the end and because it announces the life of purity that is utterly perfect and pure with meaning and with detail Even a single stanza of the Blessed Ones teaching is good in the beginning with the first word good in the middle with the second third etc and good in the end with the last word because the Dhamma is altogether admirableA sutta with a single sequence of meaning is good in the beginning with the introduction good in the end with the conclusion and good in the middle with what is in betweenA sutta with several sequences of meaning is good in the beginning with the first sequence of meaning good in the end with the last sequence of meaning and good in the middle with the sequences of meaning in betweenFurthermore it is good in the beginning with the introduction giving the place of and the origin giving the reason for its utterance It is good in the middle because it suits those susceptible of being taught since it is unequivocal in meaning and reasoned with cause and example It is good in the end with its conclusion that inspires faith in the hearersAlso the entire Dhamma of the Dispensation is good in the beginning with virtue as ones own wellbeing It is good in the middle with serenity and insight and with path and fruition It is good in the end with NibbānaOr alternatively it is good in the beginning with virtue and concentration It is good in the middle with insight and the path It is good in the end with fruition and NibbānaOr alternatively it is good in the beginning because it is the good discovery made by the Buddha It is good in the middle because it is the wellregulatedness of the Dhamma It is good in the end because it is the good way entered upon by the SaṅghaOr alternatively it is good in the beginning as the discovery of what can be attained by one who enters upon the way of practice in conformity after hearing about it It is good in the middle as the unproclaimed enlightenment of Paccekabuddhas It is good in the end as the enlightenment of disciplesAnd when listened to it does good through hearing it because it suppresses the hindrances thus it is good in the beginning And when made the way of practice it does good through the way being entered upon because it brings the bliss of serenity and insight thus it is good in the middle And when it has thus been made the way of practice and the fruit of the way is ready it does good through the fruit of the way because it brings unshakable equipoise thus it is good in the end So it is well proclaimed because of being good in the beginning the middle and the endNow the life of purity that is to say the life of purity of the Dispensation and the life of purity of the path which the Blessed One announces which he shows in various ways when he teaches the Dhamma is with meaning because of perfection of meaning and it is with detail because of perfection of detail as it is proper that it should beIt is with meaning because it conforms to the words declaring its meaning by pronouncing clarifying revealing expounding and explaining it It is with detail because it has perfection of syllables words details style language and descriptionsIt is with meaning owing to profundity of meaning and profundity of penetration It is with detail owing to profundity of law and profundity of teachingIt is with meaning because it is the province of the discriminations of meaning and of perspicuity It is with detail because it is the province of the discriminations of law and of language It is with meaning since it inspires confidence in persons of discretion being experienceable by the wise It is with detail since it inspires confidence in worldly persons being a fit object of faithIt is with meaning because its intention is profound It is with detail because its words are clearIt is utterly perfect with the complete perfection due to absence of anything that can be addedIt is pure with the immaculateness due to absence of anything to be subtracted Furthermore it is with meaning because it provides the particular distinction of achievement through practice of the way and it is with detail because it provides the particular distinction of learning through mastery of scripture It is utterly perfect because it is connected with the five aggregates of Dhamma beginning with virtue  It is pure because it has no imperfection because it exists for the purpose of crossing over the round of rebirths flood  and because it is not concerned with worldly things So it is well proclaimed because it announces the life of purity that is utterly perfect and pure with meaning and with detail Or alternatively it is well proclaimed since it has been properly proclaimed with no perversion of meaningFor the meaning of other sectarians law suffers perversion since there is actually no obstruction in the things described there as obstructive and actually no outlet in the things described there as outletswhich is why their law is illproclaimed but not so the Blessed Ones Law whose meaning suffers no perversionsince the things described there as obstructions and the things described there as outlets are so in actual factSo in the first place the Dhamma of the scriptures is well proclaimed The supramundane Dhamma is well proclaimed since both the way that accords with Nibbāna and the Nibbāna that accords with the way have been proclaimedaccording as it is said The way leading to Nibbāna has been properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One and Nibbāna and the way meetJust as the water of the Ganges meets and joins with the water of the Yamunā so too the way leading to Nibbāna has been properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One and Nibbāna and the way meet And here the noble path which is the middle way since it does not approach either extreme is well proclaimed in being proclaimed to be the middle wayThe fruits of asceticism where defilements are tranquilized are well proclaimed too in being proclaimed to have tranquilized defilementNibbāna whose individual essence is eternal deathless the refuge the shelter etc is well proclaimed too in being proclaimed to have an individual essence that is eternal and so on So the supramundane Dhamma is also well proclaimed Visible here and now firstly the noble path is visible here and now since it can be seen by a noble person himself when he has done away with greed etc in his own continuityaccording as it is said When a man is dyed with greed brahman and is overwhelmed and his mind is obsessed by greed then he thinks for his own affliction he thinks for others affliction he thinks for the affliction of bothand he experiences mental suffering and griefWhen greed has been abandoned he neither thinks for his own affliction nor thinks for others affliction nor thinks for the affliction of both and he does not experience mental suffering and griefThis brahman is how the Dhamma is visible here and now Furthermore the ninefold supramundane Dhamma is also visible here and now since when anyone has attained it it is visible to him through reviewing knowledge without his having to rely on faith in anotherOr alternatively the view that is recommended is proper view  It conquers by means of proper view thus it has proper view For in this way the noble path conquers defilements by means of the proper view associated with it and the noble fruition does so by means of the proper view that is its cause and Nibbāna does so by means of the proper view that has Nibbāna as its objective fieldSo the ninefold supramundane Dhamma has the proper view since it conquers by means of proper view just as a charioteer is so called because he conquers by means of a chariot  Or alternatively it is seeing that is called the seen then diṭṭha and sandiṭṭha are identical in meaning as seeingIt is worthy of being seen  thus it is visible here and now For the supramundane Dhamma arrests the fearful round of kamma etc as soon as it is seen by means of penetration consisting in development of the path and by means of penetration consisting in realization of NibbānaSo it is visible here and now since it is worthy of being seen  just as one who is clothable is so called because he is worthy of clothes It has no delay in the matter of giving its own fruit thus it is without delay Without delay is the same as not delayed What is meant is that instead of giving its fruit after creating a delay  say five days seven days it gives its fruit immediately next to its own occurrence  Or alternatively what is delayed is what needs some distant time to be reached before it can give its fruitWhat is thatIt is the mundane law of profitable kammaThis however is undelayed because its fruit comes immediately next to it so it is not delayed This is said with reference to the pathIt is worthy of an invitation to inspect given thus Come and see this Dhamma  thus it is inviting of inspection But why is it worthy of this invitationBecause it is found and because of its purityFor if a man has said that there is money or gold in an empty fist he cannot say Come and see itWhy notBecause it is not foundAnd on the other hand while dung or urine may well be found a man cannot for the purpose of cheering the mind by exhibiting beauty say Come and see thison the contrary they have to be covered up with grass and leavesWhyBecause of their impurityBut this ninefold supramundane Dhamma is actually found as such in its individual essence and it is as pure as the full moons disk in a cloudless sky as a gem of pure water on bleached cloth Consequently it is worthy of the invitation to inspect since it is found and pure thus it is inviting of inspection  The word opanayika is equivalent to the gerund upanetabba Here is an exposition An inducing is an inducement  As the four paths and four fruitions this Dhamma is worth inducing that is arousing in ones own mind subjectively by means of development without any question of whether or not ones clothing or ones head is on fire thus it is onwardleading This applies to the abovementioned eight formed supramundane states But the unformed dhamma is worth inducing by ones own mind to become the minds object thus it is onward leading toothe meaning is that it is worth treating as ones shelter by realizing it Or alternatively what induces the noble person onwards to Nibbāna is the noble path which is thus inductive Again what can be induced to realizability is the Dhamma consisting in fruition and Nibbāna which is thus inductive  tooThe word upaneyya is the same as the word opanayikaIs directly experienceable by the wise it can be experienced by all the kinds of wise men beginning with the acutely wise each in himself thus The path has been developed fruition attained and cessation realized by meFor it does not happen that when a preceptor has developed the path his co resident abandons his defilements nor does a coresident dwell in comfort owing to the preceptors attainment of fruition nor does he realize the Nibbāna realized by the preceptorSo this is not visible in the way that an ornament on anothers head is but rather it is visible only in ones own mindWhat is meant is that it can be undergone by wise men but it is not the province of fools Now in addition this Dhamma is well proclaimedWhyBecause it is visible here and nowIt is visible here and now because it is not delayedIt is not delayed because it invites inspectionAnd what invites inspection is onward leadingAs long as the meditator recollects the special qualities of the Dhamma in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greedor obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusionhis mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Dhamma  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious momentBut owing to the profundity of the Dhammas special qualities or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of the Dhamma too because it arises with the recollection of the Dhammas special qualities as the means When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Dhamma he thinks I never in the past met a master who taught a law that led onward thus who possessed this talent nor do I now see any such a master other than the Blessed One  Seeing the Dhammas special qualities in this way he is respectful and deferential towards the MasterHe entertains great reverence for the Dhamma and attains fullness of faith and so on He has much happiness and gladness He conquers fear and dread He is able to endure pain He comes to feel as if he were living in the Dhammas presence And his body when the recollection of the Dhammas special qualities dwells in it becomes as worthy of veneration as a shrine room His mind tends towards the realization of the peerless Dhamma When he encounters an opportunity for transgression he has vivid awareness of conscience and shame on recollecting the wellregulatedness of the DhammaAnd if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinyNow when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely beThis recollection of the Dhamma Blessed with such mighty potencyThis is the section dealing with the recollection of the Dhamma in the detailed explanationOne who wants to develop the recollection of the Community should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of the community of Noble Ones as follows The community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the good way the community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the straight way the community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the true way the community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the proper way that is to say the four pairs of men the eight persons this community of the Blessed Ones disciples is fit for gifts fit for hospitality fit for offerings fit for reverential salutation as an incomparable field of merit for the world  Herein entered on the good way is thoroughly entered on the way  What is meant is that it has entered on a way that is the right way  the way that is irreversible the way that is in conformity with truth the way that has no opposition the way that is regulated by the DhammaThey hear attentively the Blessed Ones instruction thus they are his disciples The community of the disciples is the community of those disciples The meaning is that the total of disciples forms a communality because it possesses in common both virtue and right view That right way being straight unbent uncrooked unwarped is called noble and true and is known as proper owing to its becomingnesstherefore the noble community that has entered on that is also said to have entered on the straight way entered on the true way and entered on the proper wayThose who stand on the path can be understood to have entered on the good way since they possess the right wayAnd those who stand in fruition can be understood to have entered on the good way with respect to the way that is now past since by means of the right way they have realized what should be realized Furthermore the Community has entered on the good way because it has entered on the way according as instructed in the wellproclaimed Dhamma and Discipline  and because it has entered on the immaculate wayIt has entered on the straight way because it has entered on the way avoiding the two extremes and taking the middle course and because it has entered on the way of the abandonment of the faults of bodily and verbal crookedness tortuousness and warpedness because Nibbāna is what is called trueIt has entered on the true way and it has entered on the way with that as its aimIt has entered on the proper way because it has entered on the way of those who are worthy of proper acts of veneration The word yadidaṃ  yāni imāniThe four pairs of men taking them pairwise the one who stands on the first path and the one who stands in the first fruition as one pair in this way there are four pairsThe eight persons taking them by persons the one who stands on the first path as one and the one who stands in the first fruition as one in this way there are eight personsAnd there in the compound purisapuggala the words purisa and puggala have the same meaningbut it is expressed in this way to suit differing susceptibility to teachingThis community of the Blessed Ones disciples this community of the Blessed Ones disciples taken by pairs as the four pairs of men and individually as the eight persons  As to fit for gifts etc what should be brought and given is a gift  the meaning is what is to be brought even from far away and donated to the virtuousIt is a term for the four requisitesThe Community is fit to receive that gift because it makes it bear great fruit thus it is fit for gifts Or alternatively all kinds of property even when the bringer comes from far away can be given here thus the Community can be given to or it is fit to be given to by Sakka and others thus it can be given toAnd the brahmans fire is called to be given to  for they believe that what is sacrificed to it brings great fruit But if something is to be sacrificed to for the sake of the great fruit brought by what is sacrificed to it then surely the Community should be sacrificed tofor what is sacrificed to the Community has great fruitaccording as it is saidWere anyone to serve the fire Out in the woods a hundred yearsAnd pay one moments homage too To men of selfdevelopmentHis homage would by far excel His hundred years of sacrifice And the words āhavanīya  which is used in the schools is the same in meaning as this word āhuneyya used hereThere is only the mere trifling difference of syllablesSo it is fit for gifts Fit for hospitality  hospitality is what a donation to visitors is called prepared with all honours for the sake of dear and beloved relatives and friends who have come from all quartersBut even more than to such objects of hospitality it is fitting that it should be given also to the Communityfor there is no object of hospitality so fit to receive hospitality as the Communitysince it is encountered after an interval between Buddhas and possesses wholly endearing and lovable qualitiesSo it is fit for hospitality since the hospitality is fit to be given to it and it is fit to receive itBut those who take the text to be pāhavanīya have it that the Community is worthy to be placed first and so what is to be given should first of all be brought here and given  and for that reason it is fit to be given hospitality toor since it is worthy to be given to in all aspects  it is thus fit to be given hospitality to And here this is called pāhuneyya in the same senseOffering is what a gift is called that is to be given out of faith in the world to comeThe Community is worthy of that offering or it is helpful to that offering because it purifies it by making it of great fruit thus it is fit for offerings It is worthy of being accorded by the whole world the reverential salutation consisting in placing both hands palms together above the head thus it is fit for reverential salutation As an incomparable field of merit for the world as a place without equal in the world for growing meritjust as the place for growing the kings or ministers rice or corn is the kings ricefield or the kings cornfield so the Community is the place for growing the whole worlds meritFor the worlds various kinds of merit leading to welfare and happiness grow with the Community as their supportTherefore the Community is an incomparable field of merit for the world As long as he recollects the special qualities of the Saṅgha in this way classed as having entered on the good way etc then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greedor obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusionhis mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Saṅgha  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious momentBut owing to the profundity of the Communitys special qualities or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of the Saṅgha too because it arises with the recollection of the Communitys special qualities as the meansWhen a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Community he is respectful and deferential towards the CommunityHe attains fullness of faith and so on He has much happiness and bliss He conquers fear and dread He is able to endure pain He comes to feel as if he were living in the Communitys presenceAnd his body when the recollection of the Sanghas special qualities dwells in it becomes as worthy of veneration as an Uposatha house where the Community has met His mind tends towards the attainment of the Communitys special qualities When he encounters an opportunity for transgression he has awareness of conscience and shame as vividly as if he were face to face with the Community And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinyNow when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely beThis recollection of the Saṅgha Blessed with such mighty potencyThis is the section dealing with the recollection of the Community in the detailed explanation One who wants to develop the recollection of virtue should go into solitary retreat and recollect his own different kinds of virtue in their special qualities of being untorn etc as follows Indeed my various kinds of virtue are untorn unrent unblotched unmottled liberating praised by the wise not adhered to and conducive to concentration And a layman should recollect them in the form of laymens virtue while one gone forth into homelessness should recollect them in the form of the virtue of those gone forth Whether they are the virtues of laymen or of those gone forth when no one of them is broken in the beginning or in the end not being torn like a cloth ragged at the ends then they are untornWhen no one of them is broken in the middle not being rent like a cloth that is punctured in the middle then they are unrentWhen they are not broken twice or thrice in succession not being blotched like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with discrepantcoloured oblong or round patch appearing on her back or belly then they are unblotchedWhen they are not broken all over at intervals not being mottled like a cow speckled with discrepantcoloured spots then they are unmottled Or in general they are untorn unrent unblotched unmottled when they are undamaged by the seven bonds of sexuality and by anger and enmity and the other evil things  Those same virtues are liberating since they liberate by freeing from the slavery of cravingThey are praised by the wise because they are praised by such wise men as Enlightened OnesThey are not adhered to since they are not adhered to with craving and false view or because of the impossibility of misapprehending that There is this flaw in your virtuesThey are conducive to concentration since they conduce to access concentration and absorption concentration or to path concentration and fruition concentration As long as he recollects his own virtues in their special qualities of being untorn etc in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greedor obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusionhis mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by virtue  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious momentBut owing to the profundity of the virtues special qualities or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of virtue too because it arises with the virtues special qualities as the means And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of virtue he has respect for the training He lives in communion with his fellows in the life of purity He is sedulous in welcoming He is devoid of the fear of selfreproach and so on He sees fear in the slightest fault He attains fullness of faith and so on He has much happiness and gladnessAnd if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinyNow when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely beThis recollection of his virtue Blessed with such mighty potencyThis is the section dealing with the recollection of virtue in the detailed explanation One who wants to develop the recollection of generosity should be naturally devoted to generosity and the constant practice of giving and sharingOr alternatively if he is one who is starting the development of it he should make the resolution From now on when there is anyone present to receive I shall not eat even a single mouthful without having given a gift And that very day he should give a gift by sharing according to his means and his ability with those who have distinguished qualities When he has apprehended the sign in that he should go into solitary retreat and recollect his own generosity in its special qualities of being free from the stain of avarice etc as follows It is gain for me it is great gain for me that in a generation obsessed by the stain of avarice I abide with my heart free from stain by avarice and am freely generous and openhanded that I delight in relinquishing expect to be asked and rejoice in giving and sharing  Herein it is gain for me it is my gain advantage The intention is I surely partake of those kinds of gain for a giver that have been commended by the Blessed One as follows A man who gives life by giving food shall have life either divine or human  and A giver is loved and frequented by many  and One who gives is ever loved according to the wise mans law  and so on It is great gain for me it is great gain for me that this Dispensation or the human state has been gained by meWhyBecause of the fact that I abide with my mind free from stain by avarice  and rejoice in giving and sharing Herein obsessed by the stain of avarice is overwhelmed by the stain of avariceGeneration beings so called owing to the fact of their being generatedSo the meaning here is this among beings who are overwhelmed by the stain of avarice which is one of the dark states that corrupt the natural transparency of consciousness and which has the characteristic of inability to bear sharing ones own good fortune with others Free from stain by avarice because of being both free from avarice and from the other stains greed hate and the restI abide with my heart I abide with my consciousness of the kind already stated is the meaningBut in the sutta I live the home life with my heart free  etc is said because it was taught there as a mental abiding to depend on constantly to Mahānāma the Sakyan who was a streamenterer asking about an abiding to depend onThere the meaning is I live overcoming  Freely generous liberally generousOpenhanded with hands that are purifiedWhat is meant is with hands that are always washed in order to give gifts carefully with ones own handsThat I delight in relinquishing the act of relinquishing is relinquishing  the meaning is giving upTo delight in relinquishing is to delight in constant devotion to that relinquishingExpect to be asked  accustomed to being asked because of giving whatever others ask for is the meaningYājayoga is a readingin which case the meaning is devoted to sacrifice  in other words to sacrificing And rejoice in sharingthe meaning is he recollects thus I give gifts and I share out what is to be used by myself and I rejoice in both As long as he recollects his own generosity in its special qualities of freedom from stain by avarice etc in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greedor obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusionhis mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by generosity  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious momentBut owing to the profundity of the generositys special qualities or owing to his being occupied in recollecting the generositys special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that access jhāna is known as recollection of generosity too because it arises with the generositys special qualities as the means And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of generosity he becomes ever more intent on generosity his preference is for nongreed he acts in conformity with lovingkindness he is fearless He has much happiness and gladness And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinyNow when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely beThis recollection of his giving Blessed with such mighty potencyThis is the section dealing with the recollection of generosity in the detailed explanation One who wants to develop the recollection of deities should possess the special qualities of faith etc evoked by means of the noble path recollect his own special qualities of faith etc with deities standing as witnesses as followsand he should go into solitary retreat and There are deities of the Realm of the Four Kings  there are deities of the Realm of the Thirtythree  there are deities who are Gone to Divine Bliss  who are Contented  who Delight in Creating  who Wield Power Over Others Creations  there are deities of Brahmās Retinue  there are deities higher than that And those deities were possessed of faith such that on dying here they were reborn there and such faith is present in me tooAnd those deities were possessed of virtue of learning of generosity of understanding such that when they died here they were reborn there and such understanding is present in me too  In the sutta however it is said On the occasion Mahānāma on which a noble disciple recollects the faith the virtue the learning the generosity and the understanding that are both his own and of those deities on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed  Although this is said it should nevertheless be understood as said for the purpose of showing that the special qualities of faith etc in oneself are those in the deities making the deities stand as witnessesFor it is said definitely in the Commentary He recollects his own special qualities making the deities stand as witnesses As long as in the prior stage he recollects the deities special qualities of faith etc and in the later stage he recollects the special qualities of faith etc existing in himself then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greedor obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by deities  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already stated  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious momentBut owing to the profundity of the special qualities of faith etc or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of deities too because it arises with the deities special qualities as the means And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of deities he becomes dearly loved by deities He obtains even greater fullness of faith He has much happiness and gladnessAnd if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinyNow when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely beThis recollection of deities Blessed with such mighty potencyThis is the section dealing with the recollection of deities in the detailed explanation Now in setting forth the detail of these recollections after the words His mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Perfect One it is added When a noble disciples mind has rectitude Mahānāma the meaning inspires him the law inspires him and the application of the law makes him glad When he is glad happiness is born in him  Herein the meaning inspires him should be understood as said of contentment inspired by the meaning beginning This Blessed One is such since he is  The law inspires him is said of contentment inspired by the textThe application of the law makes him glad is said of both  And when in the case of the recollection of deities inspired by deities is said this should be understood as said either of the consciousness that occurs in the prior stage inspired by deities or of the consciousness that occurs in the later stage inspired by the special qualities that are similar to those of the deities and are productive of the deities state  These six recollections succeed only in noble disciplesFor the special qualities of the Enlightened One the Law and the Community are evident to themand they possess the virtue with the special qualities of untornness etc the generosity that is free from stain by avarice and the special qualities of faith etc similar to those of deities And in the Mahānāma Sutta they are expounded in detail by the Blessed One in order to show a streamwinner an abiding to depend upon when he asked for one Also in the Gedha Sutta  Here bhikkhus a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One in this way That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished  His mind has rectitude on that occasion He has renounced got free from emerged from cupidityCupidity bhikkhus is a term for the five cords of sense desireSome beings gain purity here by making this recollection their prop  they are expounded in order that a noble disciple should purify his consciousness by means of the recollections and so attain further purification in the ultimate sense thus  And in the Sambādhokāsa Sutta taught by the venerable MahāKaccāna they are expounded as the realization of the wideopen through the susceptibility of purification that exists in the ultimate sense only in a noble disciple thus It is wonderful friends it is marvellous how the realization of the wideopen in the crowded house life has been discovered by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened for the purification of beings for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the ending of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realization of Nibbāna that is to say the six stations of recollectionWhat sixHere friends a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One  Some beings are susceptible to purification in this way  Also in the Uposatha Sutta And what is the Noble Ones Uposatha VisākhāIt is the gradual cleansing of the mind still sullied by imperfectionsAnd what is the gradual cleansing of the mind still sullied by imperfectionsHere Visākhā a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One   they are expounded in order to show the greatness of the fruit of the Uposatha as a mindpurifying meditation subject for a noble disciple who is observing the Uposatha And in the Book of Elevens  One who has faith is successful Mahānāma not one who has no faithOne who is energetic  One whose mindfulness is established  One who is concentrated  One who has understanding is successful Mahānāma not one who has no understandingHaving established yourself in these five things Mahānāma you should develop six thingsHere Mahānāma you should recollect the Perfect One That Blessed One is such since   when a noble disciple has asked Venerable sir in what way should we abide who abide in various ways they are expounded to him in order to show the way of abiding in this way  Still though this is so they can be brought to mind by an ordinary man too if he possesses the special qualities of purified virtue and the restFor when he is recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha etc even only according to hearsay his consciousness settles downby virtue of which the hindrances are suppressed In his supreme gladness he initiates insight and he even attains to Arahantship like the Elder Phussadeva who dwelt at Kaṭakandhakāra That venerable one it seems saw a figure of the Enlightened One created by Māra He thought How good this appears despite its having greed hate and delusion What can the Blessed Ones goodness have been like For he was quite without greed hate and delusion  He acquired happiness with the Blessed One as object and by augmenting his insight he reached Arahantshipin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Concentrationcalled The Description of Six RecollectionsThe seventh chapter Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness of death which was listed next Herein death is the interruption of the life faculty included within the limits of a single becoming But death as termination  in other words the Arahants termination of the suffering of the round is not intended here nor is momentary death in other words the momentary dissolution of formations nor the death of conventional usage in such expressions as dead tree dead metal and so onAs intended here it is of two kinds that is to say timely death and untimely deathHerein timely death comes about with the exhaustion of merit or with the exhaustion of a life span or with bothUntimely death comes about through kamma that interrupts other lifeproducing kammaHerein death through exhaustion of merit is a term for the kind of death that comes about owing to the result of former rebirthproducing kammas having finished ripening although favourable conditions for prolonging the continuity of a life span may be still presentDeath through exhaustion of a life span is a term for the kind of death that comes about owing to the exhaustion of the normal life span of men of today which measures only a century owing to want of such excellence in destiny as deities have or in time as there is at the beginning of an aeon or in nutriment as the Uttarakurus and so on haveUntimely death is a term for the death of those whose continuity is interrupted by kamma capable of causing them to fall from their place at that very moment as in the case of DūsiMāra  Kalāburājā  etc or for the death of those whose lifes continuity is interrupted by assaults with weapons etc due to previous kammaAll these are included under the interruption of the life faculty of the kinds already statedSo mindfulness of death is the remembering of death in other words of the interruption of the life facultyOne who wants to develop this should go into solitary retreat and exercise attention wisely in this way Death will take place the life faculty will be interrupted or Death deathIf he exercises his attention unwisely in recollecting the possible death of an agreeable person sorrow arises as in a mother on recollecting the death of her beloved child she boreand gladness arises in recollecting the death of a disagreeable person as in enemies on recollecting the death of their enemiesand no sense of urgency arises on recollecting the death of neutral people as happens in a corpseburner on seeing a dead bodyand anxiety arises on recollecting ones own death as happens in a timid person on seeing a murderer with a poised daggerIn all that there is neither mindfulness nor sense of urgency nor knowledgeSo he should look here and there at beings that have been killed or have died and advert to the death of beings already dead but formerly seen enjoying good things doing so with mindfulness with a sense of urgency and with knowledge after which he can exercise his attention in the way beginning Death will take placeBy so doing he exercises it wisely He exercises it as a right means is the meaningWhen some exercise it merely in this way their hindrances get suppressed their mindfulness becomes established with death as its object and the meditation subject reaches accessBut one who finds that it does not get so far should do his recollecting of death in eight ways that is to say as having the appearance of a murderer as the ruin of success by comparison as to sharing the body with many as to the frailty of life as signless as to the limitedness of the extent as to the shortness of the moment Herein as having the appearance of a murderer he should do his recollecting thusJust as a murderer appears with a sword thinking I shall cut this mans head off and applies it to his neck so death appearsWhyBecause it comes with birth and it takes away lifeAs budding toadstools always come up lifting dust on their tops so beings are born along with aging and deathFor accordingly their rebirthlinking consciousness reaches aging immediately next to its arising and then breaks up together with its associated aggregates like a stone that falls from the summit of a rockSo to begin with momentary death comes along with birthBut death is inevitable for what is born consequently the kind of death intended here also comes along with birth Therefore just as the risen sun moves on towards its setting and never turns back even for a little while from wherever it has got toor just as a mountain torrent sweeps by with a rapid current ever flowing and rushing on and never turning back even for a little while so too this living being travels on towards death from the time when he is born and he never turns back even for a little whileHence it is saidRight from the very day a man Has been conceived inside a wombHe cannot but go on and on Nor going can he once turn back  And whilst he goes on thus death is as near to him as drying up is to rivulets in the summer heat as falling is to the fruits of trees when the sap reaches their attachments in the morning as breaking is to clay pots tapped by a mallet as vanishing is to dewdrops touched by the suns raysHence it is saidThe nights and days go slipping by As life keeps dwindling steadilyTill mortals span like water pools In failing rills is all used up As there is fear when fruits are ripe That in the morning they will fallSo mortals are in constant fear When they are born that they will dieAnd as the fate of pots of clay Once fashioned by the potters handOr small or big or baked or rawCondemns them to be broken up So mortals life leads but to death The dewdrop on the blade of grass Vanishes when the sun comes upSuch is a human span of life So mother do not hinder me So this death which comes along with birth is like a murderer with poised sword And like the murderer who applies the sword to the neck it carries off life and never returns to bring it backThat is why since death appears like a murderer with poised sword owing to its coming along with birth and carrying off life it should be recollected as having the appearance of a murderer  As the ruin of success here success shines as long as failure does not overcome it And the success does not exist that might endure out of reach of failureAccordinglyHe gave with joy a hundred millions After conquering all the earthTill in the end his realm came down To less than half a gallnuts worthYet when his merit was used up His body breathing its last breathThe Sorrowless Asoka too Felt sorrow face to face with death  Furthermore all health ends in sickness all youth ends in aging all life ends in death all worldly existence is procured by birth haunted by aging surprised by sickness and struck down by deathHence it is saidAs though huge mountains made of rock So vast they reached up to the skyWere to advance from every side Grinding beneath them all that livesSo age and death roll over allWarriors priests merchants and craftsmen The outcastes and the scavengersCrushing all beings sparing noneAnd here no troops of elephants No charioteers no infantryNo strategy in form of spells No riches serve to beat them off This is how death should be recollected as the ruin of success by defining it as deaths final ruining of lifes success By comparison by comparing oneself to othersHerein death should be recollected by comparison in seven ways that is to say with those of great fame with those of great merit with those of great strength with those of great supernormal power with those of great understanding with Paccekabuddhas with fully enlightened BuddhasHow Although Mahāsammata Mandhātu Mahāsudassana Daḷhanemi Nimi etc were greatly famous and had a great following and though they had amassed enormous wealth yet death inevitably caught up with them at length so how shall it not at length overtake meGreat kings like Mahāsammata Whose fame did spread so mightilyAll fell into deaths power too What can be said of those like meIt should be recollected in this way firstly by comparison with those of great fameHow by comparison with those of great meritJotika Jaṭila Ugga And Meṇḍaka and PuṇṇakaThese the world said and others too Did live most meritoriouslyYet they came one and all to death What can be said of those like meIt should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great meritHow by comparison with those of great strengthVāsudeva Baladeva Bhīmasena YuddhiṭṭhilaAnd Cāṇura the wrestler Were in the Exterminators powerThroughout the world they were renowned As blessed with strength so mightyThey too went to the realm of death What can be said of those like meIt should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great strengthHow by comparison with those of great supernormal powerWho with the point of his great toe Did rock Vejayantas Palace towersThe second of the chief disciples The foremost in miraculous powersLike a deer in a lions jaw he too Despite miraculous potencyFell in the dreadful jaws of death What can be said of those like meIt should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great supernormal powerHow by comparison with those of great understandingThe first of the two chief disciples Did so excel in wisdoms artThat save the Helper of the World No being is worth his sixteenth partBut though so great was Sāriputtas Understanding facultyHe fell into deaths power too What can be said of those like meIt should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great understandingHow by comparison with PaccekabuddhasEven those who by the strength of their own knowledge and energy crushed all the enemy defilements and reached enlightenment for themselves who stood alone like the horn of the rhinoceros  who were selfperfected were still not free from death So how should I be free from itTo help them in their search for truth The Sages various signs employedTheir knowledge brought them selfperfection Their cankers were at length destroyedLike the rhinoceross horn They lived alone in constancyBut death they could no way evade What can be said of those like meIt should be recollected in this way by comparison with PaccekabuddhasHow by comparison with fully enlightened BuddhasEven the Blessed One whose material body was embellished with the eighty lesser details and adorned with the thirtytwo marks of a great man  whose Dhamma body brought to perfection the treasured qualities of the aggregates of virtue etc made pure in every aspect who overpassed greatness of fame greatness of merit greatness of strength greatness of supernormal power and greatness of understanding who had no equal who was the equal of those without equal without double accomplished and fully enlightenedeven he was suddenly quenched by the downpour of deaths rain as a great mass of fire is quenched by the downpour of a rain of waterAnd so the Greatest Sage possessed Such mighty power in every wayAnd it was not through fear or guilt That over him Death held his swayNo being not even one without Guilt or pusillanimity But will be smitten downso how I Will he not conquer those like meIt should be recollected in this way by comparison with fully enlightened Buddhas When he does his recollecting in this way by comparing himself with others possessed of such great fame etc in the light of the universality of death thinking Death will come to me even as it did to those distinguished beings then his meditation subject reaches accessThis is how death should be recollected by comparison As to the sharing of the body with many this body is shared by manyFirstly it is shared by the eighty families of worms There too creatures live in dependence on the outer skin feeding on the outer skin creatures live in dependence on the inner skin feeding on the inner skin creatures live in dependence on the flesh feeding on the flesh creatures live in dependence on the sinews feeding on the sinews creatures live in dependence on the bones feeding on the bones and creatures live in dependence on the marrow feeding on the marrowAnd there they are born grow old and die evacuate and make waterand the body is their maternity home their hospital their charnelground their privy and their urinalThe body can also be brought to death with the upsetting of these wormsAnd just as it is shared with the eighty families of worms so too it is shared by the several hundred internal diseases as well as by such external causes of death as snakes scorpions and what notAnd just as when a target is set up at a crossroads and then arrows spears pikes stones etc come from all directions and fall upon it so too all kinds of accidents befall the bodyand it also comes to death through these accidents befalling itHence the Blessed One said Here bhikkhus when day is departing and night is drawing on a bhikkhu considers thus In many ways I can risk death A snake may bite me or a scorpion may sting me or a centipede may sting me I might die of that and that would set me back Or I might stumble and fall or the food I have eaten might disagree with me or my bile might get upset or my phlegm might get upset and sever my joints as it were like knives I might die of that and that would set me back That is how death should be recollected as to sharing the body with many As to the frailty of life this life is impotent and frailFor the life of beings is bound up with breathing it is bound up with the postures it is bound up with cold and heat it is bound up with the primary elements and it is bound up with nutriment Life occurs only when the inbreaths and outbreaths occur evenlyBut when the wind in the nostrils that has gone outside does not go in again or when that which has gone inside does not come out again then a man is reckoned to be deadAnd it occurs only when the four postures are found occurring evenlyBut with the prevailing of anyone of them the life process is interruptedAnd it occurs only when cold and heat are found occurring evenlyBut it fails when a man is overcome by excessive cold or heatAnd it occurs only when the four primary elements are found occurring evenlyBut with the disturbance of the earth element even a strong mans life can be terminated if his body becomes rigid or with the disturbance of one of the elements beginning with water if his body becomes flaccid and petrified with a flux of the bowels etc or if he is consumed by a bad fever or if he suffers a severing of his limbjoint ligatures And life occurs only in one who gets physical nutriment at the proper time but if he gets none he uses his life upThis is how death should be recollected as to the frailty of life As signless as indefinable The meaning is that it is unpredictableFor in the case of all beingsThe span the sickness and the time and where The body will be laid the destinyThe living world can never know these things There is no sign foretells when they will beHerein firstly the span has no sign because there is no definition such as Just so much must be lived no more than thatFor beings die in the various stages of the embryo namely at the time of the kalala of the abbuda of the pesi of the ghana at one month gone two months gone three months gone four months gone five months gone  ten months goneand on the occasion of coming out of the wombAnd after that they die this side or the other of the centuryAnd the sickness has no sign because there is no definition such as Beings die only of this sickness not of any otherFor beings die of eye disease or of any one among those beginning with ear disease And the time has no sign because there is no definition such as One has to die only at this time not at any otherFor beings die in the morning and at any of the other times such as noon And where the body will be laid down has no sign because there is no definition such as When people die they must drop their bodies only here not anywhere elseFor the person of those born inside a village is dropped outside the villageand that of those born outside the village is dropped inside itLikewise that of those born in water is dropped on land and that of those born on land in water And this can be multiplied in many ways And the destiny has no sign because there is no definition such as One who dies there must be reborn hereFor there are some who die in a divine world and are reborn in the human world and there are some who die in the human world and are reborn in a divine world and so on And in this way the world goes round and round the five kinds of destinies like an ox harnessed to a machine This is how death should be recollected as signless As to the limitedness of the extent the extent of human life is short nowOne who lives long lives a hundred years more or lessHence the Blessed One said Bhikkhus this human life span is short There is a new life to be gone to there are profitable deeds to be done there is the life of purity to be led There is no not dying for the bornHe who lives long lives a hundred years more or less The life of humankind is short A wise man holds it in contemptAnd acts as one whose head is burning Death will never fail to come And he said further Bhikkhus there was once a teacher called Araka   all of which sutta should be given in full adorned as it is with seven similes And he said further Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live a night and day that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by meand when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live a day that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me                          and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by methese are called bhikkhus who dwell in negligence and slackly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction of cankers And bhikkhus when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live for as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by meand when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live as long as it takes to breathe in and breathe out or as long as it takes to breathe out and breathe in that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by methese are called bhikkhus who dwell in diligence and keenly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction of cankers So short in fact is the extent of life that it is not certain even for as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls As to the shortness of the moment in the ultimate sense the lifemoment of living beings is extremely short being only as much as the occurrence of a single conscious momentJust as a chariot wheel when it is rolling rolls that is touches the ground only on one point of the circumference of its tire and when it is at rest rests only on one point so too the life of living beings lasts only for a single conscious momentWhen that consciousness has ceased the being is said to have ceasedaccording as it is said In a past conscious moment he did live not he does live not he will liveIn a future conscious moment not he did live not he does live he will liveIn the present conscious moment not he did live he does live not he will liveLife person pleasure painjust these aloneJoin in one conscious moment that flicks byCeased aggregates of those dead or aliveAre all alike gone never to returnNo world is born if consciousness is not Produced when that is present then it livesWhen consciousness dissolves the world is dead The highest sense this concept will allow This is how death should be recollected as to the shortness of the momentSo while he does his recollecting by means of one or other of these eight ways his consciousness acquires the support of repetition owing to the reiterated attention mindfulness settles down with death as its object the hindrances are suppressed and the jhāna factors make their appearanceBut since the object is stated with individual essences and since it awakens a sense of urgency the jhāna does not reach absorption and is only accessNow with special development the supramundane jhāna and the second and the fourth immaterial jhānas reach absorption even with respect to states with individual essencesFor the supramundane reaches absorption by means of progressive development of the purificationand the immaterial jhānas do so by means of development consisting in the surmounting of the objectsince there in those two immaterial jhānas there is merely the surmounting of the object of jhāna that had already reached absorptionBut here in mundane mindfulness of death there is neitherso the jhāna only reaches accessAnd that access is known as mindfulness of death too since it arises through its means A bhikkhu devoted to mindfulness of death is constantly diligent He acquires perception of disenchantment with all kinds of becoming  He conquers attachment to life He condemns evil He avoids much storing He has no stain of avarice about requisites Perception of impermanence grows in him following upon which there appear the perceptions of pain and notselfBut while beings who have not developed mindfulness of death fall victims to fear horror and confusion at the time of death as though suddenly seized by wild beasts spirits snakes robbers or murderers he dies undeluded and fearless without falling into any such stateAnd if he does not attain the deathless here and now he is at least headed for a happy destiny on the breakup of the bodyNow when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely beThis recollection about death Blessed with such mighty potencyThis is the section dealing with the recollection of death in the detailed explanation Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject which is never promulgated except after an Enlightened Ones arising and is outside the province of any sectarians It has been commended by the Blessed One in various ways in different suttas thus Bhikkhus when one thing is developed and repeatedly practiced it leads to a supreme sense of urgency to supreme benefitto supreme surcease of bondageto supreme mindfulness and full awarenessto acquisition of knowledge and visionto a happy life here and nowto realization of the fruit of clear vision and deliveranceWhat is that one thingIt is mindfulness occupied with the body And thus Bhikkhus they savour the deathless who savour mindfulness occupied with the bodythey do not savour the deathless who do not savour mindfulness occupied with the bodyThey have savoured the deathless who have savoured mindfulness occupied with the body they have not savoured  They have neglected  they have not neglected  They have missed  they have found the deathless who have found mindfulness occupied with the body  And it has been described in fourteen sections in the passage beginning And how developed bhikkhus how repeatedly practiced is mindfulness occupied with the body of great fruit of great benefitHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu gone to the forest   that is to say the sections on breathing on postures on the four kinds of full awareness on attention directed to repulsiveness on attention directed to elements and on the nine charnelground contemplationsHerein the three that is to say the sections on postures on the four kinds of full awareness  and on attention directed to elements as they are stated in that sutta deal with insightThen the nine sections on the charnel ground contemplations as stated there deal with that particular phase of insight knowledge called contemplation of dangerAnd any development of concentration in the bloated etc that might be implied there has already been explained in the Description of Foulness So there are only the two that is the sections on breathing and on directing attention to repulsiveness that as stated there deal with concentrationOf these two the section on breathing is a separate meditation subject namely mindfulness of breathingWhat is intended here as mindfulness occupied with the body is the thirty two aspects This meditation subject is taught as the direction of attention to repulsiveness thus Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and contained in the skin as full of many kinds of filth thus In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidney heart liver midriff spleen lungs bowels entrails gorge dung bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urine  the brain being included in the bone marrow in this version with a total of only thirtyone aspectsHere is the description of the development introduced by a commentary on the textThis body this filthy body constructed out of the four primary elementsUp from the soles of the feet from the soles of the feet upwardsDown from the top of the hair from the highest part of the hair downwardsContained in the skin terminated all round by the skinReviews  as full of many kinds of filth he sees that this body is packed with the filth of various kinds beginning with head hairsHowIn this body there are head hairs  urine  Herein there are means there are foundIn this in this which is expressed thus Up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and contained in the skin as full of many kinds of filth Body the carcassfor it is the carcass that is called body because it is a conglomeration of filth because such vile things as the head hairs etc and the hundred diseases beginning with eye disease have it as their origin Head hairs body hairs these things beginning with head hairs are the thirty two aspectsThe construction here should be understood in this way In this body there are head hairs in this body there are body hairs No one who searches throughout the whole of this fathomlong carcass starting upwards from the soles of the feet starting downwards from the top of the head and starting from the skin all round ever finds even the minutest atom at all beautiful in it such as a pearl or a gem or beryl or aloes or saffron or camphor or talcum powder on the contrary he finds nothing but the various very malodorous offensive drablooking sorts of filth consisting of the head hairs body hairs and the restHence it is said In this body there are head hairs body hairs  urine This is the commentary on the wordconstruction hereNow a clansman who as a beginner wants to develop this meditation subject should go to a good friend of the kind already described and learn itAnd the teacher who expounds it to him should tell him the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving attentionHerein the sevenfold skill in learning should be told thus as verbal recitation as mental recitation as to colour as to shape as to direction as to location as to delimitation This meditation subject consists in giving attention to repulsiveness Even if one is master of the Tipiṭaka the verbal recitation should still be done at the time of first giving it attentionFor the meditation subject only becomes evident to some through recitation as it did to the two elders who learned the meditation subject from the Elder Mahā Deva of the Hill Country On being asked for the meditation subject it seems the elder gave the text of the thirtytwo aspects saying Do only this recitation for four months Although they were familiar respectively with two and three Piṭakas it was only at the end of four months of recitation of the meditation subject that they became streamenterers with right apprehension of the textSo the teacher who expounds the meditation subject should tell the pupil to do the recitation verbally firstNow when he does the recitation he should divide it up into the skin pentad etc and do it forwards and backwardsAfter saying Head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin he should repeat it backwards Skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs Next to that with the kidney pentad after saying Flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidney he should repeat it backwards Kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs Next with the lungs pentad after saying Heart liver midriff spleen lungs he should repeat it backwards Lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs Next with the brain pentad after saying Bowels entrails gorge dung brain he should repeat it backwards Brain dung gorge entrails bowels lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs Next with the fat sextad after saying Bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat he should repeat it backwards Fat sweat blood pus phlegm bile brain dung gorge entrails bowels lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs Next with the urine sextad after saying Tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints urine he should repeat it backwards Urine oil of the joints snot spittle grease tears fat sweat blood pus phlegm bile brain dung gorge entrails bowels lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs  The recitation should be done verbally in this way a hundred times a thousand times even a hundred thousand timesFor it is through verbal recitation that the meditation subject becomes familiar and the mind being thus prevented from running here and therethe parts become evident and seem like the fingers of a pair of clasped hands like a row of fence posts The mental recitation should be done just as it is done verballyFor the verbal recitation is a condition for the mental recitationand the mental recitation is a condition for the penetration of the characteristic of foulness As to colour the colour of the head hairs etc should be defined As to shape their shape should be defined too As to direction in this body upwards from the navel is the upward direction and downwards from it is the downward direction So the direction should be defined thus This part is in this direction  As to location the location of this or that part should be defined thus This part is established in this location  As to delimitation there are two kinds of delimitation that is delimitation of the similar and delimitation of the dissimilarHerein delimitation of the similar should be understood in this way This part is delimited above and below and around by this Delimitation of the dissimilar should be understood as nonintermixedness in this way Head hairs are not body hairs and body hairs are not head hairs When the teacher tells the skill in learning in seven ways thus he should do so knowing that in certain suttas this meditation subject is expounded from the point of view of repulsiveness and in certain suttas from the point of view of elementsFor in the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta it is expounded only as repulsivenessIn the Mahā Hatthipadopama Sutta  in the Mahā Rāhulovāda Sutta  and the Dhātuvibhaṅga  it is expounded as elementsIn the Kāyagatāsati Sutta  however four jhānas are expounded with reference to one to whom it has appeared as a colour kasiṇa Herein it is an insight meditation subject that is expounded as elementsand a serenity meditation subject that is expounded as repulsivenessConsequently it is only the serenity meditation subject that is relevant hereHaving thus told the sevenfold skill in learning he should tell the tenfold skill in giving attention as follows as to following the order not too quickly not too slowly as to warding off distraction as to surmounting the concept as to successive leaving as to absorption  as to the three suttantas Herein as to following the order from the time of beginning the recitation attention should be given following the serial order without skippingFor just as when someone who has no skill climbs a thirtytworung ladder using every other step his body gets exhausted and he falls without completing the climb so too one who gives it attention skipping parts becomes exhausted in his mind and does not complete the development since he fails to get the satisfaction that ought to be got with successful development Also when he gives attention to it following the serial order he should do so not too quicklyFor just as when a man sets out on a threeleague journey even if he has already done the journey out and back a hundred times rapidly without taking note of turnings to be taken and avoided though he may finish his journey he still has to ask how to get there so too when the meditator gives his attention to the meditation subject too quickly though he may reach the end of the meditation subject it still does not become clear or bring about any distinction So he should not give his attention to it too quickly And as not too quickly so also not too slowlyFor just as when a man wants to do a threeleague journey in one day if he loiters on the way among trees rocks pools etc he does not finish the journey in a day and needs two or three to complete it so too if the meditator gives his attention to the meditation subject too slowly he does not get to the end and it does not become a condition for distinction As to warding off distraction he must ward off temptation to drop the meditation subject and to let his mind get distracted among the variety of external objectsFor if not just as when a man has entered on a onefootwide cliff path if he looks about here and there without watching his step he may miss his footing and fall down the cliff which is perhaps as high as a hundred men so too when there is outward distraction the meditation subject gets neglected and deterioratesSo he should give his attention to it warding off distraction As to surmounting the concept this name concept beginning with head hairs body hairs must be surmounted and consciousness established on the aspect repulsive For just as when men find a water hole in a forest in a time of drought they hang up some kind of signal there such as a palm leaf and people come to bathe and drink guided by the signal body hairsbut when the way has become plain with their continual traffic there is no further need of the signal and they go to bathe and drink there whenever they want so too when repulsiveness becomes evident to him as he is giving his attention to the meditation subject through the means of the name concept head hairshe must surmount the concept head hairs body hairs and establish consciousness on only the actual repulsiveness As to successive leaving in giving his attention he should eventually leave out any parts that do not appear to himFor when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs his attention then carries on till it arrives at the last part that is urine and stops thereand when he gives his attention to urine his attention then carries on till it arrives back at the first part that is head hairs and stops thereAs he persists in giving his attention thus some parts appear to him and others do notThen he should work on those that have appeared till one out of any two appears the clearerHe should arouse absorption by again and again giving attention to the one that has appeared thusHere is a simile Suppose a hunter wanted to catch a monkey that lived in a grove of thirtytwo palms and he shot an arrow through a leaf of the palm that stood at the beginning and gave a shout then the monkey went leaping successively from palm to palm till it reached the last palm and when the hunter went there too and did as before it came back in like manner to the first palm and being followed thus again and again after leaping from each place where a shout was given it eventually jumped on to one palm and firmly seizing the palm shoots leaf spike in the middle would not leap any more even when shotso it is with thisThe application of the simile is this The thirtytwo parts of the body are like the thirtytwo palms in the groveThe monkey is like the mindThe meditator is like the hunterThe range of the meditators mind in the body with its thirtytwo parts as object is like the monkeys inhabiting the palm grove of thirtytwo palmsThe settling down of the meditators mind in the last part after going successively from part to part when he began by giving his attention to head hairs is like the monkeys leaping from palm to palm and going to the last palm when the hunter shot an arrow through the leaf of the palm where it was and gave a shoutLikewise in the return to the beginningHis doing the preliminary work on those parts that have appeared leaving behind those that did not appear while as he gave his attention to them again and again some appeared to him and some did not is like the monkeys being followed and leaping up from each place where a shout is givenThe meditators repeated attention given to the part that in the end appears the more clearly of any two that have appeared to him and his finally reaching absorption is like the monkeys eventually stopping in one palm firmly seizing the palm shoots leaf spike in the middle and not leaping up even when shot There is another simile too Suppose an almsfoodeater bhikkhu went to live near a village of thirtytwo families and when he got two lots of alms at the first house he left out one house beyond itand next day when he got three lots of alms at the first house he left out two houses beyond itand on the third day he got his bowl full at the first house and went to the sitting hall and ateso it is with thisThe thirtytwo aspects are like the village with the thirtytwo familiesThe meditator is like the almsfood eaterThe meditators preliminary work is like the almsfood eaters going to live near the villageThe meditators continuing to give attention after leaving out those parts that do not appear and doing his preliminary work on the pair of parts that do appear is like the almsfood eaters getting two lots of alms at the first house and leaving out one house beyond it and like his next day getting three lots of alms at the first house and leaving out two houses beyond itThe arousing of absorption by giving attention again and again to that which has appeared the more clearly of two is like the almsfood eaters getting his bowl full at the first house on the third day and then going to the sitting hall and eating As to absorption as to absorption part by part The intention here is this it should be understood that absorption is brought about in each one of the parts  As to the three suttantas the intention here is this it should be understood that the three suttantas namely those on higher consciousness on coolness and on skill in the enlightenment factors have as their purpose the linking of energy with concentration HereinBhikkhus there are three signs that should be given attention from time to time by a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousnessThe sign of concentration should be given attention from time to timethe sign of exertion should be given attention from time to timethe sign of equanimity should be given attention from time to timeIf a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention only to the sign of concentration then his consciousness may conduce to idlenessIf a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention only to the sign of exertion then his consciousness may conduce to agitationIf a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention only to the sign of equanimity then his consciousness may not become rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankersBut bhikkhus when a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention from time to time to the sign of concentration  to the sign of exertion  to the sign of equanimity then his consciousness becomes malleable wieldy and bright it is not brittle and becomes rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankersBhikkhus just as a skilled goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice prepares his furnace and heats it up and puts crude gold into it with tongs and he blows on it from time to time sprinkles water on it from time to time and looks on at it from time to timeand if the goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice only blew on the crude gold it would burn andif he only sprinkled water on it it would cool downand if he only looked on at it it would not get rightly refinedbut when the goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice blows on the crude gold from time to time sprinkles water on it from time to time and looks on at it from time to time then it becomes malleable wieldy and bright it is not brittle and it submits rightly to being wroughtwhatever kind of ornament he wants to work it into whether a chain or a ring or a necklace or a gold fillet it serves his purposeSo too bhikkhus there are three signs that should be given attention from time to time by a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness  becomes rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers He attains the ability to be a witness through realization by directknowledge of any state realizable by directknowledge to which he inclines his mind whenever there is occasion  this sutta should be understood to deal with higher consciousness Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu possesses six things he is able to realize the supreme coolnessWhat sixHere bhikkhus when consciousness should be restrained he restrains itwhen consciousness should be exerted he exerts itwhen consciousness should be encouraged he encourages itwhen consciousness should be looked on at with equanimity he looks on at it with equanimityHe is resolute on the superior state to be attained he delights in NibbānaPossessing these six things a bhikkhu is able to realize the supreme coolness  this sutta deals with coolness Skill in the enlightenment factors has already been dealt with in the explanation of skill in absorption in the passage beginning Bhikkhus when the mind is slack that is not the time for developing the tranquillity enlightenment factor  So the meditator should make sure that he has apprehended this sevenfold skill in learning well and has properly defined this tenfold skill in giving attention thus learning the meditation subject properly with both kinds of skillIf it is convenient for him to live in the same monastery as the teacher then he need not get it explained in detail thus to begin with but as he applies himself to the meditation subject after he has made quite sure about it he can have each successive stage explained as he reaches each distinctionOne who wants to live elsewhere however must get it explained to him in detail in the way already given and he must turn it over and over getting all the difficulties solved He should leave an abode of an unsuitable kind as described in the Description of the Earth Kasiṇa and go to live in a suitable one Then he should sever the minor impediments and set about the preliminary work for giving attention to repulsiveness When he sets about it he should first apprehend the learning sign in head hairsHowThe colour should be defined first by plucking out one or two head hairs and placing them on the palm of the hand He can also look at them in the haircutting placeor in a bowl of water or rice gruelIf the ones he sees are black when he sees them they should be brought to mind as blackif white as whiteif mixed they should be brought to mind in accordance with those most prevalentAnd as in the case of head hairs so too the sign should be apprehended visually with the whole of the skin pentad Having apprehended the sign thus and defined all the other parts of the body by colour shape direction location and delimitation  he should then define repulsiveness in five ways that is by colour shape odour habitat and locationHere is the explanation of all the parts given in successive orderHead Hairs Firstly head hairs are black in their normal colour the colour of fresh ariṭṭhaka seedsAs to shape they are the shape of long round measuring rodsAs to direction they lie in the upper directionAs to location it is bounded on both sides by the roots of the ears in front by the forehead and behind by the nape of the necktheir location is the wet inner skin that envelops the skull As to delimitation they are bounded below by the surface of their own roots which are fixed by entering to the amount of the tip of a rice grain into the inner skin that envelops the head They are bounded above by space and all round by each other There are no two hairs together This is their delimitation by the similarHead hairs are not body hairs and body hairs are not head hairs being likewise not intermixed with the remaining thirtyone parts the head hairs are a separate part This is their delimitation by the dissimilarSuch is the definition of head hairs as to colour and so on Their definition as to repulsiveness in the five ways that is by colour etc is as followsHead hairs are repulsive in colouras well as in shape odour habitat and locationFor on seeing the colour of a head hair in a bowl of inviting rice gruel or cooked rice people are disgusted and say This has got hairs in it Take it away So they are repulsive in colourAlso when people are eating at night they are likewise disgusted by the mere sensation of a hairshaped akkabark or makaci bark fibreSo they are repulsive in shape And the odour of head hairs unless dressed with a smearing of oil scented with flowers etc is most offensiveAnd it is still worse when they are put in the fireEven if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour and shape still their odour is directly repulsiveJust as a babys excrement as to its colour is the colour of turmeric and as to its shape is the shape of a piece of turmeric rootand just as the bloated carcass of a black dog thrown on a rubbish heap as to its colour is the colour of a ripe palmyra fruit andas to its shape is the shape of a mandolinshaped drum left face down and its fangs are like jasmine buds and so even if both these are not directly repulsive in colour and shape still their odour is directly repulsiveso too even if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour and shape still their odour is directly repulsive But just as pot herbs that grow on village sewage in a filthy place are disgusting to civilized people and unusable so also head hairs are disgusting since they grow on the sewage of pus blood urine dung bile phlegm and the like This is the repulsive aspect of the habitatAnd these head hairs grow on the heap of the other thirtyone parts as fungi do on a dunghillAnd owing to the filthy place they grow in they are quite as unappetizing as vegetables growing on a charnelground on a midden etc as lotuses or water lilies growing in drains and so on This is the repulsive aspect of their locationAnd as in the case of head hairs so also the repulsiveness of all the parts should be defined in the same five ways by colour shape odour habitat and locationAll however must be defined individually by colour shape direction location and delimitation as followsBody Hairs Herein firstly as to natural colour body hairs are not pure black like head hairs but blackish brownAs to shape they are the shape of palm roots with the tips bent downAs to direction they lie in the two directionsAs to location except for the locations where the head hairs are established and for the palms of the hands and soles of the feet they grow in most of the rest of the inner skin that envelops the bodyAs to delimitation they are bounded below by the surface of their own roots which are fixed by entering to the extent of a likhā into the inner skin that envelops the body above by space and all round by each other There are no two body hairs together This is the delimitation by the similarBut their delimitation by the dissimilar is like that for the head hairsNails Nails is the name for the twenty nail platesThey are all white as to colourAs to shape they are the shape of fish scalesAs to direction the toenails are in the lower direction the fingernails are in the upper direction So they grow in the two directionsAs to location they are fixed on the tips of the backs of the fingers and toesAs to delimitation they are bounded in the two directions by the flesh of the ends of the fingers and toes and inside by the flesh of the backs of the fingers and toes and externally and at the end by space and all round by each other There are no two nails together Teeth There are thirtytwo tooth bones in one whose teeth are completeThey are white in colourAs to shape they are of various shapesfor firstly in the lower row the four middle teeth are the shape of pumpkin seeds set in a row in a lump of claythat on each side of them has one root and one point and is the shape of a jasmine budeach one after that has two roots and two points and is the shape of a wagon propthen two each side with three roots and three pointsthen two each side fourrooted and fourpointedLikewise in the upper rowAs to direction they lie in the upper directionAs to location they are fixed in the jawbonesAs to delimitation they are bounded by the surface of their own roots which are fixed in the jawbones they are bounded above by space and all round by each other There are no two teeth together Skin The inner skin envelops the whole bodyOutside it is what is called the outer cuticle which is black brown or yellow in colour and when that from the whole of the body is compressed together it amounts to only as much as a jujubefruit kernelBut as to colour the skin itself is whiteand its whiteness becomes evident when the outer cuticle is destroyed by contact with the flame of a fire or the impact of a blow and so onAs to shape it is the shape of the bodyin briefBut in detail the skin of the toes is the shape of silkworms cocoonsthe skin of the back of the foot is the shape of shoes with uppersthe skin of the calf is the shape of a palm leaf

collar for the throatthe skin of the face is the shape of an insects nest full of holesthe skin of the head is the shape of a bowl bagThe meditator who is discerning the skin should first define the inner skin that covers the face working his knowledge over the face beginning with the upper lipNext the inner skin of the frontal boneNext he should define the inner skin of the head separating as it were the inner skins connection with the bone by inserting his knowledge in between the cranium bone and the inner skin of the head as he might his hand in between the bag and the bowl put in the bagNext the inner skin of the shouldersNext the inner skin of the right arm forwards and backwardsand then in the same way the inner skin of the left armNext after defining the inner skin of the back he should define the inner skin of the right leg forwards and backwardsthen the inner skin of the left leg in the same wayNext the inner skin of the groin the paunch the bosom and the neck should be successively definedThen after defining the inner skin of the lower jaw next after that of the neck he should finish on arriving at the lower lipWhen he discerns it in the gross in this way it becomes evident to him more subtly tooAs to direction it lies in both directionsAs to location it covers the whole bodyAs to delimitation it is bounded below by its fixed surface and above by space Flesh There are nine hundred pieces of fleshAs to colour it is all red like kiṃsuka flowersAs to shape the flesh of the calves is the shape of cooked rice in a palm leaf bagThe flesh of the thighs is the shape of a rolling pinThe flesh of the buttocks is the shape of the end of an ovenThe flesh of the back is the shape of a slab of palm sugarThe flesh between each two ribs is the shape of clay mortar squeezed thin in a flattened openingThe flesh of the breast is the shape of a lump of clay made into a ball and flung downThe flesh of the two upper arms is the shape of a large skinned rat and twice the sizeWhen he discerns it grossly in this way it becomes evident to him subtly tooAs to direction it lies in both directionsAs to location it is plastered over the three hundred and odd bonesAs to delimitation it is bounded below by its surface which is fixed on to the collection of bones and above by the skin and all round each by each other piece Sinews There are nine hundred sinewsAs to colour all the sinews are whiteAs to shape they have various shapesFor five of great sinews that bind the body together start out from the upper part of the neck and descend by the frontand five more by the backand then five by the rightand five by the leftAnd of those that bind the right hand five descend by the front of the handand five by the backlikewise those that bind the left handAnd of those that bind the right foot five descend by the front and five by the backlikewise those that bind the left footSo there are sixty great sinews called body supporters which descend from the neck and bind the body togetherand they are also called tendonsThey are all the shape of yam shootsBut there are others scattered over various parts of the bodywhich are finer than the lastnamed They are the shape of strings and cordsThere are others still finer the shape of creepers Others still finer are the shape of large lute stringsYet others are the shape of coarse threadThe sinews in the backs of the hands and feet are the shape of a birds clawThe sinews in the head are the shape of childrens head netsThe sinews in the back are the shape of a wet net spread out in the sunThe rest of the sinews following the various limbs are the shape of a net jacket fitted to the bodyAs to direction they lie in the two directionsAs to location they are to be found binding the bones of the whole body togetherAs to delimitation they are bounded below by their surface which is fixed on to the three hundred bones and above by the portions that are in contact with the flesh and the inner skin and all round by each other Bones Excepting the thirtytwo teeth bones these consist of the remaining sixty four hand bones sixtyfour foot bones sixtyfour soft bones dependent on the flesh two heel bones then in each leg two ankle bones two shin bones one knee bone and one thigh bone then two hip bones eighteen spine bones twenty four rib bones fourteen breast bones one heart bone  two collar bones two

the shin bonesthe shin bones on the ankle bonesthe ankle bones on the bones of the back of the footAs to delimitation they are bounded inside by the bone marrow above by the flesh at the ends and at the roots by each other Bone Marrow This is the marrow inside the various bonesAs to colour it is whiteAs to shape that inside each large bone is the shape of a large cane shoot moistened and inserted into a bamboo tubeThat inside each small bone is the shape of a slender cane shoot moistened and inserted in a section of bamboo twigAs to direction it lies in both directionsAs to location it is set

is still only a budInside it there is a hollow the size of a punnāga seeds bed where half a pasata measure of blood is kept with which as their support the mind element and mindconsciousness element occur That in one of greedy temperament is red that in one of hating temperament is black that in one of deluded temperament is like water that meat has been washed in that in one of speculative

marionettestrings do the marionettes wooden limbs at the time of the marionettes being pulled alongAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to entrails Gorge This is what has been eaten drunk chewed and tasted and is present in the stomachAs to colour it is the colour of swallowed foodAs to shape it is the shape of rice loosely tied in a cloth strainerAs to direction it is in the upper directionAs to location it is in the stomach What is called the stomach is a part of the bowelmembrane which is like the swelling of air produced in the middle of a length of wet cloth when it is being twisted and wrung out from the two ends It is smooth outside Inside it is like a balloon of cloth soiled by wrapping up meat refuse or it can be said to be like the inside of the skin of a rotten jack fruit It is the place where worms dwell seething in tangles the thirtytwo families of worms such as round worms boilproducing worms palmsplinter worms needlemouthed worms tape worms thread worms and the rest When there is no food and drink etc present they leap up shrieking and pounce upon the hearts flesh and when food and drink etc are swallowed they wait with uplifted mouths and scramble to snatch the first two or three lumps swallowed It is these worms maternity home privy hospital and charnel groundJust as when it has rained heavily in a time of drought and what has been carried by the water into the cesspit at the gate of an outcaste villagethe various kinds of ordure such as urine excrement bits of hide and bones and sinews as well as spittle snot blood etcgets mixed up with the mud and water already collected there and after two or three days the families of worms appear and it ferments warmed by the energy of the suns heat frothing and bubbling on the top quite black in colour and so utterly stinking and loathsome that one can scarcely go near it or look at it much less smell or taste it so too the stomach is where the assortment of food drink etc falls after being pounded up by the tongue and stuck together with spittle and saliva losing at that moment its virtues of colour smell taste etc and taking on the appearance of weavers paste and dogs vomit then to get soused in the bile and phlegm and wind that have collected there where it ferments with the energy of the stomachfires heat seethes with the families of worms frothing and bubbling on the top till it turns into utterly stinking nauseating muckeven to hear about which takes away any appetite for food drink etc let alone to see it with the eye of understandingAnd when the food drink etc fall into it they get divided into five parts the worms eat one part the stomachfire bums up another part another part becomes urine another part becomes excrement and one part is turned into nourishment and sustains the blood flesh and so on As to delimitation it is bounded by the stomach lining and by what appertains to gorge Dung This is excrementAs to colour it is mostly the colour of eaten foodAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it is in the lower directionAs to location it is to be found in the receptacle for digested food  The receptacle for digested food is the lowest part at the end of the bowel between the navel and the root of the spine It measures eight fingerbreadths in height and resembles a bamboo tube Just as when rain water falls on a higher level it runs down to fill a lower level and stays there so too the receptacle for digested food is where any food drink etc that have fallen into the receptacle for undigested food have been continuously cooked and simmered by the stomachfire and have got as soft as though ground up on a stone run down to through the cavities of the bowels and it is pressed down there till it becomes impacted like brown clay pushed into a bamboo joint and there it staysAs to delimitation it is bounded by the receptacle for digested food and by what appertains to dung Brain This is the lumps of marrow to be found inside the skullAs to colour it is white the colour of the flesh of a toadstoolit can also be said that it is the colour of turned milk that has not yet become curdAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to the upper directionAs to location it is to be found inside the skull like four lumps of dough put together to correspond with the skulls four sutured sectionsAs to delimitation it is bounded by the skulls inner surface and by what appertains to brain Bile There are two kinds of bile local bile and free bileHerein as to colour the local bile is the colour of thick madhuka oilthe free bile is the colour of faded ākulī flowersAs to shape both are the shape of their locationAs to direction the local bile belongs to the upper direction the other belongs to both directionsAs to location the free bile spreads like a drop of oil on water all over the body except for the fleshless parts of the head hairs body hairs teeth nails and the hard dry skin When it is disturbed the eyes become yellow and twitch and there is shivering and itching of the bodyThe local bile is situated near the flesh of the liver between the heart and the lungs It is to be found in the bile container  which is like a large kosātakī gourd pip When it is disturbed beings go crazy and become demented they throw off conscience and shame and do the undoable speak the unspeakable and think the unthinkable As to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to bile Phlegm The phlegm is inside the body and it measures a bowlfulAs to colour it is white the colour of the juice of nāgabalā leavesAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to the upper directionAs to location it is to be found on the stomachs surfaceJust as duckweed and green scum on the surface of water divide when a stick or a potsherd is dropped into the water and then spread together again so too at the time of eating and drinking etc when the food drink etc fall into the stomach the phlegm divides and then spreads together again And if it gets weak the stomach becomes utterly disgusting with a smell of ordure like a ripe boil or a rotten hens egg and then the belchings and the mouth reek with a stench like rotting ordure rising from the stomachso that the man has to be told Go away your breath smells But when it grows plentiful it holds the stench of ordure beneath the surface of the stomach acting like the wooden lid of a privyAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to phlegm Pus Pus is produced by decaying bloodAs to colour it is the colour of bleached leavesbut in a dead body it is the colour of stale thickened gruelAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to both directionsAs to location however there is no fixed location for pus where it could be found stored up Wherever blood stagnates and goes bad in some part of the body damaged by wounds with stumps and thorns by burns with fire etc or where boils carbuncles etc appear it can be found thereAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to pus Blood There are two kinds of blood stored blood and mobile bloodHerein as to colour stored blood is the colour of cooked and thickened lac solutionmobile blood is the colour of clear lac solutionAs to shape both are the shape of their locationsAs to direction the stored blood belongs to the upper directionthe other belongs to both directionsAs to location except for the fleshless parts of the head hairs body hairs teeth nails and the hard dry skin the mobile blood permeates the whole of the clungto body by following the network of veinsThe stored blood fills the lower part of the livers site to the extent of a bowlful and by its splashing little by little over the heart kidney and lungs it keeps the kidney heart liver and lungs moistFor it is when it fails to moisten the kidney heart etc that beings become thirstyAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to blood Sweat This is the water element that trickles from the pores of the body hairs and so onAs to colour it is the colour of clear sesame oilAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to both directionsAs to location there is no fixed location for sweat where it could always be found like bloodBut if the body is heated by the heat of a fire by the suns heat by a change of temperature etc then it trickles from all the pore openings of the head hairs and body hairs as water does from a bunch of unevenly cut lilybud stems and lotus stalks pulled up from the water So its shape should also be understood to correspond to the poreopenings of the head hairs and body hairsAnd the meditator who discerns sweat should only give his attention to it as it is to be found filling the poreopenings of the head hairs and body hairsAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to sweat Fat This is a thick unguentAs to colour it is the colour of sliced turmericAs to shape firstly in the body of a stout man it is the shape of turmericcoloured dukūla rags placed between the inner skin and the fleshIn the body of a lean man it is the shape of turmericcoloured dukūla rags placed in two or three thicknesses on the shank flesh thigh flesh back flesh near the spine and bellycovering fleshAs to direction it belongs to both directionsAs to location it permeates the whole of a stout mans body it is to be found on a lean mans shank flesh and so on And though it was described as unguent above still it is neither used as oil on the head nor as oil for the nose etc because of its utter disgustingnessAs to delimitation it is bounded below by the flesh above by the inner skin and all round by what appertains to fat Tears These are the water element that trickles from the eyeAs to colour they are the colour of clear sesame oilAs to shape they are the shape of their locationAs to direction they belong to the upper directionAs to location they are to be found in the eye socketsBut they are not stored in the eye sockets all the while as the bile is in the bile containerBut when beings feel joy and laugh uproariously or feel grief and weep and lament or eat particular kinds of wrong food or when their eyes are affected by smoke dust dirt etcthen being originated by the joy grief wrong food or temperature they fill up the eye sockets or trickle outAnd the meditator who discerns tears should discern them only as they are to be found filling the eye socketsAs to delimitation they are bounded by what appertains to tears Grease This is a melted unguentAs to colour it is the colour of coconut oilAlso it can be said to be the colour of oil sprinkled on gruelAs to shape it is a film the shape of a drop of unguent spread out over still water at the time of bathingAs to direction it belongs to both directionsAs to location it is to be found mostly on the palms of the hands backs of the hands soles of the feet backs of the feet tip of the nose forehead and points of the shouldersAnd it is not always to be found in the melted state in these locationsbut when these parts get hot with the heat of a fire the suns heat upset of temperature or upset of elements then it spreads here and there in those places like the film from the drop of unguent on the still water at the time of bathingAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to grease Spittle This is water element mixed with froth inside the mouthAs to colour it is white the colour of the frothAs to shape it is the shape of its locationor it can be called the shape of frothAs to direction it belongs to the upper directionAs to location it is to be found on the tongue after it has descended from the cheeks on both sides And it is not always to be found stored therebut when beings see particular kinds of food or remember them or put something hot or bitter or sharp or salty or sour into their mouths or when their hearts are faint or nausea arises on some account then spittle appears and runs down from the cheeks on both sides to settle on the tongueIt is thin at the tip of the tongue and thick at the root of the tongue It is capable without getting used up of wetting unhusked rice or husked rice or anything else chewable that is put into the mouth like the water in a pit scooped out in a river sand bankAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to spittle Snot This is impurity that trickles out from the brainAs to colour it is the colour of a young palmyra kernelAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to the upper directionAs to location it is to be found filling the nostril cavitiesAnd it is not always to be found stored there but rather just as though a man tied up curd in a lotus leaf which he then pricked with a thorn underneath and whey oozed out and dripped so too when beings weep or suffer a disturbance of elements produced by wrong food or temperature then the brain inside the head turns into stale phlegm and it oozes out and comes down by an opening in the palate and it fills the nostrils and stays there or trickles outAnd the meditator who discerns snot should discern it only as it is to be found filling the nostril cavitiesAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to snot Oil of the Joints This is the slimy ordure inside the joints in the bodyAs to colour it is the colour of kaṇikāra gumAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to both directionsAs to location it is to be found inside the hundred and eighty joints serving the function of lubricating the bones jointsIf it is weak when a man gets up or sits down moves forward or backward bends or stretches then his bones creak and he goes about making a noise like the snapping of fingersand when he has walked only one or two leagues distance his air element gets upset and his limbs pain himBut if a man has plenty of it his bones do not creak when he gets up sits down etc and even when he has walked a long distance his air element does not get upset and his limbs do not pain himAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to oil of the joints Urine This is the urine solutionAs to colour it is the colour of bean brineAs to shape it is the shape of water inside a water pot placed upside downAs to direction it belongs to the lower directionAs to location it is to be found inside the bladderFor the bladder sack is called the bladderJust as when a porous pot with no mouth is put into a cesspool then the solution from the cesspool gets into the porous pot with no mouth even though no way of entry is evident so too while the urinary secretion from the body enters the bladder its way of entry is not evident Its way of exit however is evidentAnd when the bladder is full of urine beings feel the need to make waterAs to delimitation it is delimited by the inside of the bladder and by what is similar to urine This is the delimitation by the similarBut its delimitation by the dissimilar is like that for the head hairs The Arising of Absorption When the meditator has defined the parts beginning with the head hairs in this way by colour shape direction location and delimitation  and he gives his attention in the ways beginning with following the order not too quickly to their repulsiveness in the five aspects of colour shape smell habitat and location  then at last he surmounts the concept  Then just as when a man with good sight is observing a garland of flowers of thirty two colours knotted on a single string and all the flowers become evident to him simultaneously so too when the meditator observes this body thus There are in this body head hairs then all these things become evident to him as it were simultaneouslyHence it was said above in the explanation of skill in giving attention For when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs his attention carries on till it arrives at the last part that is urine and stops there  If he applies his attention externally as well when all the parts have become evident in this way then human beings animals etc as they go about are divested of their aspect of beings and appear as just assemblages of parts And when drink food etc is being swallowed by them it appears as though it were being put in among the assemblage of parts Then as he gives his attention to them again and again as Repulsive repulsive employing the process of successive leaving etc  eventually absorption arises in himHerein the appearance of the head hairs etc as to colour shape direction location and delimitation is the learning signtheir appearance as repulsive in all aspects is the counterpart signAs he cultivates and develops that counterpart sign absorption arises in him but only of the first jhāna in the same way as described under foulness as a meditation subject And it arises singly in one to whom only one part has become evident or who has reached absorption in one part and makes no further effort about another But several first jhānas according to the number of parts are produced in one to whom several parts have become evident or who has reached jhāna in one and also makes further effort about another As in the case of the Elder MallakaThe elder it seems took the Elder Abhaya the Dīgha reciter by the hand and after saying Friend Abhaya first learn this matter he went on The Elder Mallaka is an obtainer of thirtytwo jhānas in the thirtytwo partsIf he enters upon one by night and one by day he goes on entering upon them for over a fortnight but if he enters upon one each day he goes on entering upon them for over a month And although this meditation is successful in this way with the first jhāna it is nevertheless called mindfulness occupied with the body because it is successful through the influence of the mindfulness of the colour shape and so on And the bhikkhu who is devoted to this mindfulness occupied with the body is a conqueror of boredom and delight and boredom does not conquer him he dwells transcending boredom as it arisesHe is a conqueror of fear and dread and fear and dread do not conquer him he dwells transcending fear and dread as they ariseHe is one who bears cold and heat  who endures  arisen bodily feelings that are  menacing to life he becomes an obtainer of the four jhānas based on the colour aspect of the head hairs etcand he comes to penetrate the six kinds of directknowledge So let a man if he is wise Untiringly devote his daysTo mindfulness of body which Rewards him in so many waysThis is the section dealing with mindfulness occupied with the body in the detailed treatiseIt has been recommended by the Blessed One thus And bhikkhus this concentration through mindfulness of breathing when developed and practiced much is both peaceful and sublime it is an unadulterated blissful abiding and it banishes at once and stills evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as they arise It has been described by the Blessed One as having sixteen bases thus And how developed bhikkhus how practiced much is concentration through mindfulness of breathing both peaceful and sublime an unadulterated blissful abiding banishing at once and stilling evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as they ariseHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect established mindfulness in front of him ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he knows I breathe in long or breathing out long he knows I breathe out long Breathing in short he knows I breathe in short or breathing out short he knows I breathe out short He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole bodyhe trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formationhe trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing happiness he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing happiness  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing bliss he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing bliss  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formation he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the mental formation  He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the mental formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the mental formation   He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the manner of consciousness  He trains thus I shall breathe in gladdening the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out gladdening the manner of consciousness  He trains thus I shall breathe in concentrating the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out concentrating the manner of consciousness  He trains thus I shall breathe in liberating the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out liberating the manner of consciousness   He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating impermanence he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating impermanence  He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating fading away he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating fading away  He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating cessation he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating cessation He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating relinquishmenthe trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment  The description of development is complete in all respectshowever only if it is given in due course after a commentary on the textSo it is given here introduced by a commentary on the first part of the textAnd how developed bhikkhus how practiced much is concentration through mindfulness of breathing here in the first place how is a question showing desire to explain in detail the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing in its various formsDeveloped bhikkhus  is concentration through mindfulness of breathing this shows the thing that is being asked about out of desire to explain it in its various formsHow practiced much  as soon as they arise here too the same explanation applies Herein developed means aroused or increasedconcentration through mindfulness of breathing is either concentration associated with mindfulness that discerns breathingor it is concentration on mindfulness of breathingPracticed much practiced again and again Both peaceful and sublime  it is peaceful in both ways and sublime in both waysthe two words should each be understood as governed by the word both What is meantUnlike foulness which as a meditation subject is peaceful and sublime only by penetration but is neither peaceful nor sublime in its object since its object in the learning stage is gross and after that its object is repulsivenessunlike that this is not unpeaceful or unsublime in any way but on the contrary it is peaceful stilled and quiet both on account of the peacefulness of its object and on account of the peacefulness of that one of its factors called penetrationAnd it is sublime something one cannot have enough of both on account of the sublimeness of its object and on account of the sublimeness of the aforesaid factorHence it is called both peaceful and sublime It is an unadulterated blissful abiding it has no adulteration thus it is unadulterated it is unalloyed unmixed particular specialHere it is not a question of peacefulness to be reached through preliminary work as with the kasiṇas or through access as with foulness for instanceIt is peaceful and sublime in its own individual essence too starting with the very first attention given to itBut some say that it is unadulterated because it is unalloyed possessed of nutritive value and sweet in its individual essence tooSo it should be understood to be unadulterated and a blissful abiding since it leads to the obtaining of bodily and mental bliss with every moment of absorption As soon as they arise whenever they are not suppressedEvil badUnprofitable thoughts thoughts produced by unskilfulness It banishes at once it banishes suppresses at that very momentStills  it thoroughly calms or else when eventually brought to fulfilment by the noble path it cuts off because of partaking of penetration it tranquilizes is what is meant In brief however the meaning here is thisBhikkhus in what way in what manner by what system is concentration through mindfulness of breathing developed in what way is it practiced much that it is both peaceful  as soon as they arise He now said Here bhikkhus etc giving the meaning of that in detailHerein here bhikkhus a bhikkhu means bhikkhus in this dispensation a bhikkhuFor this word here signifies the Buddhas dispensation as the prerequisite for a person to produce concentration through mindfulness of breathing in all its modes and it denies that such a state exists in any other dispensationFor this is said Bhikkhus only here is there an ascetic here a second ascetic here a third ascetic here a fourth ascetic other dispensations are devoid of ascetics That is why it was said above in this dispensation a bhikkhu Gone to the forest  or to an empty place this signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathingFor this bhikkhus mind has long been dissipated among visible data etc as its object and it does not want to mount the object of concentration throughmindfulnessofbreathing it runs off the track like a chariot harnessed to a wild oxNow suppose a cowherd wanted to tame a wild calf that had been reared on a wild cows milk he would take it away from the cow and tie it up apart with a rope to a stout post dug into the ground then the calf might dash to and fro but being unable to get away it would eventually sit down or lie down by the post So too when a bhikkhu wants to tame his own mind which has long been spoilt by being reared on visible data etc as object for its food and drink he should take it away from visible data etc as object and bring it into the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place and tie it up there to the post of inbreaths and outbreaths with the rope of mindfulnessAnd so his mind may then dash to and fro when it no longer gets the objects it was formerly used to but being unable to break the rope of mindfulness and get away it sits down lies down by that object under the influence of access and absorptionHence the Ancients said Just as a man who tames a calf Would tie it to a post so hereShould his own mind by mindfulness Be firmly to the object tiedThis is how an abode is favourable to his developmentHence it was said above This signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing Or alternatively this mindfulness of breathing as a meditation subject which is foremost among the various meditation subjects of all Buddhas some Paccekabuddhas and some Buddhas disciples as a basis for attaining distinction and abiding in bliss here and nowis not easy to develop without leaving the neighbourhood of villages which resound with the noises of women men elephants horses etc noise being a thorn to jhāna whereas in the forest away from a village a meditator can at his ease set about discerning this meditation subject and achieve the fourth jhāna in mindfulness of breathing and then by making that same jhāna the basis for comprehension of formations with insight  he can reach Arahantship the highest fruitThat is why the Blessed One said gone to the forest etc in pointing out a favourable abode for him For the Blessed One is like a master of the art of building sites  As the master of the art of building sites surveys the proposed site for a town thoroughly examines it and then gives his directions Build the town here and when the town is safely finished he receives great honour from the royal family so the Blessed One examines an abode as to its suitability for the meditator and he directs Devote yourself to the meditation subject here and later on when the meditator has devoted himself to the meditation subject and has reached Arahantship and says The Blessed One is indeed fully enlightened the Blessed One receives great honour And this bhikkhu is compared to a leopardFor just as a great leopard king lurks in a grass wilderness or a jungle wilderness or a rock wilderness in the forest and seizes wild beaststhe wild buffalo wild ox boar etcso too the bhikkhu who devotes himself to his meditation subject in the forest etc should be understood to seize successively the paths of streamentry oncereturn nonreturn and Arahantship and the noble fruitions as wellHence the Ancients saidFor as the leopard by his lurking in the forest seizes beastsSo also will this Buddhas son with insight gifted strenuousBy his retreating to the forest seize the highest fruit of all So the Blessed One said gone to the forest etc to point out a forest abode as a place likely to hasten his advancement Herein gone to the forest is gone to any kind of forest possessing the bliss of seclusion among the kinds of forests characterized thus Having gone out beyond the boundary post all that is forest  and A forest abode is five hundred bow lengths distant To the root of a tree gone to the vicinity of a treeTo an empty place gone to an empty secluded spaceAnd here he can be said to have gone to an empty place if he has gone to any of the remaining seven kinds of abode  Having thus indicated an abode that is suitable to the three seasons suitable to humour and temperament and favourable to the development of mindfulness of breathing he then said sits down etc indicating a posture that is peaceful and tends neither to idleness nor to agitationThen he said having folded his legs crosswise etc to show firmness in the sitting position easy occurrence of the inbreaths and outbreaths and the means for discerning the object Herein crosswise is the sitting position with the thighs fully lockedFolded having lockedSet his body erect having placed the upper part of the body erectwith the eighteen backbones resting end to endFor when he is seated like this his skin flesh and sinews are not twistedand so the feelings that would arise moment by moment if they were twisted do not ariseThat being so his mind becomes unified and the meditation subject instead of collapsing attains to growth and increase Established mindfulness in front of him  having placed mindfulness facing the meditation subject Or alternatively the meaning can be treated here too according to the method of explanation given in the Paṭisambhidā which is this Pari has the sense of control mukhaṃ has the sense of outlet sati has the sense of establishment that is why parimukhaṃ satiṃ is said The meaning of it in brief is Having made mindfulness the outlet from opposition forgetfulness being thereby controlled Ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out having seated himself thus having established mindfulness thus the bhikkhu does not abandon that mindfulness ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out he is a mindful worker is what is meant Now breathing in long etc is said in order to show the different ways in which he is a mindful workerFor in the Paṭisambhidā in the exposition of the clause Ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out this is saidHe is a mindful worker in thirtytwo ways when he knows unification of mind and nondistraction by means of a long inbreath mindfulness is established in himowing to that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker When he knows unification of mind and nondistraction by means of a long outbreath  by means of breathing in contemplating relinquishment  When he knows unification of mind and nondistraction by means of breathing out contemplating relinquishment mindfulness is established in himowing to that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker  Herein breathing in long is producing a long inbreathAssāsa is the wind issuing outpassāsa is the wind entering in is said in the Vinaya CommentaryBut in the Suttanta Commentaries it is given in the opposite senseHerein when any infant comes out from the mothers womb first the wind from within goes outand subsequently the wind from without enters in with fine dust strikes the palate and is extinguished with the infants sneezingThis firstly is how assāsa and passāsa should be understood But their length and shortness should be understood by extent For just as water or sand that occupies an extent of space is called a long water a long sand a short water a short sand so in the case of elephants and snakes bodies the inbreaths and outbreaths regarded as particles slowly fill the long extent in other words their persons and slowly go out againThat is why they are called longThey rapidly fill a short extent in other words the person of a dog a hare etc and rapidly go out again That is why they are called short  And in the case of human beings some breathe in and breathe out long by extent of time as elephants snakes etc dowhile others breathe in and breathe out short in that way as dogs hares etc do Of these therefore the breaths that travel over a long extent in entering in and going out are to be understood as long in time and the breaths that travel over a little extent in entering in and going out as short in time Now this bhikkhu knows I breathe in I breathe out long while breathing in and breathing out long in nine waysAnd the development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body should be understood to be perfected in one aspect in him who knows thusaccording as it is said in the Paṭisambhidā How breathing in long does he know I breathe in longbreathing out long does he know I breathe out long He breathes in a long inbreath reckoned as an extent He breathes out a long outbreath reckoned as an extent He breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths reckoned as an extentAs he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths reckoned as an extent zeal arises Through zeal he breathes in a long inbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent Through zeal he breathes out a long outbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent Through zeal he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extentAs through zeal he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent gladness arises Through gladness he breathes in a long inbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent Through gladness he breathes out a long outbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent Through gladness he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extentAs through gladness he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent his mind turns away from the long in breaths and outbreaths and equanimity is establishedLong inbreaths and outbreaths in these nine ways are a bodyThe establishment is mindfulnessThe contemplation is knowledgeThe body is the establishment  but it is not the mindfulnessMindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulnessBy means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that bodyThat is why development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said  The same method of explanation applies also in the case of short breathsBut there is this difference While in the former case a long inbreath reckoned as an extent is said here a short inbreath reckoned as a little duration is givenSo it must be construed as short as far as the phrase That is why development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said  So it should be understood that it is when this bhikkhu knows inbreaths and outbreaths in these nine ways as a long extent and as a little duration that breathing in long he knows I breathe in long  breathing out short he knows I breathe out short is said of himAnd when he knows thusThe long kind and the short as wellThe inbreath and the outbreath tooSuch then are the four kinds that happenAt the bhikkhus nose tip here He trains thus I shall breathe in  I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body he trains thus I shall breathe in making known making plain the beginning middle and end of the entire inbreath bodyI shall breathe out making known making plain the beginning middle and end of the entire out breath body thus he trainsMaking them known making them plain in this way he both breathes in and breathes out with consciousness associated with knowledgeThat is why it is said He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out  To one bhikkhu the beginning of the inbreath body or the outbreath body distributed in particles that is to say regarded as successive arisings is plain but not the middle or the end he is only able to discern the beginning and has difficulty with the middle and the endTo another the middle is plain not the beginning or the end he is only able to discern the middle and has difficulty with the beginning and the endTo another the end is plain not the beginning or the middlehe is only able to discern the end and has difficulty with the beginning and the middleTo yet another all stages are plain he is able to discern them all and has no difficulty with any of them Pointing out that one should be like the lastmentioned bhikkhu he said He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out experiencing the whole body  Herein he trains he strives he endeavours in this wayOr else the restraint here in one such as this is training in the higher virtuehis consciousness is training in the higher consciousnessand his understanding is training in the higher understanding  So he trains in repeats develops repeatedly practices these three kinds of training on that object by means of that mindfulness by means of that attention This is how the meaning should be regarded here Herein in the first part of the system he should only breathe in and breathe out and not do anything else at all and it is only afterwards that he should apply himself to the arousing of knowledge and so onConsequently the present tense is used here in the text He knows I breathe in  he knows I breathe outBut the future tense in the passage beginning I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body should be understood as used in order to show that the aspect of arousing knowledge etc has to be undertaken from then on He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe in shall breathe out tranquilizing completely tranquilizing stopping stilling the gross bodily formation And here both the gross and subtle state and also progressive tranquilizing should be understoodFor previously at the time when the bhikkhu has still not discerned the meditation subject his body and his mind are disturbed and so they are grossAnd while the grossness of the body and the mind has still not subsided the inbreaths and outbreaths are gross They get stronger his nostrils become inadequate and he keeps breathing in and out through his mouthBut they become quiet and still when his body and mind have been discernedWhen they are still then the inbreaths and outbreaths occur so subtly that he has to investigate whether they exist or not Suppose a man stands still after running or descending from a hill or putting down a big load from his head then his inbreaths and outbreaths are gross his nostrils become inadequate and he keeps on breathing in and out through his mouthBut when he has rid himself of his fatigue and has bathed and drunk and put a wet cloth on his heart and is lying in the cool shade then his inbreaths and outbreaths eventually occur so subtly that he has to investigate whether they exist or not so too previously at the time when the bhikkhu has still not discerned  he has to investigate whether they exist or not Why is thatBecause previously at the time when he has still not discerned there is no concern in him no reaction no attention no reviewing to the effect that I am progressively tranquilizing each grosser bodily formation  But when he has discerned there isSo his bodily formation at the time when he has discerned is subtle in comparison with that at the time when he has notHence the Ancients saidThe mind and body are disturbed And then in excess it occursBut when the body is undisturbed Then it with subtlety occursIn discerning the meditation subject the formation is gross and it is subtle by comparison in the firstjhāna accessalso it is gross in that and subtle by comparison in the first jhānain the first jhāna and secondjhāna access it is gross and in the second jhāna subtlein the second jhāna and thirdjhāna access it is gross and in the third jhāna subtlein the third jhāna and fourthjhāna access it is gross and in the fourth jhāna it is so exceedingly subtle that it even reaches cessationThis is the opinion of the Dīgha and Saṃyutta recitersBut the Majjhima reciters have it that it is subtler in each access than in the jhāna below too in this way In the first jhāna it is gross and in the secondjhāna access it is subtle by comparison and so onIt is however the opinion of all that the bodily formation occurring before the time of discerning becomes tranquilized at the time of discerningand the bodily formation at the time of discerning becomes tranquilized in the firstjhāna access  and the bodily formation occurring in the fourthjhāna access becomes tranquilized in the fourth jhānaThis is the method of explanation in the case of serenity But in the case of insight the bodily formation occurring at the time of not discerning is gross and in discerning the primary elements it is by comparison subtlethat also is gross and in discerning derived materiality it is subtlethat also is gross and in discerning all materiality it is subtlethat also is gross and in discerning the immaterial it is subtlethat also is gross and in discerning the material and immaterial it is subtlethat also is gross and in discerning conditions it is subtlethat also is gross and in seeing mentalitymateriality with its conditions it is subtlethat also is gross and in insight that has the characteristics of impermanence etc as its object it is subtlethat also is gross in weak insight while in strong insight it is subtleHerein the tranquilizing should be understood as the relative tranquillity of the subsequent compared with the previousThus should the gross and subtle state and the progressive tranquilizing be understood here But the meaning of this is given in the Paṭisambhidā together with the objection and clarification thusHow is it that he trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formationWhat are the bodily formationsLong in breaths  outbreaths experiencing the whole body belong to the body these things being bound up with the body are bodily formationshe trains in tranquilizing stopping stilling those bodily formations When there are such bodily formations whereby there is bending backwards sideways in all directions and forwards and perturbation vacillation moving and shaking of the body he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formationWhen there are such bodily formations whereby there is no bending backwards sideways in all directions and forwards and no perturbation vacillation moving and shaking of the body quietly subtly he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation Objection So then he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formationhe trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formationthat being so there is no production of awareness of windand there is no production of inbreaths and outbreathsand there is no production of mindfulness of breathing and there is no production of concentration through mindfulness of breathing and consequently the wise neither enter into nor emerge from that attainment Clarification So then he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formationthat being so there is production of awareness of wind and there is production of inbreaths and outbreaths and there is production of mindfulness of breathing and there is production of concentration through mindfulness of breathing and consequently the wise enter into and emerge from that attainment Like whatJust as when a gong is struckAt first gross sounds occur and consciousness occurs because the sign of the gross sounds is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the gross sounds have ceased then afterwards faint sounds occurand consciousness occurs because the sign of the faint sounds is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the faint sounds have ceased then afterwards consciousness occurs because it has the sign of the faint sounds as its objectso too at first gross inbreaths and outbreaths occur and consciousness does not become distractedbecause the sign of the gross inbreaths and outbreaths is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the gross inbreaths and outbreaths have ceased then afterwards faint inbreaths and outbreaths occur and consciousness does not become distractedbecause the sign of the faint inbreaths and outbreaths is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the faint inbreaths and outbreaths have ceased then afterwards consciousness does not become distracted because it has the sign of the faint inbreaths and outbreaths as its objectThat being so there is production of awareness of wind and there is production of inbreaths and outbreaths and there is production of mindfulness of breathing and there is production of concentration through mindfulness of breathing and consequently the wise enter into and emerge from that attainment Inbreaths and outbreaths tranquilizing the bodily formation are a body The establishment is mindfulness The contemplation is knowledge The body is the establishment  but it is not the mindfulness Mindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that bodyThat is why development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said This in the first place is the consecutive word commentary here on the first tetrad which deals with contemplation of the body The first tetrad is set forth as a meditation subject for a beginnerbut the other three tetrads are respectively set forth as the contemplations of feeling of the manner of consciousness and of mental objects for one who has already attained jhāna in this tetradSo if a clansman who is a beginner wants to develop this meditation subject and through insight based on the fourth jhāna produced in breathing to reach Arahantship together with the discriminations he should first do all the work connected with the purification of virtue etc in the way already described after which he should learn the meditation subject in five stages from a teacher of the kind already described Here are the five stages learning questioning establishing absorption characteristicHerein learning is learning the meditation subjectQuestioning is questioning about the meditation subjectEstablishing is establishing the meditation subjectAbsorption is the absorption of the meditation subjectCharacteristic is the characteristic of the meditation subjectwhat is meant is that it is the ascertaining of the meditation subjects individual essence thus This meditation subject has such a characteristic  Learning the meditation subject in the five stages in this way he neither tires himself nor worries the teacherSo in giving this meditation subject consisting in mindfulness of breathing attention he can live either with the teacher or elsewhere in an abode of the kind already described learning the meditation subject in the five stages thus getting a little expounded at a time and taking a long time over reciting it He should sever the minor impediments After finishing the work connected with the meal and getting rid of any dizziness due to the meal he should seat himself comfortably Then making sure he is not confused about even a single word of what he has learned from the teacher he should cheer his mind by recollecting the special qualities of the Three Jewels Here are the stages in giving attention to it counting connection touching fixing observing turning away purification and looking back on theseHerein counting is just countingconnection is carrying ontouching is the place touched by the breathsfixing is absorptionobserving is insightturning away is the pathpurification is fruitionlooking back on these is reviewing Herein this clansman who is a beginner should first give attention to this meditation subject by countingAnd when counting he should not stop short of fiveor go beyond tenor make any break in the seriesBy stopping short of five his thoughts get excited in the cramped space like a herd of cattle shut in a cramped penBy going beyond ten his thoughts take the number rather than the breaths for their supportBy making a break in the series he wonders if the meditation subject has reached completion or notSo he should do his counting without those faults When counting he should at first do it slowly that is late as a grain measurer doesFor a grain measurer having filled his measure says One and empties itand then refilling it he goes on saying One one while removing any rubbish he may have noticedAnd the same with Two two and so onSo taking the inbreath or the outbreath whichever appears most plainly he should begin with One one and count up to Ten ten noting each as it occurs As he does his counting in this way the inbreaths and outbreaths become evident to him as they enter in and issue outThen he can leave off counting slowly  like a grain measurer and he can count quickly that is early as a cowherd doesFor a skilled cowherd takes pebbles in his pocket and goes to the cow pen in the morning whip in hand sitting on the bar of the gate prodding the cows in the back he counts each one as it reaches the gate saying One two dropping a pebble for eachAnd the cows of the herd which have been spending the three watches of the night uncomfortably in the cramped space come out quickly in parties jostling each other as they escapeSo he counts quickly Three four five and so up to ten In this way the inbreaths and outbreaths which had already become evident to him while he counted them in the former way now keep moving along quickly Then knowing that they keep moving along quickly not apprehending them either inside or outside the body but apprehending them just as they reach the nostril doorhe can do his counting quickly  One two three four five one two three four five six  seven  eight  nine  tenFor as long as the meditation subject is connected with counting it is with the help of that very counting that the mind becomes unified just as a boat in a swift current is steadied with the help of a rudder When he counts quickly the meditation subject becomes apparent to him as an uninterrupted processThen knowing that it is proceeding uninterruptedly he can count quickly in the way just described not discerning the wind either inside or outside the bodyFor by bringing his consciousness inside along with the incoming breath it seems as if it were buffeted by the wind inside or filled with fatBy taking his consciousness outside along with the outgoing breath it gets distracted by the multiplicity of objects outsideHowever his development is successful when he fixes his mindfulness on the place touched by the breathsThat is why it was said above He can count quickly in the way just described not discerning the wind either inside or outside  But how long is he to go on countingUntil without counting mindfulness remains settled on the inbreaths and outbreaths as its objectFor counting is simply a device for setting mindfulness on the inbreaths and out breaths as object by cutting off the external dissipation of applied thoughts Having given attention to it in this way by counting he should now do so by connectionConnection is the uninterrupted following of the inbreaths and outbreaths with mindfulness after counting has been given upAnd that is not by following after the beginning the middle and the end The navel is the beginning of the wind issuing out the heart is its middle and the nosetip is its endThe nosetip is the beginning of the wind entering in the heart is its middle and the navel is its endAnd if he follows after that his mind is distracted by disquiet and perturbationaccording as it is saidWhen he goes in with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of the in breath his mind being distracted internally both his body and his mind are disquieted and perturbed and shakyWhen he goes out with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of the outbreath his mind being distracted externally both his body and his mind are disquieted and perturbed and shaky  So when he gives his attention to it by connection he should do so not by the beginning middle and endbut rather by touching and by fixing There is no attention to be given to it by touching separate from fixing as there is by counting separate from connectionBut when he is counting the breaths in the place touched by each he is giving attention to them by counting and touchingWhen he has given up counting and is connecting them by means of mindfulness in that same place and fixing consciousness by means of absorption then he is said to be giving his attention to them by connection touching and fixingAnd the meaning of this may be understood through the similes of the man who cannot walk and the gatekeeper given in the commentaries and through the simile of the saw given in the Paṭisambhidā Here is the simile of the man who cannot walk Just as a man unable to walk who is rocking a swing for the amusement of his children and their mother sits at the foot of the swing post and sees both ends and the middle of the swing plank successively coming and going yet does not move from his place in order to see both ends and the middle so too when a bhikkhu places himself with mindfulness as it were at the foot of the post for anchoring mindfulness and rocks the swing of the inbreaths and outbreaths he sits down with mindfulness on the sign at that same place and follows with mindfulness the beginning middle and end of the inbreaths and outbreaths at the place touched by them as they come and go keeping his mind fixed there he then sees them without moving from his place in order to see them This is the simile of the man who cannot walk This is the simile of the gatekeeper Just as a gatekeeper does not examine people inside and outside the town asking Who are you Where have you come from Where are you going What have you got in your handfor those people are not his concernbut he does examine each man as he arrives at the gate so too the incoming breaths that have gone inside and the outgoing breaths that have gone outside are not this bhikkhus concern but they are his concern each time they arrive at the nostril gate itself Then the simile of the saw should be understood from its beginningFor this is saidSign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousnessBy one who knows not these three things Development is not obtainedSign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousnessBy one who does know these three things Development can be obtained  How is it that these three things are not the object of a single consciousness that they are nevertheless not unknown that the mind does not become distracted that he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effectSuppose there were a tree trunk placed on a level piece of ground and a man cut it with a sawThe mans mindfulness is established by the saws teeth where they touch the tree trunk without his giving attention to the saws teeth as they approach and recede though they are not unknown to him as they do so and he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effectAs the tree trunk placed on the level piece of ground so the sign for the anchoring of mindfulnessAs the saws teeth so the inbreaths and outbreathsAs the mans mindfulness established by the saws teeth where they touch the tree trunk without his giving attention to the saws teeth as they approach and recede though they are not unknown to him as they do so and so he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect so too the bhikkhu sits having established mindfulness at the nose tip or on the upper lip without giving attention to the inbreaths and outbreaths as they approach and recede though they are not unknown to him as they do so and he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effectEffort what is the effortThe body and the mind of one who is energetic become wieldythis is the effortWhat is the taskImperfections come to be abandoned in one who is energetic and his applied thoughts are stilledthis is the taskWhat is the effectFetters come to be abandoned in one who is energetic and his inherent tendencies come to be done away withthis is the effectSo these three things are not the object of a single consciousness and they are nevertheless not unknown and the mind does not become distracted and he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effectWhose mindfulness of breathing in And out is perfect well developedAnd gradually brought to growth According as the Buddha taughtTis he illuminates the world Just like the full moon free from cloudThis is the simile of the sawBut here it is precisely his not giving attention to the breaths as yet to come and already gone that should be understood as the purpose When someone gives his attention to this meditation subject sometimes it is not long before the sign arises in him and then the fixing in other words absorption adorned with the rest of the jhāna factors is achieved After someone has given his attention to counting both body and mind become light as though the body would leap up into the airJust as when a body that is disturbed sits down on a bed or chair the bed or chair sags down and creaks and the cover gets rumpledbut when a body that is not disturbed sits down the bed or chair neither sags down nor creaks the cover does not get rumpled and it is as though filled with cotton woolwhybecause a body that is not disturbed is lightso too after he has given his attention to counting when the bodily disturbance has been stilled by the gradual cessation of gross inbreaths and outbreaths then both the body and the mind become light the physical body is as though it were ready to leap up into the air When his gross inbreaths and out breaths have ceased his consciousness occurs with the sign of the subtle inbreaths and outbreaths as its objectAnd when that has ceased it goes on occurring with the successively subtler signs as its objectHow Suppose a man stuck a bronze bell with a big iron bar and at once a loud sound arose his consciousness would occur with the gross sound as its objectthen when the gross sound had ceased it would occur afterwards with the sign of the subtle sound as its object and when that had ceased it would go on occurring with the sign of the successively subtler sounds as its object This is how it should be understoodAnd this is given in detail in the passage beginning Just as when a metal gong is struck For while other meditation subjects become clearer at each higher stage this one does notin fact as he goes on developing it it becomes more subtle for him at each higher stage and it even comes to the point at which it is no longer manifest However when it becomes unmanifest in this way the bhikkhu should not get up from his seat shake out his leather mat and go awayWhat should be doneHe should not get up with the idea Shall I ask the teacher  or Is my meditation subject lostfor by going away and so disturbing his posture the meditation subject has to be started anewSo he should go on sitting as he was and temporarily substitute the place normally touched for the actual breaths as the object of contemplation These are the means for doing it The bhikkhu should recognize the unmanifest state of the meditation subject and consider thus Where do these inbreaths and outbreaths exist Where do they notIn whom do they exist In whom notThen as he considers thus he finds that they do not exist in one inside the mothers womb or in those drowned in water or likewise in unconscious beings or in the dead or in those attained to the fourth jhāna or in those born into a finematerial or immaterial existence or in those attained to cessation of perception and feeling So he should apostrophize himself thus You with all your wisdom are certainly not inside a mothers womb or drowned in water or in the unconscious existence or dead or attained to the fourth jhāna or born into the finematerial or immaterial existence or attained to cessationThose inbreaths and outbreath are actually existent in you only you are not able to discern them because your understanding is dullThen fixing his mind on the place normally touched by the breaths he should proceed to give his attention to that These inbreaths and outbreaths occur striking the tip of the nose in a longnosed manand the upper lip in a shortnosed manSo he should fix the sign thus This is the place where they strikeThis was why the Blessed One said Bhikkhus I do not say of one who is forgetful who is not fully aware that he practices development of mindfulness of breathing  Although any meditation subject no matter what is successful only in one who is mindful and fully awareyet any meditation subject other than this one gets more evident as he goes on giving it his attentionBut this mindfulness of breathing is difficult difficult to develop a field in which only the minds of Buddhas Paccekabuddhas and Buddhas sons are at home It is no trivial matter nor can it be cultivated by trivial personsIn proportion as continued attention is given to it it becomes more peaceful and more subtleSo strong mindfulness and understanding are necessary here Just as when doing needlework on a piece of fine cloth a fine needle is neededand a still finer instrument for boring the needles eye so too when developing this meditation subject which resembles fine cloth both the mindfulness which is the counterpart of the needle and the understanding associated with it which is the counterpart of the instrument for boring the needles eye need to be strongA bhikkhu must have the necessary mindfulness and understanding and must look for the inbreaths and outbreaths nowhere else than the place normally touched by themSuppose a ploughman after doing some ploughing sent his oxen free to graze and sat down to rest in the shade then his oxen would soon go into the forestNow a skilled ploughman who wants to catch them and yoke them again does not wander through the forest following their tracks but rather he takes his rope and goad and goes straight to the drinking place where they meet and he sits or lies there Then after the oxen have wandered about for a part of the day they come to the drinking place where they meet and they bathe and drink and when he sees that they have come out and are standing about he secures them with the rope and prodding them with the goad he brings them back yokes them and goes on with his ploughing So too the bhikkhu should not look for the inbreaths and out breaths anywhere else than the place normally touched by themAnd he should take the rope of mindfulness and the goad of understanding and fixing his mind on the place normally touched by them he should go on giving his attention to thatFor as he gives his attention in this way they reappear after no long time as the oxen did at the drinking place where they metSo he can secure them with the rope of mindfulness and yoking them in that same place and prodding them with the goad of understanding he can keep on applying himself to the meditation subject When he does so in this way the sign soon appears to himBut it is not the same for allon the contrary some say that when it appears it does so to certain people producing a light touch like cotton or silkcotton or a draught But this is the exposition given in the commentaries It appears to some like a star or a cluster of gems or a cluster of pearls to others with a rough touch like that of silkcotton seeds or a peg made of heartwood to others like a long braid string or a wreath of flowers or a puff of smoke to others like a stretchedout cobweb or a film of cloud or a lotus flower or a chariot wheel or the moons disk or the suns disk In fact this resembles an occasion when a number of bhikkhus are sitting together reciting a suttanta When a bhikkhu asks What does this sutta appear like to you one says It appears to me like a great mountain torrentanother To me it is like a line of forest treesanother To me it is like a spreading fruit tree giving cool shadeFor the one sutta appears to them differently because of the difference in their perceptionSimilarly this single meditation subject appears differently because of difference in perceptionIt is born of perception its source is perception it is produced by perceptionTherefore it should be understood that when it appears differently it is because of difference in perception And here the consciousness that has inbreath as its object is one the consciousness that has outbreath as its object is another and the consciousness that has the sign as its object is anotherFor the meditation subject reaches neither absorption nor even access in one who has not got these three things clearBut it reaches access and also absorption in one who has got these three things clearFor this is saidSign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousnessBy one who knows not these three things Development is not obtainedSign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousnessBy one who does know these three things Development can be obtained  And when the sign has appeared in this way the bhikkhu should go to the teacher and tell him Venerable sir such and such has appeared to meBut say the Dīgha reciters the teacher should say neither This is the sign nor This is not the signafter saying It happens like this friend he should tell him Go on giving it attention again and againfor if he were told It is the sign he might become complacent and stop short at that and if he were told It is not the sign he might get discouraged and give upso he should encourage him to keep giving it his attention without saying eitherSo the Dīgha reciters say firstlyBut the Majjhima reciters say that he should be told This is the sign friend Well done Keep giving attention to it again and again  Then he should fix his mind on that same signand so from now on his development proceeds by way of fixingFor the Ancients said thisFixing his mind upon the sign And putting away extraneous aspectsThe clever man anchors his mind Upon the breathings in and out  So as soon as the sign appears his hindrances are suppressed his defilements subsidehis mindfulness is establishedand his consciousness is concentrated in access concentration Then he should not give attention to the sign as to its colour or review it as to its specific characteristicHe should guard it as carefully as a kings chief queen guards the child in her womb due to become a Wheelturning Monarch or as a farmer guards the ripening crops and he should avoid the seven unsuitable things beginning with the unsuitable abode and cultivate the seven suitable thingsThen guarding it thus he should make it grow and improve with repeated attention and he should practice the tenfold skill in absorption and bring about evenness of energy  As he strives thus fourfold and fivefold jhāna is achieved by him on that same sign in the same way as described under the earth kasiṇa However when a bhikkhu has achieved the fourfold and fivefold jhāna and wants to reach purity by developing the meditation subject through observing and through turning away he should make that jhāna familiar by attaining mastery in it in the five ways  and then embark upon insight by defining mentalitymaterialityHow On emerging from the attainment he sees that the inbreaths and outbreaths have the physical body and the mind as their originand that just as when a blacksmiths bellows are being blown the wind moves owing to the bag and to the mans appropriate effort so too inbreaths and outbreaths are due to the body and the mindNext he defines the inbreaths and outbreaths and the body as materiality and the consciousness and the states associated with the consciousness as the immaterial mindThis is in brief but the details will be explained later in the defining of mentalitymateriality Having defined mentalitymateriality in this way he seeks its conditionWith search he finds it and so overcomes his doubts about the way of mentality materialitys occurrence in the three divisions of time His doubts being overcome he attributes the three characteristics beginning with that of suffering to mentality and materiality comprehending them by groups  he abandons the ten imperfections of insight beginning with illumination which arise in the first stages of the contemplation of rise and fall  and he defines as the path the knowledge of the way that is free from these imperfections  He reaches contemplation of dissolution by abandoning attention to arising When all formations have appeared as terror owing to the contemplation of their incessant dissolution he becomes dispassionate towards them  his greed for them fades away and he is liberated from them  After he has thus reached the four noble paths in due succession and has become established in the fruition of Arahantship he at last attains to the nineteen kinds of reviewing knowledge  and he becomes fit to receive the highest gifts from the world with its deities At this point his development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing beginning with counting and ending with looking back is completed This is the commentary on the first tetrad in all aspects Now since there is no separate method for developing the meditation subject in the case of the other tetradstheir meaning therefore needs only to be understood according to the word commentary He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out experiencing happiness that is making happiness known making it plainHerein the happiness is experienced in two ways with the object and with nonconfusion How is the happiness experienced with the objectHe attains the two jhānas in which happiness is presentAt the time when he has actually entered upon them the happiness is experienced with the object owing to the obtaining of the jhāna because of the experiencing of the object How with nonconfusionWhen after entering upon and emerging from one of the two jhānas accompanied by happiness he comprehends with insight that happiness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fallthen at the actual time of the insight the happiness is experienced with nonconfusion owing to the penetration of its characteristics of impermanence and so on For this is said in the PaṭisambhidāWhen he knows unification of mind and nondistraction through long inbreaths mindfulness is established in himBy means of that mindfulness and that knowledge that happiness is experiencedWhen he knows unification of mind and nondistraction through long out breaths  through short inbreaths  through short outbreaths  through in breaths  outbreaths experiencing the whole body  through inbreaths  outbreaths tranquilizing the bodily formation mindfulness is established in himBy means of that mindfulness and that knowledge that happiness is experiencedIt is experienced by him when he adverts when he knows sees reviews steadies his mind resolves with faith exerts energy establishes mindfulness concentrates his mind understands with understanding directly knows what is to be directly known fully understands what is to be fully understood abandons what is to be abandoned develops what is to be developed realizes what is to be realizedIt is in this way that that happiness is experienced  The remaining three clauses should be understood in the same way as to meaningbut there is this difference here The experiencing of bliss must be understood to be through three jhānas and that of the mental formation through fourThe mental formation consists of the two aggregates of feeling and perceptionAnd in the case of the clause experiencing bliss it is said in the Paṭisambhidā in order to show the plane of insight here as well Bliss there are two kinds of bliss bodily bliss and mental bliss Tranquilizing the mental formation tranquilizing the gross mental formation stopping it is the meaningAnd this should be understood in detail in the same way as given under the bodily formation  Here moreover in the happiness clause feeling which is actually being contemplated in this tetrad is stated under the heading of happiness which is a formationbut in the bliss clause feeling is stated in its own formIn the two mentalformation clauses the feeling is that necessarily associated with perception because of the words Perception and feeling belong to the mind these things being bound up with the mind are mental formations  So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of feeling In the third tetrad the experiencing of the manner of consciousness must be understood to be through four jhānas Gladdening the manner of consciousness he trains thus Making the mind glad instilling gladness into it cheering it rejoicing it I shall breathe in shall breathe outHerein there is gladdening in two ways through concentration and through insightHow through concentrationHe attains the two jhānas in which happiness is presentAt the time when he has actually entered upon them he inspires the mind with gladness instils gladness into it by means of the happiness associated with the jhānaHow through insightAfter entering upon and emerging from one of the two jhānas accompanied by happiness he comprehends with insight that happiness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fallthus at the actual time of insight he inspires the mind with gladness instils gladness into it by making the happiness associated with the jhāna the objectIt is of one progressing in this way that the words He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out gladdening the manner of consciousness are said Concentrating the manner of consciousness evenly placing the mind evenly putting it on its object by means of the first jhāna and so onOr alternatively when having entered upon those jhānas and emerged from them he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall then at the actual time of insight momentary unification of the mind arises through the penetration of the characteristics of impermanence and so onThus the words He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out concentrating the manner of consciousness are said also of one who evenly places the mind evenly puts it on its object by means of the momentary unification of the mind arisen thus Liberating the manner of consciousness he both breathes in and breathes out delivering liberating the mind from the hindrances by means of the first jhāna from applied and sustained thought by means of the second from happiness by means of the third from pleasure and pain by means of the fourthOr alternatively when having entered upon those jhānas and emerged from them he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fallthen at the actual time of insight he delivers liberates the mind from the perception of permanence by means of the contemplation of impermanence from the perception of pleasure by means of the contemplation of pain from the perception of self by means of the contemplation of not self from delight by means of the contemplation of dispassion from greed by means of the contemplation of fading away from arousing by means of the contemplation of cessation from grasping by means of the contemplation of relinquishmentHence it is said He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out liberating the manner of consciousness So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of mind But in the fourth tetrad as to contemplating impermanence here firstly the impermanent should be understoodand impermanenceand the contemplation of impermanenceand one contemplating impermanenceHerein the five aggregates are the impermanentWhyBecause their essence is rise and fall and changeImpermanence is the rise and fall and change in those same aggregates or it is their nonexistence after having been the meaning is it is the breakup of produced aggregates through their momentary dissolution since they do not remain in the same modeContemplation of impermanence is contemplation of materiality etc as impermanent in virtue of that impermanenceOne contemplating impermanence possesses that contemplationSo it is when one such as this is breathing in and breathing out that it can be understood of him He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out contemplating impermanence  Contemplating fading away there are two kinds of fading away that is fading away as destruction and absolute fading awayHerein fading away as destruction is the momentary dissolution of formationsAbsolute fading away is NibbānaContemplation of fading away is insight and it is the path which occurs as the seeing of these twoIt is when he possesses this twofold contemplation that it can be understood of him He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out contemplating fading away  The same method of explanation applies to the clause contemplating cessation Contemplating relinquishment relinquishment is of two kinds too that is to say relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering intoRelinquishment itself as a way of contemplation is contemplation of relinquishmentFor insight is called both relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into since firstly through substitution of opposite qualities it gives up defilements with their aggregateproducing kamma formations and secondly through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed it also enters into Nibbāna by inclining towards Nibbāna which is the opposite of the formed Also the path is called both relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into since it gives up defilements with their aggregateproducing kammaformations by cutting them off and it enters into Nibbāna by making it its objectAlso both insight and path knowledge are called contemplation because of their reseeing successively each preceding kind of knowledgeIt is when he possesses this twofold contemplation that it can be understood of him He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment  This tetrad deals only with pure insightwhile the previous three deal with serenity and insightThis is how the development of mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases in four tetrads should be understoodThis mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases thus is of great fruit of great benefit Its great beneficialness should be understood here as peacefulness both because of the words And bhikkhus this concentration through mindfulness of breathing when developed and much practiced is both peaceful and sublime  etc and because of its ability to cut off applied thoughtsfor it is because it is peaceful sublime and an unadulterated blissful abiding that it cuts off the minds running hither and thither with applied thoughts obstructive to concentration and keeps the mind only on the breaths as objectHence it is said Mindfulness of breathing should be developed in order to cut off applied thoughts  Also its great beneficialness should be understood as the root condition for the perfecting of clear vision and deliverancefor this has been said by the Blessed One Bhikkhus mindfulness of breathing when developed and much practiced perfects the four foundations of mindfulness The four foundations of mindfulness when developed and much practiced perfect the seven enlightenment factors The seven enlightenment factors when developed and much practiced perfect clear vision and deliverance  Again its great beneficialness should be understood to reside in the fact that it causes the final inbreaths and outbreaths to be knownfor this is said by the Blessed One Rāhula when mindfulness of breathing is thus developed thus practiced much the final inbreaths and outbreaths too are known as they cease not unknown  Herein there are three kinds of breaths that are final because of cessation that is to say final in becoming final in jhāna and final in deathFor among the various kinds of becoming  inbreaths and outbreaths occur in the sensualsphere becoming not in the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming That is why there are final ones in becomingIn the jhānas they occur in the first three but not in the fourth That is why there are final ones in jhānaThose that arise along with the sixteenth consciousness preceding the death consciousness cease together with the death consciousness They are called final in deathIt is these last that are meant here by final  When a bhikkhu has devoted himself to this meditation subject it seems if he adverts at the moment of arising of the sixteenth consciousness before the death consciousness to their arising then their arising is evident to himif he adverts to their presence then their presence is evident to himif he adverts to their dissolution then their dissolution is evident to him and it is so because he has thoroughly discerned inbreaths and outbreaths as object When a bhikkhu has attained Arahantship by developing some other meditation subject than this one he may be able to define his life term or notBut when he has reached Arahantship by developing this mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases he can always define his life termHe knows My vital formations will continue now for so long and no more  Automatically he performs all the functions of attending to the body dressing and robing etc after which he closes his eyes like the Elder Tissa who lived at the Koṭapabbata Monastery like the Elder Mahā Tissa who lived at the Mahā Karañjiya Monastery like the Elder Tissa the almsfood eater in the kingdom of Devaputta like the elders who were brothers and lived at the Cittalapabbata monastery Here is one story as an illustrationAfter reciting the Pātimokkha it seems on the Uposatha day of the full moon one of the two elders who were brothers went to his own dwelling place surrounded by the Community of Bhikkhus As he stood on the walk looking at the moonlight he calculated his own vital formations and he said to the Community of Bhikkhus In what way have you seen bhikkhus attaining Nibbāna up till nowSome answered Till now we have seen them attain Nibbāna sitting in their seatsOthers answered We have seen them sitting crosslegged in the airThe elder said I shall now show you one attaining Nibbāna while walking  He then drew a line on the walk saying I shall go from this end of the walk to the other end and return when I reach this line I shall attain Nibbāna  So saying he stepped on to the walk and went to the far end On his return he attained Nibbāna in the same moment in which he stepped on the lineSo let a man if he is wise Untiringly devote his daysTo mindfulness of breathing which Rewards him always in these waysThis is the section dealing with mindfulness of breathing in the detailed explanation One who wants to develop the recollection of peace mentioned next to mindfulness of breathing should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of Nibbāna in other words the stilling of all suffering as follows Bhikkhus in so far as there are dhammas whether formed or unformed fading away is pronounced the best of them that is to say the disillusionment of vanity the elimination of thirst the abolition of reliance the termination of the round the destruction of craving fading away cessation Nibbāna  Herein in so far as means as many asDhammas means individual essencesWhether formed or unformed whether made by conditions going together coming together or not so madeFading away is pronounced the best of them of these formed and unformed dhammas fading away is pronounced the best is called the foremost the highest Herein fading away is not mere absence of greed but rather it is that unformed dhamma which while given the names disillusionment of vanity etc in the clause that is to say the disillusionment of vanity  Nibbāna is treated basically as fading awayIt is called disillusionment of vanity because on coming to it all kinds of vanity  such as the vanity of conceit and vanity of manhood are disillusioned undone done away withAnd it is called elimination of thirst because on coming to it all thirst for sense desires is eliminated and quenchedBut it is called abolition of reliance because on coming to its reliance on the five cords of sense desire is abolishedIt is called termination of the round because on coming to it the round of the three planes of existence is terminatedIt is called destruction of craving because on coming to it craving is entirely destroyed fades away and ceasesIt is called Nibbāna because it has gone away from  has escaped from  is dissociated from craving which has acquired in common usage the name fastening because by ensuring successive becoming craving serves as a joining together a binding together a lacing together of the four kinds of generation five destinies seven stations of consciousness and nine abodes of beings This is how peace in other words Nibbāna should be recollected according to its special qualities beginning with disillusionment of vanityBut it should also be recollected according to the other special qualities of peace stated by the Blessed One in the suttas beginning with Bhikkhus I shall teach you the unformed  the truth  the other shore  the hardtosee  the undecaying  the lasting  the undiversified  the deathless  the auspicious  the safe  the marvellous  the intact  the unafflicted  the purity  the island  the shelter   As he recollects peace in its special qualities of disillusionment of vanity etc in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by peace So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described under the recollection of the Enlightened One etc the jhāna factors arise in a single momentBut owing to the profundity of the special qualities of peace or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of various kinds the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that jhāna itself is known as recollection of peace too because it arises by means of the special qualities of peace And as in the case of the six recollections this also comes to success only in a noble disciple Still though this is so it can nevertheless also be brought to mind by an ordinary person who values peaceFor even by hearsay the mind has confidence in peace A bhikkhu who is devoted to this recollection of peace sleeps in bliss and wakes in bliss his faculties are peaceful his mind is peaceful he has conscience and shame he is confident he is resolved to attain the superior state he is respected and honoured by his fellows in the life of purityAnd even if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinySo that is why a man of wit Untiringly devotes his daysTo mind the noble peace which can Reward him in so many waysThis is the section dealing with the recollection of peace in the detailed explanationcomposed for the purpose of gladdening good people in the Path of Purificationin the Treatise on the Development of Concentrationcalled The Description of Recollections as Meditation SubjectsThe eighth chapter The four divine abidings were mentioned next to the recollections as meditation subjects  They are lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity A meditator who wants to develop firstly lovingkindness among these if he is a beginner should sever the impediments and learn the meditation subject Then when he has done the work connected with the meal and got rid of any dizziness due to it he should seat himself comfortably on a wellprepared seat in a secluded place To start with he should review the danger in hate and the advantage in patience WhyBecause hate has to be abandoned and patience attained in the development of this meditation subjectand he cannot abandon unseen dangers and attain unknown advantagesNow the danger in hate should be seen in accordance with such suttas as this Friends when a man hates is a prey to hate and his mind is obsessed by hate he kills living things and  No higher rule the Buddhas say than patience And no Nibbāna higher than forbearance Patience in force in strong array Tis him I call a brahman No greater thing exists than patience  And the advantage in patience should be understood according to such suttas as these Thereupon he should embark upon the development of lovingkindness for the purpose of secluding the mind from hate seen as a danger and introducing it to patience known as an advantageBut when he begins he must know that some persons are of the wrong sort at the very beginning and that lovingkindness should be developed towards certain kinds of persons and not towards certain other kinds at firstFor lovingkindness should not be developed at first towards the following four kinds of persons an antipathetic person a very dearly loved friend a neutral person and a hostile personAlso it should not be developed specifically towards the opposite sexor towards a dead person What is the reason why it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the othersTo put an antipathetic person in a dear ones place is fatiguingTo put a very dearly loved friend in a neutral persons place is fatiguing and if the slightest mischance befalls the friend he feels like weepingTo put a neutral person in a respected ones or a dear ones place is fatiguingAnger springs up in him if he recollects a hostile person That is why it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the restThen if he develops it specifically towards the opposite sex lust inspired by that person springs up in himAn elder supported by a family was asked it seems by a friends son Venerable sir towards whom should lovingkindness be developedThe elder told him Towards a person one lovesHe loved his own wifeThrough developing lovingkindness towards her he was fighting against the wall all the nightThat is why it should not be developed specifically towards the opposite sexBut if he develops it towards a dead person he reaches neither absorption nor accessA young bhikkhu it seems had started developing lovingkindness inspired by his teacherHis lovingkindness made no headway at allHe went to a senior elder and told him Venerable sir I am quite familiar with attaining jhāna through lovingkindness and yet I cannot attain it What is the matterThe elder said Seek the sign friend the object of your meditationHe did so Finding that his teacher had died he proceeded with developing lovingkindness inspired by another and attained absorptionThat is why it should not be developed towards one who is deadFirst of all it should be developed only towards oneself doing it repeatedly thus May I be happy and free from suffering or May I keep myself free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happilyIf that is so does it not conflict with what is said in the texts For there is no mention of any development of it towards oneself in what is said in the VibhaṅgaAnd how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart filled with lovingkindnessJust as he would feel lovingkindness on seeing a dearly loved person so he pervades all beings with lovingkindness and in the PaṭisambhidāIn what five ways is the minddeliverance of lovingkindness practiced with unspecified pervasion May all beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happilyMay all breathing things  all who are born  all persons  all those who have a personality be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily in what is said and in the Mettā SuttaIn joy and safetymay all beings be joyful at heart in what is said Does it not conflict with what is said in the textsFor there is no mention of any development of it towards oneself Does it not conflict with those texts It does not conflictWhy notBecause that refers to absorptionBut this initial development towards oneself refers to making oneself an exampleFor even if he developed lovingkindness for a hundred or a thousand years in this way I am happy and so on absorption would never ariseBut if he develops it in this way I am happy Just as I want to be happy and dread pain as I want to live and not to die so do other beings too making himself the example then desire for other beings welfare and happiness arises in himAnd by the Blessed Ones sayingI visited all quarters with my mindNor found I any dearer than myselfSelf is likewise to every other dearWho loves himself will never harm another this method is indicated So he should first as example pervade himself with lovingkindness Next after that in order to proceed easily he can recollect such gifts kind words etc as inspire love and endearment such virtue learning etc as inspire respect and reverence met with in a teacher or his equivalent or a preceptor or his equivalent developing lovingkindness towards him in the way beginning May this good man be happy and free from sufferingWith such a person of course he attains absorption But if this bhikkhu does not rest content with just that much and wants to break down the barriers he should next after that develop lovingkindness towards a very dearly loved friend then towards a neutral person as a very dearly loved friend then towards a hostile person as neutralAnd while he does so he should make his mind malleable and wieldy in each instance before passing on to the nextBut if he has no enemy or he is of the type of a great man who does not perceive another as an enemy even when the other does him harm he should not interest himself as follows Now that my consciousness of lovingkindness has become wieldy towards a neutral person I shall apply it to a hostile oneRather it was about one who actually has an enemy that it was said above that he should develop lovingkindness towards a hostile person as neutralIf resentment arises in him when he applies his mind to a hostile person because he remembers wrongs done by that person he should get rid of the resentment by entering repeatedly into lovingkindness jhāna towards any of the firstmentioned persons and then after he has emerged each time directing lovingkindness towards that personBut if it does not die out in spite of his efforts thenLet him reflect upon the saw With other figures of such kindAnd strive and strive repeatedly To leave resentment far behindHe should admonish himself in this way Now you who get angry has not the Blessed One said this Bhikkhus even if bandits brutally severed limb from limb with a twohandled saw he who entertained hate in his heart on that accountwould not be one who carried out my teaching  And thisTo repay angry men in kind Is worse than to be angry firstRepay not angry men in kind And win a battle hard to winThe weal of both he does promote His own and then the others tooWho shall anothers anger know And mindfully maintain his peace And this Bhikkhus there are seven things gratifying and helpful to an enemy that happen to one who is angry whether woman or manWhat sevenHere bhikkhus an enemy wishes thus for his enemy Let him be uglyWhy is thatAn enemy does not delight in an enemys beautyNow this angry person is a prey to anger ruled by anger though well bathed well anointed with hair and beard trimmed and clothed in white yet he is ugly being a prey to angerThis is the first thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is angry whether woman or manFurthermore an enemy wishes thus for his enemy Let him lie in pain  Let him have no fortune  Let him not be wealthy  Let him not be famous  Let him have no friends  Let him not on the breakup of the body after death reappear in a happy destiny in the heavenly worldWhy is thatAn enemy does not delight in an enemys going to a happy destinyNow this angry person is a prey to anger ruled by anger he misconducts himself in body speech and mindMisconducting himself thus in body speech and mind on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a state of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell being a prey to anger And this As a log from a pyre burnt at both ends and fouled in the middle serves neither for timber in the village nor for timber in the forestso is such a person as this I sayIf you are angry now you will be one who does not carry out the Blessed Ones teaching by repaying an angry man in kind you will be worse than the angry man and not win the battle hard to win you will yourself do to yourself the things that help your enemy and you will be like a pyre log If his resentment subsides when he strives and makes effort in this way it is goodIf not then he should remove irritation by remembering some controlled and purified state in that person which inspires confidence when rememberedFor one person may be controlled in his bodily behaviourwith his control in doing an extensive course of duty known to allthough his verbal and mental behaviour are not controlledThen the latter should be ignored and the control in his bodily behaviour rememberedAnother may be controlled in his verbal behaviourand his control known to allhe may naturally be clever at welcoming kindly easy to talk with congenial opencountenanced deferential in speech and he may expound the Dhamma with a sweet voice and give explanations of Dhamma with well rounded phrases and detailsthough his bodily and mental behaviour are not controlled Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his verbal behaviour remembered Another may be controlled in his mental behaviour and his control in worshiping at shrines etc evident to allFor when one who is uncontrolled in mind pays homage at a shrine or at an Enlightenment Tree or to elders he does not do it carefully and he sits in the Dhammapreaching pavilion with mind astray or noddingwhile one whose mind is controlled pays homage carefully and deliberately listens to the Dhamma attentively remembering it and evincing the confidence in his mind through his body or his speechSo another may be only controlled in his mental behaviour though his bodily and verbal behaviour are not controlled Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his mental behaviour rememberedBut there may be another in whom not even one of these three things is controlled Then compassion for that person should be aroused thus Though he is going about in the human world now nevertheless after a certain number of days he will find himself in one of the eight great hells or the sixteen prominent hellsFor irritation subsides too through compassionIn yet another all three may be controlled Then he can remember any of the three in that person whichever he likesfor the development of lovingkindness towards such a person is easyAnd in order to make the meaning of this clear Bhikkhus there are five ways of dispelling annoyancewhereby annoyance arisen in a bhikkhu can be entirely dispelled  this following sutta from the Book of Fives should be cited in full But if irritation still arises in him in spite of his efforts then he should admonish himself thusSuppose an enemy has hurt You now in what is his domainWhy try yourself as well to hurt Your mind That is not his domainIn tears you left your family They had been kind and helpful tooSo why not leave your enemy The anger that brings harm to yougnawing at the very roots Of all the virtues that you guardThis anger that you entertain  Who is there such a fool as youAnother does ignoble deeds So you are angryHow is thisDo you then want to copy too The sort of acts that he commitsSuppose another to annoy Provokes you with some odious actWhy suffer anger to spring up And do as he would have you doIf you get angry then maybe You make him suffer maybe notThough with the hurt that anger brings You certainly are punished nowIf angerblinded enemies Set out to tread the path of woeDo you by getting angry too Intend to follow heel to toeIf hurt is done you by a foe Because of anger on your partThen put your anger down for why Should you be harassed groundlesslySince states last but a moments time Those aggregates by which was doneThe odious act have ceased so now What is it you are angry withWhom shall he hurt who seeks to hurt Another in the others absenceYour presence is the cause of hurt Why are you angry then with himBut if resentment does not subside when he admonishes himself thus then he should review the fact that he himself and the other are owners of their deeds Herein he should first review this in himself thus Now what is the point of your getting angry with himWill not this kamma of yours that has anger as its source lead to your own harmFor you are the owner of your deeds heir of your deeds having deeds as your parent deeds as your kin deeds as your refuge you will become the heir of whatever deeds you do  And this is not the kind of deed to bring you to full enlightenment to undeclared enlightenment or to the disciples grade or to any such position as the status of Brahmā or Sakka or the throne of a Wheelturning Monarch or a regional king etc but rather this is the kind of deed to lead to your fall from the Dispensation even to the status of the eaters of scraps etc and to the manifold suffering in the hells and so onBy doing this you are like a man who wants to hit another and picks up a burning ember or excrement in his hand and so first burns himself or makes himself stink Having reviewed ownership of deeds in himself in this way he should review it in the other also And what is the point of his getting angry with youWill it not lead to his own harmFor that venerable one is owner of his deeds heir of his deeds  he will become the heir of whatever deeds he doesAnd this is not the kind of deed to bring him to full enlightenment to undeclared enlightenment or to the disciples grade or to any such position as the status of Brahmā or Sakka or to the throne of a Wheelturning Monarch or a regional king etc but rather this is the kind of deed to lead to his fall from the Dispensation even to the status of the eaters of scraps etc and to the manifold suffering in the hells and so onBy doing this he is like a man who wants to throw dust at another against the wind and only covers himself with itFor this is said by the Blessed OneWhen a fool hates a man that has no hateIs purified and free from every blemishSuch evil he will find comes back on himAs does fine dust thrown up against the wind But if it still does not subside in him when he reviews ownership of deeds in this way then he should review the special qualities of the Masters former conductHere is the way of reviewing it Now you who have gone forth is it not a fact that when your Master was a Bodhisatta before discovering full enlightenment while he was still engaged in fulfilling the perfections during the four incalculable ages and a hundred thousand aeons he did not allow hate to corrupt his mind even when his enemies tried to murder him on various occasionsFor example in the Sīlavant Birth Story when his friends rose to prevent his kingdom of three hundred leagues being seized by an enemy king who had been incited by a wicked minister in whose mind his own queen had sown hate for him he did not allow them to lift a weaponAgain when he was buried along with a thousand companions up to the neck in a hole dug in the earth in a charnel ground he had no thought of hate And when after saving his life by a heroic effort helped by jackals scraping away soil when they had come to devour the corpses he went with the aid of a spirit to his own bedroom and saw his enemy lying on his own bed he was not angry but treated him as a friend undertaking a mutual pledge and he then exclaimedThe brave aspire the wise will not lose heartI see myself as I had wished to be  And in the Khantivādin Birth Story he was asked by the stupid king of Kāsi  What do you preach monk  and he replied I am a preacher of patience and when the king had him flogged with scourges of thorns and had his hands and feet cut off he felt not the slightest anger It is perhaps not so wonderful that an adult who had actually gone forth into homelessness should have acted in that waybut also as an infant he did so For in the CūḷaDhammapāla Birth StoryOh Dhammapālas arms are severed That had been bathed in sandalwoodHe was the heir to all the earth O king my breath is choking me his hands and feet were ordered to be lopped off like four bamboo shoots by his father King Mahāpatāpa and his mother lamented over him thus  Then his father still not satisfied commanded that his head be cut off as well But even then he had not the least trace of hate since he had firmly resolved thus Now is the time to restrain your mind now good Dhammapāla be impartial towards these four persons that is to say towards your father who is having your head cut off the man who is beheading you your lamenting mother and yourselfAnd it is perhaps not so wonderful that one who had become a human being should have acted in that waybut also as an animal he did so For while the Bodhisatta was the elephant called Chaddanta he was pierced in the navel by a poisoned shaft But even then he allowed no hate towards the hunter who had wounded him to corrupt his mindaccording as it is saidThe elephant when struck by the stout shaftAddressed the hunter with no hate in mindWhat is your aim What is the reason whyYou kill me thus What can your purpose be And when the elephant had spoken thus and was told Sir I have been sent by the king of Kāsis queen to get your tusks in order to fulfil her wish he cut off his own tusks whose gorgeous radiance glittered with the flashes of the six coloured rays and gave them to himAnd when he was the Great Monkey the man whom he had pulled out of a rocky chasm thoughtNow this is food for human kind Like other forest animalsSo why then should a hungry man Not kill the ape to eat I askIll travel independently Taking his meat as a provisionThus I shall cross the waste and that Will furnish my viaticum Then he took up a stone and dashed it on his head But the monkey looked at him with eyes full of tears and saidOh act not so good sir or else That you would do to me todayThe fate you reap will long deter All others from such deeds as this And with no hate in his mind and regardless of his own pain he saw to it that the man reached his journeys end in safetyAnd while he was the royal nāga Bhūridatta when he had undertaken the Uposatha precepts and was lying on the top of a termitemound though he was caught and sprinkled with medicinal charms resembling the fire that ushers in the end of an aeon and was put into a box and treated as a plaything throughout the whole of Jambudīpa yet he had no trace of hate for that brahmanaccording as it is saidWhile being put into the coffer And being crushed down with his handI had no hate for lambāna Lest I should break my precept vow And when he was the royal nāga Campeyya he let no hate spring up in his mind while he was being cruelly treated by a snake charmeraccording as it is saidWhile I was living in the Law Observing the UposathaA snake charmer took me away To play with at the royal gateWhatever hue he might conceive Blue and yellow and red as wellSo in accordance with his thought I would become what he had wishedI would turn dry land into water And water into land likewiseNow had I given way to wrath I could have seared him into ashHad I relaxed mindmastery I should have let my virtue lapseAnd one who lets his virtue lapse Cannot attain the highest goal And when he was the royal nāga Saṅkhapāla while he was being carried along on a carrying pole by the sixteen village boys after they had wounded him in eight places with sharp spears and inserted thorn creepers into the wounds orifices and while after threading a strong rope through his nose they were causing him great agony by dragging him along bumping his body on the surface of the ground though he was capable of turning those village boys to cinders with a mere glance yet he did not even show the least trace of hate on opening his eyesaccording as it is saidOn the fourteenth and the fifteenth too ḷāraI regularly kept the Holy DayUntil there came those sixteen village boysBearing a rope and a stout spear as wellThe hunters cleft my nose and through the slitThey passed a rope and dragged me off like thatBut though I felt such poignant agonyI let no hate disturb my Holy Day And he performed not only these wonders but also many others too such as those told in the Mātuposaka Birth Story Now it is in the highest degree improper and unbecoming to you to arouse thoughts of resentment since you are emulating as your Master that Blessed One who reached omniscience and who has in the special quality of patience no equal in the world with its deities But if as he reviews the special qualities of the Masters former conduct the resentment still does not subside in him since he has long been used to the slavery of defilement then he should review the suttas that deal with the beginninglessness of the round of rebirthsHere is what is saidBhikkhus it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother  your father  your brother  your sister  your son  your daughter Consequently he should think about that person thus This person it seems as my mother in the past carried me in her womb for ten months and removed from me without disgust as if it were yellow sandalwood my urine excrement spittle snot etc and played with me in her lap and nourished me carrying me about on her hip And this person as my father went by goat paths and paths set on piles etc to pursue the trade of merchant and he risked his life for me by going into battle in double array by sailing on the great ocean in ships and doing other difficult things and he nourished me by bringing back wealth by one means or another thinking to feed his childrenAnd as my brother sister son daughter this person gave me such and such help So it is unbecoming for me to harbour hate for him in my mind But if he is still unable to quench that thought in this way then he should review the advantages of lovingkindness thus Now you who have gone forth into homelessness has it not been said by the Blessed One as followsBhikkhus when the minddeliverance of lovingkindness is cultivated developed much practiced made the vehicle made the foundation established consolidated and properly undertaken eleven blessings can be expectedWhat are the elevenA man sleeps in comfort wakes in comfort and dreams no evil dreams he is dear to human beings he is dear to nonhuman beings deities guard him fire and poison and weapons do not affect him his mind is easily concentrated the expression of his face is serene he dies unconfused if he penetrates no higher he will be reborn in the Brahmāworld  If you do not stop this thought you will be denied these advantages But if he is still unable to stop it in this way he should try resolution into elementsHowNow you who have gone forth into homelessness when you are angry with him what is it you are angry withIs it head hairs you are angry with Or body hairs Or nails  Or is it urine you are angry withOr alternatively is it the earth element in the head hairs etc you are angry with Or the water element Or the fire element Or is it the air element you are angry withOr among the five aggregates or the twelve bases or the eighteen elements with respect to which this venerable one is called by such and such a name which then is it the materiality aggregate you are angry with Or the feeling aggregate the perception aggregate the formations aggregate the consciousness aggregate you are angry withOr is it the eye base you are angry with Or the visibleobject base you are angry with  Or the mind base you are angry with Or the mentalobject base you are angry withOr is it the eye element you are angry with Or the visibleobject element Or the eyeconsciousness element  Or the mind element Or the mentalobject element Or the mindconsciousness element you are angry withFor when he tries the resolution into elements his anger finds no foothold like a mustard seed on the point of an awl or a painting on the airBut if he cannot effect the resolution into elements he should try the giving of a giftIt can either be given by himself to the other or accepted by himself from the otherBut if the others livelihood is not purified and his requisites are not proper to be used it should be given by oneselfAnd in the one who does this the annoyance with that person entirely subsidesAnd in the other even anger that has been dogging him from a past birth subsides at the moment as happened to the senior elder who received a bowl given to him at the Cittalapabbata Monastery by an almsfoodeater elder who had been three times made to move from his lodging by him and who presented it with these words Venerable sir this bowl worth eight ducats was given me by my mother who is a lay devotee and it is rightly obtained let the good lay devotee acquire meritSo efficacious is this act of givingAnd this is saidA gift for taming the untamed A gift for every kind of goodThrough giving gifts they do unbend And condescend to kindly speech When his resentment towards that hostile person has been thus allayed then he can turn his mind with lovingkindness towards that person too just as towards the one who is dear the very dear friend and the neutral personThen he should break down the barriers by practicing lovingkindness over and over again accomplishing mental impartiality towards the four persons that is to say himself the dear person the neutral person and the hostile personThe characteristic of it is this Suppose this person is sitting in a place with a dear a neutral and a hostile person himself being the fourth then bandits come to him and say Venerable sir give us a bhikkhu and on being asked why they answer So that we may kill him and use the blood of his throat as an offering then if that bhikkhu thinks Let them take this one or this one he has not broken down the barriersAnd also if he thinks Let them take me but not these three he has not broken down the barriers eitherWhyBecause he seeks the harm of him whom he wishes to be taken and seeks the welfare of the other onlyBut it is when he does not see a single one among the four people to be given to the bandits and he directs his mind impartially towards himself and towards those three people that he has broken down the barriersHence the Ancients said The four that is himself the dear The neutral and the hostile oneWhen he discriminates between  But only kindly towards beingsThen skilled is not the name he gets Nor having amity at willNow when a bhikkhus barriers Have all the four been broken downHe treats with equal amity The whole world with its deitiesFar more distinguished than the first Is he who knows no barriers Thus the sign and access are obtained by this bhikkhu simultaneously with the breaking down of the barriersBut when breaking down of the barriers has been effected he reaches absorption in the way described under the earth kasiṇa without trouble by cultivating developing and repeatedly practicing that same signAt this point he has attained the first jhāna which abandons five factors possesses five factors is good in three ways is endowed with ten characteristics and is accompanied by lovingkindnessAnd when that has been obtained then by cultivating developing and repeatedly practicing that same sign he successively reaches the second and third jhānas in the fourfold system and the second third and fourth in the fivefold systemNow it is by means of one of these jhānas beginning with the first that he Dwells pervading one direction with his heart endued with loving kindnesslikewise the second direction likewise the third direction likewise the fourth directionand so above below and around everywhere and equally he dwells pervading the entire world with his heart endued with loving kindness abundant exalted measureless free from enmity and free from affliction For this versatility comes about only in one whose consciousness has reached absorption in the first jhāna and the rest And here endued with lovingkindness means possessing lovingkindnessWith his heart  with his mind One direction this refers to anyone direction in which a being is first discerned and means pervasion of the beings included in that one directionPervading touching making his objectHe dwells  he causes the occurrence of an abiding in postures that is devoted to the divine abidings Likewise the second just as he dwells pervading anyone direction among those beginning with the eastern one so he does with the next one and the third and the fourth is the meaning So above in that same way in the upper direction is what is meantBelow around so too the lower direction and the direction all roundHerein below is underneathand around is in the intermediate directionsSo he sends his heart full of lovingkindness back and forth in all directions like a horse in a circus groundUp to this point specified pervasion with lovingkindness is shown in the discernment of each direction separatelyEverywhere etc is said for the purpose of showing unspecified pervasionHerein everywhere means in all placesEqually  to all classed as inferior medium superior friendly hostile neutral etc just as to oneself equality with oneself without making the distinction This is another being is what is meantOr alternatively equally is with the whole state of the mind not reserving even a little is what is meantEntire  possessing all beings  associated with all beings is the meaningWorld is the world of beings Endued with lovingkindness is said again here in order to introduce the synonyms beginning with abundantOr alternatively endued with lovingkindness is repeated because the word likewise or the word so is not repeated here as it was in the case of the preceding specified pervasionOr alternatively it is said as a way of concludingAnd abundant should be regarded here as abundance in pervadingBut it is exalted in plane from the sensualsphere plane to the fine materialsphere plane measureless through familiarity and through having measureless beings as its object free from enmity through abandonment of ill will and hostility and free from affliction through abandonment of grief without suffering is what is meantThis is the meaning of the versatility described in the way beginning With his heart endued with lovingkindnessAnd just as this versatility is successful only in one whose mind has reached absorption so too that described in the Paṭisambhidā should be understood to be successful only in one whose mind has reached absorption that is to say The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified pervasion in five ways The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with specified pervasion in seven ways The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with directional pervasion in ten ways  And herein the minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified pervasion in these five ways May all beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily May all breathing things  all creatures  all persons  all those who have a personality be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily  The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with specified pervasion in these seven ways May all women be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily May all men  all Noble Ones  all not Noble Ones  all deities  all human beings  all in states of loss be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily  May all beings in the eastern direction be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happilyMay all beings in the western direction  northern direction  southern direction  eastern intermediate direction  western intermediate direction  northern intermediate direction  southern intermediate direction  downward direction  upward direction be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happilyMay all breathing things in the eastern direction  May all creatures in the eastern direction  May all persons in the eastern direction  May all who have a personality in the eastern direction  etc  in the upward direction be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happilyMay all women in the eastern direction  May all men in the eastern direction  May all Noble Ones in the eastern direction  May all not Noble Ones in the eastern direction  May all deities in the eastern direction  May all human beings in the eastern direction  May all those in states of loss in the eastern direction  etc  be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with directional pervasion in these ten ways  Herein all signifies inclusion without exceptionBeings  they are held  gripped by desire and greed for the aggregates beginning with materiality thus they are beings For this is said by the Blessed OneAny desire for matter Rādha any greed for it any delight in it any craving for it has held it has gripped it that is why a being is said But in ordinary speech this term of common usage is applied also to those who are without greed just as the term of common usage palm fan is used for different sorts of fans in general even if made of split bambooHowever in the world etymologists who do not consider meaning have it that it is a mere namewhile those who do consider meaning have it that a being is so called with reference to the bright principle Breathing things  so called because of their state of breathing  the meaning is because their existence depends on inbreaths and outbreathsCreatures  so called because of being  the meaning is because of their being fully become  because of their being generated puṃ is what hell is calledthey fall into that is the meaning of persons Personality is what the physical body is calledor it is just the pentad of aggregates since it is actually only a concept derived from that pentad of aggregatesWhat is referred to is included in that personality thus it has a personality Included in is delimited by gone into is the meaningAnd all the remaining terms should be understood as synonyms for all beings used in accordance with ordinary speech as in the case of the term beingsOf course there are other synonyms too for all beings such as all folks all souls etc still it is for claritys sake that The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified pervasion in five ways is said and that only these five are mentioned Those who would have it that there is not only a mere verbal difference between beings breathing things etc but also an actual difference in meaning are contradicted by the mention of unspecified pervasion So instead of taking the meaning in that way the unspecified pervasion with loving kindness is done in any one of these five waysAnd here may all beings be free from enmity is one absorptionfree from affliction is one absorptionfree from affliction is free from afflictedness free from anxiety is one absorptionfree from anxiety is free from sufferingmay they live happily is one absorptionConsequently he should do his pervading with lovingkindness according to whichever of these phrases is clear to himSo with the four kinds of absorption in each of the five ways there are twenty kinds of absorption in unspecified pervasion In specified pervasion with the four kinds of absorption in each of the seven ways there are twentyeight kinds of absorptionAnd here woman and man are stated according to sexNoble Ones and not Noble Ones according to Noble Ones and ordinary peopledeities and human beings and those in states of loss according to the kind of rebirth In directional pervasion with twenty kinds of absorption in each of the directions beginning with all beings in the eastern direction there are two hundred kinds of absorption and with twentyeight kinds in each of the directions beginning with all women in the eastern direction there are two hundred and eighty kinds so these make four hundred and eighty kinds of absorptionConsequently all the kinds of absorption mentioned in the Paṭisambhidā amount to five hundred and twentyeightSo when this meditator develops the minddeliverance of lovingkindness through any one of these kinds of absorption he obtains the eleven advantages described in the way beginning A man sleeps in comfort  Herein sleeps in comfort means that instead of sleeping uncomfortably turning over and snoring as other people do he sleeps comfortablyhe falls asleep as though entering upon an attainment He wakes in comfort instead of waking uncomfortably groaning and yawning and turning over as others do he wakes comfortably without contortions like a lotus opening He dreams no evil dreams when he sees dreams he sees only auspicious ones as though he were worshipping a shrine as though he were making an offering as though he were hearing the DhammaBut he does not see evil dreams as others do as though being surrounded by bandits as though being threatened by wild beasts as though falling into chasms He is dear to human beings he is as dear to and beloved by human beings as a necklace worn to hang on the chest as a wreath adorning the headHe is dear to nonhuman beings he is just as dear to nonhuman beings as he is to human beings as in the Elder Visākhas caseHe was a landowner it seems at Pāṭaliputta While he was living there he heard this The Island of Tambapaṇṇi  apparently is adorned with a diadem of shrines and gleams with the yellow cloth and there a man can sit or lie wherever he likes there the climate is favourable the abodes are favourable the people are favourable the Dhamma to be heard is favourable and all these favourable things are easily obtained thereHe made over his fortune to his wife and children and left his home with only a single ducat sewn into the hem of his garment He stopped for one month on the sea coast in expectation of a shipand meanwhile by his skill in trading he made a thousand during the month by buying goods here and selling them there in lawful enterprise Eventually he came to the Great Monastery at Anurādha pura and there he asked for the going forth into homelessnessWhen he was being conducted to the chapter house for the goingforth ceremony the purse containing the thousand pieces dropped out from under his beltWhen asked What is that he replied It is a thousand ducats venerable sirs They told him Lay follower it is not possible to distribute them after the going forth Distribute them now Then he said Let none who have come to the scene of Visākhas going forth depart emptyhanded and opening the purse he strewed them over the chapter house yard after which he received the going forth and the full admissionWhen he had acquired five years seniority and had become familiar with the two Codes he celebrated the Pavāraṇā at the end of the Rains took a meditation subject that suited him and set out to wander living for four months in each monastery and doing the duties on a basis of equality with the residentsWhile he was wandering in this wayThe elder halted in a wood To scan the tenor of his wayHe thundered forth this roundelay Proclaiming that he found it goodSo from your fulladmission day Till in this place you paused and stoodNo stumbling mars your bhikkhuhood Be thankful for such grace I sayOn his way to Cittalapabbata he came to a road fork and stood wondering which turn to takeThen a deity living in a rock held out a hand pointing out the road to him He came to the Cittalapabbata Monastery After he had stayed there for four months he lay down thinking In the morning I departThen a deity living in a maṇila tree at the end of the walk sat down on a step of the stair and burst into tearsThe elder asked Who is thatIt is I Maṇiliyā venerable sirWhat are you weeping forBecause you are going awayWhat good does my living here to youVenerable sir as long as you live here non human beings treat each other kindly Now when you are gone they will start quarrels and loose talkThe elder said If my living here makes you live at peace that is good and so he stayed there another four months Then he again thought of leavingbut the deity wept as beforeAnd so the elder lived on there and it was there that he attained Nibbāna This is how a bhikkhu who abides in lovingkindness is dear to nonhuman beings Deities guard him deities guard him as a mother and father guard their childFire poison and weapons do not affect him they do not affect do not enter into the body of one who abides in lovingkindness like the fire in the case of the lay woman devotee Uttarā  like the poison in the case of the Saṃyutta reciter the Elder CūḷaSiva like the knife in the case of the novice Saṅkicca they do not disturb the body is what is meantAnd they tell the story of the cow here tooA cow was giving milk to her calf it seemsA hunter thinking I shall shoot her flourished a longhandled spear in his hand and flung itIt struck her body and bounced off like a palm leafand that was owing neither to access nor to absorption but simply to the strength of her consciousness of love for her calfSo mightily powerful is loving kindnessHis mind is easily concentrated the mind of one who abides in lovingkindness is quickly concentrated there is no sluggishness about it The expression of his face is serene his face has a serene expression like a palmyra fruit loosed from its stemHe dies unconfused there is no dying deluded for one who abides in loving kindness He passes away undeluded as if falling asleepIf he penetrates no higher if he is unable to reach higher than the attainment of lovingkindness and attain Arahantship then when he falls from this life he reappears in the Brahmāworld as one who wakes up from sleepThis is the detailed explanation of the development of lovingkindnessOne who wants to develop compassion should begin his task by reviewing the danger in lack of compassion and the advantage in compassionAnd when he begins it he should not direct it at first towards the dear etc personsfor one who is dear simply retains the position of one who is deara very dear companion retains the position of a very dear companionone who is neutral retains the position of one who is neutralone who is antipathetic retains the position of one who is antipatheticand one who is hostile retains the position of one who is hostileOne of the opposite sex and one who is dead are also not the field for itIn the Vibhaṅga it is said And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with compassionJust as he would feel compassion on seeing an unlucky unfortunate person so he pervades all beings with compassion  Therefore first of all on seeing a wretched man unlucky unfortunate in every way a fit object for compassion unsightly reduced to utter misery with hands and feet cut off sitting in the shelter for the helpless with a pot placed before him with a mass of maggots oozing from his arms and legs and moaning compassion should be felt for him in this way This being has indeed been reduced to misery if only he could be freed from this suffering But if he does not encounter such a person then he can arouse compassion for an evildoing person even though he is happy by comparing him to one about to be executedHow Suppose a robber has been caught with stolen goods and in accordance with the kings command to execute him the kings men bind him and lead him off to the place of execution giving him a hundred blows in sets of fourThen people give him things to chew and eat and also garlands and perfumes unguents and betel leavesAlthough he goes along eating and enjoying these things as though he were happy and well off still no one fancies that he is really happy and well off On the contrary people feel compassion for him thinking This poor wretch is now about to die every step he takes brings him nearer to the presence of deathSo too a bhikkhu whose meditation subject is compassion should arouse compassion for an evildoing person even if he is happy Though this poor wretch is now happy cheerful enjoying his wealth still for want of even one good deed done now in any one of the three doors of body speech and mind he can come to experience untold suffering in the states of loss Having aroused compassion for that person in that way he should next arouse compassion for a dear person next for a neutral person and next for a hostile person successively in the same way But if resentment towards the hostile person arises in the way already described he should make it subside in the way described under lovingkindness And here too when someone has done profitable deeds and the meditator sees or hears that he has been overtaken by one of the kinds of ruin beginning with ruin of health relatives property etc he deserves the meditators compassion and so he does too in any case even with no such ruin thus In reality he is unhappy because he is not exempt from the suffering of the round of becoming And in the way already described the meditator should break down the barriers between the four kinds of people that is to say himself the dear person the neutral person and the hostile person Then cultivating that sign developing it and repeatedly practicing it he should increase the absorption by the triple and quadruple jhāna in the way already stated under lovingkindnessBut the order given in the Aṅguttara Commentary is that a hostile person should first be made the object of compassion and when the mind has been made malleable with respect to him next the unlucky person next the dear person and next oneself That does not agree with the text an unlucky unfortunate person Therefore he should begin the development break down the barriers and increase absorption only in the way stated here After that the versatility consisting in the unspecified pervasion in five ways the specified pervasion in seven ways and the directional pervasion in ten ways and the advantages described as He sleeps in comfort etc should be understood in the same way as given under lovingkindnessThis is the detailed explanation of the development of compassionOne who begins the development of gladness should not start with the dear person and the restfor a dear person is not the proximate cause of gladness merely in virtue of dearness how much less the neutral and the hostile personOne of the opposite sex and one who is dead are also not the field for itHowever the very dear companion can be the proximate cause for itone who in the commentaries is called a boon companionfor he is constantly glad he laughs first and speaks afterwards So he should be the first to be pervaded with gladnessOr on seeing or hearing about a dear person being happy cheerful and glad gladness can be aroused thus This being is indeed glad How good how excellentFor this is what is referred to in the Vibhaṅga And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with gladnessJust as he would be glad on seeing a dear and beloved person so he pervades all beings with gladness But if his boon companion or the dear person was happy in the past but is now unlucky and unfortunate then gladness can still be aroused by remembering his past happiness and apprehending the glad aspect in this way In the past he had great wealth a great following and he was always glad Or gladness can be aroused by apprehending the future glad aspect in him in this way In the future he will again enjoy similar success and will go about in gold palanquins on the backs of elephants or on horseback and so onHaving thus aroused gladness with respect to a dear person he can then direct it successively towards a neutral one and after that towards a hostile oneBut if resentment towards the hostile one arises in him in the way already described he should make it subside in the same way as described under loving kindness  He should break down the barriers by means of mental impartiality towards the four that is towards these three and himself And by cultivating that sign developing and repeatedly practicing it he should increase the absorption to triple and quadruple jhāna in the way already stated under lovingkindnessNext the versatility consisting in unspecified pervasion in five ways specified pervasion in seven ways and directional pervasion in ten ways and also the advantages described as He sleeps in comfort etc should be understood in the same way as stated under lovingkindnessThis is the detailed explanation of the development of gladness One who wants to develop equanimity must have already obtained the triple or quadruple jhāna in lovingkindness and so on He should emerge from the third jhāna in the fourfold reckoning after he has made it familiar and he should see danger in the former three divine abidings because they are linked with attention given to beings enjoyment in the way beginning May they be happy because resentment and approval are near and because their association with joy is gross And he should also see the advantage in equanimity because it is peaceful Then he should arouse equanimity by looking on with equanimity at a person who is normally neutral after that at a dear person and the restFor this is said And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with equanimityJust as he would feel equanimity on seeing a person who was neither beloved nor unloved so he pervades all beings with equanimity Therefore he should arouse equanimity towards the neutral person in the way already stated Then through the neutral one he should break down the barriers in each case between the three people that is the dear person then the boon companion and then the hostile one and lastly himself And he should cultivate that sign develop and repeatedly practice itAs he does so the fourth jhāna arises in him in the way described under the earth kasiṇaBut how then Does this arise in one in whom the third jhāna has already arisen on the basis of the earth kasiṇa etcIt does notWhy notBecause of the dissimilarity of the objectIt arises only in one in whom the third jhāna has arisen on the basis of lovingkindness etc because the object is similarBut after that the versatility and the obtaining of advantages should be understood in the same way as described under lovingkindnessThis is the detailed explanation of the development of equanimity Now having thus known these divine abidings Told by the Divine One supremely wiseThere is this general explanation too Concerning them that he should recognizeMeanings Now as to the meaning firstly of lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity it fattens  thus it is lovingkindness  it is solvent is the meaningAlso it comes about with respect to a friend  or it is behaviour towards a friend thus it is lovingkindness When there is suffering in others it causes good peoples hearts to be moved  thus it is compassion Or alternatively it combats others suffering attacks and demolishes it thus it is compassionOr alternatively it is scattered upon those who suffer it is extended to them by pervasion thus it is compassion Those endowed with it are glad  or itself is glad  or it is the mere act of being glad  thus it is gladness It looks on at  abandoning such interestedness as thinking May they be free from enmity and having recourse to neutrality thus it is equanimity Characteristic Etc As to the characteristic etc lovingkindness is characterized here as promoting the aspect of welfare Its function is to prefer welfare It is manifested as the removal of annoyance Its proximate cause is seeing loveableness in beingsIt succeeds when it makes ill will subside and it fails when it produces affectionCompassion is characterized as promoting the aspect of allaying suffering Its function resides in not bearing others suffering It is manifested as non cruelty Its proximate cause is to see helplessness in those overwhelmed by sufferingIt succeeds when it makes cruelty subside and it fails when it produces sorrow Gladness is characterized as gladdening  Its function resides in being unenvious It is manifested as the elimination of aversion  Its proximate cause is seeing beings successIt succeeds when it makes aversion subside and it fails when it produces merrimentEquanimity is characterized as promoting the aspect of neutrality towards beings Its function is to see equality in beings It is manifested as the quieting of resentment and approval Its proximate cause is seeing ownership of deeds thus Beings are owners of their deeds Whose if not theirs is the choice by which they will become happy or will get free from suffering or will not fall away from the success they have reached It succeeds when it makes resentment and approval subside and it fails when it produces the equanimity of unknowing which is that worldlyminded indifference of ignorance based on the house lifePurpose The general purpose of these four divine abidings is the bliss of insight and an excellent form of future existenceThat peculiar to each is respectively the warding off of ill will and so onFor here lovingkindness has the purpose of warding off ill willwhile the others have the respective purposes of warding off cruelty aversion  and greed or resentmentAnd this is said tooFor this is the escape from ill will friends that is to say the minddeliverance of lovingkindness For this is the escape from cruelty friends that is to say the minddeliverance of compassion For this is the escape from boredom friends that is to say the minddeliverance of gladness For this is the escape from greed friends that is to say the minddeliverance of equanimity The Near and Far Enemies And here each one has two enemies one near and one farThe divine abiding of lovingkindness has greed as its near enemy since both share in seeing virtues Greed behaves like a foe who keeps close by a man and it easily finds an opportunity So lovingkindness should be well protected from itAnd ill will which is dissimilar to the similar greed is its far enemy like a foe ensconced in a rock wilderness So lovingkindness must be practiced free from fear of thatfor it is not possible to practice lovingkindness and feel anger simultaneously Compassion has grief based on the home life as its near enemy since both share in seeing failure Such grief has been described in the way beginning When a man either regards as a privation failure to obtain visible objects cognizable by the eye that are sought after desired agreeable gratifying and associated with worldliness or when he recalls those formerly obtained that are past ceased and changed then grief arises in him Such grief as this is called grief based on the home life And cruelty which is dissimilar to the similar grief is its far enemySo compassion must be practiced free from fear of thatfor it is not possible to practice compassion and be cruel to breathing things simultaneously Gladness has joy based on the home life as its near enemy since both share in seeing success Such joy has been described in the way beginning When a man either regards as gain the obtaining of visible objects cognizable by the eye that are sought  and associated with worldliness or recalls those formerly obtained that are past ceased and changed then joy arises in him Such joy as this is called joy based on the home life And aversion  which is dissimilar to the similar joy is its far enemySo gladness should be practiced free from fear of that for it is not possible to practice gladness and be discontented with remote abodes and things connected with the higher profitableness simultaneously Such unknowing has been described in the way beginning On seeing a visible object with the eye equanimity arises in the foolish infatuated ordinary man in the untaught ordinary man who has not conquered his limitations who has not conquered future kamma result who is unperceiving of danger Such equanimity as this does not surmount the visible objectSuch equanimity as this is called equanimity based on the home life  Equanimity has the equanimity of unknowing based on the home life as its near enemy since both share in ignoring faults and virtuesAnd greed and resentment which are dissimilar to the similar unknowing are its far enemiesTherefore equanimity must be practiced free from fear of thatfor it is not possible to look on with equanimity and be inflamed with greed or be resentful simultaneouslyThe Beginning Middle and End Etc Now zeal consisting in desire to act is the beginning of all these things Suppression of the hindrances etc is the middle Absorption is the endTheir object is a single living being or many living beings as a mental object consisting in a conceptThe Order in Extension The extension of the object takes place either in access or in absorptionHere is the order of it Just as a skilled ploughman first delimits an area and then does his ploughing so first a single dwelling should be delimited and loving kindness developed towards all beings there in the way beginning In this dwelling may all beings be free from enmityWhen his mind has become malleable and wieldy with respect to that he can then delimit two dwellingsNext he can successively delimit three four five six seven eight nine ten one street half the village the whole village the district the kingdom one direction and so on up to one worldsphere or even beyond that and develop loving kindness towards the beings in such areasLikewise with compassion and so on This is the order in extending hereThe Outcome Just as the immaterial states are the outcome of the kasiṇas and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is the outcome of concentration and fruition attainment is the outcome of insight and the attainment of cessation is the outcome of serenity coupled with insight so the divine abiding of equanimity is the outcome of the first three divine abidingsFor just as the gable rafters cannot be placed in the air without having first set up the scaffolding and built the framework of beams so it is not possible to develop the fourth without having already developed the third jhāna in the earlier Four Questions And here it may be asked But why are lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity called divine abidingsAnd why are they only fourAnd what is their order And why are they called measureless states in the AbhidhammaIt may be replied The divineness of the abiding should be understood here in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculateFor these abidings are the best in being the right attitude towards beingsAnd just as Brahmā gods abide with immaculate minds so the meditators who associate themselves with these abidings abide on an equal footing with Brahmā gods So they are called divine abidings in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate Here are the answers to the questions beginning with Why are they only four Their number four is due to paths to purity And other sets of fourAs welfare and the resttheir order to their aim ImmeasurableTheir scope is found to be so measureless states their name For among these lovingkindness is the way to purity for one who has much ill will compassion is that for one who has much cruelty gladness is that for one who has much aversion  and equanimity is that for one who has much greedAlso attention given to beings is only fourfold that is to say as bringing welfare as removing suffering as being glad at their success and as unconcern that is to say impartial neutralityAnd one abiding in the measureless states should practice lovingkindness and the rest like a mother with four sons namely a child an invalid one in the flush of youth and one busy with his own affairs for she wants the child to grow up wants the invalid to get well wants the one in the flush of youth to enjoy for long the benefits of youth and is not at all bothered about the one who is busy with his own affairsThat is why the measureless states are only four as due to paths to purity and other sets of four One who wants to develop these four should practice them towards beings first as the promotion of the aspect of welfareand lovingkindness has the promotion of the aspect of welfare as its characteristicand next on seeing or hearing or judging that beings whose welfare has been thus wished for are at the mercy of suffering they should be practiced as the promotion of the aspect of the removal of sufferingand compassion has the promotion of the aspect of the removal of suffering as its characteristicand then on seeing the success of those whose welfare has been wished for and the removal of whose suffering has been wished for they should be practiced as being gladand gladness has the act of gladdening as its characteristicbut after that there is nothing to be done and so they should be practiced as the neutral aspect in other words the state of an onlookerand equanimity has the promotion of the aspect of neutrality as its characteristictherefore since their respective aims are the aspect of welfare etc their order should be understood to correspond with loving kindness stated first then compassion gladness and equanimityAll of them however occur with a measureless scope for their scope is measureless beingsand instead of assuming a measure such as Loving kindness etc should be developed only towards a single being or in an area of such an extent they occur with universal pervasionThat is why it was saidTheir number four is due to paths to purity And other sets of four As welfare and the resttheir order to their aim ImmeasurableTheir scope is found to be so measureless states their nameAs Producing Three Jhānas and Four Jhānas Though they have a single characteristic in having a measureless scope yet the first three are only of triple and quadruple jhāna respectively in the fourfold and fivefold reckoningsWhyBecause they are not dissociated from joyBut why are their aims not dissociated from joyBecause they are the escape from ill will etc which are originated by griefBut the last one belongs only to the remaining single jhānaWhyBecause it is associated with equanimous feelingFor the divine abiding of equanimity that occurs in the aspect of neutrality towards beings does not exist apart from equanimous that is to say neither painfulnorpleasant feeling However someone might say this It has been said by the Blessed One in the Book of Eights speaking of the measureless states in general Next bhikkhu you should develop the concentration with applied thought and sustained thought and you should develop it without applied thought and with sustained thought only and you should develop it without applied thought and without sustained thought and you should develop it with happiness and you should develop it without happiness and you should develop it accompanied by gratification and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity  Consequently all four measureless states have quadruple and quintuple jhāna He should be told Do not put it like thatFor if that were so then contemplation of the body etc would also have quadruple and quintuple jhāna But there is not even the first jhāna in the contemplation of feeling or in the other twoSo do not misrepresent the Blessed One by adherence to the letter The Enlightened Ones word is profound and should be taken as it is intended giving due weight to the teachers And the intention here is this The Blessed One it seems was asked to teach the Dhamma thus Venerable sir it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that having heard the Blessed Ones Dhamma I may dwell alone withdrawn diligent ardent and selfexerted  But the Blessed One had no confidence yet in that bhikkhu since although he had already heard the Dhamma he had nevertheless gone on living there instead of going to do the ascetics duties and the Blessed One expressed his lack of confidence thus So too some misguided men merely question me and when the Dhamma is expounded to them they still fancy that they need not follow me  However the bhikkhu had the potentiality for the attainment of Arahantship and so he advised him again saying Therefore bhikkhu you should train thus My mind shall be steadied quite steadied internally and arisen evil unprofitable things shall not obsess my mind and remainYou should train thus But what is stated in that advice is basic concentration consisting in mere unification of mind internally in the sense of in oneself  After that he told him about its development by means of lovingkindness in order to show that he should not rest content with just that much but should intensify his basic concentration in this way As soon as your mind has become steadied quite steadied internally bhikkhu and arisen evil unprofitable things do not obsess your mind and remainthen you should train thus The mind deliverance of lovingkindness will be developed by me frequently practiced made the vehicle made the foundation established consolidated and properly undertakenYou should train thus bhikkhu  after which he said further As soon as this concentration has been thus developed by you bhikkhu and frequently practiced then you should develop this concentration with applied thought and sustained thought  and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity  The meaning is this Bhikkhu when this basic concentration has been developed by you by means of lovingkindness then instead of resting content with just that much you should make this basic concentration reach quadruple and quintuple jhāna in other objects by further developing it in the way beginning With applied thought  And having spoken thus pointing out that you should effect its further development by means of quadruple and quintuple jhāna in other objects this further development being preceded by the remaining divine abidings of compassion and the rest he further said As soon as this concentration has been thus developed by you bhikkhu and frequently practicedthen you should train thus The minddeliverance of compassion will be developed by me   etc Having thus shown how its further development by means of quadruple and quintuple jhāna is preceded by lovingkindness etc and having told him As soon as this concentration has been developed by you bhikkhu and frequently practiced then you should train thus I shall dwell contemplating the body as a body etc he concluded the discourse with Arahantship as its culmination thus As soon as this concentration has been developed by you bhikkhu completely developed then wherever you go you will go in comfort wherever you stand you will stand in comfort wherever you sit you will sit in comfort wherever you make your couch you will do so in comfort From that it must be understood that the three beginning with lovingkindness have only triplequadruple jhāna and that equanimity has only the single remaining jhānaAnd they are expounded in the same way in the Abhidhamma as wellThe Highest Limit of Each And while they are twofold by way of the triplequadruple jhāna and the single remaining jhāna still they should be understood to be distinguishable in each caseby a different efficacy consisting in having beauty as the highest etc For they are so described in the Haliddavasana Suttaaccording as it is said Bhikkhus the minddeliverance of lovingkindness has beauty as the highest I say The minddeliverance of compassion has the base consisting of boundless space as the highest I say The minddeliverance of gladness has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as the highest I say The mind deliverance of equanimity has the base consisting of nothingness as the highest I say  But why are they described in this wayBecause each is the respective basic support for eachFor beings are unrepulsive to one who abides in loving kindnessBeing familiar with the unrepulsive aspect when he applies his mind to unrepulsive pure colours such as blueblack his mind enters into them without difficultySo lovingkindness is the basic support for the liberation by the beautiful  but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having beauty as the highest One who abides in compassion has come to know thoroughly the danger in materiality since compassion is aroused in him when he sees the suffering of beings that has as its material sign beating with sticks and so onSo well knowing the danger in materiality when he removes whichever kasiṇa concept he was contemplating whether that of the earth kasiṇa or another and applies his mind to the space that remains  which is the escape from materiality then his mind enters into that space without difficultySo compassion is the basic support for the sphere of boundless space but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having the base consisting of boundless space as the highest When he abides in gladness his mind becomes familiar with apprehending consciousness since gladness is aroused in him when he sees beings consciousness arisen in the form of rejoicing over some reason for joyThen when he surmounts the sphere of boundless space that he had already attained in due course and applies his mind to the consciousness that had as its object the sign of space his mind enters into it without difficulty So gladness is the basic support for the base consisting of boundless consciousness but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having the sphere of boundless consciousness as the highest When he abides in equanimity his mind becomes skilled in appre hending what is nonexistent because his mind has been diverted from apprehension of the ultimate sense namely pleasure pain etc owing to having no further concern such as May beings be happy or May they be released from pain or May they not lose the success they have obtainedNow his mind has become used to being diverted from apprehension of what is existent in the ultimate sense and his mind has become skilled in apprehending what is nonexistent in the ultimate sense  and so when he surmounts the base consisting of boundless consciousness attained in due course and applies his mind to the absence which is nonexistent as to individual essence of consciousness which is a reality in the ultimate sense then his mind enters into that without difficulty So equanimity is the basic support for the base consisting of nothingness but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having the base consisting of nothingness as the highest When he has understood thus that the special efficacy of each resides respectively in having beauty as the highest etc he should besides understand how they bring to perfection all the good states beginning with givingFor the Great Beings minds retain their balance by giving preference to beings welfare by dislike of beings suffering by desire for the various successes achieved by beings to last and by impartiality towards all beings And to all beings they give gifts which are a source a pleasure without discriminating thus It must be given to this one it must not be given to this one And in order to avoid doing harm to beings they undertake the precepts of virtueThey practice renunciation for the purpose of perfecting their virtueThey cleanse their understanding for the purpose of nonconfusion about what is good and bad for beingsThey constantly arouse energy having beings welfare and happiness at heartWhen they have acquired heroic fortitude through supreme energy they become patient with beings many kinds of faultsThey do not deceive when promising We shall give you this we shall do this for youThey are unshakably resolute upon beings welfare and happinessThrough unshakable lovingkindness they place them first before themselvesThrough equanimity they expect no reward Having thus fulfilled the ten perfections these divine abidings then perfect all the good states classed as the ten powers the four kinds of fearlessness the six kinds of knowledge not shared by disciples and the eighteen states of the Enlightened One This is how they bring to perfection all the good states beginning with givingin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Concentrationcalled The Description of the Divine AbidingsThe ninth chapter Now as to the four immaterial states mentioned next to the divine abidings  one who wants firstly to develop the base consisting of boundless space sees in gross physical matter danger through the wielding of sticks etc because of the words It is in virtue of matter that wielding of sticks wielding of knives quarrels brawls and disputes takes place but that does not exist at all in the immaterial stateand in this expectation he enters upon the way to dispassion for only material things for the fading and cessation of only those  and he sees danger in it too through the thousand afflictions beginning with eye disease So in order to surmount that he enters upon the fourth jhāna in any one of the nine kasiṇas beginning with the earth kasiṇa and omitting the limitedspace kasiṇaNow although he has already surmounted gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the finematerial sphere nevertheless he still wants also to surmount the kasiṇa materiality since it is the counterpart of the formerHow does he do thisSuppose a timid man is pursued by a snake in a forest and flees from it as fast as he can then if he sees in the place he has fled to a palm leaf with a streak painted on it or a creeper or a rope or a crack in the ground he is fearful anxious and will not even look at itSuppose again a man is living in the same village as a hostile man who illuses him and on being threatened by him with a flogging and the burning down of his house he goes away to live in another village then if he meets another man there of similar appearance voice and manner he is fearful anxious and will not even look at himHere is the application of the similes The time when the bhikkhu has the gross physical matter as his object is like the time when the men were respectively threatened by the snake and by the enemyThe time when the bhikkhu surmounts the gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the fine material sphere is like the first mans fleeing as fast as he can and the other mans going away to another villageThe bhikkhus observing that even the matter of the kasiṇa is the counterpart of that gross physical matter and his wanting to surmount that also is like the first mans seeing in the place he had fled to the palm leaf with a streak painted on it etc and the other mans seeing the man who resembled the enemy in the village he had left and their unwillingness to look owing to fear and anxietyAnd here the similes of the dog attacked by a boar and that of the pisāca goblin and the timid man should be understood too So when he has thus become disgusted with the kasiṇa materiality the object of the fourth jhāna and wants to get away from it he achieves mastery in the five ways Then on emerging from the now familiar fourth jhāna of the finematerial sphere he sees the danger in that jhāna in this way This makes its object the materiality with which I have become disgusted and It has joy as its near enemy and It is grosser than the peaceful liberationsThere is however no comparative grossness of factors here as in the case of the four finematerial jhānasfor the immaterial states have the same two factors as this finematerial jhāna When he has seen the danger in that finematerial fourth jhāna jhāna in this way and has ended his attachment to it he gives his attention to the base consisting of boundless space as peaceful Then when he has spread out the kasiṇa to the limit of the worldsphere or as far as he likes he removes the kasiṇa materiality by giving his attention to the space touched by it regarding that as space or boundless space When he is removing it he neither folds it up like a mat nor withdraws it like a cake from a tin It is simply that he does not advert to it or give attention to it or review it it is when he neither adverts to it nor gives attention to it nor reviews it but gives his attention exclusively to the space touched by it regarding that as space space that he is said to remove the kasiṇa And when the kasiṇa is being removed it does not roll up or roll away It is simply that it is called removed on account of his nonattention to it his attention being given to space space  This is conceptualized as the mere space left by the removal of the kasiṇa materialityWhether it is called space left by the removal of the kasiṇa or space touched by the kasiṇa or space secluded from the kasiṇa it is all the sameHe adverts again and again to the sign of the space left by the removal of the kasiṇa as space space and strikes at it with thought and applied thoughtAs he adverts to it again and again and strikes at it with thought and applied thought the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in accessHe cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices it As he again and again adverts to it and gives attention to it in this way consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space arises in absorption with the space as its object as the consciousness belonging to the finematerial sphere did in the case of the earth kasiṇa and so onAnd here too in the prior stage there are either three or four sensualsphere impulsions associated with equanimous feelingwhile the fourth or the fifth is of the immaterial sphereThe rest is the same as in the case of the earth kasiṇa There is however this difference When the immaterialsphere conscious ness has arisen in this way the bhikkhu who has been formerly looking at the kasiṇa disk with the jhāna eye finds himself looking at only space after that sign has been abruptly removed by the attention given in the preliminary work thus space space  He is like a man who has plugged an opening in a covered vehicle a sack or a pot with a piece of blue rag or with a piece of rag of some such colour as yellow red or white and is looking at that and then when the rag is removed by the force of the wind or by some other agency he finds himself looking at spaceAnd at this point it is said With the complete surmounting of perceptions of matter with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance with nonattention to perceptions of variety aware of unbounded space he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space  Herein complete is in all aspects or of all perceptions without exception is the meaningOf perceptions of matter both of the finematerial jhānas mentioned here under the heading of perception and of those things that are their objectFor the jhāna of the finematerial sphere is called matter in such passages as Possessed of visible matter he sees instances of matter  and it is its object too that is called matter in such passages as He sees instances of visible matter externally  fair and ugly  Consequently here the words perception of matter  in the sense of perceptions about matter are used for finematerial jhāna stated thus under the headings of perceptionsAlso it has the label matter  thus it is labelled matter what is meant is that matter is its nameSo it should be understood that this is also a term for what is classed as the earth kasiṇa etc which is the object of that jhānaWith the surmounting with the fading away and with the cessationWhat is meantWith the fading away and with the cessation both because of the fading away and because of the cessation either in all aspects or without exception of these perceptions of matter reckoned as jhāna which number fifteen with the five each of the profitable resultant and functional and also of these things labelled matter reckoned as objects of those perceptions which number nine with the earth kasiṇa etc he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless spaceFor he cannot enter upon and dwell in that without completely surmounting perceptions of matterHerein there is no surmounting of these perceptions in one whose greed for the object of those perceptions has not faded away and when the perceptions have been surmounted their objects have been surmounted as wellThat is why in the Vibhaṅga only the surmounting of the perceptions and not that of the objects is mentioned as follows Herein what are perceptions of matterThey are the perception perceiving perceivedness in one who has attained a fine materialsphere attainment or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this present life These are what are called perceptions of matterThese perceptions of matter are passed surpassed surmountedHence With the complete surmounting of perceptions of matter is said Because these attainments have to be reached by surmounting the object they are not to be reached by retaining the same object as in the first and subsequent jhānasThrerefore But this commentary should be understood to deal also with the surmounting of the object With the disappearance of perceptions of resistance perceptions of resistance are perceptions arisen through the impact of the physical base consisting of the eye etc and the respective objects consisting of visible objects etcand this is a term for perception of visible objects and so onaccording as it is said Here what are perceptions of resistancePerceptions of visible objects perceptions of sounds perceptions of odours perceptions of flavours perceptions of tangible objectsthese are called perceptions of resistance with the complete disappearance the abandoning the nonarising of these ten kinds of perceptions of resistance that is to say of the five profitableresultant and five unprofitableresultant causing their nonoccurrence is what is meantOf course these are not to be found in one who has entered upon the first jhāna etc eitherfor consciousness at that time does not occur by way of the five doorsStill the mention of them here should be understood as a recommendation of this jhāna for the purpose of arousing interest in it just as in the case of the fourth jhāna there is mention of the pleasure and pain already abandoned elsewhere and in the case of the third path there is mention of the false view of personality etc already abandoned earlier Or alternatively though these are also not to be found in one who has attained the finematerial sphere still their not being there is not due to their having been abandonedfor development of the finematerial sphere does not lead to fading of greed for materiality and the occurrence of those finematerial jhānas is actually dependent on materialityBut this development of the immaterial does lead to the fading of greed for materialityTherefore it is allowable to say that they are actually abandoned hereand not only to say it but to maintain it absolutelyIn fact it is because they have not been abandoned already before this that it was said by the Blessed One that sound is a thorn to one who has the first jhāna And it is precisely because they are abandoned here that the imperturbability of the immaterial attainments and their state of peaceful liberation are mentioned and that ḷāra Kālāma neither saw the five hundred carts that passed close by him nor heard the sound of them while he was in an immaterial attainment With nonattention to perceptions of variety either to perceptions occurring with variety as their domain or to perceptions themselves variousFor perceptions of variety are so called for two reasonsfirstly because the kinds of perception included along with the mind element and mindconsciousness element in one who has not attainedwhich kinds are intended here as described in the Vibhaṅga thus Herein what are perceptions of variety The perception perceiving perceivedness in one who has not attained and possesses either mind element or mind consciousness element in one who has not attained and possesses either mind element or mindconsciousness element these are called perceptions of variety occur with respect to a domain that is varied in individual essence with the variety classed as visibleobject sound etc and secondly because the fortyfour kinds of perceptionthat is to say eight kinds of sensesphere profitable perception twelve kinds of unprofitable perception eleven kinds of sensesphere profitable resultant perception two kinds of unprofitableresultant perception and eleven kinds of sensesphere functional perceptionthemselves have variety have various individual essences and are dissimilar from each otherWith the complete nonattention to nonadverting to nonreaction to nonreviewing of these perceptions of varietywhat is meant is that because he does not advert to them give them attention or review them therefore And two things should be understood firstly that because the earlier perceptions of matter and perceptions of resistance do not exist even in the kind of existence produced by this jhāna on rebirthlet alone when this jhāna is entered upon and dwelt in that existence their absence is stated here in two ways as surmounting and disappearanceand secondly in the case of perceptions of variety nonattention to them is said because twentyseven kinds of perceptionthat is to say eight kinds of sensesphere profitable perception nine kinds of functional perception and ten kinds of unprofitable perceptionstill exist in the kind of existence produced by this jhānaFor when he enters upon and dwells in this jhāna there too he does so by nonattention to them also but he has not attained when he does give attention to themAnd here briefly it should be understood that the abandoning of all fine materialsphere states is signified by the words with the surmounting of perceptions of matterand the abandoning of and nonattention to all sensesphere consciousness and its concomitants is signified by the words with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance with nonattention to perceptions of varietyUnbounded space here it is called unbounded because neither its end as its arising nor its end as its fall are made knownIt is the space left by the removal of the kasiṇa that is called spaceAnd here unboundedness should be understood as referring to the attention alsowhich is why it is said in the Vibhaṅga He places settles his consciousness in that space he pervades unboundedly  hence unbounded space is said  He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space it has no bound  and thus it is unbounded  What is spatially unbounded is unbounded space  Unbounded space is the same as boundless space  That boundless space is a base in the sense of habitat for the jhāna whose nature it is to be associated with it as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless space He enters and dwells in having reached that base consisting of boundless space having caused it to be produced he dwells with an abiding consisting in postures that are in conformity with itThis is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of boundless space as a meditation subjectWhen he wants to develop the base consisting of boundless consciousness he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment of the base consisting of boundless space Then he should see the danger in the base consisting of boundless space in this way This attainment has finematerial jhāna as its near enemy and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of boundless consciousness  So having ended his attachment to that he should give his attention to the base consisting of boundless consciousness as peaceful adverting again and again as consciousness consciousness to the consciousness that occurred pervading that space as its object He should give it attention review it and strike at it with applied and sustained thoughtbut he should not give attention simply in this way boundless boundless  As he directs his mind again and again on to that sign in this way the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in accessHe cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices itAs he does so consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness arises in absorption with the past consciousness that pervaded the space as its object just as that belonging to the base consisting of boundless space did with the space as its objectBut the method of explaining the process of absorption should be understood in the way already described And at this point it is said By completely surmounting the base consisting of boundless space aware of unbounded consciousness he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless consciousness  Herein completely is as already explainedBy  surmounting the base consisting of boundless space the jhāna is called the base consisting of boundless space in the way already stated  and its object is so called tooFor the object too is boundless space in the way already stated  and then because it is the object of the first immaterial jhāna it is its base in the sense of habitat as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless spaceLikewise it is boundless space and then because it is the cause of the jhānas being of that species it is its base in the sense of locality of the species as Kambojā is the base of horses thus it is the base consisting of boundless space in this way alsoSo it should be understood that the words By  surmounting the base consisting of boundless space include both the jhāna and its object together since this base consisting of boundless consciousness is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting by causing the nonoccurrence of and by not giving attention to both the jhāna and its objectUnbounded consciousness What is meant is that he gives his attention thus unbounded consciousness to that same consciousness that occurred in pervading as its object the space as unbounded spaceOr unbounded refers to the attentionFor when he gives attention without reserve to the consciousness that had the space as its object then the attention he gives to it is unbounded  For it is said in the Vibhaṅga Unbounded consciousness he gives attention to that same space pervaded by consciousness he pervades boundlessly hence unbounded consciousness is said But in that passage the instrumental case by consciousness must be understood in the sense of accusative for the teachers of the commentary explain its meaning in that way What is meant by He pervades boundlessly is that he gives attention to that same consciousness which had pervaded that space  He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless consciousness it has no bound  thus it is unbounded What is unbounded is boundless and unbounded consciousness is called boundless consciousness that is viññāṇañcaṃ in the contracted form instead of viññāṇānañcaṃ which is the full number of syllablesThis is an idiomatic formThat boundless consciousness is the base in the sense of foundation for the jhāna whose nature it is to be associated with it as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless consciousness The rest is the same as beforeThis is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of boundless consciousness as a meditation subjectWhen he wants to develop the base consisting of nothingness he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment in the base consisting of boundless consciousness Then he should see the danger in the base consisting of boundless consciousness in this way This attainment has the base consisting of boundless space as its near enemy and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of nothingness  So having ended his attachment to that he should give his attention to the base consisting of nothingness as peaceful He should give attention to the present nonexistence voidness secluded aspect of that same past consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space which became the object of the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousnessHow does he do this Without giving further attention to that consciousness he should now advert again and again in this way there is not there is not or void void or secluded secluded and give his attention to it review it and strike at it with thought and applied thoughtAs he directs his mind on to that sign thus the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in accessHe cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices itAs he does so consciousness belonging to the base consisting of nothingness arises in absorption making its object the void secluded nonexistent state of that same past exalted consciousness that occurred in pervading the space just as the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness did the then past exalted consciousness that had pervaded the spaceAnd here too the method of explaining the absorption should be understood in the way already describedBut there is this difference Suppose a man sees a community of bhikkhus gathered together in a meeting hall or some such place and then goes elsewhere then after the bhikkhus have risen at the conclusion of the business for which they had met and have departed the man comes back and as he stands in the doorway looking at that place again he sees it only as void he sees it only as secludedhe does not think So many bhikkhus have died so many have left the district but rather he sees only the nonexistence thus This is void secludedso too having formerly dwelt seeing with the jhāna eye belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness the earlier consciousness that had occurred making the space its object now when that consciousness has disappeared owing to his giving attention to the preliminary work in the way beginning There is not there is not he dwells seeing only its non existence in other words its departedness when this consciousness has arisen in absorption And at this point it is said By completely surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness aware that There is nothing he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of nothingness  Herein completely is as already explainedBy  surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness here too the jhāna is called the base consisting of boundless consciousness in the way already stated and its object is socalled tooFor the object too is boundless consciousness in the way already stated and then because it is the object of the second immaterial jhāna it is its base in the sense of habitat as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless consciousnessLikewise it is boundless consciousness and then because it is the cause of the jhānas being of that species it is its base in the sense of locality of the species as Kambojā is the base of horses thus it is the base consisting of boundless consciousness in this way alsoSo it should be understood that the words By  surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness include both the jhāna and its object together since this base consisting of nothingness is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting by causing the non occurrence of by not giving attention to both jhāna and its object There is nothing  what is meant is that he gives his attention thus there is not there is not or void void or secluded secludedIt is said in the Vibhaṅga There is nothing he makes that same consciousness nonexistent makes it absent makes it disappear sees that there is nothing hence there is nothing is said  which is expressed in a way that resembles comprehension by insight of liability to destruction nevertheless the meaning should be understood in the way described aboveFor the words He makes that same consciousness nonexistent makes it absent makes it disappear are said of one who does not advert to it or gives attention to it or review it and only gives attention to its nonexistence its voidness its secludedness they are not meant in the other way He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of nothingness it has no owning  this it is nonowning  what is meant is that it has not even the mere act of its dissolution remainingThe state of nonowning is nothingness  This is a term for the disappearance of the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless spaceThat nothingness is the base in the sense of foundation for that jhāna as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of nothingnessThe rest is as beforeThis is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of nothingness as a meditation subject When however he wants to develop the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness Then he should see the danger in the base consisting of nothingness and the advantage in what is superior to it in this way This attainment has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as its near enemy and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception or in this way Perception is a boil perception is a dart  this is peaceful this is sublime that is to say neither perception nor nonperception  So having ended his attachment to the base consisting of nothingness he should give attention to the base consisting of neither perception non nonperception as peaceful He should advert again and again to that attainment of the base consisting of nothingness that has occurred making nonexistence its object adverting to it as peaceful peaceful and he should give his attention to it review it and strike at it with thought and applied thought As he directs his mind again and again on to that sign in this way the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in accessHe cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices itAs he does so consciousness belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception arises in absorption making its object the four mental aggregates that constitute the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness just as the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of nothingness did the disappearance of the previous consciousnessAnd here too the method of explaining the absorption should be understood in the way already describedAnd at this point it is said By completely surmounting the base consisting of nothingness he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception  Herein completely is already explainedBy  surmounting the base consisting of nothingness here too the jhāna is called the base consisting of nothingness in the way already stated and its object is so called tooFor the object too is nothingness in the way already stated and then because it is the object of the third immaterial jhāna it is its base in the sense of habitat as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of nothingnessLikewise it is nothingness and then because it is the cause of the jhānas being of that species it is its base in the sense of locality of the species as Kambojā is the base of horses thus it is the base consisting of nothingness in this way alsoSo it should be understood that the words By  surmounting the base consisting of nothingness include both the jhāna and its object together since the base consisting of neither perception nor non perception is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting by causing the nonoccurrence of by not giving attention to both the jhāna and its objectBase consisting of neither perception nor nonperception then there is he who so practices that there is in him the perception on account of the presence of which this attainment is called the the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperceptionand in the Vibhaṅga in order to point out that person firstly one specified as neither percipient nor nonpercipient it is said gives attention to that same base consisting of nothingness as peaceful he develops the attainment with residual formations hence neither percipient nor non percipient is said  Herein he gives attention  as peaceful means that he gives attention to it as peaceful because of the peacefulness of the object thus How peaceful this attainment is for it can make even nonexistence its object and still subsistIf he brings it to mind as peaceful then how does there come to be surmountingBecause there is no actual desire to attain itFor although he gives attention to it as peaceful yet there is no concern in him or reaction or attention such as I shall advert to this or I shall attain this or I shall resolve upon the duration of thisWhy notBecause the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is more peaceful and better than the base consisting of nothingnessSuppose a king is proceeding along a city street with the great pomp of royalty splendidly mounted on the back of an elephant and he sees craftsmen wearing one cloth tightly as a loincloth and another tied round their heads working at the various crafts such as ivory carving etc their limbs covered with ivory dust etc now while he is pleased with their skill thinking How skilled these craftmasters are and what crafts they practice he does not however think Oh that I might abandon royalty and become a craftsman like thatWhy notBecause of the great benefits in the majesty of kingshe leaves the craftsmen behind and proceeds on his waySo too though this meditator gives attention to that attainment as peaceful yet there is no concern in him or reaction or attention such as I shall advert to this attainment or I shall attain this or I shall resolve upon the duration of it or I shall emerge from it or I shall review it As he gives attention to it as peaceful in the way already described he reaches the ultrasubtle absorbed perception in virtue of which he is called neither percipient nor nonpercipient and it is said of him that He develops the attainment with residual formations The attainment with residual formations is the fourth immaterial attainment whose formations have reached a state of extreme subtletyNow in order to show the meaning of the kind of perception that has been reached on account of which this jhāna is called the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception it is said Base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception states of consciousness or its concomitants in one who has attained the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this present life Of these what is intended here is the states of consciousness and its concomitants in one who has attainedThe word meaning here is this that jhāna with its associated states neither has perception nor has no perception because of the absence of gross perception and the presence of subtle perception thus it is neither perception nor non perception It is neither perception nor nonperception and it is a base because it is included in the mindbase and the mentalobject base  thus it is the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception  Or alternatively the perception here is neither perception since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception nor yet non perception since it is present in a subtle state as a residual formation thus it is neither perception nor nonperceptionIt is neither perception nor non perception and it is a base in the sense of a foundation for the other states thus it is the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception And here it is not only perception that is like this but feeling as well is neitherfeelingnornonfeeling consciousness is neitherconsciousnessnor nonconsciousness and contact is neithercontactnornoncontactand the same description applies to the rest of the associated statesbut it should be understood that this presentation is given in terms of perceptionAnd the meaning should be illustrated by the similes beginning with the smearing of oil on the bowlA novice smeared a bowl with oil it seems and laid it aside When it was time to drink gruel an elder told him to bring the bowlHe said Venerable sir there is oil in the bowlBut then when he was told Bring the oil novice I shall fill the oil tube he replied There is no oil venerable sirHerein just as There is oil is in the sense of incompatibility with the gruel because it has been poured into the bowland just as There is no oil is in the sense of filling the oil tube etcso too this perception is neither perception since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception and it is nor non perception because it is present in a subtle form as a residual formationBut in this context what is perceptions functionIt is the perceiving of the object and it is the production of dispassion if that attainment and its object are made the objective field of insightBut it is not able to make the function of perceiving decisive as the heat element in tepid water is not able to make the function of burning decisiveand it is not able to produce dispassion by treatment of its objective field with insight in the way that perception is in the case of the other attainmentsThere is in fact no bhikkhu capable of reaching dispassion by comprehension of aggregates connected with the base consisting of neither perception nor non perception unless he has already done his interpreting with other aggregates  And furthermore when the venerable Sāriputtaor someone very wise and naturally gifted with insight as he was is able to do soeven he has to do it by means of comprehension of groups in this way So it seems these states not having been come to be having come to be they vanish  and not by means of actual direct insight into states one by one as they ariseSuch is the subtlety that this attainment reachesAnd this meaning should be illustrated by the simile of the water on the road as it was by the simile of the oilsmearing on the bowlA novice was walking in front of an elder it seems who had set out on a journey He saw a little water and said There is water venerable sir remove your sandalsThen the elder said If there is water bring me the bathing cloth and let us bathe but the novice said There is none venerable sirHerein just as There is water is in the sense of mere wetting of the sandals and There is none is in the sense of bathingso too this perception is neither perception since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception and it is nor nonperception because it is present in a subtle form as a residual formation And this meaning should be illustrated not only by these similes but by other appropriate ones as wellEnters upon and dwells in is already explainedThis is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception as a meditation subject Thus has the Peerless Helper told The fourfold immaterial stateTo know these general matters too Will not be inappropriate For these immaterial statesWhile reckoned by the surmounting of The object they are four the wiseDo not admit surmounting of Factors that one can recognize Of these four the first is due to surmounting signs of materiality the second is due to surmounting space the third is due to surmounting the consciousness that occurred with that space as its objectand the fourth is due to surmounting the disappearance of the consciousness that occurred with that space as its object So they should be understood as four in number with the surmounting of the object in each caseBut the wise do not admit any surmounting of jhāna factorsfor there is no surmounting of factors in them as there is in the case of the finematerialsphere attainmentsEach one has just the two factors namely equanimity and unification of mind That being soThey progress in refinement each Is finer than the one beforeTwo figures help to make them known The cloth lengths and each palace floorSuppose there were a fourstoried palace on its first floor the five objects of sense pleasure were provided in a very fine form as divine dancing singing and music and perfumes scents garlands food couches clothing etcand on the second they were finer than thatand on the third finer stilland on the fourth they were finest of allyet they are still only palace floors and there is no difference between them in the matter of their state as palace floorsit is with the progressive refinement of the five objects of sense pleasure that each one is finer than the one belowagain suppose there were lengths of cloth of quadruple triple double and single thickness and made of thick thin thinner and very thin thread spun by one woman all the same measure in width and breadthnow although these lengths of cloth are four in number yet they measure the same in width and breadth there is no difference in their measurementbut in softness to the touch fineness and costliness each is finer than the one before so too although there are only the two factors in all four immaterial states that is to say equanimity and unification of mind still each one should be understood as finer than the one before with the progressive refinement of factors due to successful developmentAnd for the fact that each one of them is finer than the last there is this figureOne hangs upon a tent that stands On filth on him another leansOutside a third not leaning stands Against the last another leansBetween the four men and these states The correspondence then is shownAnd so how each to each relates Can by a man of wit be knownThis is how the meaning should be construed There was a tent in a dirty place it seems Then a man arrived and being disgusted with the dirt he rested himself on the tent with his hands and remained as if hung or hanging on to itThen another man came and leant upon the man hanging on to the tentThen another man came and thought The one who is hanging on to the tent and the one who is leaning upon him are both badly offand if the tent falls they will certainly fallI think I shall stand outsideSo instead of leaning upon the one leaning upon the first he remained outsideThen another arrived and taking account of the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one leaning upon him and fancying that the one standing outside was well placed he stood leaning upon himHerein this is how it should be regarded The space from which the kasiṇa has been removed is like the tent in the dirty place The consciousness of the base consisting of boundless space which makes space its object owing to disgust with the sign of the finematerial is like the man who hangs on to the tent owing to disgust with the dirt The consciousness of the base consisting of boundless consciousness the occurrence of which is contingent upon the consciousness of the base consisting of boundless space whose object is space is like the man who leans upon the man who hangs on to the tent The consciousness of the base consisting of nothingness which instead of making the consciousness of the base consisting of boundless space its object has the nonexistence of that as its object is like the man who after considering the insecurity of those two does not lean upon the one hanging on to the tent but stands outside The consciousness of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception the occurrence of which is contingent upon the consciousness of the base consisting of nothingness which stands in a place outside in other words in the nonexistence of the past consciousness is like the man who stands leaning upon the lastnamed having considered the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one leaning upon him and fancying that the one standing outside is well placed And while occurring in this wayIt takes this for its object since There is no other one as goodAs men depend upon a king Whose fault they see for livelihood For although this consciousness of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception has seen the flaw in the base consisting of nothingness in this way This attainment has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as its near enemy notwithstanding that fact it takes it as its object in the absence of any otherLike whatAs men for the sake of livelihood depend on kings whose faults they seeFor just as for the sake of livelihood and because they cannot get a livelihood elsewhere people put up with some king ruler of all quarters who is unrestrained and harsh in bodily verbal and mental behaviour though they see his faults thus He is harshly behaved so too the consciousness of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception takes that base consisting of nothingness as its object in spite of seeing its faults in this way and it does so since it cannot find another better objectAs one who mounts a lofty stair Leans on its railings for a propAs one who climbs an airy peak Leans on the mountains very topAs one who stands on a crags edge Leans for support on his own kneesEach jhāna rests on that below For so it is with each of thesein the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the treatise on the Development of Concentrationcalled The Description of the Immaterial StatesThe tenth chapter Now comes the description of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment which was listed as the one perception next to the immaterial states Herein it nourishes  thus it is nutriment That is of four kinds as physical nutriment nutriment consisting of contact nutriment consisting of mental volition and nutriment consisting of consciousness But what is it here that nourishes whatPhysical nutriment nourishes the materiality of the octad that has nutritive essence as eighthcontact as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of feelingmental volition as nutriment nourishes rebirth linking in the three kinds of becomingconsciousness as nutriment nourishes mentalitymateriality at the moment of rebirthlinking Now when there is physical nutriment there is attachment which brings perilwhen there is nutriment as contact there is approaching which brings peril when there is nutriment as mental volition there is rebirthlinking which brings perilAnd to show how they bring fear thus physical nutriment should be illustrated by the simile of the childs flesh contact as nutriment by the simile of the hideless cow mental volition as nutriment by the simile of the pit of live coals and consciousness as nutriment by the simile of the hundred spears But of these four kinds of nutriment it is only physical nutriment classed as what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted that is intended here as nutriment in this senseThe perception arisen as the apprehension of the repulsive aspect in that nutriment is perception of repulsiveness in nutriment One who wants to develop that perception of repulsiveness in nutriment should learn the meditation subject and see that he has no uncertainty about even a single word of what he has learnt Then he should go into solitary retreat and review repulsiveness in ten aspects in the physical nutrimentclassified as what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted that is to say as to going seeking using secretion receptacle what is uncooked  what is cooked  fruit outflow and smearing Herein as to going even when a man has gone forth in so mighty a dispensation still after he has perhaps spent all night reciting the Enlightened Ones word or doing the ascetic s work after he has risen early to do the duties connected with the shrine terrace and the Enlightenmenttree terrace to set out the water for drinking and washing to sweep the grounds and to see to the needs of the body after he has sat down on his seat and given attention to his meditation subject twenty or thirty times and got up again then he must take his bowl and outer robe he must leave behind the ascetics woods that are not crowded with people offer the bliss of seclusion possess shade and water and are clean cool delightful places he must disregard the Noble Ones delight in seclusion and he must set out for the village in order to get nutriment as a jackal for the charnel groundAnd as he goes thus from the time when he steps down from his bed or chair he has to tread on a carpet covered with the dust of his feet geckos droppings and so onNext he has to see the doorstep which is more repulsive than the inside of the room since it is often fouled with the droppings of rats bats and so onNext the lower terrace which is more repulsive than the terrace above since it is all smeared with the droppings of owls pigeons and so onNext the grounds which are more repulsive than the lower floor since they are defiled by old grass and leaves blown about by the wind by sick novices urine excrement spittle and snot and in the rainy season by water mud and so onAnd he has to see the road to the monastery which is more repulsive than the groundsIn due course after standing in the debating lodge when he has finished paying homage at the Enlightenment Tree and the shrine he sets out thinking Instead of looking at the shrine that is like a cluster of pearls and the Enlightenment Tree that is as lovely as a bouquet of peacocks tail feathers and the abode that is as fair as a gods palace I must now turn my back on such a charming place and go abroad for the sake of food and on the way to the village the view of a road of stumps and thorns and an uneven road broken up by the force of water awaits himNext after he has put on his waist cloth as one who hides an abscess and tied his waist band as one who ties a bandage on a wound and robed himself in his upper robes as one who hides a skeleton and taken out his bowl as one who takes out a pan for medicine when he reaches the vicinity of the village gate perhaps the sight of an elephants carcass a horses carcass a buffalos carcass a human carcass a snakes carcass or a dogs carcass awaits himand not only that but he has to suffer his nose to be assailed by the smell of themNext as he stands in the village gateway he must scan the village streets in order to avoid danger from savage elephants horses and so on So this repulsive experience beginning with the carpet that has to be trodden on and ending with the various kinds of carcasses that have to be seen and smelled has to be undergone for the sake of nutrimentOh nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to going How as to seekingWhen he has endured the repulsiveness of going in this way and has gone into the village and is clothed in his cloak of patches he has to wander in the village streets from house to house like a beggar with a dish in his handAnd in the rainy season wherever he treads his feet sink into water and mire up to the flesh of the calves He has to hold the bowl in one hand and his robe up with the otherIn the hot season he has to go about with his body covered with the dirt grass and dust blown about by the windOn reaching such and such a house door he has to see and even to tread in gutters and cesspools covered with bluebottles and seething with all the species of worms all mixed up with fish washings meat washings rice washings spittle snot dogs and pigs excrement and what notfrom which flies come up and settle on his outer cloak of patches and on his bowl and on his headAnd when he enters a house some give and some do notAnd when they give some give yesterdays cooked rice and stale cakes and rancid jelly sauce and so onSome not giving say Please pass on venerable sir others keep silent as if they did not see him Some avert their faces Others treat him with harsh words such as Go away you baldheadWhen he has wandered for alms in the village in this way like a beggar he has to depart from itSo this experience beginning with the entry into the village and ending with the departure from it which is repulsive owing to the water mud etc that has to be trodden in and seen and endured has to be undergone for the sake of nutrimentOh nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to seeking How as to usingAfter he has sought the nutriment in this way and is sitting at ease in a comfortable place outside the village then so long as he has not dipped his hand into it he would be able to invite a respected bhikkhu or a decent person if he saw one to share itbut as soon as he has dipped his hand into it out of desire to eat he would be ashamed to say Take someAnd when he has dipped his hand in and is squeezing it up the sweat trickling down his five fingers wets any dry crisp food there may be and makes it soddenAnd when its good appearance has been spoilt by his squeezing it up and it has been made into a ball and put into his mouth then the lower teeth function as a mortar the upper teeth as a pestle and the tongue as a handIt gets pounded there with the pestle of the teeth like a dogs dinner in a dogs trough while he turns it over and over with his tongue then the thin spittle at the tip of the tongue smears it and the thick spittle behind the middle of the tongue smears it and the filth from the teeth in the parts where a toothstick cannot reach smears it When thus mashed up and besmeared this peculiar compound now destitute of the original colour and smell is reduced to a condition as utterly nauseating as a dogs vomit in a dogs troughYet notwithstanding that it is like this it can still be swallowed because it is no longer in range of the eyes focus This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to using How as to secretionBuddhas and Paccekabuddhas and Wheelturning Monarchs have only one of the four secretions consisting of bile phlegm pus and bloodbut those with weak merit have all fourSo when the food has arrived at the stage of being eaten and it enters inside then in one whose secretion of bile is in excess it becomes as utterly nauseating as if smeared with thick madhuka oilin one whose secretion of phlegm in excess it is as if smeared with the juice of nāgabalā leavesin one whose secretion of pus is in excess it is as if smeared with rancid buttermilkand in one whose secretion of blood is in excess it is as utterly nauseating as if smeared with dye This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to secretion How as to receptacleWhen it has gone inside the belly and is smeared with one of these secretions then the receptacle it goes into is no gold dish or crystal or silver dish and so onOn the contrary if it is swallowed by one ten years old it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for ten yearsIf it is swallowed by one twenty years old thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety ears oldif it is swallowed by one a hundred years old it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for a hundred years This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to receptacle How as to what is uncooked After this nutriment has arrived at such a place for its receptacle then for as long as it remains uncooked it stays in that same place just described which is shrouded in absolute darkness pervaded by draughts tainted by various smells of ordure and utterly fetid and loathsome And just as when a cloud out of season has rained during a drought and bits of grass and leaves and rushes and the carcasses of snakes dogs and human beings that have collected in a pit at the gate of an outcaste village remain there warmed by the suns heat until the pit becomes covered with froth and bubbles so too what has been swallowed that day and yesterday and the day before remains there together and being smothered by the layer of phlegm and covered with froth and bubbles produced by digestion through being fermented by the heat of the bodily fires it becomes quite loathsome This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is uncooked How as to what is cookedWhen it has been completely cooked there by the bodily fires it does not turn into gold silver etc as the ores of gold silver etc do through smeltingInstead giving off froth and bubbles it turns into excrement and fills the receptacle for digested food like brown clay squeezed with a smoothing trowel and packed into a tube and it turns into urine and fills the bladder This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is cooked How as to fruitWhen it has been rightly cooked it produces the various kinds of ordure consisting of head hairs body hairs nails teeth and the rest When wrongly cooked it produces the hundred diseases beginning with itch ringworm smallpox leprosy plague consumption coughs flux and so on Such is its fruit This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to fruit How as to outflowOn being swallowed it enters by one door after which it flows out by several doors in the way beginning Eyedirt from the eye ear dirt from the ear And on being swallowed it is swallowed even in the company of large gatheringsBut on flowing out now converted into excrement urine etc it is excreted only in solitudeOn the first day one is delighted to eat it elated and full of happiness and joyOn the second day one stops ones nose to void it with a wry face disgusted and dismayedAnd on the first day one swallows it lustfully greedily gluttonously infatuatedly But on the second day after a single night has passed one excretes it with distaste ashamed humiliated and disgustedHence the Ancients said The food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suckGo in all by a single door But by nine doors come oozing outThe food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suckMen like to eat in company But to excrete in secrecyThe food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suckThese a man eats with high delight And then excretes with dumb disgustThe food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suckA single night will be enough To bring them to putridityThis is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to outflow How as to smearingAt the time of using it he smears his hands lips tongue and palateand they become repulsive by being smeared with it And even when washed they have to be washed again and again in order to remove the smellAnd just as when rice is being boiled the husks the red powder covering the grain etc rise up and smear the mouth rim and lid of the cauldron so too when eaten it rises up during its cooking and simmering by the bodily fire that pervades the whole body it turns into tartar which smears the teethand it turns into spittle phlegm etc which respectively smear the tongue palate etc and it turns into eyedirt eardirt snot urine excrement etc which respectively smear the eyes ears nose and nether passagesAnd when these doors are smeared by it they never become either clean or pleasing even though washed every dayAnd after one has washed a certain one of these the hand has to be washed againAnd after one has washed a certain one of these the repulsiveness does not depart from it even after two or three washings with cow dung and clay and scented powder This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to smearingAs he reviews repulsiveness in this way in ten aspects and strikes at it with thought and applied thought physical nutriment becomes evident to him in its repulsive aspectHe cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices itAs he does so the hindrances are suppressedand his mind is concentrated in access concentration but without reaching absorption because of the profundity of physical nutriment as a state with an individual essenceBut perception is evident here in the apprehension of the repulsive aspectwhich is why this meditation subject goes by the name of perception of repulsiveness in nutriment When a bhikkhu devotes himself to this perception of repulsiveness in nutriment his mind retreats retracts and recoils from craving for flavoursHe nourishes himself with nutriment without vanity and only for the purpose of crossing over suffering as one who seeks to cross over the desert eats his own dead childs flesh Then his greed for the five cords of sense desire comes to be fully understood without difficulty by means of the full understanding of the physical nutrimentHe fully understands the materiality aggregate by means of the fullunderstanding of the five cords of sense desireDevelopment of mindfulness occupied with the body comes to perfection in him through the repulsiveness of what is uncooked and the rest He has entered upon a way that is in conformity with the perception of foulnessAnd by keeping to this way even if he does not experience the deathless goal in this life he is at least bound for a happy destinyThis is the detailed explanation of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutrimentNow comes the description of the development of the definition of the four elements which was listed as the one defining next to the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment Herein defining is determining by characterizing individual essences The compound catudhātuvavatthāna is resolvable into catunnaṃ dhātūnaṃ vavatthānaṃ Attention given to elements the meditation subject consisting of elements and defining of the four elements all mean the same thingThis is given in two ways in brief and in detailIt is given in brief in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta and in detail in the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta  the Rāhulovāda Sutta  and the Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta Bhikkhus just as though a skilled butcher or butchers apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces so too bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this body however placed however disposed as consisting of elements In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element It is given in brief in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta for one of quick understanding whose meditation subject is elements as  The meaning is this just as though a clever butcher or his apprentice who worked for his keep had killed a cow and divided it up and were seated at the crossroads reckoned as the intersection of the main roads going in the four directions having laid it out part by part so too a bhikkhu reviews the body however placed because it is in some one of the four posturesand however disposed because it is so placed thus In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air elementWhat is meantJust as the butcher while feeding the cow bringing it to the shambles keeping it tied up after bringing it there slaughtering it and seeing it slaughtered and dead does not lose the perception cow so long as he has not carved it up and divided it into partsbut when he has divided it up and is sitting there he loses the perception cow and the perception meat occurshe does not think I am selling cow or They are carrying cow awaybut rather he thinks I am selling meat or They are carrying meat away so too this bhikkhu while still a foolish ordinary personboth formerly as a layman and as one gone forth into homelessnessdoes not lose the perception living being or man or person so long as he does not by resolution of the compact into elements review this body however placed however disposed as consisting of elementsBut when he does review it as consisting of elements he loses the perception living being and his mind establishes itself upon elementsThat is why the Blessed One said Bhikkhus just as though a skilled butcher  were seated at the crossroads  so too bhikkhus a bhikkhu  air element In the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta as follows And what is the internal earth element friendsWhatever there is internally in oneself that is hard harsh and clung to that is to say head hairs body hairs teeth nails skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidney heart liver midriff spleen lungs bowels entrails gorge dung or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is hard harsh and clung to this is called the internal earth element And What is the internal water element friendsWhatever there is internally in oneself that is water watery and clung tothat is to say bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urine or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is water watery and clung tothis is called the internal water element And What is the internal fire element friendsWhatever there is internally in oneself that is fire fiery and clung tothat is to say that whereby one is warmed ages and burns up and whereby what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted gets completely digested or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is fire fiery and clung tothis is called the internal fire element And What is the internal air element friendsWhatever there is internally in oneself that is air airy and clung tothat is to say upgoing winds down going winds winds in the belly winds in the bowels winds that course through all the limbs inbreath and outbreath or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is air airy and clung tothis is called the internal air element  it is given in detail for one of not over quick understanding whose meditation subject is elementsand as here so also in the Rāhulovāda and Dhātuvibhaṅga SuttasHere is the commentary on the words that are not clear Internally in oneself  both these words are terms for what is ones own  since what is ones own is what is produced in ones own self the meaning is included in ones continuity This is called internal because it occurs in self just as in the world speech among women is called speech belongingtowomen  And it is called in oneself because it occurs owing to self Hard rigidHarsh roughHerein the first is a word for the characteristic while the second is a word for the mode for the earth element is characterized as hard but its mode is rough which is why it is called harshClung to taken firmly by kamma the meaning is firmly taken seized adhered to as I mine That is to say the word seyyathidaṃ is a particleits meaning is What is thatNext showing what that is head hairs body hairs etc is saidAnd here the brain must be added since it has to be understood that the earth element needs to be described in twenty modesOr whatever else the earth element included in the remaining three portions It flows  flows on  to such and such a place as a state of streaming thus it is water The watery is what is gone among such various kinds of water as the kammaoriginated and so onWhat is thatIt is what has the water elements characteristic of cohesion Fire is definable as heating  The fiery is what is gone  in the way already described among the kinds of fire What is thatIt is what has the characteristic of heatWhereby by means of which the fire element when excited this body is warmed becomes heated by the state of one day fever and so onAges whereby this body grows old reaches the decline of the faculties loss of strength wrinkles grayness and so onBurns up whereby when excited it causes this body to burnand the person cries out I am burning I am burning and longs for ghee a hundred times washed and for gosīsa sandalwood ointment etc and for the breeze of a fanAnd whereby what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted gets completely digested whereby the boiled rice etc that is eaten or the beverage etc that is drunk or the hard food consisting of flour biscuits etc that is chewed the mango fruit honey molasses etc that is tasted gets completely cooked gets its juice etc extracted is the meaningAnd here the first three kinds of fire element that is to say is warmed ages and burns up are of fourfold origination while the last is only kammaoriginatedAir is definable as blowing  The airy is what is gone  in the way already described among the kinds of airWhat is thatIt is what has the characteristic of distensionUpgoing winds winds mounting upwards that cause the occurrence of vomiting belching and so onDowngoing winds winds descending downwards that expel excrement and urineWinds in the belly winds outside the bowelsWinds in the bowels winds inside the bowelsWinds that course through all the limbs winds that produce flexing extending etc and are distributed over the limbs and the whole body by means of the network of veins Inbreath wind in the nostrils entering inOutbreath wind in the nostrils issuing outAnd here the first five are of fourfold originationInbreath and outbreath are consciousnessoriginatedIn each instance the phrase or whatever else comprises respectively the water element the fire element or the air element included in the other three portionsSo the four elements have been detailed in fortytwo aspects that is to say the earth element in twenty aspects the water element in twelve the fire element in four and the air element in six This firstly is the commentary on the texts hereAs regards the method of development here however to discern the elements in detail in this way The head hairs are the earth element the body hairs are the earth element appears redundant to a bhikkhu of quick understandingWhat has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth elementwhat has the characteristic of cohesion is the water elementwhat has the characteristic of ripening is the fire elementwhat has the characteristic of distending is the air element  though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in this wayBut when one of not overquick understanding gives his attention to it in this way it appears obscure and unevidentand it only becomes plain to him if he gives his attention to it in the firstmentioned wayWhySuppose two bhikkhus are reciting a text with many elided repetitions then the bhikkhu with the quicker understanding fills out the elided repetitions once or twice after which he goes on doing the recital with only the two end parts of the elisionsHere the one of less quick understanding says What is he reciting Why he does not even give one time to move ones lips If the recitation is done like this when shall we ever get familiar with the textand so he does his recitation filling out each elision as it comesThen the other says What is he reciting Why he never lets one get to the end of it If the recitation is done like this when shall we ever get to the end of itSo too the detailed discerning of the elements by head hairs etc appears redundant to one of quick understandingthough the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in brief in this way What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element and so onBut when the other gives his attention to it in this way it appears obscure and unevidentand it only becomes plain to him if he gives his attention in detail by head hairs and so onSo firstly one of quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should go into solitary retreat Then he should advert to his own entire material body and discern the elements in brief in this way In this body what is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth elementwhat is cohesion or fluidity is the water elementwhat is maturing or heat is the fire elementwhat is distension or movement is the air element And he should advert and give attention to it and review it again and again as earth element water element that is to say as mere elements not a living being and soullessAs he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in him which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of the elements and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual essences as its objectOr alternatively there are these four bodily parts mentioned by the General of the Dhamma the Elder Sāriputta for the purpose of showing the absence of any living being in the four great primary elements thus When a space is enclosed with bones and sinews and flesh and skin there comes to be the term material form  And he should resolve each of these as a separate entity separating them out by the hand of knowledge and then discern them in the way already stated thus In these what is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element  And he should again and again advert to them give attention to them and review them as mere elements not a living being not a soulAs he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in him which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of the elements and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual essences as its objectThis is the method of development when the definition of the elements is given in briefThe method given in detail should be understood in this wayA meditator of not overquick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should learn the elements in detail in the fortytwo aspects from a teacher and he should live in an abode of the kind already described Then when he has done all the duties he should go into solitary retreat and develop the meditation subject in four ways thus with constituents in brief with constituents by analysis with characteristics in brief and with characteristics by analysisHerein how does he develop it with constituents in briefHere a bhikkhu does his defining in this way In twenty of the parts what has the stiffened mode is the earth elementand he does his defining thus In twelve parts the liquid called water with the mode of cohesion is the water element and he does his defining thus In four parts what matures is the fire elementand he does his defining thus In six parts what has the mode of distending is the air elementAs he defines them in this way they become evident to himAs he again and again adverts to them and gives his attention to them concentration arises as access onlyHowever if his meditation subject is not successful while he develops it in this way then he should develop it with constituents by analysisHowFirstly the bhikkhu should carry out all the directions given for the thirtytwofold aspect in the description of mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject  namely the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving attentionand he should start with the verbal recitation in direct and reverse order of the skin pentad and so on without omitting any of itThe only difference is this there after giving attention to the head hairs etc as to colour shape direction location and delimitation the mind had to be fixed by means of repulsiveness  but here it is done by means of elementsTherefore at the end of each part after giving attention to head hairs etc each in the five ways beginning with colour  attention should be given as follows These things called head hairs grow on the inner skin that envelops the skullHerein just as when kuṇṭha grasses grow on the top of an anthill the top of the termitemound does not know Kuṇṭha grasses are growing on me nor do the kuṇṭha grasses know We are growing on the top of a termitemound so too the inner skin that covers the

indeterminate void not a living being liquid water element in the mode of cohesionWhen he has given his attention in this way to the body hairs etc he should then give his attention to the four fire components thus That whereby one is warmed this is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is fire element in the mode of maturing  That whereby one ages  That whereby one burns up  That whereby what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted becomes completely digested this is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is fire element in the mode of maturing  After that having discovered the upgoing winds as upgoing the downgoing winds as downgoing the winds in the belly as in the belly the winds in the bowels as in the bowels the winds that course through all the limbs as coursing through all the limbs and inbreath and out breath as inbreath and outbreath he should give his attention to these six air components in this way What is called upgoing winds is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is air element in the mode of distending What is called downgoing winds  What is called winds in the belly  What is called winds in the bowels  What is called winds that course through all the limbs  What is called inbreath and outbreath is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is air element in the mode of distendingAs he gives his attention in this way the elements become evident to himAs he adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already describedBut if his meditation subject is still not successful when he gives his attention to it in this way then he should develop it with characteristics in briefHowIn the twenty components the characteristic of stiffenedness should be defined as the earth elementand the characteristic of cohesion which is there too as the water elementand the characteristic of maturing  which is there too as the fire elementand the characteristic of distension which is there too as the air elementIn the twelve components the characteristic of cohesion should be defined as the waterelement the characteristic of maturing  which is there too as the fire elementthe characteristic of distension which is there too as the air elementand the characteristic of stiffenedness which is there too as the earth elementIn the four components the characteristic of maturing should be defined as the fire elementthe characteristic of distension unresolvable from it as the air elementthe characteristic of stiffenedness as the earth elementand the characteristic of cohesion as the water elementIn the six components the characteristic of distension should be defined as the air elementthe characteristic of stiffenedness there too as the earth elementthe characteristic of cohesion as the water elementand the characteristic of maturing as the fire elementAs he defines them in this way the elements become evident to himAs he adverts to them and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already statedHowever if he still does not succeed with his meditation subject when he gives his attention to it in this way then he should develop it with characteristics by analysisHowAfter discerning head hairs etc in the way already described the characteristic of stiffenedness in head hairs should be defined as the earth elementthe characteristic of cohesion there too as the water elementthe characteristic of maturing as the fire elementand the characteristic of distension as the air elementThe four elements should be defined in this way in the case of each componentAs he defines them in this way the elements become evident to himAs he adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already describedIn addition attention should be given to the elements in the following ways as to word meaning by groups by particles by characteristic etc as to how originated as to variety and unity as to resolution and nonresolution  as to the similar and the dissimilar as to distinction between internal and external as to inclusion as to condition as to lack of conscious reaction as to analysis of conditions Herein one who gives his attention to them as to word meaning should do so separately and generally thus separately it is earth because it is spread out it flows or it glides or it satisfies  thus it is water it heats  thus it is fire it blows  thus it is air But without differentiation they are elements because of bearing their own characteristics because of grasping suffering and because of sorting out suffering This is how they should be given attention as to word meaning By groups there is the earth element described under the twenty aspects beginning with head hairs body hairs and also the water element described under the twelve aspects beginning with bile phlegm etc Now as to theseColour odour taste and nutritive essence and the four elementsFrom combination of these eight there comes the common usage head hairsAnd separately from these eight there is no common usage head hairsConsequently head hairs are only a mere group of eight statesLikewise body hairs and the restA component here that is kammaoriginated is a group of ten states that is to say the former eight together with the life faculty and sexBut it is on account of respective prominence of stiffenedness or cohesion that it comes to be styled earth element or water elementThis is how they should be given attention to by groups By particles in this body the earth element taken as reduced to fine dust and powdered to the size of the smallest atom might amount to an average doṇa measure fulland that is held together by the water element measuring half as much Being maintained by the fire element and distended by the air element it does not get scattered or dissipated Instead of getting scattered or dissipated it arrives at the alternative states of the female and male sex etc and manifests smallness bigness length shortness toughness rigidity and so on The liquid water element that is the mode of cohesion being founded on earth maintained by fire and distended by air does not trickle or run away Instead of trickling or running away it provides continued refreshmentsAnd here the fire element that cooks what is eaten drunk etc and is the mode of warming and has the characteristic of heat being established on earth held together by water and distended by air maintains this body and ensures its proper appearanceAnd this body being maintained by it shows no putrefactionThe air element that courses through all the limbs and has the characteristic of moving and distending being founded upon earth held together by water and maintained by fire distends this bodyAnd this body being distended by the latter kind of air does not collapse but stands erectand being propelled by the other motile air it shows intimation and it flexes and extends and it wriggles the hands and feet doing so in the postures comprising of walking standing sitting and lying downSo this mechanism of elements carries on like a magic trick deceiving foolish people with the male and female sex and so on This is how they should be given attention by particles As to characteristic etc he should advert to the four elements in this way The earth elementwhat are its characteristic function manifestation defining them in this way The earth element has the characteristic of hardness Its function is to act as a foundation It is manifested as receivingThe water element has the characteristic of trickling Its function is to intensify It is manifested as holding togetherThe fire element has the characteristic of heat Its function is to mature  It is manifested as a continued supply of softnessThe air element has the characteristic of distending Its function is to cause motion It is manifested as conveyingThis is how they should be given attention to by characteristic and so on As to how originated among the fortytwo components beginning with head hairs shown in the detailed treatment of the earth element etcthe four consisting of gorge dung pus and urine are temperatureoriginated onlythe four consisting of tears sweat spittle and snot are temperatureoriginated and consciousnessoriginated onlyThe fire that cooks what is eaten etc is kamma originated onlyinbreath and outbreath are consciousnessoriginated onlyall the rest are of fourfold origination This is how they should be given attention as to how originated As to variety and unity there is variety in the specific characteristics etc of all the elementsfor the characteristic function and manifestation of the earth element is oneand those of the water element etc are differentBut there is unity in them as materiality great primary element state  imperma nence etc notwithstanding the fact that they are various according to specific characteristic etc and according to origination by kamma and so onAll these elements are instances of materiality because they do not exceed the characteristic of being molested They are great primaries by reason of great manifestation and so onBy reason of great manifestation and so on means that these elements are called great primaries for the following reasons namely manifestation of greatness likeness to great creatures great maintenance great alteration and because they are great and because they are entitiesHerein manifestation of greatness they are manifested as great both in a continuity that is not clung to and in a continuity that is clung toFor their manifestation of greatness in a continuity that is not clung to is givenTwo times a hundred thousand leagues and then four nahutas as wellThis earth this bearer of all wealth Has that much thickness as they tell in the description of the recollection of the Buddha in the way beginning And they are manifested on a great scale also in a continuity that is clung to for instance in the bodies of fishes turtles deities Dānava demons and so onFor this is said Bhikkhus there are individual creatures of a hundred leagues in the great ocean  and so on Likeness to great creatures just as a magician turns water that is not crystal into crystal and turns a clod that is not gold into gold and shows themand being himself neither a spirit nor a bird shows himself as a spirit or a bird so too being themselves not blueblack they turn themselves into blueblack derived materiality being themselves not yellow  not red  not white they turn themselves into white derived materiality and show that In this way they are great primaries in being like the great creatures of a magician And just as whomsoever the great creatures such as the spirits grasp hold of  they have no standing place either inside him or outside him and yet they have no standing independently of him so too these elements are not found to stand either inside or outside each other yet they have no standing independently of one another Thus they are also great primaries in being equal to the great creatures such as the spirits because they have no thinkable standing place relative to each other And just as the great creatures known as female spirits conceal their own fearfulness with a pleasing colour shape and gesture to deceive beings so too these elements conceal each their own characteristic and function classed as hardness etc by means of a pleasing skin colour of womens and mens bodies etc and pleasing shapes of limbs and pleasing gestures of fingers toes and eyebrows and they deceive simple people by concealing their own functions and characteristics beginning with hardness and do not allow their individual essences to be seen Thus they are great primaries in being equal to the great creatures  the female spirits since they are deceivers Great maintenance this is because they have to be sustained by the great requisitesFor these elements are great primaries since they have become  have occurred by means of the food clothing etc which are great in importance because they have to be found every dayOr alternatively they are great primaries since they are primaries whose maintenance is great Great alteration the unclungto and the clungto are the basis of great alterationsHerein the great alteration of the unclungto evidences itself in the emergence of an aeon and that of the clungto in the disturbance of the elements in the bodyFor accordinglyOut of the ground and races higher And higher right to the Brahmā heavenThe conflagrations flame bursts up When the world is burnt up by fireA whole world system measuring One hundred thousand millions wideSubsides as with its furious waters The flood dissolves the world besideOne hundred thousand million leagues A whole world systems broad extentIs rent and scattered when the world Succumbs to the air elementThe bite of woodenmouths can make The body stiff to all intentWhen roused is its earth element It might be gripped by such a snakeThe bite of rottenmouths can make The body rot to all intentWhen roused its water element It might be gripped by such a snakeThe bite of fierymouths can make The body burn to all intentWhen roused is its fire element It might be gripped by such a snakeThe bite of daggermouths can make The body burst to all intentWhen roused is its air element It might be gripped by such a snakeSo they are great primaries because they have become the basis of great alteration Because they are great and because they are entities great because they need great effort to discern them and entities because they are existent thus they are great primaries because they are great and because they are entities This is how all these elements are great primaries by reason of great manifestation and so onAgain they are elements because of bearing their own characteristics because of grasping suffering and because of sorting out suffering  and because none of them are exempt from the characteristic of being elementsThey are states owing to bearing their own characteristics and owing to their so bearing for the length of the moment appropriate to themThey are impermanent in the sense of liability to destructionthey are painful in the sense of causing terrorthey are not self in the sense of having no core of permanence and so onThus there is unity of all since all are materiality great primaries elements states impermanent and so on This is how they should be given attention as to variety and unity As to resolution and nonresolution  they are positionally unresolvable since they always arise together in every single minimal material group consisting of the bare octad and the othersbut they are resolvable by characteristic This is how they should be given attention as to resolution and nonresolution  As to the similar and dissimilar and although they are unresolved in this way yet the first two similar in heavinessand so are the last two in lightnessbut for this reason the first two are dissimilar to the last two and the last two to the first two This is how they should be given attention as to the similar and dissimilar As to distinction between internal and external the internal elements are the material support for the physical bases of consciousness for the kinds of intimation and for the material faculties They are associated with postures and they are of fourfold originationThe external elements are of the opposite kind This is how they should be given attention as to distinction between internal and external As to inclusion kammaoriginated earth element is included together with the other kammaoriginated elements because there is no difference in their originationLikewise the consciousnessoriginated is included together with other consciousnessoriginated elements This is how they should be given attention as to inclusion As to condition the earth element which is held together by water maintained by fire and distended by air is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their foundationThe water element which is founded on earth maintained by fire and distended by air is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their cohesionThe fire element which is founded on earth held together by water and distended by air is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their maintainingThe air element which is founded on earth held together by water and maintained by fire is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their distension This is how they should be given attention as to condition As to lack of conscious reaction here too the earth element does not know I am the earth element or I am a condition by acting as a foundation for three great primaries And the other three do not know The earth element is a condition for us by acting as a foundation for three great primariesAnd the other three do not know The earth element is a condition for us by acting as our foundationAnd similarly in each instance This is how they should be given attention as to lack of conscious reaction As to analysis of conditions there are four conditions for the elements that is to say kamma consciousness nutriment and temperatureHerein kamma only is the condition for the kammaoriginated elements consciousness  etc ie nutriment and temperature are notConsciousness etc only are the conditions for the consciousnessoriginated elements the others are notKamma is the producing condition for the kammaoriginated elements for the rest it is indirectly the decisivesupportive conditionConsciousness is the producing condition for the consciousnessoriginated elements for the rest it is the postnascence condition presence condition and nondisappearance conditionNutriment is the producing condition for the nutrimentoriginated elements for the rest it is the nutriment condition presence condition and nondisappearance conditionTemperature is the productive condition for the temperatureoriginated elements for the rest it is the presence condition and nondisappearance conditionHerein the kammaoriginated great primary is the condition for the kamma originated great primaries and also for the consciousnessoriginated great primariesLikewise are the consciousnessoriginated great primary and the nutriment originated great primaryThe temperatureoriginated great primary is the condition for the temperatureoriginated great primaries and also for the kammaoriginated great primaries and so on  Herein the kammaoriginated earth element is a condition for the other kammaoriginated elements both as conascence mutuality support presence and nondisappearance conditions and as foundation but not as producing conditionIt is a condition for the other three great primaries in a triple continuity as support presence and nondisappearance conditions but not as foundation or producing conditionAnd here the water element is a condition for the remaining three elements both as conascence etc conditions and as cohesion but not as producing conditionAnd for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support presence and nondisappearance conditions too but not as cohesion or producing conditionAnd the fire element here is a condition for the other three elements both as conascence etc conditions and as maintaining but not as producing conditionAnd for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support presence and nondisappearance conditions too but not as maintaining or producing conditionAnd the air element here is a condition for the other three elements both as conascence etc conditions and as distension but not as producing conditionAnd for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support presence and non disappearance conditions too but not as distension or producing conditionThe same method applies in the case of the consciousnessoriginated the nutrimentoriginated and the temperatureoriginated earth element and the rest And when these elements have been made to occur through the influence of the conascence etc conditionsWith three in four ways to one due And likewise with one due to threeWith two in six ways due to twoThus their occurrence comes to be Taking each one beginning with earth there are three others whose occurrence is due to that one thus with three due to one their occurrence takes place in four waysLikewise each one beginning with earth occurs in dependence on the other three thus with one due to three their occurrence takes place in four waysBut with the last two dependent on the first two with the first two dependent on the last two with the second and fourth dependent on the first and third with the first and third dependent on the second and fourth with the second and third dependent on the first and fourth and with the first and fourth dependent on the second and third they occur in six ways with two elements due to two At the time of moving forward and moving backward  the earth element among these is a condition for pressingThat seconded by the water element is a condition for establishing on a foundationBut the water element seconded by the earth element is a condition for lowering downThe fire element seconded by the air element is a condition for lifting upThe air element seconded by the fire element is a condition for shifting forwards and shifting sideways  This is how they should be given attention as to analysis of conditions As he gives his attention to them as to word meaning etc in this way the elements become evident to him under each headingAs he again and again adverts and gives attention to them access concentration arises in the way already describedAnd this concentration too is called definition of the four elements because it arises in one who defines the four elements owing to the influence of his knowledge This bhikkhu who is devoted to the defining of the four elements immerses himself in voidness and eliminates the perception of living beingsSince he does not entertain false notions about wild beasts spirits ogres etc because he has abolished the perception of living beings he conquers fear and dread and conquers delight and aversion  he is not exhilarated or depressed by agreeable and disagreeable thingsand as one of great understanding he either ends in the deathless or he is bound for a happy destinyThe noble meditator lion Will make this mighty theme his sportDefining the four elements Is ever the wise mans resortThis is the description of the development of the defining of the four elementsThis completes in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the clause How should it be developed in the set of questions beginning with What is concentration which was formulated in order to show the method of development of concentration in detail  This concentration as intended here is twofold that is to say access concentration and absorption concentrationHerein the unification of mind in the case of ten meditation subjects and in the consciousness preceding absorption in the case of the remaining meditation subjects is access concentrationThe unification of mind in the case of the remaining meditation subjects is absorption concentrationAnd so it is developed in two forms with the development of these meditation subjectsHence it was said above This completes in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the clause How should it be developed The question what are the benefits of the development of concentration was also asked however  Herein the benefits of the development of concentration are fivefold as a blissful abiding here and now and so onFor the development of absorption concentration provides the benefit of a blissful abiding here and now for the Arahants with cankers destroyed who develop concentration thinking We shall attain and dwell with unified mind for a whole dayHence the Blessed One said But Cunda it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones disciplinethese are called blissful abidings in the Noble Ones discipline  When ordinary people and trainers develop it thinking After emerging we shall exercise insight with concentrated consciousness the development of absorption concentration provides them with the benefit of insight by serving as the proximate cause for insight and so too does access concentration as a method of arriving at wide open conditions in crowded circumstancesHence the Blessed One said Bhikkhus develop concentrationa bhikkhu who is concentrated understands correctly  But when they have already produced the eight attainments and then aspiring to the kinds of directknowledge described in the way beginning Having been one he becomes many  they produce them by entering upon jhāna as the basis for directknowledge and emerging from it then the development of absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of the kinds of directknowledge since it becomes the proximate cause for the kinds of directknowledge whenever there is an occasionHence the Blessed One said He attains the ability to be a witness through realization by directknowledge of any state realizable by directknowledge to which his mind inclines whenever there is an occasion  When ordinary people have not lost their jhāna and they aspire to rebirth in the Brahmāworld thus Let us be reborn in the Brahmāworld or even though they do not make the actual aspiration then the development of absorption concentration provides them with the benefits of an improved form of existence since it ensures that for themHence the Blessed One said Where do they reappear after developing the first jhāna limitedlyThey reappear in the company of the deities of Brahmās Retinue  and so onAnd even the development of access concentration ensures an improved form of existence in the happy destinies of the sensual sphere But when Noble Ones who have already produced the eight attainments develop concentration thinking We shall enter upon the attainment of cessation and by being without consciousness for seven days we shall abide in bliss here and now by reaching the cessation that is Nibbāna then the development of absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of cessationHence it is said Understanding as mastery owing to  sixteen kinds of behaviour of knowledge and to nine kinds of behaviour of concentration is knowledge of the attainment of cessation  That is how this benefit of the development of concentration is fivefold as a blissful abiding here and now and so onIt cleans defiling stains pollution And brings rewards past calculationSo wise men fail not in devotion To the pursuit of concentration And at this point in the Path of Purification which is taught under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding in the stanza When a wise man established well in virtue  concentration has been fully explainedin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peopleconcluding The Description of ConcentrationThe eleventh chapter
