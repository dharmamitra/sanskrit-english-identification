As these factors are strengthened through the continued practice of jhāna they make possible a clearer awareness of sensory processes as they occurThe factors of rapture serenity  equanimity existing independently of the input of the five senses make the mind less involved in sensory pleasures less inclined to search for emotional satisfaction from them the factors of mindfulness investigation of phenomena persistence  concentration enable clear insight into the events that make up sensory perceptionTo see events in the body  mind simply as that  events conditioned arising  passing away  creates a further sense of distance disenchantment  deidentificationKnowing  seeing the eye as it has come to be knowing  seeing forms eyeconsciousness eyecontact as they have come to be knowing  seeing whatever arises conditioned by eyecontact  experienced as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  as it has come to be one is uninfatuated with the eye forms eyeconsciousness eyecontact whatever arises conditioned by eyecontact and is experienced as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor painKnowing  seeing the ear Knowing  seeing the nose Knowing  seeing the tongue Knowing  seeing

contact  experienced as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  as it has come to be one is uninfatuated with the intellect ideas intellectconsciousness intellectcontact whatever arises conditioned by intellectcontact and is experienced as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor painFor him  remaining uninfatuated unconjoined unconfused  the five aggregates for sustenance head toward future diminutionThe craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now this  now that  is abandoned by himHis bodily disturbances  mental disturbances are abandonedHis bodily torments  mental torments are abandonedHis bodily distresses  mental distresses are abandonedHe is sensitive both to ease of body  ease of awarenessAny view belonging to one who has come to be like this is his right viewAny resolve his right resolveAny effort his right effortAny mindfulness his right mindfulnessAny concentration his right concentration just as earlier his actions speech  livelihood were already wellpurifiedThus for him the noble eightfold path goes to the culmination of its development the four establishings of mindfulness go to the culmination of their development the seven factors for Awakening go to the culmination of their developmentfor him these two qualities occur in tandem tranquility  insightWith the union of tranquility  insight at the culmination of the path Awakening occursThe Canon records many instances where Awakening is sudden  total and many where it occurs in stages The reason for the difference isnt stated but perhaps in sudden Awakening the mind goes through the various stages in quick successionAt any rate a brief look at the stages will give something of an idea of the dynamics of the minds UnbindingThe standard list of the stages gives four and describes them in terms of how many of the ten Fetters the mind sheds identityviews uncertainty grasping at habits  practices sensual passion irritation passion for form passion for formlessness conceit restlessness  ignoranceThere are in this community of monks monks who with the total ending of three Fetters are Streamwinners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakeningThere are monks who with the total ending of three fetters and the waning of passion aversion  delusion are OncereturnersAfter returning only once to this world they will put an end to stressThere are monks who with the total ending of the first five Fetters are due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldThere are monks who are Arahants whose effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosisAn alternative way of classifying the stages lists threeThere is the case of the monk who has attained full accomplishment with regard to virtue a modicum of accomplishment with regard to concentration and a modicum with regard to discernmentThere is the case of the monk who has attained full accomplishment with regard to virtue full accomplishment with regard to concentration and a modicum of accomplishment with regard to discernmentThere is the case of the monk who has attained full accomplishment with regard to virtue full accomplishment with regard to concentration and full accomplishment with regard to discernmentWith the ending of the effluents he remains in the effluentless release of awareness  release of discernment having known and made them manifest for himself right in the presentAs the text makes clear Streamwinners and Oncereturners are those who have fully developed virtue Nonreturners are those who have fully developed virtue  concentration and Arahants are those who have fully developed all three parts of the path virtue concentration  discernmentThis is not to say however that Streamwinners have not developed discernment to a fairly high degreeIn fact the unvarying definition of Streamwinners is that they have seen with discernment and their level of Awakening is called the arising of the Dhamma eyeWhat they see with this Dhamma eye is always expressed in the same termsThen VenAssaji gave this exposition of Dhamma to Sāriputta the WandererThen to Sāriputta the wanderer as he heard this exposition of Dhamma there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationFor this realization to occur it must follow on a glimpse of what stands in opposition to all that is subject to origination ie a glimpse of the Unconditioned  deathlessnessSāriputta the wanderer went to Moggallāna the wandererMoggallāna the wanderer saw him coming from afar and on seeing himsaid Bright are your faculties my friend pure your complexion  clearCould it be that you have attained the DeathlessYes my friend I haveAlthough their Awakening is not yet complete Streamwinners see enough of the Deathless to remove all uncertainty about the Buddhas teachingsTo Upāli the householder as he was sitting right there there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThen  having seen the Dhamma having reached the Dhamma known the Dhamma gained a footing in the Dhamma having crossed over  beyond uncertainty having had no more questioning  Upāli the householder gained fearlessness and became independent of others with regard to the Teachers messageTheir glimpse of deathlessness is also enough to convince Streamwinners of the worthlessness of identity views that center on the five aggregates of sustenance all of which come under the category of all that is subject to originationMāgandiya it is just as if there were a blind man who couldnt see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moonNow suppose that a certain man were to take a grimy oilstained rag and fool him saying Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean The blind man would take it and wear itThen suppose his friends companions  relatives took him to a doctor and the doctor treated him with medicine purges from above  purges from below ointments  counterointments and treatments through the noseAnd thanks to the medicine his eyesight would appear  grow clearThen together with the arising of his eyesight he would abandon whatever passion  delight he felt for that grimy oilstained ragAnd he would regard that man as an enemy  no friend at all and think that he deserved to be killedMy gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by that man  his grimy oilstained rag Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean In the same way Māgandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma  this freedom from Disease this Unbinding  and you on your part were to understand that freedom from Disease and see that Unbinding then together with the arising of your eyesight you would abandon whatever passion  delight you felt with regard for the five aggregates for sustenanceAnd it would occur to you My gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by this mindFor in clinging it was just form that I was clinging to it was just feeling just perception just fabrications just consciousness that I was clinging toWith my clinging as condition there is becoming birth aging  death sorrow lamentation pains distresses  despairs all come into playAnd thus is the origination of this entire mass of stressBecause they realize that their glimpse of the goal came through an act of discernment Streamwinners no longer grasp at habits  practicesWhat this means is that they no longer view mere adherence to habits  practices as a sufficient means to the goal in  of itself although they continue to abide by the habits of right speech action  livelihood and by the practice of jhāna that fostered their discernment to begin withHaving seen the efficacy of their own actions they will never intentionally do evil againThis is what perfects their virtueStill they have yet to fully comprehend the practice of jhāna and so their minds remain attached to the phenomena  with  without form  on which that practice is basedAs the texts say they are bound by their incomplete mastery of concentration  discernment and by seven remaining Fetters to the cycle of birth  deathAs for Nonreturners they have mastered jhāna to the extent that they can use it as a vantage point for watching the arising  passing away that occurs in reference to the five senses while the pleasure rapture  equanimity it offers serve them as a fulcrum point for uprooting any desire for the pleasures of those five senses together with all feelings of irritation that come when such desires are not metThey too have seen the Deathless but as with Streamwinners their discernment is not yet fully comprehensive They have yet to turn it on the act of seeing the tools  tranquility  insight  that lead to that discernment and the subtle levels of passion  delight that accompany itThe texts express this point in a variety of waysSome passages simply list the Fetters that Nonreturners have yet to abandon passion for form passion for formlessness conceit restlessness  ignoranceOthers give more experiential accounts of what is happening in a Nonreturners mindFrom reading these latter accounts it is possible to see how the five Fetters in the list are interconnected Although Nonreturners shed attachment to identity views back when they attained Stream entry they still have a lingering sense of the conceit I am associated with the five aggregates for sustenance  possessing form  formless  as they function subtly in the arising of tranquility  insight as a process of becomingAnd while they have gained enough insight into the five senses to let go of any attachment to them they still suffer from a certain amount of ignorance concerning the subtler level of becoming inherent in that conceitThis leads to refined forms of passion  delight that keep them restless  bound to the sixth sense the mindThere is the case nanda where a monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perceptions fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution empty not selfHe turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the phenomenon of deathlessness This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion stopping Unbinding Staying right there he reaches the ending of the effluentsOr if not then  through this very Dhammapassion this very Dhammadelight and from the total ending of the first five Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldSeveral strands of our discussion converge at this passageTo begin with the act of discernment described here  inclining the mind to the Deathless  is identical with the object of concentration described by the Buddha at ANThis would thus be an instance of tranquility occurring in concert with insightSecondly as the passage points out the crucial difference between Arahants and Nonreturners is whether or not the mind feels passion  delight for this act of discernmentHere the distinctions concerning sustenance  clinging raised at the beginning of Chapter III come subtly into playAny act of discernment even on this level comes under the five aggregates for sustenance as composed of perception fabrications  consciousnessIf not fully seen for what it is it can thus act as a phenomenon offering sustenanceAny passion  delight for it  and these themselves are perceptions  fabrications  function as refined sustenanceclinging in the modes of views mental absorption  a sense of I am involved in the act of discerningThus the mind still contains the conditions for becoming on a refined level and this stands in the way of its total freedomVenKhemaka a Nonreturner speaks shortly before he attains Arahantship Just like the scent of a blue red or white lotus If someone were to call it the scent of a petal or the scent of the color or the scent of a filament would he be speaking correctlyNo friendThen how would he describe it if he were describing it correctlyAs the scent of the flowerIn the same way friends I dont say that this I am is form nor that this I am is other than formI dont say that this I am is feeling perception fabrications I dont say that this I am is consciousness nor that this I am is other than consciousnessIts just that for me the I am with regard to the five aggregates for sustenance has not been removed although I dont regard them as This is meJust like a cloth spotted  stained whose owners give it over to a washerman The washerman scrubs it with salt earth or lye or cow dung and then rinses it in clear waterNow even though the cloth is clean and spotless it still has a slight lingering residual scent of salt earth or lye or cow dungThe washerman gives it to the owners the owners put it away in a wicker box filled with incense and its slight lingering residual scent of salt earth lye or cow dung disappearsIn the same way even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower Fetters he still has with regard to the five aggregates for sustenance a slight lingering residual I am conceit an I am desire an I am obsessionBut at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising  passing away with regard to the five aggregates of sustenance Such is form such its origination such its disappearanceSuch is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance As he keeps focusing on the arising  passing away of these five aggregates for sustenance the slight lingering residual I am conceit I am desire I am obsession he had with regard to them disappearsOnly when discernment is so fully developed  totally comprehensive that it has no lingering conceits desires or obsessions for anything  not even for the fabrications of passion  delight that condition subtle levels of becoming around the experience of the deathless  can it complete its emancipation from the six spheres of sensory contact that make up the AllMoggallāna Briefly lord to what extent is a monk  released through the ending of craving  utterly complete utterly free from bonds a follower of the utterly holy life utterly consummate foremost among human  heavenly beingsThe Buddha There is the case Moggallāna of the monk who has heard All things are unworthy of attachment Having heard that all things are unworthy of attachment he fully knows every thingFully knowing every thing he fully comprehends every thingFully comprehending every thing then whatever feeling he experiences  pleasure pain neither pleasure nor pain  he keeps focusing on inconstancy with regard to it keeps focusing on dispassion focusing on stopping focusing on relinquishingAs he keeps focusing on inconstancy dispassion stopping relinquishing with regard to that feeling he is unsustained by anything in the worldUnsustained he is not agitatedUnagitated he is unbound right withinHe discerns Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldIts to this extent Moggallāna that a monk in brief is released through the ending of craving utterly complete utterly free from bonds a follower of the utterly holy life utterly consummate foremost among human  heavenly beingsNow when a monk discerns  as they actually are  the origin  passing away of the six spheres of contact their allure their drawbacks  the emancipation from them then he discerns what is superior to all these thingsWith ignorance as condition there occur fabrications with fabrications as condition consciousness with consciousness as condition name  form with name  form as condition the six sense spheresBut with the remainderless fading  stopping of ignorance fabrications stopWith the stopping of fabrications consciousness stopsWith the stopping of consciousness name  form the six sense spheres contact feeling craving clinging becoming birth stopsWith the stopping of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain  distress all stopThus is the stopping of this entire mass of stressThat which arises in dependence on the eye as pleasure or joy that is the allure of the eyeWhatever of the eye are inconstant stressful  subject to change that is the drawback of the eyeWhatever is the subduing of passion  desire the abandoning of passion  desire for the eye that is the emancipation from the eyeThis the unsurpassed foremost state of peace has been realized by the Tathāgata liberation through lack of clingingsustenance having known as they actually are the origin the passing away the allure the drawbacks of  and the emancipation from  the six spheres of contactThis unsurpassed foremost state of peace that comes as the mind realizes emancipation from the All is totally UnconditionedThere is monks an unborn  unbecome  unmade  uncompoundedIf there were not that unborn  unbecome  unmade  uncompounded there would not be the case that emancipation from the born  become  made  compounded would be discernedBut precisely because there is an unborn  unbecome  unmade  uncompounded emancipation from the born  become  made  compounded is thus discernedHaving fully realized the Unconditioned the mind no longer falls under the sway of stress  inconstancyNo longer engrossed it finds that its sense of participation  engagement in all the processes of experience disbands once  for allNandaka Sisters it is just as if an adept butcher or butchers apprentice having killed a cow were to carve it up with a sharp carving knife so that  without damaging the substance of the inner flesh without damaging the substance of the outer hide  he would cut sever  detach only the skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between and having cut severed  detached the outer skin and then covering the cow again with that very skin he were to say that the cow was actually joined to the skin Would he be speaking rightlyNo sirWhy is that because no matter how much he might say that the cow was actually joined to the skin the cow would still be disjoined from the skinThis simile sisters I have given to convey a messageThe message is this The substance of the inner flesh stands for the six inner sense spheres the substance of the outer hide stands for the six outer sense spheresThe skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between stand for passion  delightAnd the sharp knife stands for noble discernment which cuts severs  detaches the defilements fetters  attachments in betweenAlthough the senses  their objects are there just as before the fundamental affective link that ties the mind to sensations has been cutAnd its cutting means unconditional freedom for the mindMahāKaccāyana Concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made after which he entered his dwelling without expounding the detailed meaning  ie A monk should investigate in such a way that his consciousness neither externally scattered  diffused nor internally fixated he would from lack of clingingsustenance be unagitatedWhen from lack of clingingsustenance he would be unagitated there is no seed for the conditions of future birth aging death or stress  I understand the detailed meaning of this statement to be thisHow is consciousness said to be scattered  diffusedThere is the case where a form is seen with the eye and consciousness follows the drift of the image of the form is tied to the attraction of the image of the form is chained to the attraction of the image of the form is fettered  joined to the attraction of the image of the form Consciousness is said to be externally scattered  diffusedAnd how is consciousness said not to be externally scattered  diffusedThere is the case where a form is seen with the eye and consciousness does not follow the drift of the image of the form is not tied to chained to fettered or joined to the attraction of the image of the form Consciousness is said not to be externally scattered  diffusedAnd how is the mind said to be internally fixatedThere is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhānaHis consciousness follows the drift of the rapture  pleasure born of seclusion is tied to chained fettered  joined to the attraction of the rapture  pleasure born of seclusionOr further he enters  remains in the second jhānaHis consciousness follows the drift of the rapture  pleasure born of concentration is tied to chained fettered  joined to the attraction of the rapture  pleasure born of concentrationOr further he enters  remains in the third jhāna His consciousness follows the drift of the equanimity  pleasure Or further he enters  remains in the fourth jhānaHis consciousness follows the drift of the neither pleasure nor pain is tied to chained to fettered  joined to the attraction of the neither pleasure nor pain The mind is said to be internally fixatedAnd how is the mind said not to be internally fixatedThere is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhānaHis consciousness does not follow the drift of the rapture  pleasure born of seclusion is not tied to chained to fettered or joined to the rapture  pleasure born of seclusionAnd how is agitation caused by clingingsustenanceThere is the case of an uninstructed runofthemill person who assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHis form changes  is unstableBecause of the change  instability of his form consciousness alters in accordance with the change in the formWith the concomitant arising of agitation born from this alteration the mind stays consumedAnd because of the consumption of awareness he feels fearful threatened  solicitousIt is thus friends that agitation is caused by clingingsustenanceAnd how is nonagitation caused by lack of clinging sustenanceThere is the case of an instructed noble disciple who does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHis form changes  is unstable but consciousness does not for that reason alter in accordance with the change in formHis mind is not consumed with any concomitant agitation born from such a changeBecause his awareness is not consumed he does not feel fearful threatened or solicitousIt is thus friends that nonagitation is caused by lack of clingingsustenanceOne who is dependent has waveringOne who is independent has no waveringThere being no wavering there is calmThere being calm there is no desireThere being no desire there is no coming or goingThere being no coming or going there is no passing away or arisingThere being no passing away or arising there is neither a here nor a there nor a betweenthetwoThis just this is the end of stressSensing a feeling of pleasure he discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relishedSensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain he discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relishedSensing a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from itSensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain he senses it disjoined from itWhen sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to the body When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life He discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life all that is experienced not being relished will grow cold right hereJust as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil  wick and from the termination of the oil  wick  and from not being provided any other sustenance  it goes out unnourished even so when sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to the body When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life He discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life all that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right hereThus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest resolve for discernment for this  the knowledge of the ending of all stress  is the highest noble discernmentHis release being founded on truth does not fluctuate for whatever is deceptive is false Unbinding  the undeceptive  is trueThus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest resolve for truth for this  Unbinding the undeceptive  is the highest noble truthWhereas formerly he foolishly had taken on  brought to completion acquisitions he has now abandoned them their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest resolve for relinquishing for this  the renunciation of all acquisitions  is the highest noble relinquishingWhereas formerly he foolishly had greed  as well as desire  infatuation  he has now abandoned them their root destroyed not destined for future arisingWhereas formerly he foolishly had malice  as well as illwill  hatred  he has now abandoned them Whereas formerly he foolishly had ignorance  as well as delusion  confusion  he has now abandoned them their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest resolve for calm for this  the calming of passions aversions  delusions  is the highest noble calmOne should not be negligent of discernment should guard the truth be devoted to relinquishing and train only for calm Thus it was said and in reference to this was it said He has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flowAnd when the currents of construing do not flow he is said to be a sage at peace Thus it has been saidWith reference to what was it saidI am is a construingI am this is a construingI will be is a construingI will not be I will be possessed of form I will not be possessed of form I will be percipient I will not be percipient I will be neither percipient nor nonpercipient is a construingConstruing is a disease construing is a cancer construing is an arrowBy going beyond all construing he is called a sage at peaceFurthermore a sage at peace isnt born doesnt age doesnt die is unagitated and free from longingHe doesnt have anything whereby he would be bornNot being born will he ageNot aging will he dieNot dying will he be agitatedNot being agitated for what will he longIt was in reference to this that it was said He has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flowAnd when the currents of construing do not flow he is said to be a sage at peaceSāriputta And how my friend is a monks mind wellcomposed by means of awarenessMy mind is without passion  his mind is wellcomposed by means of awarenessMy mind is without aversion My mind is without delusion My mind is not subject to passion to aversion to delusion  his mind is wellcomposed by means of awarenessMy mind is destined not to return to states of sensuality to states of form to formless states  his mind is wellcomposed by means of awarenessEven if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into the visual range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released his mind is neither overpowered nor even engagedBeing still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing awayAnd even if powerful sounds aromas flavors tactile sensations Even if powerful ideas cognizable by the intellect come into the mental range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released his mind is neither overpowered nor even engagedBeing still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing awayJust as if there were a stone column sixteen spans tall of which eight spans were rooted below ground and then from the east there were to come a powerful wind storm The column would not shiver nor quiver nor quakeAnd then from the west the north the south there were to some a powerful wind storm The column would not shiver nor quiver nor quakeWhyBecause of the depth of the root and the wellburiedness of the stone columnIn the same way my friend even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into the visual range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released etc his mind is neither overpowered nor even engagedThis radical freedom  unattached to sensation untouched by the power of passion aversion  delusion  is the Unbinding experienced in the present lifeAt one time the Buddha was living in Magadha just below the hills near a brahman village called EkanalaAt that time the brahman Kasibharadvaja had yoked together a number of plows for it was planting timeThe Buddha arose in the morning and having dressed and taken up his bowl he went up to where the brahman Kasibharadvaja was workingAt that time the farmer was feeding his workersSo the Buddha went up to where that feeding was taking place and stood to one sideSeeing the Buddha standing for alms the brahman Kasibharadvaja said this to him I recluse plow and sow and only after having plowed and sown do I eatYou too should plow and sow and only after having plowed and sown should you eatI do indeed plow and sow brahman replied the Buddha And only after having plowed and sown do I eatBut Gotama we do not see your yoke and plow nor your plowshare oxen or goadAnd yet you say you plow and sow and eat only after having plowed and sownAnd then the brahman Kasibharadvaja addressed the Buddha with this verseThen the brahman Kasibharadvaja filled a large bronze bowl with food and offered it to the Buddha Please eat Gotama sir this foodYou are indeed a farmerSurely you plow the plowing that yields the crop of deathlessnessAlthough the compilers of the Pali Canon were not concerned with teaching the physical sciences there are frequent passages where they cite the behavior of the physical universe in similes or examples to illustrate points of doctrineA number of these passages discuss questions of heat motion meteorology the etiology of diseases and so forth in enough detail to show that a common theory underlies their explanationThat theory centers on the concept of dhātu property or potentialThe physical properties presented in this theory are four those of earth liquid heat  windThree of them  liquid heat  wind  are potentially activeWhen they are aggravated agitated or provoked  the Pali term here pakuppati is used also on the psychological level where it means angered or upset  they act as the underlying cause for activity in natureFire for example is said to occur when the heat property is provokedThere comes a time when the external heat property is provoked and consumes village town  city countryside  rural area and then coming to the edge of a green district the edge of a road the edge of a rocky district to the waters edge or to a lush wellwatered area goes out from lack of sustenanceOnce a fire has been provoked it needs upādāna  commonly translated as fuel  to continue burningUpādāna has other meanings besides fuel though  one is the nourishment that sustains the life  growth of a tree  and as we will see below wind can also function as a fires upādānaThus sustenance would seem to be a more precise translation for the termHow do you construe this young man Which fire would be more brilliant luminous  dazzling  that which burned in dependence on a sustenance of grass  timber or that which burned in dependence on having relinquished a sustenance of grass  timberIf it were possible Gotama for a fire to burn in dependence on having relinquished a sustenance of grass  timber that fire would be the more brilliant luminous  dazzlingIts impossible young man there is no way that a fire could burn in dependence on having relinquished a sustenance of grass  timber aside from a feat of psychic powerJust as a fire Vaccha burns with sustenance and not without sustenance even so I declare the rebirth of one who has sustenance and not of one without sustenanceBut Venerable Gotama at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance what do you say is its sustenance thenVaccha when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance I say that it is windsustainedThe wind Vaccha is its sustenance at that timeAnd at the moment when a being sets this body aside and has not yet attained another body what do you say is its sustenance thenActually Vaccha when a being sets this body aside and has not yet attained another body I say that it is cravingsustainedCraving Vaccha is its sustenance at that timeAnother meaning for upādāna is clinging which suggests that just as a tree clings to the soil that provides its sustenance fire clings to its fuelThus the above passage could also read fire burns with clinging and not without clinging  a characteristic of fire that was observed in other ancient Asian traditions such as the Chinese I Ching as wellThe clinging nature of fire is reflected in a number of other idioms used by the Pali Canon to describe its workingsFor one an object that catches fire is said to get stuck or to stick Adherence is a twoway processJust as a wing bone or tendon parings monks thrown into a fire dont catch fire keep apart turn aside and are not drawn in even so the heart of a monk who spends time often with a mind accustomed to focusing on the repulsive doesnt stick to the engaging in the sexual act keeps apart turns aside and is not drawn in and remains either indifferent or repelledThe second side of the attachment  that fire in sticking to something gets stuck  is reflected in yet another idiom in the Pali Canon When it leaves a piece of fuel it has been clinging to it is said to be releasedJust as fire after being released from a house of reeds or a house of grass burns even gabled houses plastered latched shut against the wind even so all dangers that arise arise from fools and not from wise people all disasters all troubles that arise arise from fools and not from wise peopleThis sense of fires being entrapped as it burns echoes the stanza from the vetāśvatara Upaniṣad quoted above that refers to fire as being seized when ignited by the friction of fire sticksApparently the Buddhists were not alone in their time in seeing attachment  entrapment as they watched a fire burnAnd this would account for the way early Buddhist poetry tends to couple the image of an extinguished fire with the notion of freedomSo to summarize The image of an extinguished fire carried no connotations of annihilation for the early BuddhistsRather the aspects of fire that to them had significance for the mindfire analogy are these Fire when burning is in a state of agitation dependence attachment  entrapment  both clinging  being stuck to its sustenanceExtinguished it becomes calm independent indeterminate  unattached It lets go of its sustenance and is releasedThis same nexus of events applied to the workings of the mind occurs repeatedly in Canonical passages describing the attainment of the goalOne attached is unreleased one unattached is releasedShould consciousness when standing stand attached to form supported by form established on form watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferationShould consciousness when standing stand attached to feeling to perception to fabrications it would exhibit growth increase  proliferationWere someone to say I will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications that would be impossibleIf a monk abandons passion for the property of form feeling perception fabrications consciousness then owing to the abandoning of passion the support is cut off and there is no base for consciousnessConsciousness thus unestablished not proliferating not performing any function is releasedOwing to its release it stands stillOwing to its stillness it is contentedOwing to its contentment it is not agitatedNot agitated he is totally nibbānaed right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis being the set of events  stillness independence unattachment  associated with the extinguishing of a fire and the attainment of the goal it would appear that of all the etymologies offered to explain the word nibbāna the one closest to its original connotations is that quoted by Buddhaghosa in The Path of PurificationThere he derives the word from the negative prefix nir plus vāna or binding UnbindingModern scholars have tended to scorn this derivation as fanciful and they favor such hypotheses as blowing out not blowing or covering But although these hypotheses may make sense in terms of modern Western ideas about fire they are hardly relevant to the way nibbāna is used in the CanonFreedom on the other hand is more than relevantIt is central both in the context of ancient Indian theories of fire and in the psychological context of attaining the goal Not agitated he is totally unbound right withinSo Unbinding would seem to be the best equivalent for nibbāna we have in EnglishWhat kind of unbindingWe have already gained some idea  liberation from dependency  limitations from agitation  death  but it turns out that nibbāna is not the only term the Buddha borrowed from the workings of fire to describe the workings of the mindUpādāna is another and a survey of how he applied it to the mind will help to show what is loosed in the minds unbinding and howThis remarkable and powerful poem found buried amid the rather dry linguistic commentary of the Niddesa speaks to the dual themes of impermanence and selflessnessIn the later systematic psychology called Abhidhamma these themes are developed into the doctrine of momentariness and the thorough enumeration of impersonal phenomenaAll human experience is everchanging but is known in fleeting moments of perceptive and affected consciousnessClose awareness of these moments using heightened attention which can be developed through concentration and insight meditation reveal a plethora of nonpersonal mental factors arising and passing away in innumerable unique combinationsThe poem captures something of this dance of dharmas yet steers us away from identifying it as ours The elements out of which the mind so quickly constructs these glimpses of experience are universal  pleasure and pain for example are felt equally by allEvery mental state is certainly unique partly because each moments sense data changes and partly because the causal matrix from which they arise the personality is so different for each personBut the characteristics of the basic aggregates that comprise all human experience  materiality feeling perception formations and consciousness  have remained similar from time immemorialOur subjective world is created by these states emerging in a moment of minds awareness and when no longer aware  in deep sleep or death for example  our world dies with usThe image of a tiny seed balancing on the point of a needle is striking  it so poignantly describes the exquisite precision of the human conditionWith the past long gone and the future unmanifest all we have access to is the present moment and this is only as accessible as we are attentive to itHow much of our legacy we neglect when we fail to attendMeditation can train the mind to be as sharp as a needle point to notice phenomena as fleeting as a flash of lightningSo whether we live years or only a few dozen each life can be as infinitely deep as our mindfulness can penetrateThe discourses of the Pali Canon make a frequent analogy between the workings of fire and those of the mind The mind unawakened to the supreme goal is like a burning fire the awakened mind like a fire gone outThe analogy is made both indirectly  directly indirectly in the use of terminology borrowed from the physics of fire to describe mental events directly in any number of metaphorsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One  while staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River in the shade of the Bodhi tree newly awakened  was sitting in the shade of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseAfter the passing of those seven days on emerging from that concentration he surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened OneAs he did so he saw living beings burning with the many fevers and aflame with the many fires born of passion aversion  delusionThe All is aflameWhich All is aflameThe eye is aflameForms are aflameEyeconsciousness is aflameEyecontact is aflameAnd

fire but so is the passing away of a person in whom they are extinguishedWhen the Blessed One was totally gone out  simultaneously with the total going out  VenAnuruddha uttered these stanzasThe aim of this essay is to explore the implications of this imagery  to give a sense of what it was  was not intended to convey  by first making reference to the views concerning the physics of fire current in the Buddhas timeThis short of an actual experience of Awakening  something no book can provide  seems the most natural approach for drawing the proper inferences from this imageryOtherwise we are bound to interpret it in terms of our own views of how fire works a mistake as misleading  anachronistic as that of painting a picture of the Buddha dressed as Albert Einstein or Isaac NewtonThe presentation here is more like a photomosaic than an expositionQuotations have been aligned  overlapped so as to reflect  expand on one anotherComments have intentionally been kept to a bare minimum so as to allow the quotations to speak for themselvesThe weakness of this approach is that it covers several fronts at once and can make its points only incrementallyIts strength lies in its cumulative effect revealing  beneath apparently disparate teachings  unifying patterns that might go unnoticed in a more linear narrative much as satellite pictures can reveal buried archeological remains that would go unnoticed by a person standing on the groundOne of the noteworthy features of the Pali Canon is that common patterns of thought  imagery shape the extemporaneous words of a wide variety of people reported within itHere we will hear the voices not only of the Buddha  the speaker in all passages from the Canon where none is identified  but also of lay people such as Citta monks such as Vensnanda  MahāKaccāyana and nuns such as Sisters Nandā Sumedhā  PāṭācārāEach has his or her own style of expression both in poetry  in prose but they all speak from a similarity of background  experience that makes it possible to view their message as a single whole in structure as well as contentThe structure we are most concerned with here centers on the image of extinguished fire and its implications for the word nibbāna  related conceptsUsed with reference to fire nibbāna means being out or going out Used with reference to the mind it refers to the final goal and to the goals attainmentOur essay into the cluster of meanings surrounding this word is meant to read like a journey of exploration but a brief preview will help us keep track both of where we are in relation to the map provided by the Abstract and of where we are goingThe first chapter surveys ancient Vedic ideas of fire as subsisting in a diffused state even when extinguishedIt then shows how the Buddha took an original approach to those ideas to illustrate the concept of nibbāna after death as referring not to eternal existence but rather to absolute freedom from all constraints of time space  beingThe remaining three chapters deal with the concept of nibbāna in the present lifeChapter II introduces a cluster of Buddhist ideas concerning the nature of burning fire  as agitated clinging bound  dependent  and draws out the implications that these ideas have for what happens when a fire goes out and in parallel fashion when the mind attains nibbānaIn particular it concludes that of all the etymologies traditionally offered for nibbāna Buddhaghosas unbinding is probably closest to the original connotations of the termChapter III takes up the notion of clinging as it applies to the mind  as sensuality views habits  practices and doctrines of the self  to show in detail what is loosened in the minds unbinding whereas Chapter IV shows how by detailing the way in which the practice of virtue concentration  discernment frees the mind from its fettersThis final chapter culminates in an array of passages from the texts that recapitulate the pattern of firefreedom imagery covered in the preceding discussionIf read reflectively they also serve as reminders that their perspectives on the concept of nibbāna can best be connected only in light of that patternWe should note at the outset though that nibbāna is only one of the Buddhist goals many namesOne section of the Canon lists and the composite impression they convey is worth bearing in mindAccording to the Pali Canon  the earliest extant record of the Buddhas teachings  the fabrications of language cannot properly be used to describe anything outside of the realm of fabricationIn one mode of analysis this realm is divided into the six senses  their objects in another mode into the five aggregates of form feeling perception fabrications  consciousnessHowever passages in the Canon point to another realm  where the six senses  their objects cease  which can be experienced although not otherwise described even in terms of existing not existing both or neitherThe goal of Buddhist practice belongs to this second realm and this of course raised problems for the Buddha in how to teach  describe that goalHe solved the problem by illustrating the goal with similes  metaphorsThe bestknown metaphor for the goal is the name nibbāna which means the extinguishing of a fireAttempts to work out the implications of this metaphor have all too often taken it out of contextSome writers drawing on modern everyday notions of fire come to the conclusion that nibbāna implies extinction as we feel that a fire goes out of existence when extinguishedOthers however note that the Vedas  ancient Indian religious texts that predate Buddhism by many thousands of years  describe fire as immortal Even when extinguished it simply goes into hiding in a latent diffused state only to be reborn when a new fire is litThese writers then assume that the Buddha accepted the Vedic theory in its entirety and so maintain that nibbāna implies eternal existenceThe weakness of both these interpretations is that they do not take into account the way the Pali Canon describes the workings of fire the limits beyond which no phenomenon may be described and the precise implications that the Buddha himself drew from his metaphor in light of The purpose of this essay is to place this metaphor in its original context to show what it was and was not meant to implyAny discussion of the way the Buddha used the term nibbāna must begin with the distinction that there are two levels of nibbānaThe first is the nibbāna experienced by a person who has attained the goal and is still aliveThis is described metaphorically as the extinguishing of passion aversion  delusionThe second is the nibbāna after deathThe simile for these two states is the distinction between a fire that has gone out but whose embers are still warm and one so totally out that its embers are coldThe Buddha used the views of fire current in his day in somewhat different ways when discussing these two levels of nibbāna and so we must consider them separatelyTo understand the implications of nibbāna in the present life it is necessary to know something of the way in which fire is described in the Pali CanonThere fire is said to be caused by the excitation or agitation of the heat propertyTo continue burning it must have sustenanceIts relationship to its sustenance is one of clinging dependence  entrapmentWhen it goes out the heat property is no longer agitated and the fire is said to be freedThus the metaphor of nibbāna in this case would have implications of calming together with release from dependencies attachments  bondageThis in turn suggests that of all the attempts to describe the etymology of the word nibbāna the closest is the one Buddhaghosa proposed in The Path of Purification Un  binding UnbindingTo understand further what is meant by the unbinding of the mind it is also important to know that the word upādāna  the sustenance for the fire  also means clinging and that according to the Buddha the mind has four forms of clinging that keep it in bondage clinging to sensuality to views to precepts  practices and to doctrines of the selfIn each case the clinging is the passion  desire the mind feels for these thingsTo overcome this clinging then the mind must see not only the drawbacks of these four objects of clinging but more importantly the drawbacks of the act of passion  desire itselfThe mind does this by following a threefold training virtue concentration  discernmentVirtue provides the joy  freedom from remorse that are essential for concentrationConcentration provides an internal basis of pleasure rapture equanimity  singleness of mind that are not dependent on sensual objects so that discernment can have the strength  stability it needs to cut through the minds clingingsDiscernment functions by viewing these clingings as part of a causal chain seeing their origin their passing away their allure the drawbacks of their results  finally emancipation from themAlthough the Canon reports cases where individuals cut through all four forms of clinging at the same time the more common pattern is for discernment first to cut through sensual clinging by focusing on the inconstancy  stressfulness of all sensory objects and on the worthlessness of any passion or desire directed to themThus freed the mind can turn its discernment inward in a similar way to cut through its clinging to the practice of concentration itself as well as to views in general and notions of self in particularOnce it no longer views experience in terms of self the entire selfnotself dichotomy collapsesThe mind at this point attains Deathlessness although there is no sense of I in the attainmentThere is simply the realization There is this From this point onward the mind experiences mental  physical phenomena with a sense of being dissociated from themOne simile for this state is that of a hide removed from the carcass of a cow Even if the hide is then placed back on the cow one cannot say that it is attached as before because the connective tissues that once held the hide to the carcass  in other words passion  desire  have all been cutThe person who has attained the goal  called a Tathāgata in some contexts an arahant in others  thus lives out the remainder of hisher life in the world but independent of itDeath as experienced by a Tathāgata is described simply as All this no longer being relished grows cold right here All attempts to describe the experience of nibbāna or the state of the Tathāgata after death  as existing not existing both or neither  are refuted by the BuddhaTo explain his point he again makes use of the metaphor of the extinguished fire although here he draws on the Vedic view of latent fire as modified by Buddhist notions of what does and does not lie within the realm of valid descriptionTo describe the state of the Tathāgatas mind there has to be a way of knowing what hisher consciousness is dependent onHere we must remember that according to the texts a meditator may develop intuitive powers through the practice of concentration enabling himher to know the state of another persons mind or the destination of that person after deathTo do so though that persons consciousness must be dwelling on a particular object for it is only through knowledge of the object that the state of the mind can be knownWith ordinary people this is no problem for ordinary consciousness is always dependent on one object or another but with Tathāgatas this is impossible for their consciousness is totally independentBecause terms such as existing not existing both or neither apply only to what may be measured against a criterion of knowing they cannot apply to the TathāgataThe Buddha borrows two points from the Vedic notion of fire to illustrate this pointEven if one wants to assume that fire still exists after being extinguished it is so subtle that it cannot be perceived and so diffuse that it cannot be said to go to any one place or in any particular directionJust as notions of going east west north or south do not apply to an extinguished fire notions of existing and so forth do not apply to the Tathāgata after deathAs for the question of how nibbāna is experienced after death the Buddha says that there is no limit in that experience by which it could be describedThe word limit here is the important oneIn one of the ancient Vedic myths of creation the universe starts when a limit appears that separates male from female sky from earthThus the implication of the Buddhas statement is that the experience of nibbāna is so free from even the most basic notions making up the universe that it lies beyond descriptionThis implication is borne out by other passages stating that there is nothing in that experience of the known universe  earth water wind fire sun moon darkness coming going or stasis  at allThus when viewed in light of the way the Pali Canon describes the workings of fire and uses fire imagery to describe the workings of the mind it is clear that the word nibbāna is primarily meant to convey notions of freedom freedom in the present life from agitation dependency  clinging and freedom after death from even the most basic concepts or limitations  such as existence nonexistence both or neither  that make up the describable universeFreed disjoined  released from ten things the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awareness VāhunaWhich tenFreed disjoined  released from form feeling perception fabrications consciousness birth aging death stress defilement he dwells with unrestricted awarenessJust as a red blue or white lotus born in the water and growing in the water rises up above the water and stands with no water adhering to it in the same way the Tathāgata  freed disjoined  released from these ten things  dwells with unrestricted awarenessJust as the great ocean has but one taste the taste of salt even so does this doctrine  discipline have but one taste the taste of releaseThese two verses point to the healing symbolism of the Buddhas teachingHe is often pictured as the great physician who seeing the suffering of all beings in the world applies the medical formula of the four noble truths to  describe the symptoms of suffering  investigate its specific causes  using this information reverse the causes to conceive a cure and finally  lay out a flexible program of treatment that will lead a person out of affliction to lasting health of body and mindNotice that the medicine will only work if it is drunkThe heart of the Buddhist message is not so much the theoretical analysis of the human condition subtle and compelling as it is but rather the practical effect of actually taking the cureThe physician can do no more than offer us the medicine  it is up to each of us to drink of it ourselvesThis is where the practice of meditation and the momenttomoment cultivation of wholesome mind states is so importantSince all of our afflictions ultimately grow from our attachments and from the clinging constructions we forge the path to freedom or health will unfold as we learn to abandon these constructions and as they begin to waneThe mechanism for this cure is wisdom which emerges as we begin to meditate and hence see more clearly the nature of our constructed experienceBeing cured does not mean that the process of aging and dying simply stopsBut we can through wisdom be untouched by aging and deathHealth consists of a sufficiently deep understanding of the nature of things that we do not cling to anything in the worldNonattachment is itself the cureThe venerable Ananda arose early one morning and taking up his robe and bowl approached a certain settlement of nuns where he sat down on a seat that had been preparedA number of nuns approached the venerable Ananda and after greeting him sat down to one sideSo seated these nuns said this to the venerable Ananda There are here Ananda sir a number of nuns who abide with minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulnessTheir understanding is becoming ever greater and more excellentSo it is Sisters so it is replied AnandaIndeed for anybody Sisters whether monk or nun who abides with a mind well established in the four foundations of mindfulness  it is to be expected that their understanding becomes ever greater and more excellentHere Ananda a monk abides contemplating body as body  ardent fully aware mindful  leading away the unhappiness that comes from wanting the things of the worldAnd for one who is abiding contemplating body as body a bodily object arises or bodily distress or mental sluggishness that scatters his mind outwardThen the monk should direct his mind to some satisfactory imageWhen the mind is directed to some satisfactory image happiness is bornFrom this happiness joy is then bornWith a joyful mind the body relaxesA relaxed body feels content and the mind of one content becomes concentratedHe then reflects The purpose for which I directed my my mind has been accomplishedSo now I shall withdraw He withdraws and no longer thinks upon or thinks aboutHe understands I am not thinking upon or thinking aboutInwardly mindful I am content This is directed meditationAnd what is undirected meditationNot directing his mind outward a monk understands My mind is not directed outward He understands Not focused on before or after free undirected And he understands I abide observing body as body  ardent fully aware mindful  I am content This is undirected meditationAnd so Ananda I have taught directed meditation and I have taught undirected meditationWhatever is to be done by a teacher with compassion for the welfare of students that has been done by me out of compassion for youHere are the roots of treesHere are empty placesGet down and meditateDont be lazyDont become one who is later remorsefulThis is my instruction to youThis text is interesting for a number of reasons though it seems not to be particularly well known or often referred toThe framing story shows clearly that women were diligent and successful practitioners of insight meditation in the Buddhas time and that they were wellsupported in this pursuitAnanda the Buddhas cousin and lifelong assistant was a great champion of the nuns cause and would often visit communities of nuns to encourage their dhamma practiceThe Buddha seems to take the opportunity of Anandas report to expound on some of the details of mindfulness techniqueWhat he says here about directed and undirected meditation is particularly interesting in light of the modern integration of metta practice with vipassana practiceThe Buddha seems to acknowledge that mindful awareness is sometimes difficult to come by and that there are times when ones mind becomes scattered by the arising of challenging mind statesHis response here is not the warriors tone sometimes found elsewhere in the texts whereby the practitioner should just overcome the unwholesome thoughts and rouse up sufficient heroic energy to reestablish mindfulnessNor is it the gentler response we often hear in the dhamma hall to just be aware of what is arising without judgment of any kind gently returning our attention to the breath or other primary object of meditationRather the Buddhas suggestion is a deliberate redirection of our attention to a satisfactory imageThe pali words here are pasadaniya nimittaA nimitta is an image or manifestation that appears in the mind  something akin to a sign a vision or an appearance of an object in the minds eye It is the term used in visualization meditations and even has a slight connotation of conjuring up something in the mindThe adjective pasadaniya is translated by Woodward in the PTS edition as pleasurable but this sort of term is too easily misconstrued in Buddhist contextsI dont think the Buddha is suggesting here that we seek something pleasant in order to avoid the arising discomfort but is rather suggesting a short term strategy for the practical disarming of the minds defense mechanismsThe commentator Buddhaghosa suggest that the image of the Buddha might be an example of a satisfactory image but probably anything wholesome and not productive of strong craving will doThe idea is just to redirect the mind to flow around the obstacle that has appeared but not to use something that will itself become another obstacleThe practical effect of this redirection of attention is the natural calming of the mind and relaxation of the bodyOnly from tranquillity can true alertness arise  otherwise the minds attentiveness is just busy or restlessBut as the ensuing passage confirms this excursion into the deliberate cultivation of a specific image can be abandoned as soon as its mission has been fulfilledInsight meditation has never been about cultivating blissful states of mind or body for their own sakeBut as a skillful means for helping our understanding become ever greater and more excellent it seems to be a useful techniqueI think we need to rely upon the guidance of experienced meditation teachers however to help us discern when it is appropriate to apply this strategyThe mind is so capricious it may turn to a more pleasurable object of awareness just to escape the growing pains of evolving insight or it may mislead itself into thinking it is practicing undirected meditation when it is actually just spacing outOne important thing to notice about this passage is that the undirected meditation is occurring squarely in the context of the foundations of mindfulnessThis is not objectless awareness or the awareness of awareness itself that is mentioned in some traditionsThe meditator understands his awareness to be free and undirected while contemplating body as body feeling as feeling mind as mind and mental states as mental statesWhat distinguishes undirected meditation from directed meditation is simply the role of intention in the processAlas this cautionary tale does not have the happy ending we would like of such fablesIn fact as a childhood fan of Curious George and with a certain affection for this foolish monkey I could not bring myself to translate what the hunter does to him upon his arrivalThe Buddha was not one to pull any punches especially when an important point of training for the monks was at stakeThe story is taken from the Satipatthana Samyuttam a collection of discourses which discuss the Foundations of Mindfulness root teachings of the vipassana meditation traditionThe message is one that has much to do with the application of wise attention and involves changing ones frame of reference through which sense experience is received and processedIf we give our attention to the appeal or the pleasurableness that accompanies sensory experience then we are necessarily caught by the perceptual objectThere can be no freedom of mind because we are subtly yearning for more gratification than the transient object is capable of deliveringInstead of satisfying our desires such experience merely stirs up more desireThis is the situation most of us take as normal  we seek satisfaction of desire through the pursuit of pleasure in the realms of the sensesThe monastic ideal that so thoroughly shaped the flavor of early Buddhism involves a wholly different way of relating to experienceThe idea is not that monks are to avoid or ignore the data that comes in through the five sense doors  indeed this is hardly possible since all of our sensory experience must pass through these gatewaysRather the instruction is about not getting attached to sense pleasures as the poor monkey gets stuck to the monkey trapSense data itself is not harmful but the sweetness of pleasure in which each sense input is wrapped is the factor that gets us caught due to our foolish and greedy natureThe difference in strategy where a monk is wandering in the pastures of the four foundations of mindfulness is the presence of equanimityVipassana meditation trains us to attend more dispassionately to the nuances of experienceWhen we simply observe mindful and fully aware then we begin to undermine the mechanisms by which the mind gets stuck to the objects of our experienceUpādāna carries both of its meanings  clinging  sustenance  when applied to the mindIt refers on the one hand both to mental clinging  to the object clung to and on the other to both the act of taking mental sustenance  the sustenance itselfThis of course raises the question Sustenance for what In the description of dependent coarising upādāna forms the condition for becoming and through becoming for birth aging death and the entire mass of suffering  stressThus the answer Sustenance for becoming  its attendant illsJust as if a great mass of fire of ten twenty thirty or forty cartloads of timber were burning and into it a man would periodically throw dried grass dried cow dung  dried timber so that the great mass of fire  thus nourished thus sustained  would burn for a long long time even so monks in one who keeps focusing on the allure of those phenomena that offer sustenance craving develops with craving as condition sustenance with sustenance as condition becoming with becoming as condition birth with birth as condition aging illness  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all come into playThus is the origin of this entire mass of suffering  stressJust as if a great mass of fire were burning into which a man simply would not periodically throw dried grass dried cow dung or dried timber so that the great mass of fire  its original sustenance being consumed and no other being offered  would without nourishment go out even so monks in one who keeps focusing on the drawbacks of those phenomena that offer sustenance craving stopsFrom the stopping of craving sustenance stopsFrom the stopping of sustenance becoming birth aging illness  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all stopThus is the stopping of this entire mass of suffering  stressThe Buddha made a distinction between phenomena that offer sustenance  the sustenance itselfAnd what monks are phenomena that offer sustenanceWhat is sustenanceForm monks is a phenomenon offering sustenanceAny desire or passion related to it is sustenance related to itFeeling Perception Fabrications Consciousness is a phenomenon offering sustenanceAny desire or passion related to it is sustenance related to itThus passion  desire are both the act of taking sustenance and the sustenance itself while form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness simply offer the opportunity for them to occurAlternatively we can translate the distinction as one between clingable phenomena  the clinging itselfAnd what monks are clingable phenomenaWhat is clingingForm monks is a clingable phenomenonAny desire or passion related to it is clinging related to itFeeling Perception Fabrications Consciousness is a clingable phenomenonAny desire or passion related to it is clinging related to itIn this case passion  desire are the act of clinging and the object clung to while form feeling  the rest simply offer the opportunity for them to occurStill the two sides of this distinction are so closely interrelated that they are hardly distinct at allVisākha Is it the case that clingingsustenance is the same thing as the five aggregates for clingingsustenance or is it something separateSister Dhammadinnā Neither is clingingsustenance the same thing as the five aggregates for clinging sustenance my friend nor is it something separateWhatever desire  passion there is with regard to the five aggregates for clingingsustenance that is the clingingsustenance therehere may relate to the fire image as khandha can also mean the trunk of a treeThe desire  passion for these five aggregates can take any of four formsMonks there are four sustenance for becomingWhich fourSensuality as a form of sustenance views as a form of sustenance habits  practices as a form of sustenance doctrines of the self as a form of sustenanceThese four modes of sustenance act as the focus for many of the passages in the Canon describing the attainment of the goalBecause they are so closely related to the notion of nibbāna  they are the binding loosened in the unbinding of the mind  each of them deserves to be considered in detailFirst sensualityThe Buddha recommended relinquishing attachment to sensuality not because sensual pleasures are in any way evil but because the attachment itself is dangerous both in terms of the pain experienced when a relished pleasure inevitably ends and in terms of the detrimental influence such attachment can have on a persons actions  and thus on his or her future conditionIts with a cause monks that sensual thinking occurs and not without a cause And how is it monks that sensual thinking occurs with a cause and not without a causeIn dependence on the property of sensuality there occurs the perception of sensualityIn dependence on the perception of sensuality there occurs the resolve for sensuality the desire for sensuality the fever for sensuality the quest for sensualityQuesting for sensuality monks an uninstructed runofthemill person conducts himself wrongly through three means through body through speech  through mindJust as if a man were to throw a burning firebrand into a dry grassy wilderness and not quickly stamp it out with his hands  feet and thus whatever animals inhabiting the grass  timber would come to ruin  loss even so monks any contemplative or brāhman who does not quickly abandon dispel demolish  wipe out of existence an outoftune unskillful perception once it has arisen will dwell in stress in the present life  threatened despairing  feverish  and on the breakup of the body after death can expect a bad destinationThis is not to deny that sensual pleasures provide a certain form of happiness but this happiness must be weighed against the greater pains  disappointments sensuality can bringNow what is the allure of sensualityThere are monks these five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingSounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingNow whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strings of sensuality that is the allure of sensualityAnd what is the drawback of sensualityThere is the case where on account of the occupation by which a clansman makes a living  whether checking or accounting or calculating or plowing or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a kings man or whatever the occupation may be  he faces cold he faces heat being harassed by mosquitoes  flies wind  sun  creeping things dying from hunger  thirstNow this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityIf the clansman gains no wealth while thus working  striving  making effort he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught My work is in vain my efforts are fruitless Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reasonIf the clansman gains wealth while thus working  striving  making effort he experiences pain  distress in protecting it How will neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it And as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with itAnd he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught What was mine is no more Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reasonFurthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brāhmans with brāhmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friendAnd then in their quarrels brawls  disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reasonFurthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows  spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reasonFurthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityEven the more honorable emotions that can develop from sensual attraction  such as love  personal devotion  ultimately lead to suffering  stress when one is inevitably parted from the person one lovesOnce in this same Sāvatthi there was a certain man whose wife diedOwing to her death he went mad out of his mind and  wandering from street to street crossroads to crossroads  would say Have you seen my wifeHave you seen my wife From this it may be realized how from a dear one owing to a dear one comes sorrow  lamentation pain distress  despairOnce in this same Sāvatthi there was a wife who went to her relatives homeHer relatives having separated her from her husband wanted to give her to another against her willSo she said to her husband These relatives of mine having separated us want to give me to another against my will whereupon he cut her in two and slashed himself open thinking Dead we will be together And from this it may be realized how from a dear one owing to a dear one comes sorrow  lamentation pain distress  despairHow do you construe this monks Which is greater the tears you have shed while transmigrating  wandering this long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing from being separated from what is pleasing  or the water in the four great oceans This is the greater The tears you have shed Why is thatFrom an inconstruable beginning monks comes transmigrationA beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering onLong have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  long enough to become disenchanted with all conditioned things enough to become dispassionate enough to be releasedA theme recurrent throughout the Canon is that complete knowledge of any object does not end with an understanding of its allure  drawbacks but goes on to comprehend what brings emancipation from the mental fetters based on bothAnd what is the emancipation from sensualityWhatever is the subduing of passion  desire the abandoning of passion  desire for sensuality that is the emancipation from sensualityThere are forms monks cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingIf a monk relishes them welcomes them  remains fastened to them he is said to be a monk fettered by forms cognizable by the eyeHe has gone over to Māras camp he has come under Māras powerThe Evil One can do with him as he willThere are forms cognizable by the eye  agreeable enticingIf a monk relishes them welcomes them  remains fastened to them then his consciousness is dependent on them is sustained by themWith sustenanceclinging the monk is not totally unboundIf he does not relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them then his consciousness is not dependent on them is not sustained by themWithout sustenanceclinging the monk is totally unboundHere again we see the reciprocal nature of attachment One is bound by what one relishes  latches onto  or rather by the act of relishing  latching on in and of itselfCitta Venerable sirs it is just as if a black ox  a white ox were joined with a single collar or yokeIf someone were to say The black ox is the fetter of the white ox the white ox is the fetter of the black  speaking this way would he be speaking rightlySome elder monks No householderThe black ox is not the fetter of the white ox nor is the white ox the fetter of the blackThe single collar or yoke by which they are joined That is the fetter thereCitta In the same way the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eyeWhatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter thereThe ear is not the fetter of sounds The nose is not the fetter of aromas The tongue is not the fetter of flavors The body is not the fetter of tactile sensations The intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellectWhatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter thereIn other words neither the senses nor their objects are fetters for the mindBeautiful sights sounds  so forth do not entrap it nor do the senses themselvesInstead it is trapped by the act of desire  passion based on such thingsMonks there are these five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable enticing sounds aromas flavors tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable enticingBut these are not sensualityThey are called stings of sensuality in the discipline of the Noble OnesThus sensual pleasures which belong to the realm of form are the clingable phenomena that offer sustenance for the bond of desire  passionOr to borrow an image from VenRāhula they are the bait  as long as one is blind to their true nature  for falling into the trap of ones own craving  heedlessnessFor this reason freedom from sensuality as a clingingsustenance requires a twopronged approach to realize the true nature of the bait and to extricate oneself from the trapThe first step involves examining the unattractive side of the human body for as the Buddha saysMonks I dont know of even one other form that stays in a mans mind and consumes it like the form of a woman one other sound smell taste touch that stays in a mans mind and consumes it like the touch of a womanThe touch of a woman stays in a mans mind and consumes itI dont know of even one other form that stays in a womans mind and consumes it like the form of a man one other sound smell taste touch that stays in a womans mind and consumes it like the touch of a manThe touch of a man stays in a womans mind and consumes itJust as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain  wheat rice mung beans kidney beans sesame seeds husked rice  and a man with good eyesight pouring it out were to reflect This is wheatThis is riceThese are mung beansThese are kidney beansThese are sesame seedsThis is husked rice in the same way monks a monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver membranes spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears oil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urineOr again as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground  one day two days three days dead  bloated livid  festering he applies it to this very body This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fateOr again as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures  hawks by dogs hyenas  various other creatures a skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions  here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a chest bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder he applies it to this very body This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate So he abides contemplating the body in  of itself internally externally or both internally  externallyThe purpose of this contemplation is not to develop a morbid fascination with the grotesque but simply to correct the distortion of perception that tries to deny the unattractive aspects of the body and to admit only the sign of the beautiful  its attractive sideNow of course this contemplation has its dangers for it can go overboard into states of aversion  depression but these are not incurableAt several points in the Canon where the Buddha sees that monks have let the contemplation of foulness adversely affect their minds he recommends that they calm their aversion by focusing on the in  out breath as a companion meditationUltimately as a more balanced perception of the body develops one may make use of the second prong of the approach turning ones attention from the object of the lust to the act of lust itself seeing it as an act of mental fabrication  foolish inconstant  stressful  and so removing any sense of identification with itThis in turn can calm the mind to an even deeper level and lead on to its UnbindingFor one who keeps focusing on the foulness any obsession with passion for the property of beauty is abandonedFor one who has mindfulness of breathing wellestablished to the fore within oneself annoying external thoughts  inclinations dont existFor one who keeps focusing on the inconstancy of all fabrications ignorance is abandoned clear knowing arisesViews are the second mode of clingingsustenanceAnd as with the abandoning of attachment to sensuality the abandoning of attachment to views can lead to an experience of UnbindingAttachment to views can block an experience of Unbinding in any of three major waysFirst the content of the view itself may not be conducive to the arising of discernment and may even have a pernicious moral effect on ones actions leading to an unfavorable rebirthI have heard that once the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans Then Puṇṇa the Koliyan a bovine and Seniya a canine naked ascetic approached the Blessed OneOn arrival Puṇṇa the Koliyan bovine bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one side while Seniya the canine naked ascetic exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One and after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies sat to one side curling up like a dogWhile he was sitting there Puṇṇa the Koliyan bovine said to the Blessed One Sir Seniya this naked ascetic is a canine a doerofhardtasksHe eats food that is thrown on the groundHe has long undertaken  conformed to that dogpracticeWhat is his future destination what is his future courseThere is the case where a person develops the dogpractice fully  perfectly Having developed the dogpractice fully  perfectly having developed a dogs virtue fully  perfectly having developed a dogs mind fully  perfectly having developed a dogs demeanor fully  perfectly then on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of dogsBut if he is of such a view as By this virtue or practice or asceticism or holy life I will become a greater or lesser god that is his wrong viewNow Puṇṇa there are two destinations for one with wrong view I say hell or the animal wombSo the dogpractice if perfected leads him to the company of dogs if defective to hellJust as if in the last month of the hot season a māluva creeper pod were to burst open and a māluva creeper seed were to fall at the foot of a sāla treeThe deity living in the tree would become frightened apprehensive  anxiousHer friends  companions relatives  kin  garden deities forest deities tree deities deities living in herbs grass  forest monarchs  would gather together to console her Have no fear have no fearIn all likelihood a peacock is sure to swallow this māluva creeper seed or a deer will eat it or a brush fire will burn it up or woodsmen will pick it up or termites will carry it off and anyway it probably isnt really a seedAnd then no peacock swallowed it no deer ate it no brush fire burned it up no woodsmen picked it up no termites carried it off and it really was a seedWatered by a rainladen cloud it sprouted in due course and curled its soft tender downy tendril around the sāla treeThe thought occurred to the deity living in the sāla tree Now what future danger did my friends foresee that they gathered together to console me Its pleasant the touch of this māluva creepers soft tender downy tendrilThen the creeper having enwrapped the sāla tree having made a canopy over it  cascading down around it caused the massive limbs of the sāla tree to come crashing downThe thought occurred to the deity living in the tree This was the future danger my friends foresaw that they gathered together to console me Its because of that māluva creeper seed that Im now experiencing sharp burning painsIn the same way monks there are some contemplatives  brāhmans who hold to a doctrine a view like this There is no harm in sensuality Thus they meet with their downfall through sensualityThey consort with women wanderers who wear their hair coiled and longThe thought occurs to them Now what future danger do those contemplatives  brāhmans foresee that they teach the relinquishing  analysis of sensualityIts pleasant the touch of this woman wanderers soft tender downy armThus they meet with their downfall through sensualityWith the breakup of the body after death they will go to a bad bourn destitution the realm of the hungry shades hellThere they will experience sharp burning painsThe thought will occur to them This was the future danger those contemplatives  brāhmans foresaw that they taught the relinquishing  analysis of sensualityIts because of sensuality as a result of sensuality that we are now experiencing these sharp burning painsSecondly apart from the actual content of the views a person attached to views is bound to get into disputes with those who hold opposing views resulting in unwholesome mental states for the winners as well as the losersThirdly and more profoundly attachment to views implicitly involves attachment to a sense of superior  inferior and to the criteria used in measuring and making such evaluationsAs we saw in Chapter I any measure or criterion acts as a limitation or bond on the mindAn important point to notice is that attachment to views must be abandoned through knowledge and not through skepticism agnosticism ignorance or a mindless openness to all viewsThis point is made clear in the Discourse of the Supreme NetThere the Buddha gives a list of philosophical positions concerning the nature of the self the cosmos  the state of ultimate freedom in the immediate presentThe list is intended to be exhaustive  the net in the title of the discourse  covering all possible views  positions on these subjects divided into ten categories one of the categories  equivocation  including cases of agnosticismThere are monks some contemplatives  brāhmans who being asked questions regarding this or that resort to verbal contortions to eellike wriggling on four grounds There is the case of a certain contemplative or brāhman who does not discern as it actually is that This is skillful or that This is unskillful The thought occurs to him I dont discern as it actually is that This is skillful or that This is unskillful If I were to declare that This is skillful or that This is unskillful desire passion aversion or irritation would occur to me that would be a falsehood for meWhatever would be a falsehood for me would be a distress for meWhatever would be a distress for me would be an obstacle for me So out of fear of falsehood a loathing for falsehood he does not declare that This is skillful or that This is unskillful Being asked questions regarding this or that he resorts to verbal contortions to eellike wriggling I dont think soI dont think in that wayI dont think otherwiseI dont think notI dont think not not There is the case of a certain contemplative or brāhman who does not discern as it actually is that This is skillful or that This is unskillful If I not discerning as it actually is that This is skillful or that This is unskillful were to declare that This is skillful or that This is unskillful  There are contemplatives  brāhmans who are pundits subtle skilled in debate who prowl about like hairsplitting marksmen as it were shooting positions to pieces with their dialecticThey might crossquestion me press me for reasons rebuke meI might not be able to stand my ground that would be a distress for me an obstacle for me So out of a fear for questioning a loathing for questioning he resorts to verbal contortions to eellike wriggling There is the case of a certain contemplative or brāhman who is dull  exceedingly stupidOut of dullness  exceeding stupidity he  being asked questions regarding this or that  resorts to verbal contortions to eellike wriggling If you ask me if there exists another world if I thought that there exists another world would I declare that to youI dont think soI dont think in that wayI dont think otherwiseI dont think notI dont think not notIf you asked me if there isnt another world both is  isnt neither is nor isnt if there are beings who transmigrate if there arent both are  arent neither are nor arent if the Tathāgata exists after death doesnt both neither I dont think soI dont think in that wayI dont think otherwiseI dont think notI dont think not notAgnosticism then is not a way of abandoning standpoints but is simply another standpoint Like all standpoints it must be abandoned through knowledgeThe type of knowledge called for  in which standpoints are regarded not in terms of their content but as events in a causal chain  is indicated by the refrain that follows each of the ten categories of the Supreme NetThis monks the Tathāgata discernsAnd he discerns that these standpoints thus seized thus grasped at lead to such  such a destination to such  such a state in the world beyondAnd he discerns what is higher than thisAnd yet discerning that he does not grasp at that act of discerningAnd as he is not grasping at it unbinding is experienced right withinKnowing as they have come to be the origin ending allure  drawbacks of feelings along with the emancipation from feelings the Tathāgata monks  through lack of sustenance clinging  is releasedAnother list of speculative views  a set of ten positions summarizing the standard topics debated by the various schools of contemplatives in the Buddhas time  recurs frequently in the CanonNonBuddhist debaters used it as a readymade checklist for gauging an individuals positions on the controversial issues of the day and they often put it to the BuddhaInvariably he would reply that he did not hold to any of the ten positionsSeeing what drawback then is Master Gotama thus entirely dissociated from each of these ten positionsVaccha the position that the world is eternal is a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsIt is accompanied by suffering distress despair  fever and it does not lead to disenchantment dispassion stopping to calm direct knowledge selfawakening UnbindingThe position that the world is not eternal the world is finite the world is infinite the soul is the same thing as the body the soul is one thing and the body another after death a Tathāgata exists after death a Tathāgata does not exist after death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist does not lead to disenchantment dispassion stopping to calm direct knowledge selfawakening UnbindingDoes Master Gotama have any position at allA position Vaccha is something that a Tathāgata has done away withWhat a Tathāgata sees is this Such is form such its origin such its disappearance such is feeling such its origin such its disappearance such is perception such are fabrications such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance Because of this I say a Tathāgata  with the ending fading out stopping renunciation  relinquishing of all construings all excogitations all Imaking  mymaking  obsessions with conceit  is through lack of sustenanceclinging releasedThe construings the Buddha relinquished include views not only in their fullblown form as specific positions but also in their rudimentary form as the categories  relationships that the mind reads into experienceThis is a point he makes in his instructions to Bāhiya which led immediately to the latters attaining the goalWhen the mind imposes interpretations on its experience it is engaging implicitly in systembuilding and all the limitations of location  relationship that systembuilding involvesOnly when it can free itself of those interpretations and the fetters they place on it can it gain true freedomTherefore Bāhiya you should train yourself thus In reference to the seen there will be only the seenIn reference to the heard only the heardIn reference to the sensed only the sensedIn reference to the cognized only the cognizedThat is how you should train yourselfWhen for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen only the heard only the sensed only the cognized in reference to the cognized then Bāhiya there is no you in connection with thatWhen there is no you in connection with that there is no you thereWhen there is no you there you are neither here nor yonder nor between the twoThis just this is the end of stressHabits  practicesThe Canon mentions a variety of habits  practices  the third mode of clingingsustenanceProminent among them are Brāhmanical rituals  Jain practices of selftorture and according to the Commentary these are the habits  practices referred to in this contextYet although the goal will always remain out of reach as long as one remains attached to such practices the abandonment of this attachment is never in  of itself sufficient for attaining the goalBut there is another practice which though a necessary part of the Buddhist path can nevertheless offer sustenance for becoming and which  as the object of attachment to be transcended  figures prominently in descriptions of the goals attainmentThat practice is jhāna or meditative absorptionIt might be argued that this is stretching the term practice a little far but jhāna does not fall under any of the other three sustenances for becoming at all and yet it definitely does function as such a sustenance so there seems to be little choice but to place it hereDifferent passages in the Canon number the levels of jhāna in different waysThe standard description gives four although the pure mindfulness  equanimity attained on the fourth level may further be applied to four progressively more  more refined formless sensations  termed the peaceful emancipations formlessness beyond forms  that altogether give eight levels often referred to as the eight attainmentsA number of objects can serve as the basis for jhānaThe breath is one and an analysis of the Canons description of the first stages of breath meditation will give an idea of what jhāna involvesThe first step is simply being mindful of the breath in the presentThere is the case of a monk who having gone to a forest to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect  keeping mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outThen comes evaluation He begins to discern variations in the breath Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short The remaining steps are willed or determined He trains himself first by manipulating his sense of conscious awareness making it sensitive to the body as a wholeHe trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body I will breathe out sensitive to the entire bodyNow that he is aware of the body as a whole he can begin to manipulate the physical sensations of which he is aware calming them  ie calming the breath  so as to create a sense of rapture  easeHe trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to rapture I will breathe out sensitive to rapture He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure I will breathe out sensitive to pleasureNow that bodily processes are stilled mental processes become apparent as they occurThese too are calmed leaving  as we will see below  a radiant awareness of the mind itselfHe trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in calming mental fabrication I will to breathe out calming mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the mind I will to breathe out sensitive to the mindThe standard description of jhāna however does not refer to any particular object as its basis but simply divides it into four levels determined by the way the mind relates to the object as it becomes more  more absorbed in itFurthermore monks the monk  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enters and remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of seclusion so that nothing of his entire body is unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from seclusionJust as an adept bathman or bathmans apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so monks the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of seclusionAnd as he remains thus earnest ardent  intent any longings related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly unified  composedThat is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyAnd furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceHe permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of concentration so that nothing of his entire body is unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of concentrationJust like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from east west north or south and with the skies periodically supplying abundant showers so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so monks the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of concentrationAnd as he remains thus earnest ardent  intent he develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyAnd furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture so that nothing of his entire body is unpervaded by pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a blue white or redlotus pond there may be some of the blue white or red lotuses that born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips there being nothing of those blue white or red lotuses unpervaded by cool water even so monks the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureAnd as he remains thus earnest ardent  intent he develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyAnd furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor stressHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness so that nothing of his entire body is unpervaded by pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so monks the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessAnd as he remains thus earnest ardent  intent he develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyDirected thought mentioned in the reference to the first level of jhāna corresponds in the description of breath meditation to the mindfulness directed to the breath in the presentEvaluation corresponds to the discernment of variations in the breath and to the manipulation of awareness  the breath so as to create a sense of rapture  pleasure throughout the bodyThe still waters in the simile for the third level of jhāna as opposed to the spring waters welling up in the second level correspond to the stilling of mental fabricationsAnd the pure bright awareness in the fourth level corresponds to the stage of breath meditation where the meditator is sensitive to the mindThus as the mind progresses through the first four levels of jhāna it sheds the various mental activities surrounding its one object Directed thought  evaluation are stilled rapture fades and pleasure is abandonedAfter reaching a state of pure bright mindful equanimous awareness in the fourth level of jhāna the mind can start shedding its perception of the form of its object the space around its object itself  the lack of activity within itselfThis process takes four steps  the four formlessnesses beyond form  culminating in a state where perception is so refined that it can hardly be called perception at allWith the complete transcending of perceptions of formand the passing away of perceptions of resistance and not attending to perceptions of diversity Infinite space one enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of spaceWith the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness one enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessWith the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing one enters  remains in the dimension of nothingnessWith the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness one enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionTo abandon attachment to jhāna as a sustenance for becoming means not to stop practicing it but rather to practice it without becoming engrossed in the sense of pleasure or equanimity it affords so that one can discern its true nature for what it isWhen this had been said Venerable nanda asked the Blessed One In the case lord where a monk has reached the point that  It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to meWhat is what has come to be that I abandon  he obtains equanimityWould this monk be totally unbound or notA certain such monk might nanda and another might notWhat is the cause what is the reason whereby one might and another might notThere is the case nanda where a monk has reached the point that  It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to meWhat is what has come to be that I abandon  he obtains equanimityHe relishes that equanimity welcomes it remains fastened to itAs he does so his consciousness is dependent on it sustained by itWith sustenance nanda a monk is not totally unboundBeing sustained where is that monk sustainedThe dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThen indeed being sustained he is sustained by the supreme sustenanceBeing sustained nanda he is sustained by the supreme sustenance for this  the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  is the supreme sustenanceThere is the case where a monk reaches equanimityHe does not relish that equanimity does not welcome it does not remain fastened to itSuch being the case his consciousness is not dependent on it is not sustained by itWithout sustenance nanda a monk is totally unboundOnce the mind can detach itself from the pleasure  equanimity offered by jhāna it can be inclined toward that which transcends jhāna  the unconditioned quality of deathlessnessThere is the case nanda where a monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution empty notselfHe turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines it to the phenomenon of deathlessness This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion stopping UnbindingStaying right there he reaches the ending of effluentsOr if not then  through this very Dhammapassion this very Dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldThe fact that the various levels of jhāna are nurtured  willed and thus dependent on conditions is important A realization of exactly how they are nurtured  a realization acquired only through practical experience with them  can give insight into the conditioned nature of all mental events and is one of the ways in which the attachment to jhāna as sustenance for becoming can be abandonedAn indication of how this happens is given in outline form in the Discourse on Mindfulness of In  Out BreathingTo take up the description of breath meditation where we left off Once there is direct awareness of the mind itself the various levels of jhāna are reviewedNow however primary attention is focused not on the object but on the mind as it relates to the object  the different ways in which it can be satisfied  steadied and the different factors from which it can be released by taking it through the different levelsHe trains himself I will breathe in out gladdening the mind He trains himself I will breathe in out steadying the mind He trains himself I will breathe in out releasing the mindThe states of gladdening steadiness  release experienced on these levels though are willed and therefore conditionedThe next step is to focus on the fact that these qualities being conditioned are inconstantOnce the mind sees directly that inconstancy is inherent both in the pleasure offered by jhāna and in the act of will that brings it about one becomes dispassionate toward it stops craving it and can relinquish any  all attachment to itHe trains himself I will breathe in out focusing on inconstancy He trains himself I will breathe in out focusing on dispassion He trains himself I will breathe in out focusing on stopping He trains himself I will breathe in out focusing on relinquishingAt the conclusion to the discourse the Buddha states that breath meditation when practiced often  repeatedly in this way results in the maturation of clear knowledge  releaseA more vivid description of how mastery of jhāna can lead to the insight that transcends it is given in the Discourse on the Analysis of the Properties there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminousJust as if a skilled goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up a crucible and taking gold with a pair of tongs place it in the crucibleHe would blow on it time  again sprinkle water on it time  again examine it time  again so that the gold would become refined wellrefined thoroughly refined flawless free from dross pliant malleable  luminousThen whatever sort of ornament he had in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  it would serve his purposeIn the same way there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminousHe discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space I would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine  thus supported thus sustained  would last for a long timeHe discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated He neither fabricates nor mentally fashions for the sake of becoming or unbecomingThis being the case he is not sustained by anything in the worldUnsustained he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldDoctrines of the self form the fourth mode of clinging sustenanceThe Canon reports a wide variety of such doctrines current in the Buddhas time only to reject them outofhand for two major reasonsThe first is that even the least articulated sense of self or selfidentification inevitably leads to stress  sufferingMonks do you see any clingingsustenance in the form of a doctrine of self which in clinging to there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairNo lordNeither do I How do you construe this monks If a person were to gather or burn or do as he likes with the grass twigs branches  leaves here in Jetas Grove would the thought occur to you Its us that this person is gathering burning or doing with as he likesNo lordWhy is thatBecause those things are not our self and do not pertain to our selfEven so monks whatever is not yours Let go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm happiness  benefitAnd what is not yoursForm is not yours Feeling is not yours Perception Fabrications Consciousness is not yoursLet go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm happiness  benefitThe second reason for rejecting doctrines of the self is that whatever form they take they all contain inherent inconsistenciesThe Buddhas most systematic treatment of this point is in the Great Discourse on Causation where he classifies all theories of the self into four major categories those describing a self possessed of form  finite possessed of form  infinite formless  finite and formless  infiniteThe text gives no examples for the categories but we might cite the following as illustrations theories that deny the existence of a soul and identify the self with the body theories that identify the self with all being or with the universe theories of discrete souls in individual beings theories of a unitary soul or identity immanent in all thingsDiscussing these various categories the Buddha states that people who adhere to any of them will state that the self already is of such a nature that it is destined to acquire such a nature after death or that it can be made into such a nature by various practicesHe then goes on to discuss the various ways people assume a self as defined in relation to feelingIn what respect nanda does one assume when assuming a selfAssuming feeling to be the self one assumes that Feeling is my self Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious  Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelingNow one who says Feeling is my self should be addressed as follows There are these three feelings my friend  feelings of pleasure feelings of pain  feelings of neither pleasure nor painWhich of these three feelings do you assume to be the selfAt a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed no feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensedOnly a feeling of pleasure is sensed at that momentAt a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensedOnly a feeling of pain is sensed at that momentAt a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of pain is sensedOnly a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at that moment Now a feeling of pleasure is inconstant compounded dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading  stoppingA feeling of pain A feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant subject to stoppingHaving sensed a feeling of pleasure as my self then with the stopping of ones very own feeling of pleasure my self has perishedHaving sensed a feeling of pain as my self Having sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as my self then with the stopping of ones very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain my self has perishedThus he assumes assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant entangled in pleasure  pain subject to arising  passing away he who says Feeling is my self Thus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the selfAs for the person who says Feeling is not the self My self is oblivious he should be addressed as follows My friend where nothing whatsoever is sensed at all would there be the thought I amNo lordThus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume that Feeling is not my self My self is obliviousAs for the person who says Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling he should be addressed as follows My friend should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder then with feeling completely not existing owing to the stopping of feeling would there be the thought I amNo lordThus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume that Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelingNow nanda in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self nor the self as oblivious nor that My self feels in that my self is subject to feeling then not assuming in this way he is not sustained by anything in the worldUnsustained he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldIf anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that The Tathāgata exists after death is his view that would be mistaken that The Tathāgata does not exist after death that The Tathāgata both exists  does not exist after death that The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death is his view that would be mistakenWhyHaving directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves Having directly known that the monk is releasedThe monk released having directly known that does not see does not know is his opinion that would be mistaken Views of the self can center around not only feeling but also physical form perception fabrications  consciousness  the five aggregates for sustenance  which according to another passage in the above discourse cover the extent of what can be designated expressed  described but none of which on investigation can rightfully be designated as selfI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Vārāṇasi in the Game Refuge at IsipatanaThere he addressed the group of five monksForm monks is notselfIf form were the self this form would not lend itself to diseaseOne could get form to be like this and not be like thatBut precisely because form is notself it lends itself to diseaseAnd one cannot get form to be like this and not be like thatFeeling is notself Perception is notself Fabrications are notselfConsciousness is notselfIf consciousness were the self this consciousness would not lend itself to diseaseOne could get consciousness to be like this and not be like thatBut precisely because consciousness is notself it lends itself to diseaseAnd one cannot get consciousness to be like this and not be like thatHow do you construe thus monks  Is form constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord  And whatever is inconstant Is it easeful or stressful  Stressful lord  And is it right to assume with regard to whatever is inconstant stressful subject to change that This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I am  No lordIs feeling constant or inconstant Is perception constant or inconstant Are fabrications constant or inconstantIs consciousness constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord  And whatever is inconstant Is it easeful or stressful  Stressful lord  And is it right to assume with regard to whatever is inconstant stressful subject to change that This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I am  No lordThus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling whatsoever Any perception whatsoever Any fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he grows dispassionateThrough dispassion he is releasedWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the group of five monks delighted at his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the hearts of the group of five monks through not clinging were released from effluentsOn the surface doctrines about the self would appear simply to be another variety of speculative viewThey deserve separate treatment though because they all come down to a deeply rooted sense of I am  a conceit coloring all perception at the most fundamental levelMonks any contemplatives or brāhmans who assume in various ways when assuming a self all assume the five aggregates for sustenance or a certain one of themWhich fiveThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form form as in the self or the self as in formHe assumes feeling to be the self perception to be the self fabrications to be the self He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThus both this assumption  the understanding I am occur to himAnd so it is with reference to the understanding I am that there is the appearance of the five faculties  eye ear nose tongue  bodyNow there is the intellect there are ideas there is the property of ignoranceTo an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by experience born of the contact of ignorance there occur I am I am thus I will be I will not be I will be possessed of form I will be formless I will be percipient I will be nonpercipient or I will be neither percipient nor nonpercipientThe five faculties monks continue as they wereAnd with regard to them the instructed noble disciple abandons ignorance and gives rise to clear knowingOwing to the fading of ignorance and the arising of clear knowing  I am I am this I will be neither percipient nor nonpercipient  do not occur to himThe sense of I am can prevent a person from reaching the goal even when he feels that he has abandoned attachment to sensuality speculative views  the experience of jhānaThere is the case monks where a certain contemplative or brāhman with the relinquishing of speculations about the past and the relinquishing of speculations about the future from being totally not determined on the fetters of sensuality and from the surmounting of the rapture of seclusion of pleasure notoftheflesh  of the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain thinks I am at peace I am unbound I am without clingingsustenanceWith regard to this the Tathāgata discerns This venerable contemplative or brāhman with the relinquishing of speculations about the past thinks I am at peace I am unbound I am without clingingsustenance Yes he affirms a practice conducive to UnbindingBut still he clings clinging to a speculation about the past or a speculation about the future or a fetter of sensuality or the rapture of seclusion or pleasure notoftheflesh or a feeling of neither pleasure nor painAnd the fact that he thinks I am at peace I am unbound I am without clingingsustenance  that in itself points to his clingingWith regard to this  fabricated gross  there is still the cessation of fabricationsKnowing There is that seeing the escape from it the Tathāgata has gone beyond itWhereas the contemplative or brāhman under discussion in this passage reads an I into what he is experiencing the Buddha simply observes that There is this This unadorned observation  which simply sees what is present in an experience as present and what is absent as absent  is treated in detail in the Lesser Discourse on EmptinessThere the Buddha describes how to develop it methodically in ascending stages passing through the levels of jhāna  in this case based on the object earth or solidity  and leading ultimately to Awakeningnanda just as this palace of Migāras mother is empty of elephants cattle  mares empty of gold  silver empty of assemblies of women  men and there is only this nonemptiness  the singleness based on the community of monks even so nanda a monk  not attending to the perception of village not attending to the perception of human being  attends to the singleness based on the perception of wildernessHis mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction settles  indulges in its perception of wildernessHe discerns that Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception of village that would exist based on the perception of human being are not presentThere is only this modicum of disturbance the singleness based on the perception of wilderness He discerns that This mode of perception is empty of the perception of villageThis mode of perception is empty of the perception of human beingThere is only this nonemptiness the singleness based on the perception of wilderness Thus he regards it as empty of whatever is not thereWhatever remains he discerns as present There is this And so this his entry into emptiness accords with actuality is undistorted in meaning  pureFurther nanda the monk  not attending to the perception of human being not attending to the perception of wilderness  attends to the singleness based on the perception of earthHis mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction settles  indulges in its perception of earthJust as a bulls hide is stretched free from wrinkles with a hundred stakes even so  without attending to all the ridges  hollows the river ravines the tracts of stumps  thorns the craggy irregularities of this earth  he attends to the singleness based on the perception of earthHis mind settles  indulges in its perception of earthHe discerns that Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception of human being that would exist based on the perception of wilderness are not presentThere is only this modicum of disturbance the singleness based on the perception of earth He discerns that This mode of perception is empty of the perception of human being empty of the perception of wildernessThere is only this nonemptiness the singleness based on the perception of earth Thus he regards it as empty of whatever is not thereWhatever remains he discerns as present There is this And so this his entry into emptiness accords with actuality is undistorted in meaning  pureFurther nanda the monk  not attending to the perception of wilderness not attending to the perception of earth  attends to the singleness based on the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space Further nanda the monk  not attending to the perception of the dimension of nothingness not attending to the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  attends to the singleness based on the signless concentration of awarenessHis mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction settles  indulges in its signless concentration of awarenessHe discerns that Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception of the dimension of nothingness that would exist based on the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception are not presentAnd there is only this modicum of disturbance that connected with the six sensory spheres dependent on this very body with life as its condition He discerns that This mode of perception is empty Further nanda the monk  not attending to the perception of the dimension of nothingness not attending to the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  attends to the singleness based on the signless concentration of awarenessHis mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction settles  indulges in its signless concentration of awarenessHe discerns that This signless concentration of awareness is fabricated  mentally fashioned And he discerns that Whatever is fabricated  mentally fashioned is inconstant  subject to stopping For him  thus knowing thus seeing  the mind is released from the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldHe discerns that Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance are not presentAnd there is only this modicum of disturbance that connected with the six sensory spheres dependent on this very body with life as its condition He discerns that This mode of perception is empty of the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignoranceAnd there is just this nonemptiness that connected with the six sensory spheres dependent on this very body with life as its condition Thus he regards it as empty of whatever is not thereWhatever remains he discerns as present There is this And so this his entry into emptiness accords with actuality is undistorted in meaning pure  superior  unsurpassednanda It is said that the world is empty the world is empty lordTo what extent is it said that the world is emptyThe Buddha Insofar as it is empty of self or of anything pertaining to self Thus it is said that the world is emptyAnd what is empty of self or of anything pertaining to selfThe eye is empty of self or of anything pertaining to selfForms Eyeconsciousness Eyecontact is empty of self or of anything pertaining to selfThe ear The nose The tongue The bodyThe intellect is empty of self or of anything pertaining to selfIdeas Intellectconsciousness Intellectcontact is empty of self or of anything pertaining to selfThus it is said that the world is emptyIn abandoning the notion of self with regard to the world  here defined in the same terms as the All  the Buddha did not however hold to a theory that there is no selfHaving sat to one side Vacchagotta the wanderer said to the Blessed One Now then Venerable Gotama is there a self When this was said the Blessed One was silentThen is there no self Again the Blessed One was silentThen Vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and leftThen not long after Vacchagotta the wanderer had left Venerable nanda said to the Blessed One Why lord did the Blessed One not answer when asked a question by Vacchagotta the wanderernanda if I being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self were to answer that there is a self that would be conforming with those contemplatives  brāhmans who are exponents of eternalismAnd if I were to answer that there is no self that would be conforming with those contemplatives  brāhmans who are exponents of annihilationismIf I were to answer that there is a self would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are notselfNo lordAnd if I were to answer that there is no self the bewildered Vacchagotta would become even more bewildered Does the self that I used to have now not existThis dialogue is one of the most controversial in the CanonThose who hold that the Buddha took a position one way or the other on the question of whether or not there is a self have to explain away the Buddhas silence and usually do so by focusing on his final statement to nandaIf someone else more spiritually mature than Vacchagotta had asked the question they say the Buddha would have revealed his true positionThis interpretation though ignores the fact that of the Buddhas four express reasons for not answering the question only the last is specific to VacchagottaThe first two hold true no matter who is asking the question To say that there is or is not a self would be to fall into one of two philosophical positions that the Buddha frequently attacked as incompatible with his teachingAs for his third reason the Buddha wanted to be consistent with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are notself not because he felt that this knowledge was worth holding onto in  of itself but because he saw that the arising of such knowledge could through causing the mind to let go of all forms of clingingsustenance lead to liberationThis point becomes clear when we compare the exchange with Vacchagotta given above to this one with MogharājaThe fundamental difference between this dialogue  the preceding one lies in the questions asked In the first Vacchagotta asks the Buddha to take a position on the metaphysical question of whether or not there is a self and the Buddha remains silentIn the second Mogharāja asks for a way to view the world so that one can go beyond death and the Buddha speaks teaching him to view the world without reference to the notion of selfThis suggests that instead of being a metaphysical assertion that there is no self the teaching on notself is more a strategy a technique of perception aimed at leading beyond death to Unbinding  a way of perceiving things that involves no selfidentification no sense that I am no attachment to I or mine And this would be in keeping with the discernment the Buddha recommends in the Discourse on the Supreme Net one that judges views not in terms of their content but in terms of where they come from and where they leadIf a person aiming at Unbinding is not to view the world in terms of self then in what terms should he or she view itThe Buddhas comment to Anurādha  It is only stress that I describe and the stopping of stress  suggests an answer and this answer is borne out by a series of other passages in the CanonLord Right view right view it is saidTo what extent is there right viewBy  large Kaccāyana this world is supported by a polarity that of existence  nonexistenceBut when one sees the origination of the world as it has come to be with right discernment nonexistence with reference to the world doesnt occur to oneWhen one sees the stopping of the world as it has come to be with right discernment existence with reference to the world doesnt occur to oneBy  large Kaccāyana this world is in bondage to attachments clingings  biasesBut one such as this doesnt get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions nor is he resolved on my self He has no uncertainty or doubt that mere stress when arising is arising stress when passing away is passing awayIn this his knowledge is independent of othersIts to this extent Kaccāyana that there is right viewThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person does not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he doesnt attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attention This is how he attends inappropriately Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the pastWill I be in the futureWill I not be in the futureWhat will I be in the futureHow will I be in the futureHaving been what what will I be in the future Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhere has this being come fromWhere is it boundAs this person attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely because of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely because of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely because of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternityThis is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairHe is not freed from stress I sayThe welltaught noble disciple discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he doesnt attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origin of stress This is the stopping of stress This is the way leading to the stopping of stressAs he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview uncertainty  grasping at habits  practicesNow this monks is the noble truth of stress Birth is stress aging is stress death is stress sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stress association with the unbeloved is stress separation from the loved is stress not getting what is wanted is stressIn short the five aggregates for sustenance are stressAnd this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecomingAnd this monks is the noble truth of the stopping of stress the remainderless fading  stopping renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very cravingAnd this monks is the noble truth of the way leading to the stopping of stress precisely this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationVision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before This is the noble truth of stress This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended This noble truth of stress has been comprehended This is the noble truth of the origination of stress This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned This noble truth of the origination of stress has been abandoned This is the noble truth of the stopping of stress This noble truth of the stopping of stress is to be realized This noble truth of the stopping of stress has been realized This is the noble truth of the way leading to the stopping of stress This noble truth of the way leading to the stopping of stress is to be developed This noble truth of the way leading to the stopping of stress has been developedAnd monks as long as this threeround twelvepermutation knowledge  vision of mine concerning these four noble truths as they have come to be was not pure I did not claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening But as soon as this threeround twelvepermutation knowledge  vision of mine concerning these four noble truths as they have come to be was truly pure then did I claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening Knowledge  vision arose in me Unprovoked is my releaseThis is the last birthThere is now no further becomingJust as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid  unsullied  where a man with good eyes standing on the bank could see shells gravel  pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about  resting and it would occur to him This pool of water is clear limpid  unsulliedHere are these shells gravel  pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about  resting So too the monk discerns as it actually is that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the stopping of stress This is the way leading to the stopping of stress These are effluents This is the origination of effluents This is the stopping of effluents This is the way leading to the stopping of effluents His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the effluent of sensuality released from the effluent of becoming released from the effluent of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis great king is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here  now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeAnd as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life higher  more sublime than this there is noneThus for the person who aims at Unbinding the Buddha recommends a technique of perception that regards things simply in terms of the four truths concerning stress with no selfidentification no sense that I am no attachment to I or mine involvedAlthough as the following passage states there may be a temporary functional identity to ones range of perception this identity goes no further than thatOne recognizes it for what it is inconstant  conditioned and thus not worthy of being taken as a self  for in transcending attachment to it there is the realization of deathlessnessnanda Its wonderful lord its marvelousFor truly the Blessed One has pointed out the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the nextBut what then lord is the noble liberationThe Buddha There is the case nanda where a noble disciple considers that Sensual pleasure here  now and in lives to come form here  now and in lives to come perceptions of form here  now and in lives to come perceptions of imperturbability perceptions of the dimension of nothingness perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception that is an identity to the extent that there is identitythis is deathless the liberation of the mind through lack of clingingsustenanceOnce the sense of self is transcended its polar opposite  the sense of something standing in contradistinction to a self  is transcended as wellIn the Discourse at Kālakas Park the Buddha expresses this lack of a selfnonself polarity directly in terms of sensory experienceFor a person who has attained the goal experience occurs with no subject or object superimposed on it no construing of experience or thing experiencedThere is simply the experience in  of itselfMonks whatever in this world  with its gods Māras  Brahmās its generations complete with contemplatives  brāhmans princes  men  is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect That do I knowWhatever in this world is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect That I directly knowThat is known by the Tathāgata but in the Tathāgata it has not been establishedThus monks the Tathāgata when seeing what is to be seen doesnt construe seen doesnt construe an unseen doesnt construe tobeseen doesnt construe a seerWhen hearing When sensingWhen cognizing what is to be cognized he doesnt construe cognized doesnt construe an uncognized doesnt construe tobecognized doesnt construe a cognizerThus monks the Tathāgata  being suchlike with regard to all phenomena that can be seen heard sensed  cognized  is Such And I tell you There is no other Such higher or more sublimeA view is true or false only when one is judging how accurately it refers to something elseIf one is regarding it simply as an event in  of itself true  false no longer applyThus for the Tathāgata  who no longer needs to impose notions of subject or object on experience and can regard sights sounds feelings  thoughts purely in  of themselves  views are not necessarily true or false but can simply serve as phenomena to be experiencedWith no notion of subject there is no grounds for I know I see with no notion of object no grounds for Thats just how it is So  although a Tathāgata may continue using true  false in the course of teaching others and may continue reflecting on right view as a means of abiding mindfully  comfortably in the present  notions of true false self  not self have lost all their holding power over the mindAs a result the mind can see conditioned events in their suchness  such are the aggregates such their origin such their disappearance  and is left free to its own Suchness unrestrained uninfluenced by anything of any sortThis concludes our survey of the four modes of clinging sustenance  passion  delight for sensuality for views for habits  practices and for doctrines of the self  and should be enough to give a sense of what is loosed in the Unbinding of the mindAll that remains now is the question of howMany of the passages we have considered seem to suggest that total Unbinding may be realized by letting go of any one of these four modes of sustenanceWhat most likely happens in such cases though is that the abandoning of one mode immediately triggers an abandoning of the remaining three for there are other cases reported in the Canon where the experience of Unbinding comes in stages spread over time the arising of the eye of Dhamma which frees one from passion  delight for identity views uncertainty and grasping at habits  practices the attainment of Nonreturning which frees one from passion  delight for sensuality and the attainment of Arahantship which frees one from passion  delight for all views the practice of jhāna  the conceit I am Why these stages happen in this order and how they relate to the practices meant to induce them is what we will take up nextOnce the Blessed One was dwelling in the Vajji country at Ukkacela on the bank of the river Ganges not long after Sariputta and Maha Moggallana had passed awayAnd at that time the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by company of monksThe Blessed One surveyed the silent gathering of monks and then spoke to them sayingThis assembly O bhikkhus appears indeed empty to me now that Sariputta and Maha Moggallana have passed awayNot empty for me is an assembly nor need I have concern for a place where Sariputta and Maha Moggallana dwellThose who in the past have been Holy OnesFully enlightened Ones those Blessed Ones too had such excellent pairs of disciples as I had in Sariputta and Maha MoggallanaThose who in the future will be Holy Ones fully Enlightened Ones those Blessed Ones too will have such excellent pairs of disciples as I had in Sariputta and Maha MoggallanaMarvelous it is most wonderful it is bhikkhus concerning those disciples that they will act in accordance with the Masters Dispensation will act in according to his advice that they will be dear to the four Assemblies will be loved respected and honored by themMarvelous it is most wonderful it is bhikkhus concerning the Perfect Ones that when such a pair of disciples has passed away there is no grief no lamentation on the part of the Perfect OneFor of that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not departThat indeed is not possibleTherefore bhikkhus be ye an island unto yourselves a refuge unto yourselves seeking no external refuge with the Teaching as your island the Teaching your refuge seeking no other refugeSee also DN SNOnce the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Anathapindikas parkAt that time the Venerable Sariputta was at Nalaka village in the Magadha country and was sick suffering gravely illThe Novice Cunda was his attendantAnd the Venerable Sariputta passed away finally through that very illnessThen the Novice Cunda took the almsbowl and robes of the Venerable Sariputta and went to Savatthi to the Jeta Grove Anathapindikas parkThere he betook himself to the Venerable Ananda and having saluted him seated himself at one sideThus seated he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Venerable sir the Venerable Sariputta has had his final passing awayThese are his bowl and robesOn this matter Cunda we ought to see the Blessed OneLet us go friend Cunda and meet the MasterHaving met him we shall acquaint the Blessed One with that factYes Venerable sir said the Novice CundaThey went to see the Blessed One and having arrived there and saluted the Master they seated themselves at one sideThen the Venerable Ananda addressed the Blessed OneO Lord the Novice Cunda has told me this The Venerable Sariputta has had his final passing awayThese are his bowl and robes Then O Lord my own body became weak as a creeper everything around became dim and things were no longer clear to me when I heard about the final passing away of the Venerable SariputtaHow is this AnandaWhen Sariputta had his final passing away did he take from you your portion of virtue or your portion of concentration or your portion of the knowledge and vision of deliveranceNot so LordWhen the Venerable Sariputta had his final passing away he did not take my portion of virtue concentration wisdom deliverance or my portion of the knowledge and vision of deliveranceBut O Lord the Venerable Sariputta has been to me a mentor teacher and instructor one who rouses inspires and gladdens untiring in preaching Dhamma a helper of his fellow monksAnd we remember how vitalizing enjoyable and helpful his Dhamma instruction wasHave I not taught you aforetime Ananda that it is the nature of all things near and dear to us that we must suffer separation from them and be severed from themOf that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not departThat indeed is not possibleIt is Ananda as though from a mighty hardwood tree a large branch should break off so has Sariputta now had his final passing away from this great and sound community of bhikkhusIndeed Ananda of that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not departThis indeed is not possibleTherefore Ananda be ye an island unto yourself a refuge unto yourself seeking no external refuge with the Teaching as your island the Teaching your refuge seeking no other refugeSee also DN SNThere is O monks worldly joy there is unworldly joy and there is

BambooGrove Monastery at the Squirrels Feeding PlaceThere a wandering ascetic Moliya Sivaka by name called on the Blessed One and after an exchange of courteous and friendly words sat down at one sideThus seated he saidThere are revered Gotama some ascetics and brahmans who have this doctrine and view Whatever a person experiences be it pleasure pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by previous action Now what does the revered Gotama say about thisProduced by bile there arise Sivaka certain kinds of feelingsThat this happens can be known by oneself also in the world it is accepted as trueProduced by phlegm of wind of combined by change of climate by adverse behavior by injuries by the results of Kamma  Sivaka there arise certain kinds of feelingsThat this happens can be known by oneself also in the world it is accepted as trueNow when these ascetics and brahmans have such a doctrine and view that whatever a person experiences be it pleasure pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by previous action then they go beyond what they know by themselves and what is accepted as true by the worldTherefore I say that this is wrong on the part of these ascetics and brahmansWhen this was spoken Moliya Sivaka the wandering ascetic said It is excellent revered Gotama it is excellent indeedMay the revered Gotama regard me as a lay follower who from today has taken refuge in him as long as life lastsOnce the Venerable Ananda went to see the Blessed OneHaving saluted him respectfully he sat down at one sideThus seated he saidWhat are the

sideSeated thus he spoke to the Blessed One as followsWhen I went into seclusion while I was in solitude this thought occurred to me Three feelings have been taught by the Blessed One pleasant painful and neutral feelingsBut the Blessed One has also said that whatever is felt is within suffering Now with reference to what was it stated by the Blessed One that whatever is felt is within sufferingWell spoken monk well spokenWhile three feelings have been taught by me the pleasant the painful and the neutral yet I have also said that whatever is felt is within sufferingThis however was stated by me with reference to the impermanence of conditioned phenomenaI have said it because conditioned phenomena are liable to destruction to evanescence to fading away to cessation and to changeIt is with reference to this that I have stated Whatever is felt is within sufferingI have further taught monk the gradual cessation of conditioned phenomenaIn him who has attained the first

that is liable to be felt as pleasurable there arises a pleasant feelingWhen that very senseimpression liable to be felt as pleasurable has ceased then the sensation born from it  namely the pleasant feeling that arose dependent on that senseimpression  also ceases and is stilledDependent on a senseimpression that is liable to be felt as painful there arises a painful feelingWhen that very senseimpression liable to be felt as painful has ceased then the sensation born from it  namely the painful feeling that arose dependent on that senseimpression  also ceases and is stilledDependent on a senseimpression that is liable to be felt as neutral there arises a neutral feelingWhen that very senseimpression liable to be felt as neutral has ceased then the sensation born from it  namely the neutral feeling that arose dependent on that senseimpression  also ceases and is stilledJust as from the coming together and rubbing of two sticks of wood heat results and fire is produced and by the separation and disconnection of the sticks the heat produced by them ceases and disappears so it is also with these three feelings which are born of senseimpression rooted in senseimpression caused by senseimpression dependent on senseimpression dependent on a senseimpression of a certain kind there arises a corresponding feeling by the cessation of that senseimpression the corresponding feeling ceasesThe three kinds of feelings O monks are impermanent compounded dependently arisen liable to destruction to evanescence to fading away to cessation  namely pleasant feeling painful feeling and neutral feelingOnce the Blessed One dwelt at Vesali in the Great Forest at the Gabled HouseIn the evening after had arisen from his seclusion he went to the sick room and sat down on a prepared

this monk knows After the dissolution of the body when life ends all these feelings which are unrelished will come to rest even hereAn untaught worldling O monks experiences pleasant feelings he experiences painful feelings and he experiences neutral feelingsA welltaught noble disciple likewise experiences pleasant painful and neutral feelingsNow what is the distinction the diversity the difference that exists herein between a welltaught noble disciple and an untaught worldlingWhen an untaught worldling is touched by a painful feeling he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraughtHe thus experiences two kinds of feelings a bodily and a mental feelingIt is as if a man were pierced by a dart and following the first piercing he is hit by a second dartSo that person will experience feelings caused by two dartsIt is similar with an untaught worldling when touched by a painful feeling he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraughtSo he experiences two kinds of feeling a bodily and a mental feelingHaving been touched by that painful feeling he resists itThen in him who so resists that painful feeling an underlying tendency of resistance against that painful feeling comes to underlieUnder the impact of that painful feeling he then proceeds to enjoy sensual happinessAnd why does he do soAn untaught worldling O monks does not know of any other escape from painful feelings except the enjoyment of sensual happinessThen in him who enjoys sensual happiness an underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feelings comes to underlieHe does not know according to facts the arising and ending of these feelings nor the gratification the danger and the escape connected with these feelingsIn him who lacks that knowledge an underlying tendency to ignorance as to neutral feelings comes to underlieWhen he experiences a pleasant feeling a painful feeling or a neutral feeling he feels it as one fettered by itSuch a one O monks is called an untaught worldling who is fettered by birth by old age by death by sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairHe is fettered by suffering this I declareBut in the case of a welltaught noble disciple O monks when he is touched by a painful feeling he will not worry nor grieve and lament he will not beat his breast and weep nor will he be distraughtIt is one kind of feeling he experiences a bodily one but not a mental feelingIt is as if a man were pierced by a dart but was not hit by a second dart following the first oneSo this person experiences feelings caused by a single dart onlyIt is similar with a welltaught noble disciple when touched by a painful feeling he will no worry nor grieve and lament he will not beat his breast and weep nor will he be distraughtHe experiences one single feeling a bodily oneHaving been touched by that painful feeling he does not resist itHence in him no underlying tendency of resistance against that painful feeling comes to underlieUnder the impact of that painful feeling he does not proceed to enjoy sensual happinessAnd why notAs a welltaught noble disciple he knows of an escape from painful feelings other than by enjoying sensual happinessThen in him who does not proceed to enjoy sensual happiness no underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feelings comes to underlieHe knows according to facts the arising and ending of those feelings and the gratification the danger and the escape connected with these feelingsIn him who knows thus no underlying tendency to ignorance as to neutral feelings comes to underlieWhen he experiences a pleasant feeling a painful feeling or a neutral feeling he feels it as one who is not fettered by itSuch a one O monks is called a welltaught noble disciple who is not fettered by birth by old age by death by sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairHe is not fettered to suffering this I declareThis O monks is the distinction the diversity the difference that exists between a welltaught noble disciple and an untaught worldlingThere are O monks these three feelings pleasant painful and neitherpainfulnorpleasantPleasant feelings should be known as painful painful feelings should be known as a thorn and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings should be known as impermanentIf a monk has known the feelings in such a way it is said of him that he has the right outlookHe has cut off craving severed the fetters and through the full penetration of conceit he has made an end of sufferingWhen O monks an untaught worldling says that in the great ocean there is a pit he speaks about something unreal and not factualThe pit O monks is rather a name for painful bodily feelingsWhen an untaught worldling is afflicted by painful bodily feelings he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraughtHe is then said to be an untaught worldling who cannot withstand the bottomless pit and cannot gain a foothold in itBut when a welltaught noble disciple is afflicted by painful bodily feelings he will not worry nor grieve and lament he will not beat his breast and weep nor will he be distraughtHe is then said to be a noble disciple who can withstand the bottomless pit and has gained a foothold in itIn the case of pleasant feelings O monks the underlying tendency to lust should be given up in the case of painful feelings the underlying tendency to resistance should be given up in the case of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings the underlying tendency to ignorance should be given upIf a monk has given up the tendency to lust in regard to pleasant feeling the tendency to resistance in regard to painful feelings and the tendency to ignorance in regard to neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings then he is called one who is free of tendencies one who has the right outlookHe has cut off craving severed the fetters and through the full penetration of conceit he has made an end of sufferingThere are O monks these three feelings pleasant feelings painful feelings and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingsThere are O monks these three feelings pleasant feelings painful feelings and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingsAt SavatthiThere are O monks four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birthWhat are the fourEdible food coarse and fine senseimpression is the second volitional thought the third and consciousness the fourthIf O monks there is lust for the nutriment edible food if there is pleasure in it and craving for it then consciousness takes a hold therein and growsWhere consciousness takes a hold and grows there will be occurrence of mindandbodyWhere there is occurrence of mindandbody there is growth of kammaformationsWhere there is growth of kammaformations there is a future arising of renewed existenceWhere there is a future arising of renewed existence there is future birth decay and deathThis I say O monks is laden with sorrow burdened with anguish and despairIf O monks there is lust for the nutriment senseimpression volitional thought consciousness if there is pleasure in it and craving for it then consciousness takes a hold therein and growsWhere consciousness takes a hold and grows there will be occurrence of mindandbodyWhere there is occurrence of mindandbody there is growth of kammaformationsWhere there is growth of kammaformations there is a future arising of renewed existenceWhere there is a future arising of renewed existence there is future birth decay and deathThis I say O monks is laden with sorrow burdened with anguish and despairSuppose there is a dyer or a painterHaving some dye or lac turmeric indigo or crimson he would depict on a wellsmoothed wooden tablet on a wall or a piece of cloth the figure of a woman or a man with all the major and minor featuresSimilarly O monks if there is lust for the nutriments edible food senseimpression volitional thought and consciousness then consciousness takes a hold therein and growsWhere consciousness takes a hold and grows there is occurrence of mindandbodyWhere there is occurrence of mindandbody there is growth of kammaformationsWhere there is growth of kammaformations there is a future arising of renewed existenceWhere there is a future arising of renewed existence there is future birth decay and deathThis I say O monks is laden with sorrow burdened with anguish and despairBut if O monks there is no lust for the nutriments edible food senseimpression volitional thought and consciousness if there is no pleasure in them and no craving for them then consciousness does not take a hold therein and does not growWhere consciousness does not take a hold nor grow there will be no occurrence of mindandbodyWhere there is no occurrence of mindandbody there is no growth of kammaformationsWhere there is no growth of kammaformations there is no future arising of renewed existenceWhere there is no future arising of renewed existence there is no future birth decay and deathThis I say O monks is free of sorrow of anguish and despairSuppose O monks there is a gabled house or a gabled hall with windows at the northern southern and eastern sidesNow when at sunrise a ray of the sun enters through a window where would it find hold  On the western wall O Lord  But if there were no western wall O monks where would it find a hold  On the earth O Lord  And if there were no earth where would it find a hold  On the water O Lord  And if there were no water where would it find a hold  It would not find any hold whatsoever O LordSimilarly O monks if there is no lust for the nutriments edible food senseimpression volitional thought and consciousness if there is no pleasure in them and no craving for them then consciousness does not take hold therein and does not growWhere consciousness does not take a hold nor grow there will be no occurrence of mindandbody there is no growth of kammaformationsWhere there is no growth of kammaformations there is no future arising of renewed existenceWhere there is no future arising of renewed existence there is no future birth decay and deathThis I say O monks is free of sorrow of anguish and despairComy This is the application of the simile the dyer or painter is the kamma with its adjunctsThe wooden tablets the wall or the piece of cloth correspond to the three planes of existence in the cycle of rebirthsAs the painter produces a figure on a clean surface so kamma with its adjuncts produces forms in various existencesIf the painter is unskilled the figures he paints will be ugly misshapen and not pleasing similarly if a person performs a kamma with mind devoid of knowledge then that kamma will produce a form that does not lend beauty to the eye etc but will be ugly misshapen and not pleasing even to father and motherBut if the painter is skillful the figures he produces will be beautiful of attractive shape and pleasing similarly if a person performs kamma in a state of mind imbued with knowledge then the bodily form produced by that kamma will give beauty to the eye etc will be attractive and wellshapen like a finished work of artHere taking nutriment together with consciousness there is one link between nutriment and mindandbodyIncluding mindandbody in the section of the resultants there is one link between mindandbody and kammaformationsFinally there is one link between kammaformations and the future existenceSee also SN SN SN SN AN The Four Nutriments of Life by Nyanaponika TheraAt SavatthiMonks remain with your minds wellestablished in the four establishings of

the second group of denying the concept of anatta or notself whereas the second group accused the first of being unable to account for the truths that they said their concept of person explainedBoth groups however found that their positions entangled them in philosophical difficulties that have never been successfully resolvedPerhaps the most useful lesson to draw from the history of this controversy is the one that accords with the Buddhas statements in MN where he refuses to get involved in questions of whether a person has a live essence separate from or identical to hisher body or of whether after death there is something of an arahant that exists or notIn other words the questions arent worth askingNothing is accomplished by assuming or denying an ultimate reality behind what we think of as a personInstead the strategy of the practice is to comprehend the burden that we each are carrying and to throw it offAs SNpoints out when one stops trying to define oneself in any way

for lifeEven if a man does not will and plan yet if he dwells on something this forms a basis for the continuation of consciousness rebirth takes placeBut if a man neither wills nor plans nor dwells on anything no basis is formed for the continuation of consciousnessThis basis being absent consciousness has no lodgmentConsciousness not being lodged there and not growing no rebirth of renewed

described in dependent originationWhen his interlocutor asks for each factor in the causal process Which is the X and whose is the X the Buddha equates this with the assumption that X is one thing and it is the X of someonesomething else He then equates this with the proposition which he has rejected many times elsewhere in the discourses that the lifeprinciple is one thing and the body is something else ie that there is something unseen lying behind the visible processes of lifeHowever the Buddha has also rejected in as many times the proposition that the lifeprinciple is the same as the body ie that there is nothing unseen lying behind the visible processes of lifeAvoiding these two extremes he simply drops the question and focuses attention on what is directly perceivable  the way one factor in dependent coarising functions as a prerequisite for the nextIf one were to focus on what might or might not lie behind these factors one would be tied up in speculations about what by definition can never be experiencedBut by focusing on the interplay of the factors that are directly perceivable and  by so doing  developing dispassion for them one can overcome the craving and

another sect and who desires the going forth  admission in this doctrine  discipline must first undergo probation for four monthsIf at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth  admit him to the monks stateBut I know distinctions among individuals in this matterLord if that is so I am willing to undergo probation for four yearsIf at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth  admit me to the monks stateThen Kassapa the clothless ascetic obtained the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained admissionAnd not

Right view right view it is saidTo what extent is there right viewBy  large Kaccayana this world is supported by a polarity that of existence  nonexistenceBut when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment nonexistence with reference to the world does not occur to oneWhen one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment existence with reference to the world does not occur to oneBy  large Kaccayana this world is in bondage to attachments clingings  biasesBut one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions nor is he resolved on my self He has no uncertainty or doubt that just stress when arising is arising stress when passing away is passing awayIn this his knowledge is independent of othersIts to this extent Kaccayana that there is right viewEverything exists That is one extremeEverything doesnt exist That is a second

the pattern for dependent coarising placing them in the position usually occupied by clinging after craving and before becomingPutting nutriment in this position highlights one of the connotations of the Pali word for clinging upadana which can also mean sustenance It also highlights one of the connotations of the Pali word for craving tanha which can also mean thirstThe Commentary to this discourse tries to fit this teaching into the threelifetime interpretation of dependent coarising emphasizing the role of the four nutriments in the mechanics of death and rebirth but there is no need to limit the teaching to this interpretationThe teachings both in this discourse and in the following one show the complex interactions and feedback loops among the different factors of dependent

being born growing old dying passing over and being rebornBut from all this suffering from decay and death no way of release is apparentSurely there must be some way of release discoverable from this suffering this decayanddeathThen monks this thought occurred to me What being present does decayanddeath come to beWhat conditions decayanddeath Then monks as I considered this thoroughly the insight

consciousness So there comes about the arising of this entire mass of sufferingArising arising  At this thought monks there arose in me concerning things unheard of before vision knowledge

there arose in me concerning things unheard of before vision knowledge understanding lightRight view right view it is said LordIn what way Lord is there right viewThe world in general Kaccaayana inclines to two views to existence or to nonexistenceBut for him who with the highest wisdom sees the uprising of the world as it really is nonexistence of the world does not apply and for him who with highest wisdom sees the passing away of the world as it really is existence of the world does not applyThe world in general Kaccaayana grasps after systems and is imprisoned by dogmasBut he does not go along with that systemgrasping that mental obstinacy and dogmatic bias does not grasp at it does not affirm This is my self He knows without doubt or hesitation that whatever arises is merely dukkha that what passes away is merely dukkha and such knowledge is his own not depending on anyone elseThis Kaccaayana is what constitutes right viewEverything exists this is one extreme nothing exists this is the other extremeAvoiding both extremes the Tathaagata teaches a doctrine of the middle Conditioned by ignorance are the formations So there comes about the arising of this entire mass of sufferingBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there comes the cessation of the formations from the cessation of the formations comes the cessation of consciousness So there comes about the complete cessation of this entire mass of sufferingDukkha in Buddhist usage refers to the inherent unsatisfactoriness and general insecurity of all conditioned existenceThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at the monastery of AnathapindikaThen he addressed the monks saying O monks  Venerable Sir said the monks by way of reply to the Blessed OneThereupon he spoke as followsMonks I shall relate a former incidentThere arose a battle between the Devas and AsurasThen Sakka the Lord of the devas addressed the devas of the Tavatimsa heaven thusHappy ones if the devas who have gone to the battle should experience fear or terror or suffer from hair standing on end let them behold the crest of my own bannerIf you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass awayIf you fail to look up to the crest of my banner look at the crest of the banner of Pajapati King of godsIf you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass awayIf you fail to look up to the crest of Pajapati King of the gods look at the crest of the banner of Varuna King of the godsIf you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass awayMonks any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in them who look at the crest of the banner of Sakka The Lord of the gods of Pajapati of Varuna of Isana the King of the gods any fear terror or hair standing on end may pass away or may not pass awayWhat is the reason for thisSakka the Lord of gods O monks is not free from lust not free from hate not free from delusion and is therefore liable to fear terror fright and flightI also say unto you O monks  if any fear terror or hair standing on end should arise in you when you have gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty house then think only of me thusSuch Indeed is the Blessed One arahant supremely enlightened endowed with knowledge and virtue welcome being knower of worlds the peerless trainer of persons teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Blessed One Monks if you think of me any fear terror or standing of hair on end that may arise in you will pass awayIf you fail to think of me then think of the Dhamma thus Well expounded is the Dhamma by the Blessed One a Dhamma to be realized by oneself and gives immediate results a Dhamma which invites investigation and leads up to Nibbana a Dhamma to be understood by the wise each for himself Monks if you think of the Dhamma any fear terror or hair standing on end that may arise in you will pass awayIf you fail to think of the Dhamma then think of the Sangha thus Of good conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One of upright conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One of wise conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One of dutiful conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed OneThis Order of Disciples of the Blessed One  namely those four pairs of persons the eight kinds of individuals  is worthy of offerings is worthy of hospitality is worthy of gifts is worthy of reverential salutations is an incomparable field of merit for the world Monks if you think of the Sangha any fear terror or hair standing on end that may arise in you will pass awayWhat is the reason for thisThe Tathagata O monks who is arahant supremely enlightened is free from lust free from hate is free from delusion and is not liable to fear terror fright or flightSo said the Blessed OneHaving thus spoken the teacher the Welcome Being further saidOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Once in the past the devas  asuras were arrayed for battleThen Vepacitti the asuraking said to Sakka the devaking Let there be victory through what is well spokenYes Vepacitti let there be victory through what is well spokenSo the devas  asuras appointed a panel of judges These will decide for us what is well spoken  poorly spokenThen Vepacitti the asuraking said to Sakka the devaking Say a verse devakingWhen this was said Sakka the devaking said to Vepacitti the asuraking But you are the senior deity here VepacittiYou say a verseWhen this was said Vepacitti recited this verseWhen Vepacitti had said this verse the asuras applauded but the devas were silentSo Vepacitti said to Sakka Say a verse devakingWhen this was said Sakka recited this verseWhen Sakka had said this verse the devas applauded but the asuras were silentSo Sakka said to Vepacitti Say a verse VepacittiWhen this was said Vepacitti recited this verseWhen Vepacitti had said this verse the asuras applauded but the devas were silentSo Vepacitti said to Sakka Say a verse devakingWhen this was said Sakka recited this verseWhen Sakka had said this verse the devas applauded but the asuras were silentThen the deva  asura panel of judges said The verses said by Vepacitti the asuraking lie in the sphere of swords  weapons  thence arguments quarrels  strifeWhereas the verses said by Sakka the devaking lies outside the sphere of swords  weapons  thence no arguments no quarrels no strifeThe victory through what is well spoken goes to Sakka the devakingAnd that monks is how the victory through what was well spoken went to Sakka the devakingThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living in the abode of Alavaka the Yakkha at AlaviThen Alavaka approached the Blessed One and said Get out recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went outCome in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One enteredGet out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a second time Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went outCome in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One enteredGet out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a third time Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went outCome in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One enteredGet out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a fourth time No O friend I will not get outDo what you willI will ask you a question recluseIf you do not answer me I will confound your mind or cleave your heart or take you by your feet and fling you over to the further shore of the oceanWell friend I do not see anyone in the world of Devas Maras Brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans who could either confound my mind or cleave my heart or take me by the feet and fling me over to the further shore of the ocean nevertheless friend ask what you willThen Alavaka addressed the Blessed One in verseHaving thus spoken Alavaka said to the Blessed OneMost excellent O Gotama is thy teaching most excellentJust as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the Dhamma has been declared in many a manner by the Venerable GotamaI take refuge in the Venerable Gotama in the Dhamma and in the SanghaMay the Venerable Gotama accept me as a disciple who has taken refuge from this day forth while life lastsTranslators note This lively exchange between a forestdwelling monk and a benevolent deity is filled with poetic movement and gives us a glimpse of the care with which some people practiced in the time of the BuddhaSince the working definition of stealing was taking what has not been given the Devata is correct  in a very strict senseNotice that the monk at first reacts defensively denying that he is doing anything wrong and then tries to shift the blame to others who do even worseAfter recognizing a veiled compliment he finally realizes that the Devata is trying to help him at which point he encourages further helpThe Devata ends the exchange sharply revealing an intriguing and capricious character who is willing to help but only on his own termsThis is a role often played by nature spirits and other minor deities in the Pali textsI have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicketNow at that time after his meal returning from his almsround he went down to a lotus pond and sniffed a red lotusThen the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verseThe monk chastened by the devata came to his sensesI have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicketNow at that time he spent the days abiding thinking evil unskillful thoughts ie thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will thoughts of doing harmThen the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verseThe monk chastened by the devata came to his sensesOn one occasion a certain monk a Vajjian princeling was dwelling near Vesali in a forest thicketAnd on that occasion an allnight festival was being held in VesaliThe monk  lamenting as he heard the resounding din of wind music string music  gongs coming from Vesali on that occasion recited this verseThen the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verseThe monk chastened by the devata came to his sensesI have heard that on one occasion VenAnuruddha was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicketNow at that time a devata from the retinue of the heaven of the Thirtythree named Jalini one of VenAnuruddhas former consorts went to him and on arrival addressed him with this verseI have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicketNow at that time as he had gone to spend the day he was thinking unskillful thoughts connected with the household lifeThen the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verseThe monk chastened by the devata came to his sensesOn one occasion VenAnanda was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen early in the morning he put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe went into Savatthi for alms with VenVangisa as his attendant monkNow at that time dissatisfaction had arisen in VenVangisaLust invaded his mindSo he addressed VenAnanda with this verseAt that time the brahman Sangaarava was living there a puritybywater man who believed in purification by water his practice was to go down into the water every evening and every morningNow the Venerable Aananda rising early took his robe and bowl and went into Saavatthii for almsIt would be well Lord if the Blessed One were to visit the dwelling of Sangaarava the Brahman out of compassion for himThe Blessed One silently consentedIs it true brahman that you are a puritybywater man that you go down to the water every evening and morningYes good GotamaWhat benefit do you expect fromIt is like this good GotamaThe evil deeds that I do in the day I cause to be borne away in the evening and the evil deeds that I do in the night I cause to be borne away in the morningThat is the benefit I expect from At these words the Brahman Sangaarava said to the Blessed One Excellent I go to the Lord Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay the Lord Gotama accept me as a laydisciple who has taken refuge in him from this day forth as long as life shall lastThis has come to be  do you see that SaariputtaThis has come to be  that O Lord one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that this has come to be one is on the way towards revulsion from what has come to be towards dispassion and cessationProduced by such nutriment  that one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that this has been produced by such nutriment one is on the way towards revulsion from its production by nutriment towards dispassion and cessationBy the cessation of nutriment that what has come to be is bound to cease  that one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that By the cessation of that nutriment what has come to be is bound to cease one is on the way towards revulsion from what is liable to cease towards dispassion and cessationThus O Lord is one in higher trainingAnd how O Lord is one a comprehender of DhammaThis has come to be  that O Lord one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that this has come to be then through revulsion from what has come to be through dispassion and the cessation one is liberated without any clingingProduced by such nutriment  that one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that this has been produced by such nutriment then through revulsion from its production by nutriment through dispassion and the cessation one is liberated without any clingingBy the cessation of nutriment that what has come to be is bound to cease  that one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that by the cessation of that nutriment what has come to be is bound to cease then through revulsion from what is liable to cease from dispassion and the cessation one is liberated without any clingingThus O Lord is one a comprehender of Dhamma Well spoken Saariputta well spoken said the Exalted OneThere are O monks four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birthWhat are the fourEdible food coarse and fine secondly senseimpression thirdly volitional thought fourthly consciousnessAfter these words the venerable MoliyaPhagguna addressed the Exalted One as followsWho O Lord consumes the nutriment consciousnessThe question is not correct said the Exalted OneI do not say that he consumes If I had said so then the question Who consumes would be appropriateBut since I did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be For what is the nutriment consciousness And to that the correct reply is The nutriment consciousness is a condition for the future arising of a renewed existence when that has come into being there is the sixfold sensebase and conditioned by the sixfold sensebase is senseimpression Who O Lord has a senseimpressionThe question is not correct said the Exalted OneI do not say that he has a senseimpression Had I said so then the question Who has a senseimpression would be appropriateBut since I did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be What is the condition of senseimpression And to that the correct reply is The sixfold sensebase is a condition of senseimpression and senseimpression is the condition of feeling Who O Lord feelsThe question is not correct said the Exalted OneI do not say that he feels Had I said so then the question Who feels would be appropriateBut since I did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be What is the condition of feeling And to that the correct reply is senseimpression is the condition of feeling and feeling is the condition of craving Who O Lord cravesThe question is not correct said the Exalted OneI do not say that he craves Had I said so then the question Who craves would be appropriateBut since I did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be What is the condition of craving And to that the correct reply is Feeling is the condition of craving and craving is the condition of clinging Who O Lord clingsThe question is not correct said the Exalted One I do not say that he clings Had I said so then the question Who clings would be appropriateBut since I did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be What is the condition of clinging And to that the correct reply is Craving is the condition of clinging and clinging is the condition of the process of becoming Such is the origin of this entire mass of sufferingThrough the complete fading away and cessation of even these six bases of senseimpression senseimpression ceases through the cessation of senseimpression feeling ceases through the cessation of feeling craving ceases through the cessation of craving clinging ceases through the cessation of clinging the process of becoming ceases through the cessation of the process of becoming birth ceases through the cessation of birth old age death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ceaseSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of sufferingIn this discourse there is one link between consciousness and mindandbody one link between feeling and craving and one link between the process of becoming and birthSubComy Since in the words of the discourse The nutriment consciousness is a condition for the future arising of a renewed existence as being a condition in a former existence for a future existence and as being a principal cause therefore the Commentary says that there is a link between consciousness and mindandbody Hence it should be understood that by the term consciousness also the kammaforming consciousness is impliedAt SavatthiThere are O monks four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birthWhat are the fourEdible food coarse and fine secondly senseimpression thirdly volitional thought fourthly consciousnessOf these four nutriments O monks what is their source what is their origin from what are they born what gives them existenceThese four nutriments O monks have craving as their cause have craving as their origin are born of craving and craving gives them existenceAnd this craving O monks what is its source what its origin from what is it born what gives it existenceCraving has feeling as its source and origin it is born of feeling and feeling gives existence to itAnd this feeling O monks what is its source and origin from what is it born and what gives existence to itFeeling has senseimpression as its source and originAnd this senseimpression O monks what is its sourcesenseimpression has the six sensebases as its source and originAnd these six sensebases O monks what is their sourceThe six sensebases have mindandbody as their source and originAnd this mindandbody O monks what is its sourceMindandbody has consciousness as its source and originAnd this consciousness O monks what is its sourceConsciousness has kammaformations as its source and originAnd these kammaformations O monks what is their source and origin from what are they born what gives existence to themKammaformations have ignorance as their source and origin they are born of ignorance and ignorance gives existence to themThus O monks through ignorance conditioned are kammaformations through the kammaformations conditioned is consciousness through consciousness conditioned is mindandbody through mindandbody conditioned are the six sensebases through the six sensebases conditioned is senseimpression through senseimpression conditioned is feeling through feeling conditioned is craving through craving conditioned is clinging through clinging conditioned is becoming through becoming conditioned is birth through birth conditioned are decay and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairThus arises this whole mass of sufferingSee also SN SN SN SN AN The Four Nutriments of Life by Nyanaponika TheraThus I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Benares in the Deer Park at IsipatanaThere he addressed the bhikkhus of the group of fiveBhikkhus these two extremes ought not to be cultivated by one gone forth from the houselifeWhat are the twoThere is devotion to indulgence of pleasure in the objects of sensual desire which is inferior low vulgar ignoble and leads to no good and there is devotion to selftorment which is painful ignoble and leads to no goodThe middle way discovered by a Perfect One avoids both these extremes it gives vision it gives knowledge and it leads to peace to direct acquaintance to discovery to nibbanaAnd what is that middle wayIt is simply the noble eightfold path that is to say right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationThat is the middle way discovered by a Perfect One which gives vision which gives knowledge and which leads to peace to direct acquaintance to discovery to nibbanaSuffering as a noble truth is this Birth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair are suffering association with the loathed is suffering dissociation from the loved is suffering not to get what one wants is suffering  in short suffering is the five categories of clinging objectsThe origin of suffering as a noble truth is this It is the craving that produces renewal of being accompanied by enjoyment and lust and enjoying this and that in other words craving for sensual desires craving for being craving for nonbeingCessation of suffering as a noble truth is this It is remainderless fading and ceasing giving up relinquishing letting go and rejecting of that same cravingThe way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this It is simply the noble eightfold path that is to say right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationSuffering as a noble truth is this Such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeThis suffering as a noble truth can be diagnosed Such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeThis suffering as a noble truth has been diagnosed Such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeThe origin of suffering as a noble truth is this Such was the vision This origin of suffering as a noble truth can be abandoned Such was the vision This origin of suffering as a noble truth has been abandoned Such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeCessation of suffering as a noble truth is this Such was the vision This cessation of suffering as a noble truth can be verified Such was the vision This cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been verified Such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeThe way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this Such was the vision This way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth can be developed Such was the vision This way leading to the cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been developed Such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeAs long as my knowing and seeing how things are was not quite purified in these twelve aspects in these three phases of each of the four noble truths I did not claim in the world with its gods its Maras and high divinities in this generation with its monks and brahmans with its princes and men to have discovered the full Awakening that is supremeBut as soon as my knowing and seeing how things are was quite purified in these twelve aspects in these three phases of each of the four noble truths then I claimed in the world with its gods its Maras and high divinities in this generation with its monks and brahmans its princes and men to have discovered the full Awakening that is supremeKnowing and seeing arose in me thus My hearts deliverance is unassailableThis is the last birthNow there is no renewal of being That is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus of the group of five were glad and they approved his wordsNow during this utterance there arose in the venerable Kondañña the spotless immaculate vision of the True Idea Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessationWhen the Wheel of Truth had thus been set rolling by the Blessed One the earthgods raised the cry At Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana the matchless Wheel of truth has been set rolling by the Blessed One not to be stopped by monk or divine or god or deathangel or high divinity or anyone in the worldOn hearing the earthgods cry all the gods in turn in the six paradises of the sensual sphere took up the cry till it reached beyond the Retinue of High Divinity in the sphere of pure formAnd so indeed in that hour at that moment the cry soared up to the World of High Divinity and this tenthousandfold worldelement shook and rocked and quaked and a great measureless radiance surpassing the very nature of the gods was displayed in the worldThen the Blessed One uttered the exclamation Kondañña knowsKondañña knows and that is how that venerable one acquired the name AññaKondañña  Kondañña who knowsAt SavatthiThere are O monks four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birthWhat are the fourEdible food coarse and fine secondly senseimpression thirdly volitional thought fourthly consciousnessHow O monks should the nutriment edible food be consideredSuppose a couple husband and wife have set out on a journey through the desert carrying only limited provisionsThey have with them their only son dearly beloved by themNow while these two traveled through the desert their limited stock of provisions ran out and came to an end but there was still a stretch of desert not yet crossedThen the two thought Our small stock of provisions has run out it has come to an end and there is still a stretch of desert that is not yet crossedShould we not kill our only son so dearly beloved prepare dried and roasted meat and eating our sons flesh we may cross in that way the remaining part of the desert lest all three of us perishAnd these two husband and wife killed their only son so dearly beloved by them prepared dried and roasted meat and eating their sons flesh crossed in that way the remaining part of the desertAnd while eating their sons flesh they were beating their breast and crying Where are you our only and beloved sonWhere are you our only and beloved sonWhat do you think O monksWill they eat the food for the pleasure of it for enjoyment for comeliness sake for embellishmentCertainly not O LordWill they not rather eat the food merely for the sake of crossing the desertSo it is O LordIn the same manner I say O monks should edible food be consideredIf O monks the nutriment edible food is comprehended the lust for the five senseobjects is comprehendedAnd if lust for the five senseobjects is comprehended there is no fetter enchained by which a noble disciple might come to this world againAnd how O monks should the nutriment senseimpression be consideredSuppose O monks there is a skinned cow that stands close to a wall then the creatures living in the wall will nibble at the cow and if the skinned cow stands near a tree then the creatures living in the tree will nibble at it if it stands in the water the creatures living in the water will nibble at it if it stands in the open air the creatures living in the air will nibble at itWherever that skinned cow stands the creatures living there will nibble at itIn that manner I say O monks should the nutriment senseimpression be consideredIf the nutriment senseimpression is comprehended the three kinds of feeling are thereby comprehendedAnd if the three kinds of feeling are comprehended there is I say no further work left to do for the noble discipleAnd how O monks should the nutriment volitional thought be consideredSuppose O monks there is a pit of glowing embers filled to cover a mans height with embers glowing without flames and smokeNow a man comes that way who loves life and does not wish to die who wishes for happiness and detests sufferingThen two strong men would seize both his arms and drag him to the pit of glowing embersThen O monks far away from it would recoil that mans will far away from it his longing far away his inclinationAnd whyBecause the man knows If I fall into that pit of glowing embers I shall meet death or deadly painIn that manner I say O monks should the nutriment volitional thought be consideredIf the nutriment volitional thought is comprehended the three kinds of craving are thereby comprehendedAnd if the three kinds of craving are comprehended there is I say no further work left to do for the noble discipleAnd how O monks should the nutriment consciousness be consideredSuppose O monks people have seized a criminal a robber and brought him before the king saying This is a criminal a robber O MajestyMete out to him the punishment you think fit Then the king would tell them Go and in the morning strike this man with a hundred spears And they strike him in the morning with a hundred spearsAt noon the king would ask his men How is that man  He is still alive Your Majesty  Then go and strike him again at noontime with a hundred spears So they did and in the evening the king asks them again How is that man  He is still alive  Then go and in the evening strike him again with a hundred spears And so they didWhat do you think O monksWill that man struck with three hundred spears during a day suffer pain and torment owing to thatEven if he were to be struck only by a single spear he would suffer pain and torment owing to thatHow much more if he is being struck by three hundred spearsIn that manner I say O monks should the nutriment consciousness be consideredIf the nutriment consciousness is comprehended mindandmatter are thereby comprehendedAnd if mind and body are comprehended there is I say no further work left to do for the noble discipleSee also SN SN SN SN AN The Four Nutriments of Life by Nyanaponika TheraThus I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Gaya at Gayasisa

a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta Grove came to the presence of the Exalted One and drawing near respectfully saluted him and stood at one sideStanding thus he addressed the Exalted One in verseNot to associate with the foolish but to associate with the wise and to honor those who are worthy of honor  this is the greatest blessingTo reside in a suitable locality to have done meritorious actions in the past and to set oneself in the right course  this is the greatest blessingTo have much learning to be skillful in handicraft welltrained in discipline

Sutta supplements it by pointing out the causes of downfallHe who allows himself to become tarnished by these blemishes of conduct blocks his own road to worldly moral and spiritual progress and lowers all that is truly noble and human in manBut he who is heedful of these dangers keeps open the road to all those thirtyeight blessings of which human nature is capableThus have I heardOnce the Exalted One was dwelling at Anathapindikas monastery in the Jeta Grove near SavatthiNow when the night was far spent a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta Grove came to the presence of the Exalted One and drawing near respectfully saluted Him and stood at one sideStanding thus he addressed the Exalted One in verseHaving come here with our questions to the Exalted One we ask thee O Gotama about mans declinePray tell us the cause of downfallThe BuddhaEasily known is the progressive one easily known he who declinesHe who loves Dhamma progresses he who is averse to it declinesThus much do we see this is the first cause of ones downfallPray tell us the second causeThe BuddhaThe wicked are dear to him with the virtuous he finds no delight he prefers the creed of the wicked  this is a cause of ones downfallBeing fond of sleep fond of company indolent lazy and irritable  this is a cause of ones downfallThough being welltodo not to support father and mother who are old and past their youth  this is a cause of ones downfallTo deceive by falsehood a brahman or ascetic or any other mendicant  this is a cause of ones downfallTo have much wealth and ample gold and food but to enjoy ones luxuries alone  this is a cause of ones downfallTo be proud of birth of wealth or clan and to despise ones own kinsmen  this is a cause of ones downfallTo be a rake a drunkard a gambler and to squander all one earns  this is a cause of ones downfallNot to be contented with ones own wife and to be seen with harlots and the wives of others  this is a cause of ones downfallBeing past ones youth to take a young wife and to be unable to sleep for jealousy of her  this is a cause of ones downfallTo place in authority a woman given to drink and squandering or a man of a like behavior  this is a cause of ones downfallTo be of noble birth with vast ambition and of slender means and to crave for rulership  this is a cause of ones downfallKnowing well these causes of downfall

was said householder How then householder should the detailed or expanded meaning of this condensed statement be seen Was this Venerable One spoken by the Blessed OneJust so householderSo then Venerable One please wait a moment while I look at its meaningAnd then Citta the householder having been silent for a moment said this to the Venerable KāmabhūFaultless part now this Venerable One is a metaphorical expression for the virtuesAdorned in white this Venerable One is a metaphorical expression for liberationGoing one way this Venerable One is a metaphorical expression for

Venerable One spoken by the Blessed One thus do I understand the detailed or expanded meaningIt is understood by you householder it is wellunderstood by you for your wisdomeye proceeds methodically through the profound word of the BuddhaThe above translation deliberately aims to adhere as closely as possible to the grammar and syntax of the Pāḷi text while at the same time trying to present an easily readable English textIn this way the translation may be especially useful for students of Pāḷi who would like to follow the Pāḷi original in parallel to the English translationConsequently I would like to suggest a different interpretation here of ara derived from the same verbal root from which the noun ara spoke is derived as is the adjective ara swift speedy namely ṛ to go to moveMonierWilliams points out a usage of ara at the end of a compound where it has the sense going and cites the example of the word samara which is analysed into sam  ara coming together meeting confluence hence also hostile encounter conflict war Zusammenlauf Zusammenfluss feindlicher Zusammenstoss KampfCone cites only muddhaara as an example ara at the end of a compound Rhys Davids and Stede define that term as head spokeI propose to read ekāra as eka one single alone  ara going on the model of sam  araThe sense would then be either that the chariot goes always alone or that the chariot goes always in one direction or that it travels always upon one path or that it travels only in one wayThese various possible senses are not mutually exclusive of courseWith respect to the first interpretation ekāra as lonegoing which implies that the Arahant is completely unattached and lives in seclusion we may consider that in UdBhaddiya is described as seen from afar following closely behind the mass of approaching monks The Buddha then describes Bhaddiya as usually for the monks of such an appearance as to be disregarded or despised Again Malalasekera Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names svAmbātakavana informs us that the Elder Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya lived there in solitude wrapt in meditation supporting this with a reference to TheragāthāOn the theme of the oneness or aloneness of the Arahant we might also cite the following stanza from Suttanipāta The Cūḷaniddesa also provides a commentary to this same stanza wherein with reference to the word eko one or alone in the phrase eko tamonudāsīno it saysOne the Blessed One by being classified as one who has taken up the ascetic life is one by the meaning of being without companions is one by the meaning of having renounced craving is one absolutely free of passion is one absolutely free of ill will is one absolutely free of delusion is one absolutely without defilements is one having gone by the oneway path is one having fully and perfectly awakened in the one ultimate right and perfect awakening is oneHere in this passage we find an echo of both of the senses that I have proposed hypothetically for ekāra read as onegoing namely both going alone and going one wayFinally we might consider also this passage from DhammapadaEven so in this present context I have ventured a slightly different readingLābha means receiving getting acquisition gainLaddha is having obtained taken received and thus suladdha is wellreceived wellgainedIf we took both occurrences of te as instrumental by you we might arrive at the alternative rendering that I have proposedMore colloquially expressed the sense would be You got it householder you got it well householder This would provide a neat sense given the context of the riddle that Kāmabhū has posed and Cittas fairly thorough solution of itThus it was heard by meAt one time the Blessed One was living in the deer park of Isipatana near BenaresThere indeed the Blessed One addressed the group of five monksForm O monks is notself if form were self then form would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding form May my form be thus may my form not be thus

disciple seeing thus gets wearied of form gets wearied of feeling gets wearied of perception gets wearied of mental formations gets wearied of consciousnessBeing wearied he becomes passionfreeIn his freedom from passion he is emancipatedBeing emancipated there is the knowledge that he is emancipatedHe knows birth is exhausted lived is the holy life what had to be done is done there is nothing more of this becoming This the Blessed One saidPleased the group of five monks were delighted with the exposition of the Blessed One moreover as this exposition was being spoken the minds of the group of five monks were freed of defilements without attachmentIndeed at that time there were six arahants in the worldAt Sāvatthī There the Blessed One said this And which monks is the taking up of the burdenThat which is this craving leading to rebirth connected with delight and passion finding delight here and there namely craving for sensual pleasure craving for being and craving for extinctionThis monks is called the taking up of the burdenAnd which monks is the putting down of the burdenThat which of just this craving is the cessation by means of the absence of desire without remainder the abandoning the forsaking the freedom the nonattachmentThis monks is called the putting down of the burdenThis said the Blessed OneHaving said this the Fortunate One the Teacher furthermore said this Pañcaupādānakhandhā literally five clinging aggregates note that in this compound clinging is a noun not an adjectiveIn English however it may be mistakenly read as an adjective which would imply that it is the aggregates themselves that are characterized as clingingRather the phrase ought to be read the five aggregates of clinging or the five aggregates for clinging which is to say the five aggregates that provide the basis for the act of clingingFor this reason I have translated the phrase as the five clungto aggregates to emphasise that the aggregates are so to speak the objects or objectivated phenomena of clinging not the subject of clinging as suchThe act of clinging is essentially an inflection of mind or consciousness but here mind or consciousness does not refer to and cannot be reduced to and completely identified with any or all of the mental factors and functions of the five aggregatesRather it transcends them and therefore it is definitely not any selfThis sense of the transcendence of the true nature of mind is what provides the possibility and the meaning of Nibbāna and thus also the possibility of the Buddhadhamma itself as a practical method for realizing NibbānaMind or consciousness clings to the aggregates and identifies itself with themBy fully recognizing and realizing its innate detachment from the aggregates it is ultimately released and can finally attain the absolute cessation of its individuated natural evolutionary functions hence for example the expression mindliberation which in the suttas is equivalent to attaining the condition of NibbānaFor an excellent perspective upon this theme see VenThanissaros various discussions of the expression viññāṇa anidassana which occurs in DN and MN and refers to liberated consciousness that cannot in any way be pointed out and of how this is closely related to the crucial idea occurring frequently in the suttas of appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa consciousness that does not support itself on anything is not established upon anything because it does not cling to or identify with anythingPuggalaThe primary sense of this very old word seems to have been separate individual and it was used both of the body and of the soulIt may well be related in etymology and meaning to the Vedic pṛthak separate different and pṛthu spread out and would therefore be closely related to the term puthujjanaFor a significant account of the philosophical concept of the puggala in the Buddhadhamma and the doctrinal and ideological struggles that have occurred around it see Priestley Pudgalavāda Buddhism The Reality of the Indeterminate Self University of Toronto CanadaAlthough Priestleys account focuses especially on later nonIndian Buddhist sources his survey of course includes the earlier Indian literature and his perceptive philosophical conclusions are of deep value for anyone sensitive to and familiar with the earlier textsThis does not mean that the puggala as the burdenbearer is a separate entity that takes hold of the burdenNor does it mean as the postAbhidhamma Theravāda commentary supposes that the expression bearer of the burden is meant to show that the person is admitted only as a mere convention which is the standard Theravāda Abhidhamma dogma on the matterThe real point is that the person is neither separable from the five clungto aggregates nor is the person merely reducible to themThe nature of the person thereby defies reductionism while at the same time eschewing eternalismThere is a very deep and important parallelism here between the concept of the person and Aristotles concept of the psukh or individuated life principle in de AnimaAristotle defined the concept of the psukh in a radically new way within Greek philosophy as the form of the living sentient being which is neither reducible to the material upon which it depends nor separable from that materialThus he steered a middle way between the reductive materialism of the Atomists and the dualism of PlatoHis paradigm is hylomorphic and I have argued elsewhere that it is profoundly relevant to and even helpful for a proper understanding of the teachings of the Suttanta Piṭaka as the literature from which we may recover definite and coherent elements of the earliest extant BuddhadhammaIncidentally the first chapter Puggalakathā Debate about the Person of the fifth book of the Theravāda Abhidhamma Piṭaka the Kathāvatthu or Subjects of Debate purports to be an extensive refutation by a Theravādin of the alleged Puggalavāda heresyHowever a careful analysis of these arguments reveals that the Theravādins either misunderstood or misrepresented what may well have been an actually nonheretical Puggalavāda interpretation of the earlier Buddhadhamma teachingsOn this view the entire Puggalakathā section of the Kathāvatthu is based upon a fallacy and refutes nothing more than a straw manThus it has been heard by meOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi in the Jeta Forest in the private park owned by AnāthapiṇḍikaThere the Blessed one addressed the monks thus Monks Those monks responded thus Blessed One The Blessed One said thisMonks the ordinary person unlearned in spiritual knowledge might grow weary of might become detached from might become released from this physical body made up of the four great elementsWhat is the reason for thisBecause monks apparent are the increase and the decrease the taking up and the putting down of this physical body made up of the four great elementsFor that reason the ordinary person in every way unlearned in spiritual knowledge might grow weary might become detached might become releasedBut indeed that which monks is called mind or thought or consciousness the ordinary person in every way unlearned in spiritual knowledge not enough to turn away not enough to become detached not enough to be releasedWhat is the reason for thisBecause for a long time monks that mind or thought or consciousness of the ordinary person in every way unlearned in spiritual knowledge has been clung to has been cherished has been fondled This is mine this I am this is my selfBecause of that the ordinary person in every way unlearned in spiritual knowledge not enough to turn away not enough to become detached not enough to be releasedBetter monks to let the ordinary person in all ways unlearned in spiritual knowledge proceed from the assumption that the self is this physical body made up of the four great elements rather than mindWhat is the reason for thisThis physical body Monks comprising the four great elements is seen standing for one rainy season standing for two rainy seasons for three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty standing for a hundred or more rainy seasonsBut indeed that which monks is called mind or thought or consciousness that by night and by day as other indeed arises as other ceasesJust as monks a monkey in the mountainside forests moving itself grasps a branch then releasing that grasps another then releasing that grasps another even so indeed monks that which is called mind or thought or consciousness that by night and by day as other indeed arises as other ceasesTherein monks the noble disciple learned in spiritual knowledge properly and legitimately cognizes just dependent coarising thus In the event of the being of this there is this from the arising of this this arisesIn the event of the nonbeing of this there is not thisFrom the cessation of this this ceasesWhich is this From ignorance as condition the formative mental functions from the formative mental functions as condition sensory consciousness from sensory consciousness as condition nameandform from nameandform as condition the six sense bases from the six sense bases as condition contact from contact as condition sensation from sensation as condition craving from craving as condition clinging from clinging as condition being from being as condition birth from birth as condition old age and death grief lamentation suffering distress and tribulation all together come to beThus there is the rise of this whole complex of sufferingBut from the fading away and cessation without any trace remaining of ignorance there is the cessation of the formative mental functions from the cessation of the formative mental functions the cessation of sensory consciousness from the cessation of sensory consciousness the cessation of nameandform from the cessation of nameandform the cessation of the six sense bases from the cessation of the six sense bases the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact the cessation of sensation from the cessation of sensation the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving the cessation of clinging from the cessation of clinging the cessation of being from the cessation of being the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth old age and death grief lamentation suffering distress and tribulation ceaseThus there is the cessation of this whole complex of sufferingSeeing thus monks a noble disciple learned in spiritual knowledge grows weary and turns away from material form grows weary and turns away from feelings grows weary and turns away from perceptions grows weary and turns away from formative functions grows weary and turns away from sensory consciousnessHaving grown weary and having turned away he detaches from detachment he is released from being released there is the knowledge Released He understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been fulfilled what had to be done has been done no coming back again to beinghereYañca kho etaṃ bhikkhave vuccati cittaṃ itipi mano itipi viññāṇaṃ itipi The quotation marks placed around each term in the translation are justified by the fact that the Pali has vuccati cittaṃ iti pi mano iti pi viññāṇaṃ iti pi It is called citta or mano or viññāṇa the particle iti after each term functions as a quotation marker corresponding to the verb vuccati it is calledThese three terms demand a very detailed comprehensive and lengthy analysis which of course cannot possibly be provided in a footnoteIf this sutta were presenting a more detailed technical and theoretical discussion such as we do indeed find in many other suttas then it would be more appropriate to translate these terms more precisely for example citta as subjective mind mano as cognitive faculty and viññāṇa as sensory consciousness although viññāṇa also has two further special technical senses and uses in the suttasBut the present sutta is very clearly not intended to be technically and theoretically precise about this particular subjectIn fact one of the points that the sutta seems to suggest is that for the ordinary unlearned person these three terms are quite interchangeable six of one and half a dozen of the other as the English idiom goesFor this reason it is much more appropriate to translate these three terms more loosely and ambiguously but this is somewhat difficult to do in English because unlike Sanskrit and Pali English does not have a very extensive vocabulary with which to indicate the subtleties of consciousness or mindWe can see from the context in which these three terms are actually used in this sutta that what is in question here is the way in which the unlearned or uninformed person thinks of these terms how he or she conflates them due to lack of analytical understanding and how he or she relates to what he or she thinks of as his or her own mind namely identifying it and cherishing as the private personal selfThis partial statement cittaṃ itipi mano itipi viññāṇaṃ itipi is very frequently quoted  in isolation out of context  by proponents and commentators of the Abhidhamma and of Abhidhammainfluenced schools in support of the stereotypical Abhidhamma view that the terms citta mano and viññāṇa are somehow synonymousOnly one other similar passage can be found in the Suttanta Piṭaka in DN at DN i but this passage is rarely cited for an obvious reason Yaṃ ca kho idaṃ vuccati cittanti vā manoti vā viññāṇanti vā That which is called citta or mano or viññāṇa There in DN it is put into the mouth of the kind of reasoner who wrongly argues that mind is a permanent eternal unchanging selfIt is therefore very interesting and very important to note that here too in SN this same formula occurs in the context of a description of the way of thinking of the tatrāssutavā puthujjano the in every way spirituallyunlearned ordinary personThis crucial matter is too detailed and complex to discuss here in a brief footnote but it can hopefully be addressed in detail and in depth on a different occasionSuffice it to say that I am not asserting that citta mano and viññāṇa are distinct and separate things but that they refer to quite distinct and noninterreducible functions and properties of mind as suchTo claim that they are mere synonyms is very crudely speaking rather like claiming that the words steam liquid and ice are all mere synonymsTo be sure they may all refer to forms of water but it would be plainly and simply wrong to claim that they are therefore merely synonymousThe Milindapañha the eighteenth book of the Khuddaka Nikaya consists of parts as shown belowThe conclusion to the Milindapañha states that it contains questions though in the editions available today only can be foundAlthough not included as a canonical text in the traditions of all the Theravadin countries this work is much revered throughout and is one of the most popular and authoritative works of Pali BuddhismComposed around the beginning of the Common Era and of unknown authorship the Milindapañha is set up as a compilation of questions posed by King Milinda to a revered senior monk named NagasenaThis Milinda has been identified with considerable confidence by scholars as the Greek king Menander of Bactria in the dominion founded by Alexander the Great which corresponds with much of present day AfghanistanMenanders realm thus would have included Gandhara where Buddhism was flourishing at that timeWhat is most interesting about the Milindapañha is that it is the product of the encounter of two great civilizations  Hellenistic Greece and Buddhist India  and is thus of continuing relevance as the wisdom of the East meets the modern Western worldKing Milinda poses questions about dilemmas raised by Buddhist philosophy that we might ask todayAnd Nagasenas responses are full of wisdom wit and helpful analogiesI see this delightful and beautiful mansion its surface of many a color ablaze with crystal and roofed with silver and goldA wellproportioned palace possessing gateways and strewn with golden sandAs the thousandrayed sun in the autumn shines in the sky in the ten directions dispelling the dark so does this your mansion glow like a blazing smokecrested fire in the darkness of the nightIt dazzles the eye like lightning beautiful suspended in spaceResounding with

air is filled with a variety of fragrancesSweetscented trees breadfruits laden branches interlaced with palm trees and hanging creepers in full bloom glorious like jeweled nets also a delightful lotus pool exists for youWhatever flowering plants there are that grow in water and trees that are on land those known in the human world and heavens all exist in your abodeOf what calming and selfrestraint is this the resultBy the fruit of what deed have you arisen hereHow did this mansion come to be possessed by youTell it in full O lady with thick eyelashesHow it come to be possessed by me this mansion with its flocks of herons peacocks and partridges and frequented by heavenly waterfowl and royal geese resounding with the cries of birds of ducks and cuckooscontaining divers varieties of creepers flowers and trees with trumpetflower roseapple and asoka trees  now how this mansion came to be possessed by me I will tell youListen venerable sirIn the eastern region of the excellent country of Magadha there is a village called Nalaka venerable sirThere I lived formerly as a daughterinlaw and they knew me there as SesavatiScattering flowerblossoms joyfully I honored him skilled in deeds and worshipped by gods and men the great Upatissa who has attained the immeasurable quenchingHaving worshipped him gone to the ultimate bourn the eminent seer bearing his last body on leaving my human shape I came to the thirty and inhabit this placeThe king asked Venerable Nagasena is it so that one does not transmigrate and one is rebornYes your majesty one does not transmigrate and one is rebornHow venerable Nagasena is it that one does not transmigrate and one is rebornGive me an analogyJust as your majesty if someone kindled one lamp from another is it indeed so your majesty that the lamp would transmigrate from the other lampCertainly not venerable sirIndeed just so your majesty one does not transmigrate and one is rebornGive me another analogyDo you remember your majesty when you were a boy learning some verse from a teacherYes venerable sirYour majesty did this verse transmigrate from the teacherCertainly not venerable sirIndeed just so your majesty one does not transmigrate and one is rebornYou are clever venerable NagasenaThe king asked Venerable Nagasena is a soul to be foundThe elder replied According to ultimate reality your majesty a soul is not to be foundYou are clever venerable NagasenaThe king asked Venerable Nagasena is there any being which transmigrates from one body to anotherCertainly not your majestyIf venerable Nagasena there is noone who transmigrates from one body to another then would not one be released from evil deedsYes your majestyIf one is not reborn then one would be released from evil deedsBut indeed because one is reborn your majesty then one is not fully released from evil deedsGive me an analogyJust as your majesty if some man were to steal the mangos of another would this be an offense worthy of punishmentYes venerable sir it would be an offense worthy of punishmentBut your majesty since these mangos that he stole were not the same mangos that the other had planted why would it be punishableVenerable sir they came into existence by means of those mangos that were planted therefore it would be punishableIndeed just so your majesty it is by the deeds that one does in this mindandbody lovely or unlovely that one is reborn in another mindandbody therefore one would not be fully released from evil deedsYou are clever venerable NagasenaThe king asked Venerable Nagasena if someone passes away and is reborn in the Brahma world and if another passes away and is reborn in Kashmir which one takes the longer time and which the shorterThey are the same your majestyGive me an analogyYour majesty where is your town of birthThere is a place called Kalasigama there I was bornHow far away your majesty is Kalasigama from hereAbout yojana venerable sirHow far away your majesty is Kashmir from hereAbout yojana venerable sirGo on then your majesty think about KalasigamaI have thought about it venerable sirGo on then your majesty think about KashmirI have thought about it venerable sirWhich thinking took a long time your majesty and which a short timeThey were the same venerable sirJust so your majesty if someone passes away and is reborn in the Brahma world and if another passes away and is reborn in Kashmir they happen in the same timeGive me another analogyWhat do you think your majesty if two birds fly in the sky and one sits in a high tree and the other in a low tree if these happen at the same time the shadow of which one would settle on the ground first and which one laterThey are the same venerable sirJust so your majesty if someone passes away and is reborn in the Brahma world and if another passes away and is reborn in Kashmir they happen in the same timeYou are clever venerable NagasenaThe king asked Venerable Nagasena for whom is the greater demerit one who knowingly does evil or one who does evil unknowinglyThe elder replied Indeed your majesty for him who does evil not knowing is the greater demeritIn that case venerable Nagasena would we doubly punish one who is our prince or kings chief minister who not knowing does evilWhat do you think your majesty who would get burned more one who knowing picks up a hot iron ball ablaze and glowing or one who not knowing picks it upIndeed venerable sir he who not knowing picks it up would get burned moreIndeed your majesty in the same way the greater demerit is for him who does evil not knowingYou are clever venerable NagasenaThe king asked Venerable Nagasena what is the distinguishing characteristic of attention and what is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdomExamination is the distinguishing characteristic of attention and severing is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdomHow is examination the distinguishing characteristic of attention and how is severing the distinguishing characteristic of wisdomGive me an analogyDo you know barleyreapers your majestyYes venerable sir I know themHow your majesty do barleyreapers reap barleyVenerable sir they take a sheaf of barley in the left hand and take a sickle in the right hand and they cut with the sickleJust as your majesty a barleyreaper takes a sheaf of barley in the left hand takes a sickle in the right hand and cuts the barley even so your majesty does the spiritual aspirant take hold of the mind with attention and cut off the defilements with wisdomIndeed thus your majesty examination is the distinguishing characteristic of attention and severing is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdomYou are clever venerable NagasenaThe king asked Venerable Nagasena what is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdomPreviously your majesty I said severing is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdom and now furthermore illuminating is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdomHow venerable sir is illuminating the distinguishing characteristic of wisdomWisdom arising your majesty dispels the darkness of ignorance produces the illumination of insight brings forth the light of knowledge and makes manifest the noble truths and further the spiritual practitioner sees with complete understanding impermanence unsatisfactoriness and corelessnessGive me an analogyJust as your majesty a person might bring a lamp into a dark house and with the lamp lit dispel the darkness produce illumination show the light and make manifest forms so too your majesty wisdom arising dispels the darkness of ignorance produces the illumination of insight brings forth the light of knowledge and makes manifest the noble truths and further the spiritual practitioner sees with complete understanding impermanence unsatisfactoriness and corelessnessYou are clever venerable NagasenaThe king asked Venerable Nagasena when mind consciousness arises do contact and feeling also ariseYes your majesty when mind consciousness arises contact arises feeling arises perception arises volition arises applied thought arises and sustained thought arisesAnd all these mental states arise with contact in the leadVenerable Nagasena what is the distinguishing characteristic of contactThe distinguishing characteristic of contact your majesty is touchingGive me an analogyJust as if your majesty two rams are butting each other one of these rams is to be understood as the eye and the other as a visual object and the coming together of the two of them is contactGive me another analogyJust as if your majesty two hands are clapping together one of these hands is to be understood as the eye and the other as a visual object and the coming together of the two of them is contactGive me another analogyJust as if your majesty two cymbals are striking together one of these cymbals is to be understood as the eye and the other as a visual object and the coming together of the two of them is contactYou are clever venerable NagasenaVenerable Nagasena what is the distinguishing characteristic of feelingThe distinguishing characteristic of feeling your majesty is sensing experiencing is also a distinguishing characteristicGive me an analogyJust as your majesty some man might render the king a service and the king being well pleased might repay the service such that the man on account of this service is provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasureThen the man might think to himself In the past I rendered a service to the king and now he has repaid me on account of which I am experiencing feelings of one kind and anotherOr just as your majesty some man having performed good actions on the dissolution of the body after death would reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world and there he would be provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasureThen the man might think to himself In the past I performed good actions and now on account of this I am experiencing feelings of one kind and another So too your majesty the distinguishing characteristics of feeling are sensing and experiencingYou are clever venerable NagasenaVenerable Nagasena what is the distinguishing characteristic of perceptionThe distinguishing characteristic of perception your majesty is perceivingWhat does one perceiveOne perceives blue yellow red white and crimsonThus your majesty the distinguishing characteristic of perception is perceivingGive me an analogyJust as your majesty the kings storekeeper having entered the storehouse might see the goods belonging to the king and would perceive blue yellow red white and crimsonSo too your majesty the distinguishing characteristic of perception is perceivingYou are clever venerable NagasenaVenerable Nagasena what is the distinguishing characteristic of volitionThe distinguishing characteristic of volition your majesty is intending preparation is also a distinguishing characteristicGive me an analogyJust as your majesty some man or other might prepare a poison and drink it himself and make others drink it then he and the others would become illEven so your majesty if some man here through volition intended some unwholesome deed then on the dissolution of the body after death he would reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellAnd those who follow his example would also on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellAlso just as your majesty some man or other might mix together ghee fresh butter oil honey and sugar and drink it himself and make others drink it then he and the others would be happyEven so your majesty if some man here through volition intended some wholesome deed then on the dissolution of the body after death he would reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly worldAnd those who followed his example would also on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly worldSo too your majesty the distinguishing characteristics of volition are intending and preparationYou are clever venerable NagasenaThe king asked Venerable Nagasena what is the distinguishing characteristic of consciousnessThe distinguishing characteristic of consciousness your majesty is cognizingGive me an analogyJust as your majesty a citysuperintendent sitting at the crossroads in the middle of the city could see a person coming from the eastern direction could see a person coming from the southern direction could see a person coming from the western direction and could see a person coming from the northern direction then indeed your majesty does a person cognize with consciousness a form he sees with the eye cognize with consciousness a sound he hears with the ear cognize with consciousness a scent he smells with the nose cognize with consciousness a taste he savors with the tongue cognize with consciousness a touch he feels with the body and cognize with consciousness a mental state he cognizes with the mindIndeed thus your majesty the distinguishing characteristic of consciousness is cognizingYou are clever venerable NagasenaVenerable Nagasena what is the distinguishing characteristic of applied thoughtThe distinguishing characteristic of applied thought your majesty is fixing ones mind on an objectGive me an analogyJust as your majesty a carpenter might fix a wellprepared piece of wood into a joint so too your majesty the distinguishing characteristic of applied thought is fixing ones mind on an objectYou are clever venerable NagasenaVenerable Nagasena what is the distinguishing characteristic of sustained thoughtThe distinguishing characteristic of sustained thought your majesty is continual examinationGive me an analogyJust as your majesty when a gong is struck and continues resounding afterwards indeed so the striking is to be understood as applied thought and the continuance of the resounding as sustained thoughtYou are clever venerable NagasenaThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Wood at Anathapindikas monasteryOn that occasion the Lord was instructing the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with Nibbana and those bhikkhus were intent on listening to DhammaThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceYour yoked and finely caparisoned horses strong and swift are heading downward through the skyAnd these five hundred chariots magically created are following the horses urged on by charioteersYou stand in this excellent chariot adorned radiant and shining like a blazing starI ask you of lovely slender form and exquisite beauty from which company of gods have you come to visit the Unrivalled OneFrom those who have reached the heights of sensual pleasures said to be unsurpassed the gods who delight in magical transformation and creationA nymph from that company able to assume any desired appearance has come here to worship the Unrivalled OneWhat good conduct did you formerly practice hereHow is it that you live in immeasurable glory and have gained such pleasuresDue to what have you acquired the unrivalled power to travel through the skyWhy does your beauty radiate in the ten directionsYou are surrounded and honored by the godsFrom where did you decease before you came to a heavenly bourn goddessOr of what teaching were you able to follow the word of instructionTell me if you were a disciple of the Awakened OneIn a fine wellbuilt city situated between hills an attendant of a noble king endowed with good fortune I was highly accomplished in dancing and singingAs Sirima I was known in RajagahaBut then the Awakened One the leader among seers the guide taught me of origination of suffering and impermanence of the unconditioned of the cessation of suffering that is everlasting and of this path not crooked straight auspiciousWhen I had learnt of the undying state the unconditioned through the instruction of the Tathagata the Unrivalled One I was highly and well restrained in the precepts and established in the Dhamma taught by the most excellent of men the Awakened OneWhen I knew the undefiled place the unconditioned taught by the Tathagata the Unrivalled One I then and there experienced the calm concentrationThat supreme certainty of release was mineWhen I gained the distinctive undying assured eminent in penetrative insight not doubting I was revered by many people and experienced much pleasure and enjoymentThus I am a goddess knowing the undying a disciple of the Tathagata the Unrivalled One a knower of Dhamma established in the first fruit a streamentererHenceforth there is no bad bourn for meI came to revere the Unrivalled One and the virtuous monks who delight in what is skilled to worship the auspicious assembly of ascetics and the respectworthy Fortunate One the DhammakingI am joyful and gladdened on seeing the sage the Tathagata the outstanding trainer of men capable of being trained who has cut off craving who delights in what is skilled the guideI worship the supremely merciful Compassionate OneThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Wood at Anathapindikas monasteryOn that occasion the Lord was instructing the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with Nibbana and those bhikkhus were intent on listening to DhammaThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Wood at Anathapindikas monasteryOn that occasion the Lord was instructing the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with Nibbana and those bhikkhus were intent on listening to DhammaThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Wood at Anathapindikas monasteryOn that occasion the Lord was instructing rousing inspiring and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk connected with Nibbana and those bhikkhus being receptive and attentive and concentrating the whole mind were intent on listening to DhammaThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Wood at Anathapindikas monasteryAt that time there were a number of recluses and brahmans wanderers of various sects living around SavatthiAnd they were of various views of various beliefs of various opinions and they relied for their support on their various viewsThere were some recluses and brahmans who asserted and held this view The world is eternal only this is true any other is false There were some recluses and brahmans who asserted The world is not eternal only this is true any other is false There were some who asserted The world is finite The world is infinite The lifeprinciple and the body are the same The lifeprinciple and the body are different The Tathagata exists beyond death The Tathagata does not exist beyond death The Tathagata both exists and does not exist beyond death The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist beyond death only this is true any other is false And they lived quarrelsome disputatious and wrangling wounding each other with verbal darts saying Dhamma is like this Dhamma is not like thatDhamma is not like this Dhamma is like thatThen a number of bhikkhus having put on their robes in the forenoon and taken their bowls and outer cloaks entered Savatthi for almsfoodHaving walked in Savatthi for almsfood and returned after the meal they approached the Lord prostrated themselves sat down to one side and said to the Lord At present revered sir there are a number of recluses and brahmans wanderers of various sects living around SavatthiAnd they are of various views saying Dhamma is like this Dhamma is like that The wanderers of other sects bhikkhus are blind unseeingThey do not know what is beneficial they do not know what is harmfulThey do not know what is Dhamma they do not know what is not DhammaNot knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is Dhamma and what is not Dhamma they are quarrelsome saying Dhamma is like this Dhamma is like thatFormerly bhikkhus there was a certain king in this very SavatthiAnd that king addressed a man Come now my good man bring together all those persons in Savatthi who have been blind from birthYes your majesty that man replied and after detaining all the blind people in Savatthi he approached the king and said All the blind people in Savatthi have been brought together your majestyNow my man show the blind people an elephantVery well your majesty the man replied to the king and he presented an elephant to the blind people saying This blind people is an elephantTo some of the blind people he presented the head of the elephant saying This is an elephant To some he presented an ear of the elephant saying This is an elephant To some he presented a tusk the trunk the body the foot the hindquarters the tail the tuft at the end of the tail saying This is an elephantThen bhikkhus the man having shown the elephant to the blind people went to the king and said The blind people have been shown the elephant your majestyDo now what you think is suitable Then the king approached those blind people and said Have you been shown the elephantYes your majesty we have been shown the elephantTell me blind people what is an elephant likeThose blind people who had been shown the head of the elephant replied An elephant your majesty is just like a water jar Those blind people who had been shown the ear of the elephant repliedAn elephant your majesty is just like a winnowing basket Those blind people who had been shown the tusk of the elephant replied An elephant your majesty is just like a plowshare Those blind people who had been shown the trunk replied An elephant your majesty is just like a plow pole Those blind people who had been shown the body replied An elephant your majesty is just like a storeroom Those blind people who had been shown the foot replied An elephant your majesty is just like a post Those blind people who had been shown the hindquarters replied An elephant your majesty is just like a mortar Those blind people who had been shown the tail replied An elephant your majesty is just like a pestle Those blind people who had been shown the tuft at the end of the tail replied An elephant your majesty is just like a broomSaying An elephant is like this an elephant is not like thatAn elephant is not like this an elephant is like that they fought each other with their fistsAnd the king was delightedEven so bhikkhus are those wanderers of various sects blind unseeing saying Dhamma is like this Dhamma is like that Then on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Kosambi at the Ghosita monasteryAt that time the Lord was living hemmed in by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis by male and female lay followers by kings and royal ministers by sectarian teachers and their disciples and he lived in discomfort and not at easeThen the Lord thought At present I am living hemmed in by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis by sectarian teachers and their disciples and I live in discomfort and not at easeSuppose I were to live alone secluded from the crowdThen the Lord having put on his robe in the forenoon and taken his bowl and outer cloak entered Kosambi for almsfoodHaving walked for almsfood in Kosambi and returned after the meal he set his lodging in order by himself took his bowl and cloak and without informing his attendant or taking leave of the Order of bhikkhus he set off alone without a companion for ParileyyakaWalking on tour by stages he arrived at Parileyyaka and stayed near Parileyyaka in a protected forest at the foot of an auspicious saltreeNow a certain bull elephant was living hemmed in by elephants and sheelephants by elephant calves and sucklings he ate grass with the tips pulled off and they ate the branches he had broken downHe drank muddied water and on going down and coming out of the water he was jostled by sheelephants and he lived in discomfort and not at easeThen that bull elephant thought At present I am living hemmed in by elephants and sheelephants by elephant calves and sucklings I eat grass with the tips pulled off and they eat the branches which I break downI drink muddied water and on going down and coming out of the water I am jostled by sheelephants and I live in discomfort and not at easeSuppose I were to live alone secluded from the crowdSo that bull elephant left the herd and went to Parileyyaka to the protected forest and approached the Lord at the foot of the auspicious saltreeOn reaching the place where the Lord was staying that bull elephant kept the place free of grass and brought water with his trunk for the Lords useThen while the Lord was in solitude and seclusion this thought arose in his mind Formerly I was living hemmed in by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and I was living in discomfort and not at easeBut now I live not hemmed in by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis in comfort and at ease And also this thought arose in that bull elephants mind Formerly I was living hemmed in by elephants and sheelephants and I was living in discomfort and not at ease but now I live not hemmed in by elephants and sheelephants I eat unbroken grass and do not eat the branches which I break downI drink clear water and on going down and coming out of the water I am not jostled by sheelephants and I live in comfort and at easeThen the Lord on observing his own solitude understood with his mind the thought in the mind of that bull elephant and uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Eastern Park at Migaras mothers mansionOn that occasion the Lord was sitting surrounded by the Order of bhikkhus as it was the day of the Uposatha observanceThen when the night was far advanced and the first watch had ended the Venerable Ananda arose from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his folded hands and said to the Lord The night is far advanced revered sir the first watch has ended and the bhikkhus have been sitting for a long timeRevered sir let the Lord recite the Patimokkha to the bhikkhus When this was said the Lord remained silentWhen the night was advanced and the middle watch had ended a second time the Venerable Ananda arose from his seat and said to the Lord The night is far advanced revered sir the middle watch has ended and the bhikkhus have been sitting for a long timeRevered sir let the Lord recite the Patimokkha to the bhikkhus A second time the Lord remained silentWhen the night was advanced and the last watch had ended as dawn was approaching and the night was drawing to a close a third time the Venerable Ananda arose from his seat and said to the Lord The night is far advanced revered sir the last watch has ended dawn is approaching and the night is drawing to a close and the bhikkhus have been sitting for a long timeRevered sir let the Lord recite the Patimokka to the bhikkhusThe gathering is not pure AnandaThen the Venerable Mahamoggallana thought Concerning which person has the Lord said The gathering is not pure Ananda And the Venerable Mahamoggallana comprehending the minds of the whole Order of bhikkhus with his own mind saw that person sitting in the midst of the Order of bhikkhus  immoral wicked of impure and suspect behavior secretive in his acts no recluse though pretending to be one not practicing the holy life though pretending to do so rotten within lustful and corruptOn seeing him he arose from his seat approached that person and said Get up friendYou are seen by the LordYou cannot live in communion with the bhikkhus But that person remained silentA second time and a third time the Venerable Mahamoggallana told that person to get up and a second time and a third time that person remained silentThen the Venerable Mahamoggllana took that person by the arm pulled him outside the gate and bolted itThen he approached the Lord and said Revered sir I have ejected that personThe assembly is quite pureRevered sir let the Lord recite the Patimokkha to the bhikkhusIt is strange Moggallana it is remarkable Moggallana how that stupid person should have waited until he was taken by the armThen the Lord addressed the bhikkhus From now on bhikkhus I shall not participate in the Uposatha observance or recite the PatimokkhaFrom now on you yourselves should participate in the Uposatha observance and recite the PatimokkhaIt is impossible bhikkhus it cannot happen that the Tathagata should participate in the Uposatha observance and recite the Patimokkha with a gathering that is not pureBhikkhus there are these eight wonderful and marvellous qualities of the great ocean seeing which the asuras delight in the great oceanWhat are the eightThe great ocean bhikkhus gradually shelves slopes and inclines and there is no sudden precipiceSince the great ocean gradually shelves this is the first wonderful and marvellous quality of the great ocean seeing which the asuras delight in the great oceanFurthermore the great ocean is stable and does not exceed the limits of the tidelineThis is the second wonderful and marvellous quality of the great oceanFurthermore the great ocean does not tolerate a dead body for when there is a dead body in the great ocean it soon conveys it to the shore and casts it up on dry landThis is the third wonderful and marvellous quality of the great oceanFurthermore whatever great rivers there are  the Ganges the Yamuna the Aciravati the Sarabhu and the Mahi  on reaching the great ocean lose their former names and identities and are just called the great ocean This is the fourth wonderful and marvellous quality of the great oceanFurthermore although the rivers of the world flow into the great ocean and showers of rain fall from the sky no lessening or filling up of the great ocean is evidentThis is the fifth wonderful and marvellous quality of the great oceanFurthermore the great ocean has one taste the taste of saltThis is the sixth wonderful and marvellous quality of the great oceanFurthermore the great ocean contains many precious substances various precious substances such as these pearl crystal beryl conch quartz coral silver gold ruby and cats eyeThis is the seventh wonderful and marvellous quality of the great oceanFurthermore the great ocean is the abode of mighty creatures of such creatures as these the timi timingala timirapingala asuras nagas and gandhabbasThere exist in the great ocean beings a hundred yojanas in size beings two hundred three hundred four hundred and five hundred yojanas in sizeThis is the eighth wonderful and marvellous quality of the great oceanThese bhikkhus are the eight wonderful and marvellous qualities of the great ocean seeing which the asuras delight in the great oceanSimilarly bhikkhus there are eight wonderful and marvellous qualities in this Dhamma and Discipline seeing which bhikkhus delight in this Dhamma and DisciplineWhat are the eightJust as the great ocean gradually shelves slopes and inclines and there is no sudden precipice so also in this Dhamma and Discipline there is a gradual training a gradual course a gradual progression and there is no sudden penetration to final knowledgeSince in this Dhamma and Discipline there is a gradual training this is the first wonderful and marvellous quality in this Dhamma and Discipline seeing which bhikkhus delight in this Dhamma and DisciplineJust as the great ocean is stable and does not exceed the limits of the tideline so also my disciples do not transgress a training rule laid down by me for disciples even for the sake of their livesThis is the second wonderful and marvellous quality in this Dhamma and DisciplineJust as the great ocean does not tolerate a dead body and casts it up on dry land so also whatsoever person is immoral wicked of impure and suspect behavior secretive in his acts no recluse though pretending to be one not practicing the holy life though pretending to do so rotten within lustful and corrupt the Order does not associate with him but when it has met together soon throws him outEven though he may be sitting in the midst of the Order of bhikkhus yet he is far from the Order and the Order is far from himThis is the third wonderful and marvellous quality in this Dhamma and DisciplineJust as whatever great rivers there are on reaching the great ocean lose their former names and identities and are just called the great ocean so also the four castes  nobles brahmans merchants and workers  having gone forth from home to the homeless state in the Dhamma and Discipline made known by the Tathagata abandon their former names and identities and are just called recluses the followers of the Sakyan son This is the fourth wonderful and marvellous quality in this Dhamma and DisciplineJust as although the rivers of the world flow into the great ocean and showers of rain fall from the sky no lessening or filling up of the great ocean is evident so also although many bhikkhus attain final Nibbana in the Nibbanaelement with no residue left no lessening or filling up of the Nibbanaelement is evidentThis is the fifth wonderful and marvellous quality in this Dhamma and DisciplineJust as the great ocean has one taste the taste of salt so also this Dhamma and Discipline has one taste the taste of liberationThis is the sixth wonderful and marvellous quality in this Dhamma and DisciplineJust as the great ocean contains many precious substances various precious substances so also this Dhamma and Discipline contains many precious things various precious things such as these the four foundations of mindfulness the four right endeavors the four bases for successful accomplishment the five faculties the five powers the seven enlightenment factors and the Noble Eightfold PathThis is the seventh wonderful and marvellous quality in this Dhamma and DisciplineJust as the great ocean is the abode of mighty creatures so also this Dhamma and Discipline is the abode of mighty creatures such as these the streamenterer and the one who is on the way to realizing the fruit of streamentry the oncereturner and the one who is on the way to realizing the fruit of oncereturning the nonreturner and the one who is on the way to realizing the fruit of nonreturning the arahant and the one who is on the way to arahatshipThis is the eighth wonderful and marvellous quality in this Dhamma and DisciplineThese bhikkhus are the eight wonderful and marvellous qualities in this Dhamma and Discipline seeing which bhikkhus delight in this Dhamma and DisciplineThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying at Calika on Calika HillAt that time the Venerable Meghiya was the Lords attendantThen the Venerable Meghiya approached the Lord prostrated himself stood to one side and said I wish to go into Jantu village for almsfood revered sirDo now Meghiya what you think it is time to doThen the Venerable Meghiya having put on his robe in the forenoon and taken his bowl and outer cloak entered Jantu village for almsfoodHaving walked in Jantu village for almsfood after the meal on returning from collecting almsfood he approached the bank of the river KimikalaAs he was walking and wandering up and down beside the river for exercise he saw a pleasant and charming mango groveOn seeing it he thought This mango grove is very pleasant and charmingIt is eminently suitable for the endeavor of a young man of good family who is intent on the endeavorIf the Lord were to give me permission I would come and endeavor in this mango groveThen the Venerable Meghiya approached the Lord prostrated himself sat down to one side and said Revered sir having put on my robe in the forenoon I approached the bank of the river Kimikala and saw a pleasant and charming mango groveOn seeing it I thought This mango grove is very pleasant and charmingIt is eminently suitable for the endeavor of a young man of good family who is intent on the endeavorIf the Lord were to give me permission I would come and endeavor in this mango grove If revered sir the Lord gives me permission I would go to that mango grove to endeavorWhen this was said the Lord replied to the Venerable Meghiya As we are alone Meghiya wait a while until some other bhikkhu comesA second time the Venerable Meghiya said to the Lord Revered sir the Lord has nothing further that should be done and nothing to add to what has been doneBut for me revered sir there is something further that should be done and something to add to what has been doneIf revered sir the Lord gives me permission I would go to that mango grove to endeavorA second time the Lord replied to the Venerable Meghiya As we are alone Meghiya wait a while until some other bhikkhu comesA third time the Venerable Meghiya said to the Lord Revered sir the Lord has nothing further that should be done I would go to that mango grove to endeavorAs you are talking of endeavoring Meghiya what can I sayDo now Meghiya what you think it is time to doThen the Venerable Meghiya rose from his seat prostrated himself before the Lord and keeping his right side towards him went to that mango groveOn entering that mango grove he sat down at the foot of a certain tree for the rest period during the middle of the dayNow while the Venerable Meghiya was staying in that mango grove there kept occurring to him three bad unwholesome kinds of thoughts sensual thought malevolent thought and cruel thoughtThe Venerable Meghiya then reflected It is indeed strangeIt is indeed remarkableAlthough I have gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless state yet I am overwhelmed by these three bad unwholesome kinds of thoughts sensual thought malevolent thought and cruel thoughtThen the Venerable Meghiya on emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon approached the Lord prostrated himself sat down to one side and said Revered sir while I was staying in that mango grove there kept occurring to me three bad unwholesome kinds of thoughts and I thought It is indeed strange I am overwhelmed by these three bad unwholesome kinds of thoughts sensual thought malevolent thought and cruel thought When minddeliverance is as yet immature Meghiya five things lead to its maturityWhat fiveHere Meghiya a bhikkhu has good friends good associates good companionsWhen minddeliverance is as yet immature Meghiya this is the first thing that leads to its maturityFurthermore Meghiya a bhikkhu is virtuous he lives restrained by the restraint of the Patimokkha endowed with conduct and resort seeing danger in the smallest faults he trains in the training rules he has acceptedWhen minddeliverance is as yet immature Meghiya this is the second thing that leads to its maturityFurthermore Meghiya a bhikkhu obtains at will with no trouble or difficulty talk that is effacing a help in opening up the mind and which conduces to complete turning away dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and Nibbana  that is talk about fewness of wishes talk about contentment talk about seclusion talk about being nongregarious talk about putting forth energy talk about virtue talk about concentration talk about wisdom talk about deliverance talk about the knowledge and vision of deliveranceWhen minddeliverance is as yet immature Meghiya this is the third thing that leads to its maturityFurthermore Meghiya a bhikkhu lives with energy instigated for the abandoning of unwholesome states and the acquiring of wholesome states he is vigorous energetic and persevering with regard to wholesome statesWhen minddeliverance is as yet immature Meghiya this is the fourth thing that leads to its maturityFurthermore Meghiya a bhikkhu is wise endowed with the noble ones penetrative understanding of rise and disappearance leading to the complete ending of sufferingWhen minddeliverance is as yet immature Meghiya this is the fifth thing that leads to its maturityWhen minddeliverance is as yet immature Meghiya these five things lead to its maturityIt is to be expected of a bhikkhu who has good friends good associates good companions that he will be virtuous that he will live restrained by the restraint of the Patimokkha endowed with conduct and resort and that seeing danger in the smallest faults he will train in the training rules he has acceptedIt is to be expected of a bhikkhu who has good friends that he will obtain at will with no trouble or difficulty talk that is effacing a help in opening up the mind talk about the knowledge and vision of deliveranceIt is to be expected of a bhikkhu who has good friends that he will live with energy instigated vigorous energetic and persevering with regard to wholesome statesIt is to be expected of a bhikkhu who has good friends that he will be wise endowed with the noble ones penetrative understanding of rise and disappearance leading to the complete ending of sufferingA bhikkhu Meghiya who is established in these five things should also cultivate four additional things foulness should be cultivated for overcoming lust lovingkindness should be cultivated for overcoming malevolence respirationmindfulness should be cultivated for cutting off thinking the perception of impermanence should be cultivated for the removal of the conceit I am For when one perceives impermanence Meghiya the perception of notself is establishedWhen one perceives notself one reaches the removal of the conceit I am which is called Nibbana here and nowThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was journeying among the Mallas together with a large Order of bhikkhus and came to the brahman village of the Mallas called ThunaThe brahman householders who lived in Thuna heard The recluse Gotama the Sakyan son who went forth from the Sakya clan has been journeying among the Mallas together with a large Order of bhikkhus and has arrived at Thuna They then filled the well to the brim with grass and chaff thinking Dont let those shavenheaded recluses get water to drinkThen the Lord stepped off the road and going up to the foot of a certain tree sat down on a seat prepared for himSitting there the Lord addressed the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda fetch me some water from that wellThereupon the Venerable Ananda said to the Lord Just now revered sir the brahman householders living in Thuna filled the well to the brim with grass and chaff thinking Dont let those shavenheaded recluses get water to drink Then a second time the Lord addressed the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda fetch me some water And a second time the Venerable Ananda said to the Lord Just now revered sir the brahman householders filled the well to the brim with grass and chaff Then for a third time the Lord addressed the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda fetch me some water from that wellYes revered sir the Venerable Ananda replied and taking a bowl he went to the wellNow as the Venerable Ananda was approaching it the well threw up all its grass and chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim with pure clean clear water as if it were overflowingThen the Venerable Ananda thought It is indeed wonderful it is indeed marvellous the great supernormal potency and power of the TathagataAs I was approaching this well it threw up all that grass and chaff from its mouth and now stands filled to the brim with pure clean clear water as if it were overflowing And taking some water in the bowl he approached the Lord and said It is indeed wonderful it is indeed marvellous the great supernormal potency and power of the TathagataThis well now stands filled to the brim with pure clean clear water as if it were overflowingDrink the water LordDrink the water SugataThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Wood at Anathapindikas monasteryOn that occasion the Venerable Nanda the Lords brother the son of his maternal aunt informed a number of bhikkhus thus I am discontented with leading the holy life friendsI am unable to endure the holy lifeI will give up the training and return to the low lifeThen a certain bhikkhu approached the Lord prostrated himself sat down to one side and said The Venerable Nanda revered sir the Lords brother the son of his maternal aunt informed a number of bhikkhus thus I am discontented with leading the holy life I will give up the training and return to the low life Then the Lord addressed a certain bhikkhu Come bhikkhu in my name tell the bhikkhu Nanda The Teacher calls you friend Nanda Very well revered sir that bhikkhu replied and approaching the Venerable Nanda he said The Teacher calls you friend NandaVery well friend the Venerable Nanda replied and approaching the Lord he prostrated himself and sat down to one sideThe Lord then said to him Is it true Nanda that you informed a number of bhikkhus thus I am discontented with leading the holy life I will return to the low lifeYes revered sirBut why Nanda are you discontented with leading the holy lifeOn departing from home revered sir a Sakyan girl the loveliest in the land with her hair halfcombed looked up at me and said May you return soon master Recollecting that revered sir I am discontented with leading the holy life I am unable to endure the holy lifeI will give up the training and return to the low lifeThen the Lord took the Venerable Nanda by the arm and just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm even so did they vanish from the Jeta Wood and appear among the devas of the Tavatimsa heavenNow on that occasion about five hundred pinkfooted nymphs had come to minister to Sakka ruler of the devasAnd the Lord said to the Venerable Nanda Do you see those five hundred pinkfooted nymphsYes revered sirWhat do you think Nanda who is more beautiful more fair to behold and more alluring  that Sakyan girl the loveliest in the land or these five hundred pinkfooted nymphsRevered sir compared to these five hundred pinkfooted nymphs that Sakyan girl the loveliest in the land is like a mutilated shemonkey that has had its ears and nose chopped offShe does not count she is not worth a fraction compared to them there is no comparisonThese five hundred nymphs are far more beautiful more fair to behold and more alluringRejoice Nanda rejoice NandaI guarantee that you will obtain five hundred pinkfooted nymphsIf revered sir the Lord guarantees that I will obtain five hundred pinkfooted nymphs I shall be content in living the holy life under the LordThen the Lord took the Venerable Nanda by the arm even so did they vanish from among the devas of the Tavatimsa heaven and appear in the Jeta WoodThe bhikkhus heard It is said that the Venerable Nanda the Lords brother the son of his maternal aunt is living the holy life for the sake of nymphsIt is said that the Lord has guaranteed that he will obtain five hundred pinkfooted nymphsThen the bhikkhufriends of the Venerable Nanda went about calling him hireling and menial saying The Venerable Nanda is a hirelingThe Venerable Nanda is a menialHe is living the holy life for the sake of nymphsIt is said that the Lord has guaranteed that he will obtain five hundred pinkfooted nymphsThen the Venerable Nanda was humiliated ashamed and dismayed by his friends calling him hireling and menial Living alone secluded diligent ardent and resolute he soon realized even here and now through his own direct knowledge that unequalled goal of the holy life for the sake of which sons of good family rightly go forth from home to the homeless state and entering into it he abode in itAnd he knew Finished is birth lived is the holy life done is what had to be done there is no more of this state And the Venerable Nanda became one of the arahatsThen when the night was far advanced a certain devata of surpassing beauty illuminating the whole Jeta Wood approached the Lord prostrated himself and stood to one sideStanding there that devata said to the Lord The Venerable Nanda revered sir the Lords brother the son of his maternal aunt by the ending of the taints has realized here and now through his own direct knowledge the taintless minddeliverance and wisdomdeliverance and entering into it he abides in itThe knowledge also arose in the Lord Nanda by the ending of the taints has realized here and now the taintless minddeliverance and wisdomdeliverance and entering into it he abides in itWhen that night had ended the Venerable Nanda approached the Lord prostrated himself sat down to one side and said to the Lord Revered sir as to the Lords guarantee that I will obtain five hundred pinkfooted nymphs I release the Lord from that promiseBut Nanda comprehending your mind with my mind I knew Nanda has realized here and now the taintless minddeliverance and wisdomdeliverance Also a devata told me The Venerable Nanda revered sir has realized here and now the taintless minddeliverance and wisdomdeliverance When Nanda your mind was released from the taints without grasping I was then released from that promiseThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceAt SavatthiMonks there are these seven propertiesWhich sevenThe property of light the property of beauty the property of the dimension of the infinitude of space the property of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the property of the dimension of nothingness the property of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception the property of the cessation of feeling  perceptionThese are the seven propertiesWhen this was said a certain monk addressed the Blessed One Lord with regard to the property of light the property of the cessation of feeling  perception In dependence on what are these properties discernedMonk the property of light is discerned in dependence on darknessThe property of beauty is discerned in dependence on the unattractiveThe property of the dimension of the infinitude of space is discerned in dependence on formThe property of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness is discerned in dependence on the dimension of the infinitude of spaceThe property of the dimension of nothingness is discerned in dependence on the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessThe property of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception is discerned in dependence on the dimension of nothingnessThe property of the cessation of feeling  perception is discerned in dependence on cessationBut lord with regard to the property of light the property of the cessation of feeling  perception How is the attainment of these properties to be reachedMonk the property of light the property of beauty the property of the dimension of the infinitude of space the property of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the property of the dimension of nothingness These properties are to be reached as perception attainmentsThe property of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception is to be reached as a remnantoffabrications attainmentThe property of the cessation of feeling  perception is to be reached as a cessation attainmentStaying at SavatthiThen a brahman cosmologist went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Now then Master Gotama does everything existEverything exists is the senior form of cosmology brahmanThen Master Gotama does everything not existEverything does not exist is the second form of cosmology brahmanThen is everything a OnenessEverything is a Oneness is the third form of cosmology brahmanThen is everything a ManynessEverything is a Manyness is the fourth form of cosmology brahmanAvoiding these two extremes the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle From

lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks responded to himThe Blessed One said Monks once the devas  asuras were arrayed for battleThen Sakka the chief of the devas addressed the devas of the Thirtythree If dear sirs when the devas have gone into battle there should arise fear terror or horripilation then on that occasion you should catch sight of the top of my standardFor when you have caught sight of the top of my standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedIf you cant catch sight of the top of my standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standardFor when you have caught sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedIf you cant catch sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Varunas standardFor when For when you have caught sight of the top of the devaking Varunas standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedIf you cant catch sight of the top of the devaking Varunas standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Isanas standardFor when you have caught sight of the top of the devaking Isanas standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedBut monks when the top of the devachief Sakkas standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Varunas standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Isanas standard is caught sight of whatever fear terror or horripilation there is may be abandoned or may not be abandonedWhy is thatBecause Sakka the chief of the devas is not devoid of passion not devoid of aversion not devoid of delusionHe feels fear feels terror feels dreadHe runs awayBut I tell you this If  when you have gone into the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  there should arise fear terror or horripilation then on that occasion you should recollect me Indeed the Blessed One is worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed For when you have recollected me whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedIf you cant recollect me then you should recollect the Dhamma The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves For when you have recollected the Dhamma whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedIf you cant recollect the Dhamma then you should recollect the Sangha The Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the unexcelled field of merit for the world For when you have recollected the Sangha whatever fear terror or horripilation where is will be abandonedWhy is thatBecause the Tathagata  worthy  rightly selfawakened  is devoid of passion devoid of aversion devoid of delusionHe feels no fear feels no terror feels no dreadHe doesnt run awayThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the Onewellgone the Teacher further said thisI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryAnd on that occasion VenSaṅgāmaji had arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed OneHis former wife heard Master Saṅgāmaji they say has arrived in Sāvatthī Taking her small child she went to Jetas GroveOn that occasion VenSaṅgāmaji was sitting at the root of a tree for the days abidingHis former wife went to him and on arrival said to him Look after me contemplative  with a little son When this was said VenSaṅgāmaji remained silentA second time A third time his former wife said to him Look after me contemplative  with a little son A third time VenSaṅgāmaji remained silentThen his former wife taking the baby and leaving him in front of VenSaṅgāmaji went away saying Thats your son contemplativeLook after himThen VenSaṅgāmaji neither looked at the child nor spoke to himHis wife after going not far away was looking back and saw VenSaṅgāmaji neither looking at the child nor speaking to himOn seeing this the thought occurred to her The contemplative doesnt even care about his son Returning from there and taking the child she leftThe Blessed One  with his divine eye purified and surpassing the human  saw VenSaṅgāmajis former wife misbehaving in that wayThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAt SavatthiThen a certain very rich brahman  shabby shabbily dressed  went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter this exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Why brahman are you shabby  shabbily dressedJust now Master Gotama my four sons  at their wives instigation  threw me out of the houseIn that case brahman memorize these verses and then recite them when a large assembly of people have gathered in the town hall and your sons are sitting there tooThen the very rich brahman having memorized these verses in the presence of the Blessed One recited them when a large assembly of people had gathered in the town hall and his sons were sitting there tooThen the brahmans sons having led him home bathed him and each provided him in a pair of clothsSo the brahman taking one pair of cloths went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter this exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One We brahmans Master Gotama look for a teachers fee for our teacherMay Master Gotama accept this teachers portion from meThe Blessed One accepted it out of sympathyThen the very rich brahman said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for lifeSee also ANThe composers of Pali poetry love to play on words  puns alliteration and double intentions abound in the verses that have emerged from the lost world of ancient IndiaThis poem is unique in its thorough repetition of the first phrase which sets the tone of cyclical activity that drones on and on until the pattern is transformedEven the pronunciation of punappunam contributes to this The first two syllables rise up in tone a pause or break occurs at the double ps and then the other two syllables descend Beginning with the cycles of nature and the onflowing of the growing seasons the poet turns the metaphor of return to the essential Dhamma teaching of the cycles of birth and death that make up samsara the flowingon of the deluded from one womb to anotherMando or confusion is the narrow limitation of mind that prevents our insight into the impermanence selflessness and unsatisfactoriness of ourselves and the worldIt is transformed by the sort of wisdom that is as farreaching tranquil and stable as the wide earth itself  capable of holding everything with equanimityThe entire poem is about that central Buddhist idea punabbhava found in the final stanza which is often translated as renewed existence or even againbecoming In the process thinking that so characterizes Buddhism people and things do not exist as much as they become and this more dynamic form of the verb to be is usually preferred in the literatureThis life we cling to is merely an episode in a much larger drama of perpetual birth and death with existence recurring over and over and we will never sort it out until we are capable of holding this wider view of our situationThe BuddhaI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Magadhans at Dakkhinagiri in the brahman village of EkanalaNow at that time approximately of the brahman Kasi Bharadvajas plows were yoked at the sowing timeThen in the early morning putting on his lower robe and taking his bowl  robes the Blessed One went to where Kasi Bharadvaja was workingNow at that time Kasi Bharadvajas fooddistribution was underwaySo the Blessed One went to Kasi Bharadvajas fooddistribution and on arrival stood to one sideKasi Bharadvaja saw the Blessed One standing for alms and on seeing him said to him I contemplative plow  sowHaving plowed  sown I eatYou too contemplative should plow  sowHaving plowed  sown you eatI too brahman plow  sowHaving plowed  sown I eatBut contemplative I dont see the Master Gotamas yoke or plow plowshare goad or oxen and yet the Master Gotama says this I too brahman plow  sowHaving plowed  sown I eat Then the Kasi Bharadvaja addressed the Blessed One with a verseThen Kasi Bharadvaja having heaped up milkrice in a large bronze serving bowl offered it to the Blessed One May Master Gotama eat milkriceThe master is a plowman for the Master Gotama plows the plowing that has as its fruit the deathlessThen to whom Master Gotama should I give this milkriceBrahman I dont see that person in this world  with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its royalty  common people  by whom this milkrice having been eaten would be rightly digested aside from a Tathagata or a Tathagatas discipleIn that case brahman throw the milkrice away in a place without vegetation or dump it in water with no living beingsSo Kasi Bharadvaja dumped the milkrice in water with no living beingsAnd the milkrice when dropped in the water hissed  sizzled seethed  steamedJust as an iron ball heated all day when tossed in the water hisses  sizzles seethes  steams in the same way the milkrice when dropped in the water hissed  sizzled seethed  steamedThen Kasi Bharadvaja  in awe his hair standing on end  went to the Blessed One and on arrival throwing himself down with his head at the Blessed Ones feet said to him Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeLet me obtain the going forth in Master Gotamas presence let me obtain admissionThen the brahman Kasi Bharadvaja obtained the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained admissionAnd not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the celibate life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the celibate life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And so VenBharadvaja became another one of the arahantsAt SavatthiThen the brahman Jata Bharadvaja went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter this exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he addressed the Blessed One with a verseWhen this was said the brahman Jata Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksLet me obtain the going forth in Master Gotamas presence let me obtain admissionThen the brahman Jata Bharadvaja received the going forth  the admission in the Blessed Ones presenceAnd not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And so VenBharadvaja became another one of the arahants Now Akkosaka of the Bhaaradvaaja Brahmans heard Angry and displeased he went to see the Blessed One overwhelming him with abuse and reproachesAt these words the Blessed One said What do you think brahmanDo you receive visits from friends and colleagues bloodrelations and othersYes good Gotama sometimes such people comeWhat do you thinkDo you serve them with solid food soft food and savoriesYes good Gotama sometimesBut supposing brahman they do not accept what you offer whose is itIf they do not accept good Gotama then it belongs to usSo it is here brahmanThe abuse the scolding the reviling you hurl at us who do not abuse or scold or revile we do not accept from youIt all belongs to you brahman it all belongs to youIf a man replies to abuse with abuse to scolding with scolding to reviling with reviling brahman that is like you joining your guests for dinnerBut we are not joining you for dinnerIt is all yours brahman it is all yoursThe king and his court believe that Gotama the recluse is an ArahantAnd yet the good Gotama can get angryAnd another Venerable Bhaaradvaaja became an ArahantThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was staying near Raajagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels FeedingPlaceNow at that time the Brahman lady Dhanañjaani wife of a certain Brahman of the Bhaaradvaaja family was a fervent supporter of the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaAnd this lady while serving the Bhaaradvaaja Brahman with his dinner came before him and burst out with this triple inspired utterance Praise to the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully SelfEnlightened OnePraise to the DhammaPraise to the SanghaAt these words the Brahman said to her Now then now thenEvery chance she gets this wretched woman has to sing the praises of that shaveling recluseNow woman Im going to tell that teacher of yours what I think of himOh Brahman I know of nobody in this world with its gods Maaras and Brahmaas with its recluses and brahmans whether they be divine or human who could thus rebuke the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully SelfEnlightened OneBut go on Brahman go and you will find outThen the Brahman angry and displeased went to see the Blessed OneAfter exchanging greetings and compliments with the Blessed One in a friendly and courteous manner he sat down to one sideSo seated he addressed the Blessed One thus in verseAt these words the Brahman said to the Blessed One Excellent good Gotama most excellentIt is good Gotama as if someone were to set up something that had been knocked down or to reveal what had been hidden or to point out the right path to a man who had got lost or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there  just so has the good Gotama shown me the truth in various waysI declare that I go to the Lord Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks I wish to embrace the homeless life under the Lord Gotama I wish to receive ordinationSo the Bhaaradvaaja Brahman was received into the homeless life under the Blessed One and received ordinationAnd not so long after his ordination the Venerable Bhaaradvaaja remaining alone and secluded heedful ardent and resolute quickly attained that for which young men of good birth rightly go forth from home into the homeless life coming to realize for himself in this present life the unsurpassed goal of the holy life realizing that birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is doneThere is no further life in this worldAnd that Bhaaradvaaja became an ArahantTranslators note This discourse reports the way the Buddha passed away giving four verses uttered by those who witnessed the eventIt is interesting to note that the verses ascribed to heavenly beings make general comments on how the nature of all beings  even a Buddha  is to pass away whereas the verses ascribed to the monks comment specifically on the Buddhas display of mental mastery immediately prior to the moment of his total UnbindingOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kusinara in Upavattana the Sal Tree Grove of the Mallans on the occasion of his total UnbindingThen the Blessed One addressed the monks I exhort you monks All fabrications are subject to decayBring about completion by being heedful Those were the Tathagatas last wordsThen the Blessed One entered the first jhanaEmerging from that he entered the second jhanaEmerging from that he entered the third the fourth jhana the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionEmerging from that he entered the cessation of perception  feelingThen emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling he entered the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionEmerging from that he entered the dimension of nothingness the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of the infinitude of space the fourth jhana the third the second the first jhanaEmerging from the first jhana he entered the second the third the fourth jhanaEmerging from the fourth jhana he immediately was totally UnboundWhen the Blessed One was totally Unbound simultaneously with the total Unbinding Sahampati Brahma uttered this verseWhen the Blessed One was totally Unbound simultaneously with the total Unbinding Sakka ruler of the gods uttered this verseWhen the Blessed One was totally Unbound simultaneously with the total Unbinding VenAnanda uttered this verseWhen the Blessed One was totally Unbound simultaneously with the total Unbinding VenAnuruddha uttered this verseI have heard that on one occasion when the Blessed One was newly Selfawakened he was staying at Uruvela on the bank of the Nerañjara River at the foot of the Goatherds Banyan TreeThen while he was alone and in seclusion this line of thinking arose in his awareness One suffers if dwelling without reverence or deferenceNow on what brahman or contemplative can I dwell in dependence honoring and respecting himThen the thought occurred to him It would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of virtue that I would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting himHowever in this world with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and commonfolk I do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in virtue than I on whom I could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting himIt would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of concentration that I would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting himHowever in this world with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and commonfolk I do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in concentration than I on whom I could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting himIt would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of discernment that I would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting himHowever in this world with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and commonfolk I do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in discernment than I on whom I could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting himIt would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of release that I would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting himHowever in this world with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and commonfolk I do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in release than I on whom I could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting himIt would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of knowledge and vision of release that I would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting himHowever in this world with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and commonfolk I do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in knowledge and vision of release than I on whom I could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting himWhat if I were to dwell in dependence on this very Dhamma to which I have fully awakened honoring and respecting itThen having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed Ones awareness  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the Brahmaworld and reappeared in front of the Blessed OneArranging his upper robe over one shoulder he saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart and said to him So it is Blessed OneSo it is OneWellGoneThose who were Arahants Rightly Selfawakened Ones in the past  they too dwelled in dependence on the very Dhamma itself honoring and respecting itThose who will be Arahants Rightly Selfawakened Ones in the future  they too will dwell in dependence on the very Dhamma itself honoring and respecting itAnd let the Blessed One who is at present the Arahant the Rightly Selfawakened One dwell in dependence on the very Dhamma itself honoring and respecting itThat is what Brahma Sahampati saidHaving said that he further said thisThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Dakkhinagiri in the brahmana village Ekanala in MagadhaNow at that time it being the sowing season five hundred plows of the brahman Kasibharadvaja were put to useThen in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and went to the place where brahman Kasibharadvajas work was going onIt was the time of food distribution by the brahman and the Blessed One drew near and stood at one sideBharadvaja seeing the Blessed One standing there for alms said to himRecluse I do plow and do sow and having plowed and sown I eatYou also recluse should plow and sow having plowed and sown you should eatI too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown I eatWe do not see the Venerable Gotamas yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxenNevertheless the Venerable Gotama says I too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown I eat Thereupon the brahman addressed the Blessed One in a stanzaYou profess to be a plowman yet your plow we do not see asked about your plow and the rest tell us of them that we may knowFaith is my seed austerity the rain wisdom my yoke and plow modesty is the pole mind the strap mindfulness is my plowshare and goadControlled in speech and conduct guarded in deed and speech abstemious in food I make truth my weed cutter arahantship my deliverance completeExertion my team in yoke draws me to Nibbanas security and on it goes without stopping wither gone one does not sufferThuswise is this plowing plowed which bears the fruit of Deathlessness having plowed this plowing one is freed from every illThen brahman Kasibharadvaja filling a golden bowl with milkrice offered it to the Blessed One saying May the Venerable Gotama partake of this milk rice a plowman indeed is Venerable Gotama who plows a plow for the fruit of DeathlessnessWhat I receive by reciting verses O brahman I should not eatIt is not the tradition of those who practice right livelihoodThe Buddhas reject what is received by reciting versesThis brahman is the conduct as long as Dhamma reignsTo those wholly consummate taintless and welldisciplines great sages should thou offer other food and drink sure field is that for meritseeking menTo whom then Venerable Gotama shall I give this milk riceBrahman in the world of Devas Maras and Brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans there is no one by whom this milk rice if eaten could be wholly digested except by the Tathagata or the disciple of a TathagataTherefore brahman either cast this milk rice where there is no grass or into water where there are no living creaturesThereupon the brahman flung that milk rice into water where there were no living creatures and the milk rice thrown into the water smoked and steamed making the noise cicchita citicita just like a plowshare heated during the day when thrown into water smokes and steams making the noise cicchita citicitaThen the brahman Kasibharadvaja alarmed with hair standing on end approached and fell with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and said as followsMost excellent O Gotama is thy teaching most excellentJust as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the Dhamma has been declared in many a manner by the Venerable GotamaI take refuge in the Venerable Gotama in the Dhamma and in the SanghaI wish to receive the novices ordination and higher ordinationBrahman Kasibharadvaja duly received both the pabbajja and upasampada from the Blessed OneNot long after his upasampada the Venrable Bharadvaja dwelling alone and aloof diligent strenuous and resolute ere long by his own insight here and now realized and attained the highest perfection the end of the Noble Life  for the sake of which men of good family go forth from home to live the homeless lifeBirth is destroyed lived is the noble life done is what has to be done there is no more of this stateThe Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahantsThe nun Soma has entered Andhavana near Savatthi to practice meditationMara the embodiment of delusion sees her there and desires to make her waver and abandon her concentrationHe addresses her with a verseThis in my view is the definitive statement in the Buddhist tradition regarding the equality of the sexesWhatever other words have crept into the literature  from ancient times to the present  whatever attitudes may have been expressed by Theras Lamas Roshis or Teachers over the ages this position of thoroughgoing equality in light of the Dhamma is plainly stated by Soma one of the Buddhas contemporary nunsSoma was the daughter of the chief priest of King Bimbisara of Magadha and was an early convert to the Buddhas teachingShe spent many years as a lay supporter before eventually becoming a nun and achieved awakening  like so many of her sisters  not long after joining the orderIn this exchange Mara is clearly trying to provoke and discourage Soma but only reveals his delusionThe expression he uses literally means two fingers  of wisdomIt may originally have been a reference to the domestic task of checking if rice is cooked by examining it between the fingers but here it is obviously used pejoratively to impugn that women are less capable of liberationSoma not only refrains from getting offended but calmly points out how ludicrous the statement is when viewed in light of the Buddhas higher teaching about the nature of personhoodI have heard that on one occasion when the Blessed One was newly Selfawakened he was staying at Uruvela on the bank of the Nerañjara River at the foot of the Goatherds Banyan TreeThen while he was alone and in seclusion this line of thinking arose in his awareness This Dhamma that I have attained is deep hard to see hard to realize peaceful refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseBut this generation delights in attachment is excited by attachment enjoys attachmentFor a generation delighting in attachment excited by attachment enjoying attachment thisthat conditionality and dependent coarising are hard to seeThis state too is hard to see the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingAnd if I were to teach the Dhamma and if others would not understand me that would be tiresome for me troublesome for meJust then these verses unspoken in the past unheard before occurred to the Blessed OneAs the Blessed One reflected thus his mind inclined to dwelling at ease not to teaching the DhammaThen Brahma Sahampati having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed Ones awareness thought The world is lostThe world is destroyedThe mind of the Tathagata the Arahant the Rightly Selfawakened One inclines to dwelling at ease not to teaching the Dhamma Then just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the Brahmaworld and reappeared in front of the Blessed OneArranging his upper robe over one shoulder he knelt down with his right knee on the ground saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart and said to him Lord let the Blessed One teach the DhammaLet the OneWellGone teach the DhammaThere are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the DhammaThere will be those who will understand the DhammaThat is what Brahma Sahampati saidHaving said that he further said thisThen the Blessed One having understood Brahmas invitation out of compassion for beings surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened OneAs he did so he saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other worldJust as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses  born and growing in the water  might flourish while immersed in the water without rising up from the water some might stand at an even level with the water while some might rise up from the water and stand without being smeared by the water  so too surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One the Blessed One saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other worldHaving seen this he answered Brahma Sahampati in verseThen Brahma Sahampati thinking The Blessed One has given his consent to teach the Dhamma bowed down to the Blessed One and circling him on the right disappeared right thereI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Kosalans in a wilderness hut in a Himalayan districtThen as he was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Is it possible to exercise rulership without killing or causing others to kill without confiscating or causing others to confiscate without sorrowing or causing others sorrow  righteouslyThen Mara the Evil One knowing with his awareness the train of thought in the Blessed Ones awareness went to him and on arrival said to him Exercise rulership Blessed OneExercise rulership O One Wellgone without killing or causing others to kill without confiscating or causing others to confiscate without sorrowing or causing others sorrow  righteouslyBut what do you see in me Evil One that you say to me Exercise rulership Blessed OneExercise rulership O One Wellgone without killing or causing others to kill without confiscating or causing others to confiscate without sorrowing or causing others sorrow  righteouslyLord the Blessed One has developed the four bases of power pursued them handed them the reins and taken them as a basis given them a grounding steadied them consolidated them and undertaken them wellIf he wanted to he could resolve on the Himalayas king of mountains as gold and it would become a mountain of goldThen Mara the Evil One  sad  dejected at realizing The Blessed One knows me the One Wellgone knows me  vanished right thereAt SavatthiNow at that time the Blessed One was instructing urging rousing  encouraging the monks with a Dhamma talk concerning UnbindingThe monks  attentive interested lending ear focusing their entire awareness  were listening to the DhammaThen the thought occurred to Mara the Evil One Gotama the contemplative is instructing urging rousing  encouraging the monks with a Dhamma talk concerning UnbindingThe monks  attentive interested lending ear focusing their entire awareness  are listening to the DhammaWhat if I were to go to Gotama the contemplative to obscure his visionThen Mara the Evil One taking on the form of a farmer with a large plowshare over his shoulder carrying a long goad stick  his hair disheveled his clothes made of coarse hemp his feet splattered with mud  went to the Blessed One and on arrival said Hey contemplativeHave you seen my oxenAnd what are your oxen Evil OneMine alone is the eye contemplativeMine are forms mine is the sphere of consciousness  contact at the eyeWhere can you go to escape meMine alone is the ear the nose the tongue the body Mine alone is the intellect contemplativeMine are ideas mine is the sphere of consciousness  contact at the intellectWhere can you go to escape meYours alone is the eye Evil OneYours are forms yours is the sphere of consciousness of contact at the eyeWhere no eye exists no forms exist no sphere of consciousness  contact at the eye exists there Evil One you cannot goYours alone is the ear the nose the tongue the body Yours alone is the intellect Evil OneYours are ideas yours is the sphere of consciousness  contact at the intellectWhere no intellect exists no ideas exist no sphere of consciousness of contact at the intellect exists there Evil One you cannot goThen Mara the Evil One  sad  dejected at realizing The Blessed One knows me the One Wellgone knows me  vanished right thereAt SavatthiThen King Pasenadi Kosala approached the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Well now great king where are you coming from in the middle of the dayJust now lord I was engaged in the sort of royal affairs typical of headanointed noblewarrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earthWhat do you think great kingSuppose a man trustworthy and reliable were to come to you from the east and on arrival would say If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the eastThere I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beingsDo whatever you think should be done Then a second man were to come to you from the west Then a third man were to come to you from the north Then a fourth man were to come to you from the south and on arrival would say If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the southThere I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beingsDo whatever you think should be done If great king such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what should be doneIf lord such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard

country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth but there is no use for those elephant battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling inThere are cavalry battles chariot battles infantry battles but there is no use for those infantry battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling inIn this royal court there are counselors who when the enemies arrive are capable of dividing them by their wits but there is no use for those battles of wits no scope for them when aging and death are rolling inIn this royal court there is abundant bullion and gold stored in vaults and depositories and with such wealth we are capable of buying off enemies when they come but there is no use for those battles of wealth no scope for them when aging and death

death are rolling in on you what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deedsThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher further said thisTranslators note See the introductory note to SNI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha at the Maddakucchi Deer ReserveNow at that time his foot had been pierced by a stone sliverExcruciating were the bodily feelings that developed within him  painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable  but he endured them mindful alert  unperturbedHaving had his outer robe folded in four and laid out he lay down on his right side in the lions posture  with one foot placed on top of the other  mindful  alertThen Mara the Evil One went to the Blessed One and recited this verse in his presenceThen Mara the Evil One  sad  dejected at realizing The Blessed One knows me the One WellGone knows me  vanished right thereThis verse emerges from a discussion between the Buddha and the Kosala king Pasenadi who generally feels secure behind his fourfold army his conjurers and his treasuryThe Buddha asks him to imagine a situation  the fantastic closingin of four mountain ranges  where all his royal resources will not help him meet the foeSuch is the situation in which we actually all find ourselves  rich or poor aristocrat or laborer  though we are reluctant to face itHow do we respond to the inevitable onslaught of aging and deathThe answer given in the body of the sutta is What else is there to do save to live righteously and justly and to work good and meritorious deeds The verse summarizes this phrase by saying one should have confidence in the triple gem and practice the Buddhas teachingEver practical the Buddha often points out that in this way we are covering our bets there are immediate benefits in this life and in the next our chances are better of emerging welloffAt SavatthiAs he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Where lord should a gift be givenWherever the mind feels confidence great kingBut a gift given where lord bears great fruitThis is one thing great king  Where should a gift be given  while this  A gift given where bears great fruit  is something else entirelyWhat is given to a virtuous person  rather than to an unvirtuous one  bears great fruitIn that case great king I will ask you a counterquestionAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think great kingThere is the case where you have a war at hand a battle imminentA noblewarrior youth would come along  untrained unpracticed undisciplined undrilled fearful terrified cowardly quick to fleeWould you take him onWould you have any use for a man like thatNo lord I wouldnt take him onI wouldnt have any use for a man like thatThen a brahman youth a merchant youth a laborer youth would come along  untrained unpracticed undisciplined undrilled fearful terrified cowardly quick to fleeWould you take him onWould you have any use for a man like thatNo lord I wouldnt take him onI wouldnt have any use for a man like thatNow what do you think great kingThere is the case where you have a war at hand a battle imminentA noblewarrior youth would come along  trained practiced disciplined drilled fearless unterrified not cowardly not quick to fleeWould you take him onWould you have any use for a

unterrified not cowardly not quick to fleeWould you take him onWould you have any use for a man like thatYes lord I would take him onI would have use for a man like thatIn the same way great kingWhen someone has gone forth from the home life into homelessness  no matter from what clan  and he has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five what is given to him bears great fruitAnd which five factors has he abandonedHe has abandoned sensual desire ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety uncertaintyThese are the five factors he has abandonedAnd with which five factors is he endowedHe is endowed with the aggregate of virtue of one beyond training the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training the aggregate of discernment of one beyond training the aggregate of release of one beyond training the aggregate of knowledge  vision of release of one beyond trainingThese are the five factors with which he is endowedWhat is given to one who has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five factors in this way bears great fruitThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher said furtherAt SavatthiAs he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One How many qualities of the world that when arising arise for harm stress  discomfortThree qualities of the world great king when arising arise for harm stress  discomfortWhich threeGreed great king is a quality of the world that when arising arises for harm stress  discomfortAversion Delusion is a quality of the world that when arising arises for harm stress  discomfortThese are the three qualities of the world great king that when arising arise for harm stress  discomfortThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher said furtherAt SavatthiThen King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Well now great king where are you coming from in the middle of the dayJust now lord a moneylending householder died in SavatthiI have come from conveying his heirless fortune to the royal palace eight million in silver to say nothing of the goldBut even though he was a moneylending householder his enjoyment of food was like this he ate broken rice  pickle brineHis enjoyment of clothing was like this he wore three lengths of hempen clothHis enjoyment of a vehicle was like this he rode in a dilapidated little cart with an awning of leavesThats the way it is great kingThats the way it isWhen a person of no integrity acquires lavish wealth he doesnt provide for his own pleasure  satisfaction nor for the pleasure  satisfaction of his parents nor for the pleasure  satisfaction of his wife  children nor for the pleasure  satisfaction of his slaves servants  assistants nor for the pleasure  satisfaction of his friendsHe doesnt institute for brahmans  contemplatives offerings of supreme aim heavenly resulting in happiness leading to heavenWhen his wealth isnt properly put to use kings make off with it or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with itThus his wealth not properly put to use goes to waste and not to any good useJust as with a pond in a place haunted by nonhuman beings with clear water cool water fresh water clean with good fords delightful No people would draw water from it or drink it or bathe in it or apply it to their needsAnd so that water not properly put to use would go to waste and not to any good useIn the same way when a person of no integrity acquires lavish wealth his wealth not properly put to use goes to waste and not to any good useBut when a person of integrity acquires lavish wealth he provides for his own pleasure  satisfaction for the pleasure  satisfaction of his parents the pleasure  satisfaction of his wife  children the pleasure  satisfaction of his slaves servants  assistants and the pleasure  satisfaction of his friendsHe institutes for brahmans  contemplatives offerings of supreme aim heavenly resulting in happiness leading to heavenWhen his wealth is properly put to use kings dont make off with it thieves dont make off with it fire doesnt burn it water doesnt sweep it away and hateful heirs dont make off with itThus his wealth properly put to use goes to a good use and not to wasteJust as with a pond not far from a town or village with clear water cool water fresh water clean with good fords delightfulPeople would draw water from it or drink it or bathe in it or apply it to their needsAnd so that water properly put to use would go to a good use and not to wasteIn the same way when a person of integrity acquires lavish wealth his wealth properly put to use goes to a good use and not to wasteThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher said furtherThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Wood at Anathapindikas monasteryOn that occasion a certain bhikkhu was sitting crosslegged not far from the Lord holding his body erect mindful and clearly comprehending enduring without complaint feelings that were painful acute sharp and severe the ripening of former actionThe Lord saw that bhikkhu sitting crosslegged not far away enduring without complaint feelings that were painful acute sharp and severe the ripening of former actionThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying at Anupiya in the Mango OrchardAt that time the Venerable Bhaddiya Kaligodhas son on going into the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place constantly uttered Ah what blissAh what blissA number of bhikkhus heard the Venerable Bhaddiya constantly uttering Ah what blissAh what bliss and the thought came to them No doubt friend the Venerable Bhaddiya Kaligodhas son is dissatisfied with leading the holy life since formerly when he was a householder he enjoyed the bliss of royaltyAnd when recollecting that on going into the forest he utters Ah what blissAh what bliss Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Lord prostrated themselves sat down to one side and reported this to the LordThen the Lord addressed a certain bhikkhu Come bhikkhu in my name tell the bhikkhu Bhaddiya The Teacher calls you friend Bhaddiya Very well revered sir the bhikkhu replied and approaching the Venerable Bhaddiya Kaligodhas son he said The Teacher calls you friend BhaddiyaVery well friend the Venerable Bhaddiya replied and approaching the Lord he prostrated himself and sat down to one sideThe Lord then said to him Is it true Bhaddiya that on going into the forest you utter Ah what blissAh what blissYes revered sirBut Bhaddiya what do you see that prompts you to do soFormerly revered sir when I was a householder and enjoyed the bliss of royalty inside and outside my inner apartments guards were appointed inside and outside the city guards were appointed inside and outside the district guards were appointedBut revered sir although I was thus guarded and protected I lived fearful agitated distrustful and afraidBut now revered sir on going alone into the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place I am fearless unagitated confident and unafraidI live unconcerned unruffled my needs satisfied with a mind become like a deersSeeing this revered sir prompts me on going to the forest to utter constantly Ah what blissAh what bliss Then on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying at Uruvela beside the river Nerañjara at the foot of the Mucalinda Tree having just realized full enlightenmentAt that time the Lord sat crosslegged for seven days experiencing the bliss of liberationNow it happened that there occurred out of season a great rainstorm and for seven days there were rain clouds cold winds and unsettled weatherThen Mucalinda the nagaking left his dwelling place and having encircled the Lords body seven times with his coils he stood with his great hood spread over the Lords head to protect the Lord from cold and heat from gadflies mosquitoes wind sun and the touch of creeping thingsAt the end of those seven days the Lord emerged from that concentrationThen Mucalinda the nagaking seeing that the sky had cleared and the rain clouds had gone removed his coils from the Lords bodyChanging his own appearance and assuming the appearance of a youth he stood in front of the Lord with his hands folded together venerating himThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Wood at Anathapindikas monasteryAt that time Bahiya of the Barkcloth was living by the seashore at SupparakaHe was respected revered honored venerated and given homage and was one who obtained the requisites of robes almsfood lodging and medicinesNow while he was in seclusion this reflection arose in the mind of Bahiya of the Barkcloth Am I one of those in the world who are arahats or who have entered the path to arahatshipThen a devata who was a former bloodrelation of Bahiya of the Barkcloth understood that reflection in his mindBeing compassionate and wishing to benefit him he approached Bahiya and said You Bahiya are neither an arahant nor have you entered the path to arahatshipYou do not follow that practice whereby you could be an arahant or enter the path to arahatshipThen in the world including the devas who are arahats or have entered the path to arahatshipThere is Bahiya in a far country a town called SavatthiThere the Lord now lives who is the Arahant the Fully Enlightened OneThat Lord Bahiya is indeed an arahant and he teaches Dhamma for the realization of arahatshipThen Bahiya of the Barkcloth profoundly stirred by the words of that devata then and there departed from SupparakaStopping only for one night everywhere he went to Savatthi where the Lord was staying in the Jeta Wood at Anathapindikas monasteryAt that time a number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in the open airThen Bahiya of the Barkcloth approached those bhikkhus and said Where revered sirs is the Lord now living the Arahant the Fully Enlightened OneWe wish to see that Lord who is the Arahant the Fully Enlightened OneThe Lord Bahiya has gone for almsfood among the housesThen Bahiya hurriedly left the Jeta WoodEntering Savatthi he saw the Lord walking for almsfood in Savatthi  pleasing lovely to see with calmed senses and tranquil mind attained to perfect poise and calm controlled a perfected one watchful with restrained sensesOn seeing the Lord he approached fell down with his head at the Lords feet and said Teach me Dhamma Lord teach me Dhamma Sugata so that it will be for my good and happiness for a long timeUpon being spoken to thus the Lord said to Bahiya of the Barkcloth It is an unsuitable time Bahiya we have entered among the houses for almsfoodA second time Bahiya said to the Lord It is difficult to know for certain revered sir how long the Lord will live or how long I will liveTeach me Dhamma Lord teach me Dhamma Sugata so that it will be for my good and happiness for a long time A second time the Lord said to Bahiya It is an unsuitable time Bahiya we have entered among the houses for almsfoodA third time Bahiya said to the Lord It is difficult to know for certain Teach me Dhamma Sugata so that it will be for my good and happiness for a long timeHerein Bahiya you should train yourself thus In the seen will be merely what is seen in the heard will be merely what is heard in the sensed will be merely what is sensed in the cognized will be merely what is cognized In this way you should train yourself BahiyaWhen Bahiya for you in the seen is merely what is seen in the cognized is merely what is cognized then Bahiya you will not be with that When Bahiya you are not with that then Bahiya you will not be in that When Bahiya you are not in that then Bahiya you will be neither here nor beyond nor in between the twoJust this is the end of sufferingNow through this brief Dhamma teaching of the Lord the mind of Bahiya of the Barkcloth was immediately freed from the taints without graspingThen the Lord having instructed Bahiya with this brief instruction went awayNot long after the Lords departure a cow with a young calf attacked Bahiya of the Barkcloth and killed himWhen the Lord having walked for almsfood in Savatthi was returning from the alms round with a number of bhikkhus on departing from the town he saw that Bahiya of the Barkcloth had diedSeeing this he said to the bhikkhus Bhikkhus take Bahiyas body put it on a litter carry it away and burn it and make a stupa for itYour companion in the holy life has diedVery well revered sir those bhikkhus replied to the LordTaking Bahiyas body they put it upon a litter carried it away and burnt it and made a stupa for itThen they went to the Lord prostrated themselves and sat down to one sideSitting there those bhikkhus said to the Lord Bahiyas body has been burnt revered sir and a stupa has been made for itWhat is his destiny what is his future birthBhikkhus Bahiya of the Barkcloth was a wise manHe practiced according to Dhamma and did not trouble me by disputing about DhammaBhikkhus Bahiya of the Barkcloth has attained final NibbanaThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThis inspired utterance was spoken by the Lord also so I did hearThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying at Uruvela for seven days experiencing the bliss of liberationThen at the end of those seven days the Lord gave wellreasoned attention during the last watch of the night to dependent arising in both forward and reverse order thusThat is with ignorance as condition volitional activities come to be with birth as condition aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair come to beThis is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingBut from the complete disappearance and cessation of ignorance volitional activities cease from the cessation of birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ceaseThis is the ceasing of this whole mass of sufferingThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceTranslators note It might come as something of a surprise that the Buddha in this discourse seems to speak favorably of the lavish enjoyment of sensual pleasuresTaken in light of his teachings in AN his remarks here are less surprisingThere he points out that the enjoyment of pleasure is one of the legitimate rewards of wealth although the proper enjoyment of wealth doesnt end thereIn this discourse he speaks of a man who because of his past kamma couldnt even enjoy sensual pleasuresThis is a useful discourse for illustrating the point that the Buddhas ultimate rejection of sensual pleasure is not that of a man who was too aversive or stingy to enjoy themRather he rejects them because he was capable of enjoying them but realized that this sort of enjoyment was not the path to true happinessAs for the moneylender mentioned in this discourse even though his inability to enjoy his wealth can be traced to attitudes in the past his unwillingness to make merit in this lifetime is not the fault of his past kammaPeople are always free to choose to practice the Dhamma at any timeIn his case he chose not toThus he got no legitimate use out of his wealth at allAt SavatthiThen King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Well now great king where are you coming from in the middle of the dayJust now lord a moneylending householder died in SavatthiI have come from conveying his heirless fortune to the royal palace ten million in silver to say nothing of the goldBut even though he was a moneylending householder his enjoyment of food was like this he ate broken rice  pickle brineHis enjoyment of clothing was like this he wore three lengths of hempen clothHis enjoyment of a vehicle was like this he rode in a dilapidated little cart with an awning of leavesThats the way it is great kingThats the way it isOnce in the past that moneylending householder provided alms for the Private Buddha named TagarasikhiSaying Give alms to the contemplative he got up from his seat and leftAfter giving though he felt regret It would have been better if my slaves or servants had eaten those alms And he also murdered his brothers only heir for the sake of his fortuneNow the result of his action in having provided alms for the Private Buddha named Tagarasikhi was that he appeared seven times in a good destination the heavenly worldAnd through the remaining result of that action he acted as moneylender seven times in this very same SavatthiBut the result of his action in feeling regret after giving alms  It would have been better if my slaves or servants had eaten those alms  was that his mind didnt lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of food didnt lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of clothing didnt lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of a vehicle didnt lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of the five strings of sensualityThe result of his action in having murdered his brothers only heir for the sake of his fortune was that he boiled in hell for many years many hundreds of years many thousands of years many hundredthousands of yearsAnd through the remaining result of that action he has left this seventh heirless fortune to the royal treasuryNow because of the wasting away of that moneylending householders old merit and his nonaccumulation of new merit he is today boiling in the Great Roruva hellSo he has reappeared in the Great Roruva hell lordYes great kingHe has reappeared in the Great Roruva hellThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher said furtherThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying at Uruvela for seven days experiencing the bliss of liberationThen at the end of those seven days the Lord emerged from that concentration and gave wellreasoned attention during the middle watch of the night to dependent arising in reverse order thusThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying at Uruvela beside the river Nerañjara at the foot of the Bodhi Tree having just realized full enlightenmentAt that time the Lord sat crosslegged for seven days experiencing the bliss of liberationThen at the end of those seven days the Lord emerged from that concentration and gave wellreasoned attention during the first watch of the night to dependent arising in forward order thusThen on realizing its significance the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utteranceThe Venerable PingiyaI am old and feeble the comeliness of youth has vanishedMy sight is weak and I am hard of hearingI do not wish to perish whilst still confusedTeach me the Dhamma by understanding which I may abandon birth and decayThe LordSeeing heedless people afflicted and suffering through their bodies Pingiya you should be heedful and renounce body so as to not come again to birthThe Venerable PingiyaIn the ten directions  the four quarters four between and those above and below  there is nothing in the world not seen heard sensed or understood by youTeach me the Dhamma by understanding which I may abandon birth and decayThe LordSeeing men caught in craving Pingiya tormented and afflicted by old age you should be heedful and renounce craving so as to not come again to birthThe Venerable MogharajaTwice have I asked Sakka but the Seeing One has not answered meI have heard a divine sage replies when asked a third timeI do not know the view of the greatly famous Gotama concerning this world the next world and the Brahmaworld with its deitiesTo him of supreme vision I have come with a question how should one regard the world so that one is not seen by the King of DeathThe LordLook upon the world as empty Mogharaja ever mindful uprooting the view of self you may thus be one who overcomes deathSo regarding the world one is not seen by the King of DeathThe world here and elsewhere is not to be understood in the way we usually think of it but is defined as the five aggregates of material form feeling perception activities and consciousness or as the eye and visible objects the ear and sounds etc that is to say the whole of our subjective and objective experienceI ask the Lord this question may he tell me the answer to itI know him to be a master of knowledge and a perfected beingFrom whence have arisen these many sufferings evident in the worldYou have asked me the source of sufferingMettagu I will tell it to you as it has been discerned by meThese many sufferings evident in the world have arisen from worldly attachmentsWhoever ignorantly creates an attachment that stupid person comes upon suffering again and againTherefore a man of understanding should not create attachment seeing it is the source of sufferingWhat I did ask you have explained now I ask another questionCome tell me this how do the wise cross the flood birth and old age sorrow and griefExplain it thoroughly to me O sage for this Dhamma has been understood by youThe Lord I will set forth the Dhamma Mettagu a teaching to be directly perceived not something based on hearsay by experiencing which and living mindfully one may pass beyond the entanglements of the worldMettagu I rejoice in the thought of that highest Dhamma great sage by experiencing which and living mindfully one may pass beyond the entanglements of the worldWhatever you clearly comprehend Mettagu above below across and in between get rid of delight in itRid yourself of habitual attitudes and consciousnessDo not continue in existenceLiving thus mindful and vigilant a bhikkhu who has forsaken selfish attachments may by understanding abandon suffering birth and old age sorrow and grief even here in this lifeI rejoice in the words of the great sageWell explained O Gotama is the state of nonattachmentThe Lord has surely abandoned suffering as this Dhamma has been realized by himThey will certainly abandon suffering who are constantly admonished by you O SageHaving understood I venerate it Noble OneMay the Lord constantly admonish me alsoWhom you know as a true brahmana a master of knowledge owning nothing not attached to sensual existence he has certainly crossed this floodHaving crossed beyond he is untainted and freed from doubtOne who has discarded this clinging to renewal of existence is a man who has realized the highest knowledgeFree from craving undistressed desireless he has crossed beyond birth and old age I sayAlasNow that I have departed from home to the homeless state these reckless thoughts from the Dark One come upon meMighty warriors great archers trained steady bowmen one thousand fearless men might surround me on all sidesEven if more women than these will come they will not cause me to waver for I am firmly established in the teachingIn his presence I heard from the Awakened One the Kinsman of the Sun of this path leading to nibbana it is there that my mind is attachedEvil One while I am living thus if you assail me so shall I act O Death that you will not see my pathEntirely giving up disliking and liking and the thinking associated with the life of a householder one should not have craving for anythingHe indeed is a monk who is wholly without cravingWhatever there is here of form inhabiting the earth and the sky immersed in the world all is impermanent and decayingSo understanding the wise live their livesRegarding objects of attachment people are greedy for what is to be seen and heard and touched and otherwise experiencedBeing unmoved dispel desire for them for they call him a sage who does not cling to themThen caught in the sixty full of thoughts because of being outsiders they are established in wrong teachingBut one who is a monk would not take up a sectarian viewpoint much less seize upon what is badIntelligent for a long time composed not deceitful wise not envious the sage has experienced the peaceful state depending on which attained to quenching he awaits his timeAbandon conceit Gotama get rid of the way of conceit completelyBecause of being infatuated by the way of conceit for a long time you have been remorsefulSoiled by contempt destroyed by conceit people fall into hellPersons destroyed by conceit grieve for a long time upon being reborn in hellA monk never grieves who is a knower of the path one who has practiced it properlyHe experiences fame and happiness truthfully they call him a seer of DhammaTherefore be without barrenness here energetic purified by abandoning the hindrancesHaving completely abandoned conceit be an ender through knowledge and become one who dwells at peaceI burn with sensual desire my mind is enflamedOut of pity please tell me Gotama the effective extinguishing of itYour mind is enflamed because of distorted perceptionShun the aspect of beauty associated with passionBSee constructions as other as painful not as self extinguish strong passion do not burn again and againDevote the mind onepointed and wellcomposed to the contemplation of foulnessLet mindfulness be directed towards the body and be full of disenchantment for itContemplate the signless and cast out the underlying tendency to conceitThen by the penetration of conceit you will go about at peaceOne should speak only that word by which one would not torment oneself nor harm othersThat word is indeed well spokenOne should speak only pleasant words words which are acceptableWhat one speaks without bringing evils to others is pleasantTruth is indeed the undying word this is an ancient verityUpon truth the good say the goal and the teaching are foundedThe sure word the Awakened One speaks for the attainment of nibbana for making an end of suffering is truly the best of wordsOf profound wisdom intelligent skilled in knowledge of the right and wrong path Sariputta of great wisdom teaches Dhamma to the monksHe teaches in brief he speaks with detailed explanation his voice is like that of the mynah bird he demonstrates readiness of speechListening to his sweet utterance while he is teaching with a voice that is captivating pleasing and lovely the monks give ear with minds elated and joyfulToday on the fifteenth five hundred monks have gathered for the ceremony of purification cutters of fetters and bonds untroubled seers finished with renewed existenceAs a wheelturning monarch surrounded by his ministers tours all around this oceangirt earth so do the disciples with the threefold knowledge who have left death behind attend upon the victor in battle the unsurpassed caravan leaderAll are the Fortunate Ones sons there is no chaff found hereI pay homage to the destroyer of the dart of craving the Kinsman of the SunMore than a thousand monks attend upon the Happy One as he is teaching the stainless Dhamma concerning nibbana where no fear can come from any quarterThey hear the taintless Dhamma taught by the Fully Awakened OneThe Awakened One is truly resplendent as he is revered by the community of monksYou are called a naga Fortunate One of seers you are the best of seersLike a great raincloud you rain down upon the disciplesLeaving his daytime abode wishing to see the Teacher your disciple Vangisa pays homage at your feet Great HeroOvercoming the devious ways and range of Mara he walks having broken up the things that make for barrenness of mindSee him producing release from bonds unattached separating into its constituent partsHe has shown the path in a variety of ways with the aim of guiding us across the floodSince the undying has been shown the Dhammaseers stand immovableThe lightmaker having penetrated saw the overcoming of all standpointsHaving understood and experienced it he taught the topmost to the fiveWhen the Dhamma has been thus well taught what indolence could there be in those who know the DhammaTherefore vigilant and ever revering one should follow the training in the Fortunate Ones dispensationThe Elder Kondañña strong in energy who was enlightened after the Awakened One is repeatedly the obtainer of pleasurable abidings and seclusionsWhatever is to be attained by a disciple who does the instruction of the Teacher all that has been attained by him vigilant and disciplinedHaving great power and the threefold knowledge skilled in knowing the thoughts of others Kondañña the Awakened Ones heir pays homage at the Teachers feetDisciples possessors of the threefold knowledge who have left death behind attend upon the sage seated on the mountain side who has gone to the far shore beyond sufferingMoggallana of great supernormal powers encompasses with his mind seeking their minds completely freed without attachmentsThus do they attend upon Gotama endowed with so many virtuous qualities the sage possessed of all the attributes and gone to the far shore beyond sufferingAs the moon shines in the sky free from clouds as also the spotless sun even so Resplendent One Great Sage do you outshine the whole world with your fameIntoxicated with skill in the poetic art formerly we wandered from village to village from town to townThen we saw the Awakened One gone to the far shore beyond all phenomenaThe sage gone to the far shore beyond suffering taught me the DhammaOn hearing the Dhamma we gained confidence in him faith arose in usHaving heard his word and learnt of the aggregates bases and elements I went forth into homelessnessIndeed Tathagatas appear for the good of the many men and women who practice their teachingIndeed the sage attained enlightenment for the good of those monks and nuns who see the course to be undergoneWell taught are the Four Noble Truths by the Seeing One the Awakened One the Kinsman of the Sun out of compassion for living beingsSuffering the origin of suffering the overcoming of suffering and the noble eightfold path leading to the allaying of sufferingThus these things thus spoken of have been seen by me as they really areThe true goal has been reached by me the Awakened Ones instruction has been doneIt was good indeed for me my coming into the presence of the Awakened OneAmong things shared out I obtained the bestI have attained the perfection of the direct knowledges I have purified the element of hearing I have the threefold knowledge and obtained supernormal powers and am skilled in knowing the minds of othersI ask the teacher of superior wisdom one who in this very life is the cutteroff of doubts The monk well known and famous who has died at Aggalava was he completely quenched in mindNigrodhakappa was the name given to that brahmin by you Fortunate OneLooking for release strenuously energetic he went about revering you O seer of the secure stateSakka Allseeing One we all wish to know concerning that discipleOur ears are ready to hearYou are the teacher you are unsurpassedSever our doubtTell me this you of extensive wisdom that he experienced quenchingSpeak in our very midst Allseeing One like the thousandeyed Sakka in the midst of the godsWhatever bonds exist here ways of delusion on the side of ignorance bases for doubt they no longer exist on reaching the Tathagata for that vision of his is supreme among menIf no man were ever to disperse the defilements as the wind disperses a mass of clouds the whole world enveloped would surely be darkness and even illustrious men would not shine forthBut the wise are lightmakersO Wise One I think you are just such a oneWe have come upon him who knows and is gifted with insightMake evident to us within the companies the fate of KappaQuickly enunciate your beautiful utterance O beautiful oneLike a goose stretching forth honk gently with your melodious and wellmodulated voice we are all listening to you attentivelyPressing the one who has completely abandoned birth and death I shall urge the purified one to speak DhammaFor among outsiders there is no acting as they wish but among Tathagatas there is acting with discretionThis full explanation of yours one with upright wisdom is well learntThis last salutation is proferredYou of superior wisdom knowing do not keep us in ignoranceHaving known the noble Dhamma in its full extent you of superior energy knowing do not keep us in ignoranceI long for your word as one overcome by heat in the hot season longs for waterRain down on our earsSurely the purpose for which Kappayana practiced the holy life was not in vainWas he quenched or had he a residue remainingLet us hear in what way he was releasedHe cut off craving here for mindandmateriality said the Fortunate One the stream of craving which for a long time had lain latent within himHe has crossed beyond birth and death completely So spoke the Fortunate One the foremost of the fiveOn hearing your word O best of seers I believeMy question was truly not in vain the brahmin did not deceive meAs he spoke so he actedHe was a disciple of the Awakened OneHe cut through the strong spreadout net of Death the deceiverKappiya saw the starting point of grasping O Fortunate OneKappayana has certainly gone beyond the realm of Death so difficult to crossI pay homage to you the god of gods and to your son O best of bipeds to the great hero born in your tracks a naga a true son of the nagaTo him who is free from craving who has seen the root I have come with a question for what reason did sages warriors brahmanas and other men prepare here in this world various sacrificial gifts for the godsI ask the Lord this let him tell me the answerWhatever sages warriors brahmanas and other men Punnaka prepared various sacrificial gifts for the gods they did so in the hope of this or that existence being induced by old age and decayBy preparing various sacrificial gifts for the gods being zealous in sacrificing do they cross beyond birth and decay LordThey hope and extol pray and sacrifice for things of the senses PunnakaFor the sake of such reward they prayThese devotees of sacrifice infatuated by their passion for existence do not cross beyond birth and decay I sayIf these devotees of sacrifice do not cross beyond birth and decay through sacrifice Sir then by what practice does one cross beyond birth and decay in this world of gods and menHe who has comprehended in the world the here and the beyond in whom there is no perturbation by anything in the world who is calm free from the smoldering fires untroubled and desireless  he has crossed beyond birth and decay I sayBy what is the world envelopedBecause of what is it not knownWith what do you say it is soiledWhat is its great fearThe world is enveloped by ignorance AjitaBecause of wrongly directed desire and heedlessness it is not knownIt is soiled by longings and its great fear is sufferingEverywhere flow the streamsWhat is the obstruction for the streams tell me the restricting of them by what are they cut offWhatever streams are in the world it is mindfulness that obstructs them and restricts them and by wisdom they are cut offIt is just wisdom and mindfulnessNow mindandbody sir explain this where does it ceaseThis question you have asked Ajita I will answer for you where mindandbody completely ceaseBy the cessation of consciousness they ceaseThose who have fully understood the Dhamma those who are training and the other individuals here explain their conductNot craving for sensual pleasures and with a mind that is pure and tranquil a bhikkhu should mindfully go forth skillful in all situationsViolence breeds misery look at people quarrelingI will relate the emotion agitating meHaving seen people struggling and contending with each other like fish in a small amount of water fear entered meThe world is everywhere insecure every direction is in turmoil desiring an abode for myself I did not find one uninhabitedWhen I saw contention as the sole outcome aversion increased in me but then I saw an arrow here difficult to see set in the heartPierced by it one runs in every direction but having pulled it out one does not run nor does one sinkHere follows the trainingWhatever are worldly fetters may you not be bound by themCompletely break down sensual desires and practice so as to realize Nibbana for yourselfA sage should be truthful not arrogant not deceitful not given to slandering others and should be without angerHe should remove the evil of attachment and wrongly directed longing he should conquer drowsiness lassitude and sloth and not dwell in indolenceA man whose mind is set on Nibbana should not be arrogantHe should not lapse into untruth nor generate love for sense objectsHe should thoroughly understand conceit and abstain from violenceHe should not delight in what is past nor be fond of what is new nor sorrow for what is disappearing nor crave for the attractiveGreed I say is a great flood it is a whirlpool sucking one down a constant yearning seeking a hold continually in movement difficult to cross is the morass of sensual desireA sage does not deviate from truth a brahmana stands on firm ground renouncing all he is truly called calmedHaving actually experienced and understood the Dhamma he has realized the highest knowledge and is independentHe comports himself correctly in the world and does not envy anyone hereHe who has left behind sensual pleasures an attachment difficult to leave behind does not grieve nor have any longing has cut across the stream and is unfetteredDry out that which is past let there be nothing for you in the futureIf you do not grasp at anything in the present you will go about at peaceOne who in regard to this entire mindbody complex has no cherishing of it as mine and who does not grieve for what is nonexistent truly suffers no loss in the worldFor him there is no thought of anything as this is mine or this is anothers not finding any state of ownership and realizing nothing is mine he does not grieveTo be not callous not greedy at rest and unruffled by circumstances  that is the profitable result I proclaim when asked about one who does not waverFor one who does not crave who has understanding there is no productionRefraining from initiating he sees security everywhereA sage does not speak in terms of being equal lower or higherCalmed and without selfishness he neither grasps nor rejectsA person who associates himself with certain views considering them as best and making them supreme in the world he says because of that that all other views are inferior therefore he is not free from contentionIn what is seen heard cognized and in ritual observances performed he sees a profit for himselfJust by laying hold of that view he regards every other view as worthlessThose skilled say that a bond if relying on it one regards everything else as inferiorTherefore a bhikkhu should not depend on what is seen heard or cognized nor upon ritual observancesHe should not present himself as equal to nor imagine himself to be inferior nor better than anotherAbandoning he had held and not taking up he does not seek a support even in knowledgeAmong those who dispute he is certainly not one to take sidesHe does not recourse to a view at allIn whom there is no inclination to either extreme for becoming or nonbecoming here or in another existence for him there does not exist a fixed viewpoint on investigating the doctrines assumedConcerning the seen the heard and the cognized he does not form the least notionThat brahmana who does not grasp at a view with what could he be identified in the worldThey do not speculate nor pursue doctrines are not accepted by themA brahmana is beyond does not fall back on viewsFrom what arise contentions and disputes lamentations and sorrows along with selfishness and conceit and arrogance along with slanderFrom where do these various things ariseCome tell me thisFrom being too endeared arise contentions and disputes lamentations and sorrows along with avarice selfishness and conceit arrogance and slanderContentions and disputes are linked with selfishness and slander is born of contentionWhat are the sources of becoming endeared in the worldWhat are the sources of whatever passions prevail in the world of longings and fulfillments that are mans goalDesires are the source of becoming endeared in the world also of whatever passions prevailThese are the sources of longings and fulfillments that are mans goalNow what is the source of desire in the worldWhat is the cause of judgments that arise of anger untruth doubts and whatever other states that have been spoken of by the RecluseIt is pleasant it is unpleasant so people speak in the world and based upon that arises desireHaving seen the appearing and disappearing of material things a man makes his judgments in the worldAnger untruth and doubts these states arise merely because of the existence of this dualityLet a doubter train himself by way of insight to understand these states as taught by the RecluseWhat is the source of thinking things as pleasant or unpleasantWhen what is absent are these states not presentWhat is the meaning of appearing and disappearingExplain the source of it to meThe pleasant and the unpleasant have their source in senseimpressionWhen this senseimpression is absent these states are not presentThe idea of appearing and disappearing is produced from this I sayWhat is the source of senseimpressionFrom what arises so much graspingBy the absence of what is there no selfish attachmentBy the disappearance of what is senseimpression not experiencedSenseimpression is dependent upon the mental and the materialGrasping has its source in wantingWhat not being present there is no selfish attachmentBy the disappearance of material objects senseimpression is not experiencedFor whom does materiality disappearHow do pleasure and discomfort cease to beTell me how it ceases so that I may be satisfied in my mind that I have understood itHis perception is not the ordinary kind nor is his perception abnormal he is not without perception nor is his perception suspended to such an one immateriality ceasesPerception is indeed the source of the world of multiplicityWhat we asked you have explainedWe now ask another questionTell us the answer to itDo not some of the learned declare purification of the spirit as the highest state to be attainedAnd do not others speak of something else as the highestSome of the learned do declare purification of the spirit as the highestBut contrary to them some teach a doctrine of annihilationThose clever ones declare this to be without basis of lifes fuel remainingKnowing that these rely on a sage investigates that upon which they relyHaving understood and being free he will not dispute with anyoneThe wise do not enter into any existenceShort indeed is this life this side of a hundred years one dies whoever lives long even he dies from old agePeople grieve for things they are attached to yet there exist no permanent possessions but just a state of separationSeeing this one should no longer live the household lifeThat which a man imagines to be his will disappear at deathKnowing this a wise man will have no attachmentAs a man awakened from sleep no longer sees what happened in his dream similarly one does not see a loved one who is deadThose people who were seen and heard and called by their names as such and such only their names remain when they have passed awayThose greedy for objects of attachment do not abandon sorrow grief and avarice but sages having got rid of possessions live perceiving securityFor a bhikkhu with a detached mind living in a secluded dwelling it is right they say that he no longer shows himself in the abodesA sage who is completely independent does not make close friends or enemiesIn him sorrow and selfishness do not stay like water on a lotus leafAs a lotus is not wetted by water so a sage is not affected by what is seen or heard nor by what is perceived by the other sensesA wise man is not deluded by what is perceived by the sensesHe does not expect purity by any other wayHe is neither pleased nor is he repelledHere I see one who is pure entirely free of sicknessBy seeing him a man may attain to purityConvinced of that and thinking it the highest he believes it to be knowledge when he contemplates the pure one But if by sights man can gain purification or if through such knowledge he could leave suffering behind then one who still has attachments could be purified by anotherHowever this is merely the opinion of those who so assertThe brahmana has said one is not purified by another nor by what is seen heard or perceived nor by the performance of ritual observancesHe is not defiled by merit or demeritHaving given up what he had grasped at he no longer engages in producingHaving left a former they attach themselves to another dominated by craving they do not go beyond attachmentThey reject and seize like a monkey letting go of a branch to take hold of anotherA person having undertaken a ritual act goes this way and that fettered by his sensesBut one with a wide wisdom having understood and gone into the Dhamma with his experience does not go this way and thatFor a person indifferent towards all conditions whatever is seen heard or cognized he is one who sees it as it really is and lives with clarityWith what could he be identified in the worldThey do not speculate nor pursue they do not claim perfect purityLoosening the knot with which they are bound they do not have longing anywhere in the worldThe brahmana who has gone beyond limitations having understood and seen there is no longer any assumption for him he is neither disturbed by lust nor agitated by revulsionFor him there is nothing upheld as the highestSee how the world together with the devas has selfconceit for what is notselfEnclosed by mindandbody it imagines This is real Whatever they imagine it to be it is quite different from thatIt is unreal of a false nature and perishableNibbana not false in nature that the Noble Ones know as trueIndeed by the penetration of the true they are completely stilled and realize final deliveranceForms sounds tastes scents bodily contacts and ideas which are agreeable pleasant and charming all these while they last are deemed to be happiness by the world with its devasBut when they cease that is agreed by all to be unsatisfactoryBy the Noble Ones the cessation of the existing body is seen as happinessThis is the reverse of the outlook of the whole worldWhat others call happiness that the Noble Ones declare to be sufferingWhat others call suffering that the Noble Ones have found to be happinessSee how difficult it is to understand the DhammaHerein those without insight have completely gone astrayFor those under the veil it is obscured for those who cannot see it is utter darknessBut for the good and the wise it is as obvious as the light for those who can seeEven though close to it the witless who do not know the Dhamma do not comprehend itBy those overcome by attachment to existence those who drift with the stream of existence those in the realm of Mara this Dhamma is not properly understoodWho other than the Noble Ones are fit to fully understand that state by perfect knowledge of which they realize final deliverance free from defilementsUnindicated and unknown is the length of life of those subject to deathLife is difficult and brief and bound up with sufferingThere is no means by which those who are born will not dieHaving reached old age there is deathThis is the natural course for a living beingWith ripe fruits there is the constant danger that they will fallIn the same way for those born and subject to death there is always the fear of dyingJust as the pots made by a potter all end by being broken so death is of lifeThe young and old the foolish and the wise all are stopped short by the power of death all finally end in deathOf those overcome by death and passing to another world a father cannot hold back his son nor relatives a relationSeeWhile the relatives are looking on and weeping one by one each mortal is led away like an ox to slaughterIn this manner the world is afflicted by death and decayBut the wise do not grieve having realized the nature of the worldYou do not know the path by which they came or departedNot seeing either end you lament in vainIf any benefit is gained by lamenting the wise would do itOnly a fool would harm himselfYet through weeping and sorrowing the mind does not become calm but still more suffering is produced the body is harmed and one becomes lean and pale one merely hurts oneselfOne cannot protect a departed one by that meansTo grieve is in vainBy not abandoning sorrow a being simply undergoes more sufferingBewailing the dead he comes under the sway of sorrowSee other men faring according to their deedsHence beings tremble here with fear when they come into the power of deathWhatever they imagine it quite different from thatThis is the sort of disappointment that existsLook at the nature of the worldIf a man lives for a hundred years or even more finally he is separated from his circle of relatives and gives up his life in the endTherefore having listened to the arahant one should give up lamentingSeeing a dead body one should know He will not be met by me again As the fire in a burning house is extinguished with water so a wise discriminating learned and sensible man should quickly drive away the sorrow that arises as the wind a piece of cottonHe who seeks happiness should withdraw the arrow his own lamentations longings and griefWith the arrow withdrawn unattached he would attain to peace of mind and when all sorrow has been transcended he is sorrowfree and has realized NibbanaWhen near the river Nerañjara I exerted myself in meditation for attaining to security from bondage there came Namuci speaking words of compassionYou are emaciated and illlooking you are near to deathA thousand parts of you belong to death and only a fraction of you is aliveLive good SirIt is better to liveLiving you may perform meritorious deedsFrom practicing celibacy and tending the sacrificial fire much merit is made but what is obtained from strivingIt is difficult to enter the path of exertion it is difficult to do difficult to maintain Mara spoke these words whilst standing in the presence of the Awakened OneTo Mara speaking thus the Lord repliedYou who are the friend of the negligent O Evil One for what reason have you come hereThose who still have use for merit Mara may consider worthwhile addressingI have faith and energy and wisdomBeing thus bent on striving why do you ask me to liveThis wind will wither the currents of the rivers why should not my exertion dry up even the bloodWhen the blood dries up the bile and phlegm witherOn the wasting away of the flesh the mind becomes more and more serene and my mindfulness wisdom and concentration are established more firmlyIn me who abides enduring such an extreme experience the mind does not long for sensual pleasuresSee the purity of a beingSensual desire is your first army the second is called discontent the third is hunger and thirst the fourth craving the fifth sluggishness and laziness the sixth fear the seventh indecision and the eighth disparagement of others and stubbornness gain fame honor prestige wrongly acquired and whoever praises himself and despises others  these Namuci are your armies the Dark Ones striking forcesA lazy cowardly person cannot overcome them but by conquering them one gains blissI wear muñjagrassShame on life here in this worldIt is better for me to die in battle than to live defeatedSome recluses and brahmanas are not seen here so immersed are theyThey are not aware of that path by which those of perfect conduct walkSeeing the surrounding army ready and Mara mounted I am going out to fight so that he may not shift me from my positionThis army of yours which the world together with the devas is unable to subdue that I will destroy with wisdom like an unbaked claybowl with a stoneHaving mastered the mind and firmly established mindfulness I shall wander from country to country guiding many disciplesAnd they will be diligent and energetic in practicing my teaching the teaching of one without sensual desire and they will go where having gone one does not grieveMara For seven years I followed the Lord step by step but did not find an opportunity to defeat that mindful Awakened OneA crow flew around a stone having the color of fat Can we find even here something tenderMay it be something to eatNot finding anything edible the crow left that placeAs with the crow and the stone we leave Gotama having approached and become disheartenedOvercome by sorrow his lute fell from his arm and thereupon the unhappy spirit disappeared from that placeThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Grove at Anathapindikas monasteryNow the layfollower Dhammika with five hundred other layfollowers approached the LordHaving drawn near and having saluted the Lord respectfully he sat down at one sideSitting there the layfollower Dhammika addressed the Lord as followsI ask Gotama of extensive wisdom this How acting is a disciple virtuous  both the disciple who has gone from home to the homeless state and the followers who are householdersFor you clearly understand the behavior of the world with the devas and the final releaseThere is none equal to you who are skilled in seeing what is profoundYou are an illustrious Awakened OneHaving investigated all knowledge and being compassionate towards beings you have announced the Dhamma a revealer of what is hidden of comprehensive vision stainless you illuminate all the worldsThis Dhamma subtle and pleasing and taught so clearly by you Lord it is this we all wish to hearHaving been questioned foremost Awakened One tell usAll these bhikkhus and also the layfollowers who have come to hear the truth let them listen to the Dhamma awakened to by the Stainless One as the devas listen to the wellspoken words of Vasava Listen to me bhikkhus I will teach you the ascetic practice the mode of living suitable for those who have gone forthDo you all bear it in mindOne who is intent upon what is good and who is thoughtful should practice itA bhikkhu should not wander about at the wrong time but should walk the village for food at the right time as one who goes about at the wrong time is obsessed by attachment therefore Awakened Ones do not walk at the wrong timeSights sounds tastes scents and bodily contacts overwhelm beingsBeing rid of desire for these sense objects at the right time one may enter for the morning mealHaving duly obtained food going back alone and sitting down in a secluded place being inwardly thoughtful and not letting the mind go out to external objects a bhikkhu should develop selfcontrolIf he should speak with a laydisciple with someone else or with another bhikkhu he should speak on the subtle Dhamma not slandering others nor gossipingSome set themselves up as disputants in opposition to others those of little wisdom we do not praise attachments bind them and they are carried away by their emotionsHaving heard the Dhamma taught by the Sugata and considered it a disciple of Him of excellent wisdom should wisely make use of food a dwelling a bed a seat and water for washing the robeBut a bhikkhu should not be soiled by these things as a lotus is not wetted by a drop of waterNow I will tell you the laymans dutyFollowing it a laydisciple would be virtuous for it is not possible for one occupied with the household life to realize the complete bhikkhu practiceHe should not kill a living being nor cause it to be killed nor should he incite another to killDo not injure any being either strong or weak in the worldA disciple should avoid taking anything from anywhere knowing itHe should not steal nor incite another to stealHe should completely avoid theftA wise man should avoid unchastity as a pit of glowing charcoalIf unable to lead a celibate life he should not go to anothers wifeHaving entered a royal court or a company of people he should not speak liesHe should not speak lies nor incite others to do soHe should completely avoid falsehoodA layman who has chosen to practice this Dhamma should not indulge in the drinking of intoxicantsHe should not drink them nor encourage others to do so realizing that it leads to madnessThrough intoxication foolish people perform evil deeds and cause other heedless people to do likewiseHe should avoid intoxication this occasion for demerit which stupefies the mind and is the pleasure of foolish peopleThis is called the eightfactored observance made known by the Awakened One who has reached the end of sufferingWith a gladdened mind observe the observance day complete with its eight factors on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth days of the fortnight and also the special holiday of the half monthIn the morning with a pure heart and a joyful mind a wise man after observing the uposatha should distribute suitable food and drink to the community of bhikkhusHe should support his mother and father as his duty and engage in lawful tradingA layman who carries this out diligently goes to the devas called Selfradiant Rouse yourselfSit upWhat good is there in sleepingFor those afflicted by disease struck by the arrow what sleep is thereRouse yourselfSit upResolutely train yourself to attain peaceDo not let the king of death seeing you are careless lead you astray and dominate youGo beyond this clinging to which devas and men are attached and they seekDo not waste your opportunityWhen the opportunity has passed they sorrow when consigned to NirayahellNegligence is a taint and so is the negligence growing from itBy earnestness and understanding withdraw the arrowBy developing what habit what conduct what actions may man be correctly established in and arrive at the highest goalHe should respect his elders and not be envious of themHe should know the right time for seeing his teacherIf a talk on Dhamma has started he should know the value of the opportunity and should listen carefully to the wellspoken wordsWhen the time is right let him go to his teachers presence unassuming putting aside stubbornnessLet him keep in mind and practice the meaning and the text selfcontrol and the Holy LifeDelighting in the Dhamma devoted to the Dhamma established in the Dhamma skilled in investigating the Dhamma let him not indulge in talk harmful to the DhammaLet him be guided by wellspoken truthsAbandoning the uttering of laughter and lamentations giving up anger fraud hypocrisy longing conceit violence harshness moral taints and infatuation let him live without pride self controlledUnderstanding is essential to a wellspoken wordLearning and understanding are essential to meditation but a man who is hasty and heedless does not increase his wisdom and learningThose who are devoted to the Dhamma made known by the Noble Ones are unsurpassed in speech thought and actionThey are established in peace gentleness and concentration and have reached the essence of learning and wisdomHe from whom a person learns the Dhamma should be venerated as the devas venerate Inda their LordHe of great learning thus venerated will explain the Dhamma being welldisposed towards oneHaving paid attention and considered it a wise man practicing according to Dhamma becomes learned intelligent and accomplished by associating himself diligently with such a teacherBut by following an inferior and foolish teacher who has not gained understanding of the Dhamma and is envious of others one will approach death without comprehending the Dhamma and unrelieved of doubtIf a man going down into a river swollen and swiftly flowing is carried away by the current  how can he help others acrossEven so he who has not comprehended the Dhamma has not paid attention to the meaning as expounded by the learned being himself without knowledge and unrelieved of doubt  how can he make others understandBut if knows the method and is skilled and wise by boarding a strong boat equipped with oars and a rudder he can with its help set others acrossEven so he who is experienced and has a welltrained mind who is learned and dependable clearly knowing he can help others to understand who are willing to listen and ready to receiveSurely therefore one should associate with a good man who is wise and learnedBy understanding the meaning of what one has learned and practicing accordingly one who has Dhammaexperience attains happiness A quarrelsome bhikkhu shrouded by delusion does not comprehend the Dhamma taught by the Awakened One when it is revealedAnnoying those practiced in meditation being led by ignorance he is not aware that his defiled path leads to NirayahellFalling headlong passing from womb to womb from darkness to darkness such a bhikkhu undergoes suffering hereafter for certainAs a cesspool filled over a number of years is difficult to clean similarly whoever is full of impurity is difficult to make pureWhoever you know to be such bhikkhus bent on worldliness having wrong desires wrong thoughts wrong behavior and resort being completely united avoid him sweep him out like dirt remove him like rubbishWinnow like chaff the nonreclusesHaving ejected those of wrong desires of wrong behavior and resort be pure and mindful dwelling with those who are pureBeing united and prudent you will make an end to sufferingOne who overstepping and despising a sense of shame says I am your friend but does not take upon himself any tasks he is capable of doing is to be recognized as no friendOne who speaks amiably to his companions but whose actions do not conform to it him the wise know for certain as a talker not a doerHe is no friend who anticipating conflict is always alert in looking out for weaknessesBut he on whom one can rely like a child sleeping on its mothers breast is truly a friend who cannot be parted from one by othersOne who bears the human burden of responsibility with its fruits and blessings in mind he cultivates a cause of joy and happiness worthy of praiseHaving tasted the flavor of solitude and peace one is free from fear and wrongdoings imbibing the rapture of DhammaThis was said by the LordLiving with Brahma are those families where within the home mother and father are respected by their childrenLiving with the early devas are those families where within the home mother and father are respected by their childrenLiving with the early teachers are those families where within the home mother and father are respected by their childrenLiving with those worthy of adoration are those families where within the home mother and father are respected by their childrenBrahma bhikkhus is a term for mother and fatherEarly devas and early teachers and those worthy of veneration are terms for mother and fatherFor what reasonBecause mother and father are very helpful to their children they take care of them and bring them up and teach them about the worldThis was said by the LordSuppose bhikkhus a man was being borne along by the current of a river that seemed pleasant and agreeableBut upon seeing him a keensighted man standing on the bank would call out to him Hey good manAlthough you are being borne along by the current of a river that seems pleasant and agreeable lower down there is a pool with turbulent waves and swirling eddies with monsters and demonsOn reaching that pool you will die or suffer close to death Then bhikkhus upon hearing the words of that person that man would struggle against the current with hands and feetI have made use of this simile bhikkhus to illustrate the meaningAnd this is the meaning here The current of the river is a synonym for cravingSeeming pleasant and agreeable is a synonym for the six internal sensebasesThe pool lower down is a synonym for the five lower fettersTurbulent waves is a synonym for anger and frustrationSwirling eddies is a synonym for the five strands of sensual pleasureMonsters and demons is a synonym for womenfolkAgainst the current is a synonym for renunciationStruggling with hands and feet is a synonym for instigating energyThe keensighted man standing on the bank is a synonym for the Tathagata the Arahant the Fully Enlightened OneThis was said by the Lord said by the Arahant so I heardBhikkhus the world has been fully understood by the Tathagata the Tathagata is released from the worldThe origin of the world has been fully understood by the Tathagata the origin of the world has been abandoned by the TathagataThe cessation of the world has been fully understood by the Tathagata the cessation of the world has been realized by the TathagataThe course leading to the cessation of the world has been fully understood by the Tathagata the course leading to the cessation of the world has been developed by the TathagataBhikkhus in the world with its devas maras and brahmas with its recluses and brahmans among humankind with its princes and people whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought and reflected upon by the mind  that is fully understood by the Tathagata therefore he is called the TathagataBhikkhus from the night when the Tathagata awakened to unsurpassed full enlightenment until the night when he passes away into the Nibbanaelement with no residue left whatever he speaks utters and explains  all that is just so and not otherwise therefore he is called the TathagataAs the Tathagata says so he does as the Tathagata does so he says therefore he is called the TathagataIn the world with its devas maras and brahmas with its recluses and brahmans among humankind with its princes and people the Tathagata is the conqueror unvanquished allseer wielding power therefore he is called the TathagataThis too is the meaning of what was said by the Lord so I heardThis was said by the LordBhikkhus these two bright principles protect the worldWhat are the twoShame and fear of wrongdoingIf bhikkhus these two bright principles did not protect the world there would not be discerned respect for mother or maternal aunt or maternal uncles wife or a teachers wife or the wives of other honored persons and the world would have fallen into promiscuity as with goats sheep chickens pigs dogs and jackalsBut as these two bright principles protect the world there is discerned respect for mother and the wives of other honored personsThis was said by the LordThere is bhikkhus a notborn a notbroughttobeing a notmade a notconditionedIf bhikkhus there were no notborn notbroughttobeing notmade notconditioned no escape would be discerned from what is born broughttobeing made conditionedBut since there is a notborn a notbroughttobeing a notmade a notconditioned therefore an escape is discerned from what is born broughttobeing made conditionedThis was said by the LordBhikkhus there are these two NibbanaelementsWhat are the twoThe Nibbanaelement with residue left and the Nibbanaelement with no residue leftWhat bhikkhus is the Nibbanaelement with residue leftHere a bhikkhu is an arahant one whose taints are destroyed the holy life fulfilled who has done what had to be done laid down the burden attained the goal destroyed the fetters of being completely released through final knowledgeHowever his five sense faculties remain unimpaired by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable and feels pleasure and painIt is the extinction of attachment hate and delusion in him that is called the Nibbanaelement with residue leftNow what bhikkhus is the Nibbanaelement with no residue leftHere a bhikkhu is an arahant completely released through final knowledgeFor him here in this very life all that is experienced not being delighted in will be extinguishedThat bhikkhus is called the Nibbanaelement with no residue leftThese bhikkhus are the two NibbanaelementsThis was said by the LordAnd how bhikkhus do some hold backDevas and humans enjoy being delight in being are satisfied with beingWhen Dhamma is taught to them for the cessation of being their minds do not enter into it or acquire confidence in it or settle upon it or become resolved upon itThus bhikkhus do some hold backHow bhikkhus do some overreachNow some are troubled ashamed and disgusted by this very same being and they rejoice in nonbeing asserting In as much as this self good sirs when the body perishes at death is annihilated and destroyed and does not exist after death  this is peaceful this is excellent this is reality Thus bhikkhus do some overreachHow bhikkhus do those with vision seeHerein a bhikkhu sees what has come to be as having come to beHaving seen it thus he practices the course for turning away for dispassion for the cessation of what has come to beThus bhikkhus do those with vision seeThis too is the meaning of what was said by the Lord so I heardThis was said by the LordBhikkhus the skeletons of a single person running on and wandering in samsara for an aeon would make a heap of bones a quantity of bones as large as this Mount Vepulla if there were someone to collect them and if the collection were not destroyedThis was said by the LordBhikkhus I say that for an individual who transgresses in one thing there is no evil deed whatsoever he would not doWhat is that one thingIt is this bhikkhus deliberately telling a lieThis was said by the LordBhikkhus if beings knew as I know the result of giving and sharing they would not eat without having given nor would they allow the stain of meanness to obsess them and take root in their mindsEven if it were their last morsel their last mouthful they would not eat without having shared it if there were someone to share it withBut bhikkhus as beings do not know as I know the result of giving and sharing they eat without having given and the stain of meanness obsesses them and takes root in their mindsThis was said by the LordBhikkhus whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mindrelease of lovingkindnessThe mindrelease of lovingkindness surpasses them and shines forth bright and brilliantJust as the radiance of all the stars does not equal a sixteenth part of the moons radiance but the moons radiance surpasses them and shines forth bright and brilliant even so whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mindrelease of lovingkindnessJust as in the last month of the rainy season in the autumn when the sky is clear and free of clouds the sun on ascending dispels the darkness of space and shines forth bright and brilliant even so whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mindrelease of lovingkindnessAnd just as in the night at the moment of dawn the morning star shines forth bright and brilliant even so whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mindrelease of lovingkindnessThe mindrelease of lovingkindness surpasses them and shines forth bright and brilliantThis too is the meaning of what was said by the Lord so I heardThis was said by the LordBhikkhus there are these three elements of escapeWhat threeThe escape from sensual desires that is renunciation the escape from form that is the formless and the escape from whatever has come to be from whatever is conditioned and dependently arisen that is cessationThese bhikkhus are the three elements of escapeThis was said by the LordBhikkhus these three kinds of persons are found existing in the worldWhat threeOne who is like a rainless cloud one who rains locally and one who rains everywhereNow what kind of person bhikkhus is like a rainless cloudHere a certain person is not a giver to anyone he does not give food drink clothing vehicles garlands scents ointments beds lodging and lamps to recluses and brahmans to the poor destitute and needyThis kind of person is like a rainless cloudNow what bhikkhus is the kind of person who rains locallyHere a certain person is a giver to some but not a giver to othersFood drink clothing vehicles garlands scents ointments beds lodging and lamps he gives only to some recluses and brahmans to some of the poor

the time when a noble disciple lives engaged in cultivating the seven groups of the requisites of enlightenment at that time among the devas the joyous utterance is proclaimed A noble disciple is doing battle with Mara This is the second joyous utterance proclaimed among the devas from time to time upon a certain occasionAnd again bhikkhus at the time when a noble disciple through realization by his own direct knowledge here and now enters and abides in the mindrelease and wisdomrelease that is taintless by the destruction of the taints at that time among the devas the joyous utterance is proclaimed A noble disciple has won the battleHe was in the forefront of the fight and he now dwells victorious This bhikkhus is the third joyous utterance proclaimed among the devas from time to time

of births and attained to the perfection of insight the sage who has reached the summit of spiritual excellence  him do I call a holy manThe craving of one given to heedless living grows like a creeperLike the monkey seeking fruits in the forest he leaps from life to lifeWhoever is overcome by this wretched and sticky craving his sorrows grow like grass after the rainsBut whoever overcomes this wretched craving so difficult to overcome from him sorrows fall away like water from a lotus leafThis I say to you Good luck to all assembled hereDig up the root of craving like one in search of the fragrant root of the birana grassLet not Mara crush you again and again as a flood crushes a reedJust as a tree though cut down sprouts up again if its roots remain uncut and firm even so until the craving that lies dormant is rooted out suffering springs up again and againThe misguided man in whom the thirtysix currents of craving strongly rush toward pleasurable objects is swept away by the flood of his passionate thoughtsEverywhere these currents flow and the creeper sprouts and growsSeeing that the creeper has sprung up cut off its root with wisdomFlowing in and watered by craving feelings of pleasure arise in beingsBent on pleasures and seeking enjoyment these men fall prey to birth and decayBeset by craving people run about like an entrapped hareHeld fast by mental fetters they come to suffering again and again for a long timeBeset by craving people run about like an entrapped hareTherefore one who yearns to be passionfree should destroy his own cravingThere is one who turning away from desire takes to the life of the forestBut after being freed from the household he runs back to itBehold that manThough freed he runs back to that very bondageThat is not a strong fetter the wise say which is made of iron wood or hempBut the infatuation and longing for jewels and ornaments children and wives  that they say is a far stronger fetter which pulls one downward and though seemingly loose is hard to removeThis too the wise cut offGiving up sensual pleasure and without any longing they renounce the worldThose who are lustinfatuated fall back into the swirling current like a spider on its selfspun webThis too the wise cut offWithout any longing they abandon all suffering and renounce the worldLet go of the past let go of the future let go of the present and cross over to the farther shore of existenceWith mind wholly liberated you shall come no more to birth and deathFor a person tormented by evil thoughts who is passiondominated and given to the pursuit of pleasure his craving steadily growsHe makes the fetter strong indeedHe who delights in subduing evil thoughts who meditates on the impurities and is ever mindful  it is he who will make an end of craving and rend asunder Maras fetterHe who has reached the goal is fearless free from craving passionless and has plucked out the thorns of existence  for him this is the last bodyHe who is free from craving and attachment is perfect in uncovering the true meaning of the Teaching and knows the arrangement of the sacred texts in correct sequence  he indeed is the bearer of his final bodyHe is truly called the profoundly wise one the great manA victor am I over all all have I knownYet unattached am I to all that is conquered and knownAbandoning all I am freed through the destruction of cravingHaving thus directly comprehended all by myself whom shall I call my teacherThe gift of Dhamma excels all gifts the taste of the Dhamma excels all tastes the delight in Dhamma excels all delightsThe CravingFreed vanquishes all sufferingRiches ruin only the foolish not those in quest of the BeyondBy craving for riches the witless man ruins himself as well as othersWeeds are the bane of fields lust is the bane of mankindTherefore what is offered to those free of lust yields abundant fruitWeeds are the bane of fields hatred is the bane of mankindTherefore what is offered to those free of hatred yields abundant fruitWeeds are the bane of fields delusion is the bane of mankindTherefore what is offered to those free of delusion yields abundant fruitWeeds are the bane of fields desire is the bane of mankindTherefore what is offered to those free of desire yields abundant fruitAs an elephant in the battlefield withstands arrows shot from bows all around even so shall I endure abuseThere are many indeed who lack virtueA tamed elephant is led into a crowd and the king mounts a tamed elephantBest among men is the subdued one who endures abuseExcellent are welltrained mules thoroughbred Sindhu horses and noble tusker elephantsBut better still is the man who has subdued himselfNot by these mounts however would one go to the Untrodden Land as one who is selftamed goes by his own tamed and wellcontrolled mindMusty during rut the tusker named Dhanapalaka is uncontrollableHeld in captivity the tusker does not touch a morsel but only longingly calls to mind the elephant forestWhen a man is sluggish and gluttonous sleeping and rolling around in bed like a fat domestic pig that sluggard undergoes rebirth again and againFormerly this mind wandered about as it liked where it wished and according to its pleasure but now I shall thoroughly master it with wisdom as a mahout controls with his ankus an elephant in rutDelight in heedfulnessGuard well your thoughtsDraw yourself out of this bog of evil even as an elephant draws himself out of the mudIf for company you find a wise and prudent friend who leads a good life you should overcoming all impediments keep his company joyously and mindfullyIf for company you cannot find a wise and prudent friend who leads a good life then like a king who leaves behind a conquered kingdom or like a lone elephant in the elephant forest you should go your way aloneBetter it is to live alone there is no fellowship with a foolLive alone and do no evil be carefree like an elephant in the elephant forestGood are friends when need arises good is contentment with just what one has good is merit when life is at an end and good is the abandoning of all sufferingIn this world good it is to serve ones mother good it is to serve ones father good it is to serve the monks and good it is to serve the holy menGood is virtue until lifes end good is faith that is steadfast good is the acquisition of wisdom and good is the avoidance of evilIf by renouncing a lesser happiness one may realize a greater happiness let the wise man renounce the lesser having regard for the greaterEntangled by the bonds of hate he who seeks his own happiness by inflicting pain on others is never delivered from hatredThe cankers only increase for those who are arrogant and heedless who leave undone what should be done and do what should not be doneThe cankers cease for those mindful and clearly comprehending ones who always earnestly practice mindfulness of the body who do not resort to what should not be done and steadfastly pursue what should be doneHaving slain mother father two warriorkings and destroyed a country together with its treasurer ungrieving goes the holy manHaving slain mother father two brahman kings and a tiger as the fifth ungrieving goes the holy manThose disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily who day and night constantly practice the Recollection of the Qualities of the BuddhaThose disciples of Gotama

a monk difficult is it to delight thereinAlso difficult and sorrowful is the household lifeSuffering comes from association with unequals suffering comes from wandering in samsaraTherefore be not an aimless wanderer be not a pursuer of sufferingHe who is full of faith and virtue and possesses good repute and wealth  he is respected everywhere in whatever land he travelsThe good shine from afar like the Himalaya mountainsBut the wicked are unseen like arrows shot in the nightHe who sits alone sleeps alone and walks alone who is strenuous and subdues himself alone will find delight in the solitude of the forestThe liar goes to the state of woe also he who having done says I did not do it Men of base actions both on departing they share the same destiny in the other worldThere are many evil characters and uncontrolled men wearing the saffron robeThese wicked men will be born in states of woe because of their evil deedsIt would be better to swallow a redhot iron ball blazing like fire than as an immoral and uncontrolled monk to eat the alms of the peopleFour misfortunes befall the reckless man who consorts with anothers wife acquisition of demerit disturbed sleep illrepute and states of woeSuch a man acquires demerit and an unhappy birth in the futureBrief is the pleasure of the frightened man and woman and the king imposes heavy punishmentHence let no man consort with

none of these bear much fruitIf anything is to be done let one do it with sustained vigorA lax monastic life stirs up the dust of passions all the moreAn evil deed is better left undone for such a

upholding right views they go to realms of blissTranslators note The setting seven weeks after the Buddhas enlightenmentawakening he goes to five former companions that he had previously practiced extreme asceticism withAfter trying asceticism he had given this up for a more moderate approach based on a healthy body and jhāna The following is seen as the first teaching he gave to anyoneIn other contexts the Buddha taught the Four True Realities for the Spiritually Ennobled Ones to people after first giving them a preparatory discourse to ensure they were in the right frame of mind be able to fully benefit from the teachingThen the Blessed One gave the householder Upāli a stepbystep discourse that is talk on giving talk on moral virtue talk on the heaven worlds he made known the danger the inferior nature of and tendency to defilement in sensepleasures and the advantage of renouncing themWhen the Blessed One knew that the householder Upālis mind was ready open without hindrances inspired and confident then he expounded to him the elevated Dhammateaching of the buddhas dukkha its origination its cessation the path The four true realities taught by the Buddha are not as such things to believe but to be open to see and contemplate and respond to appropriately by fully understanding dukkhapainthe painful abandoning that which originates it personally experiencing its cessation and cultivating the path that leads to thisThese four true realities are the four fundamental dimensions of experience as seen by a spiritually noble person with deep wisdom the conditioned world that which originates it the cessationtranscending of it and the path to thisIndeed it is by insight into these that a person becomes spiritually ennobledThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at IsipatanaThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five thus Bhikkhus these two extremes should not be followed by one gone forthWhat twoThat which is this pursuit of sensual happiness in sense pleasures which is low vulgar the way of the ordinary person ignoble not connected to the goal and that which is this pursuit of selfmortification which is painful ignoble not connected to the goalBhikkhus without veering towards either of these two extremes the One Attuned to Reality has awakened to the middle way which gives rise to vision which gives rise to knowledge which leads to peace to higher knowledge to full awakening to NibbānaAnd what bhikkhus is that middle way awakened to by the One Attuned to Reality which gives rise to vision which gives rise to knowledge which leads to peace to higher knowledge to full awakening to NibbānaIt is just this Noble Eightfactored Path that is to say right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right mental unificationThis bhikkhus is that middle way awakened to by the One Attuned to Reality which gives rise to vision which gives rise to knowledge which leads to peace to higher knowledge to full awakening to NibbānaNow this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality which is pain birth is painful aging is painful illness is painful death is painful sorrow lamentation physical pain unhappiness and distress are painful union with what is disliked is painful separation from what is liked is painful not to get what one wants is painful in brief the five bundles of graspingfuel are painfulNow this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painoriginating true realityIt is this craving which leads to renewed existence accompanied by delight and attachment seeking delight now here now there that is craving for sensepleasures craving for existence craving for exterminationNow this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painceasing true realityIt is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving the giving up and relinquishing of it freedom from it nonreliance on itNow this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality which is the way leading to the cessation of painIt is this Noble Eightfactored Path that is to say right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right mental unificationThis for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality of pain in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and lightNow on this This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality of pain  is to be fully understood in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and lightNow on this This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality of pain  has been fully understood in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light with respect to This for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painoriginating true reality This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painoriginating true reality  is to be abandoned and This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painoriginating true reality  has been abandoned in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light with respect to This for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painceasing true reality This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painceasing true reality  is to be personally experienced and This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painceasing true reality  has been personally experienced in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light with respect to This for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality which is the way leading to the cessation of pain This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality which is the way leading to the cessation of pain  is to be developed and This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality which is way leading to the cessation of pain  has been developedSo long bhikkhus as my knowledge and seeing of these four true realities for the spiritually ennobled ones as they really are in their three phases and twelve modes was not thoroughly purified in this way then so long in the world with its devas māras and brahmās in this population with its renunciants and brahmans its devas and humans I did not claim to be fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakeningBut when bhikkhus my knowledge and vision of these four true realities for the spiritually ennobled ones as they really are in their three phases and twelve modes was thoroughly purified in this way then in the world with its devas māras and brahmās in this population with its renunciants and brahmans its devas and humans I claimed to be fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakeningIndeed knowledge and seeing arose in me Unshakeable is the liberation of my mind this is my last birth now there is no more renewed existence This is what the Blessed One saidElated the bhikkhus of the group of five delighted in the Blessed Ones statementAnd while this explanation was being spoken there arose in the venerable Koṇḍañña the dustfree stainless vision of the Basic Pattern whatever is patterned with an origination all that is patterned with a cessationAnd when the Wheel of the Basic Pattern had been set in motion by the Blessed One the earthdwelling devas raised a cry At Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana the unsurpassed Wheel of the Basic Pattern has been set in motion by the Blessed One which cannot be stopped by any renunciant or brahman or māra or brahmā or by anyone in the world Having heard the cry of the earthdwelling devas the devas of the Four Great Kings raised the same cryHaving heard it the Thirtythree devas took it up then the Yāma devas then the Contented devas then the devas Who Delight in Creating then the devas With Mastery in the Creations of Others and then the devas of the brahmā groupThus at that moment at that instant at that second the cry spread as far as the brahmā world and this ten thousandfold world system shook quaked and trembled and an immeasurable glorious radiance appeared in the world surpassing the divine majesty of the devasThen the Blessed One uttered this inspiring utterance the honorable Koṇḍañña has indeed understoodThe honorable Koṇḍañña has indeed understoodIn this way the venerable Koṇḍañña acquired the name Koṇḍañña Who Has UnderstoodAriyasacca usually translated Noble Truth but KRNorman sees this as the least likely of all the possibilities for the meaning of ariyasaccaHe points out that the commentators interpret it as truth of the noble one truth of the noble ones truth for a noble one ie the truth that will make one noble as well as the translation noble truth so familiar to usThe last possibility however they put at the very bottom of the list of possibilities if they mention it at allHe prefers truth of the noble one but acknowledges that the term may be deliberately multivalentAt S v the Buddha is the Spiritually Ennobled One but the term also applies to any of the ennobled personsThey are different from the ordinary person the puthujjana though an ordinary person can become a Noble person by insight into DhammaAs regards the translation of sacca this means truth in many contexts but as an adjective it means both true and real Taking sacca as meaning truth in the term ariyasacca is problematic as in the above discourse it is said that the second ariyasacca is to be abandoned but surely the truth on the origination of painthe painful should not be abandonedRather the true reality which is the origination of painthe painful  craving  should be abandonedMoreover the discourse says that the Buddha understood This is the ariyasacca which is pain not The ariyasacca This is pain which would be the case if sacca here meant a truth whose content was expressed in words in quote marksThe ariyasaccas as true realities for the spiritually ennobled ones are reminiscent of such passages as S iv which says that That in the world by which one is a perceiver of the world a conceiver of the world  this is called the world in the discipline of the spiritually ennobled one That is spiritually ennobled ones understand things in a different way from ordinary peopleIndeed at Suttanipāta p it is said Whatever bhikkhus is regarded as this is true reality by the world that is well seen by the spiritually ennobled ones with right wisdom as it really is as this is deceptive and vice versaSnpthen says Whatever bhikkhus is regarded as This is pleasant by the world this is well seen by the spiritually ennobled ones with right wisdom as this is painful  and vice versaThis is because desirable senseobjects are impermanent and bring pain when they end and because spiritually ennobled ones unlike ordinary people see the five bundles of grasping fuel  the conditioned world  as painfulWhile ordinary people do not agree with this or that birth that is being born is painful they may of course agree that for example not to get what one wants is painfulOf all the paths the Eightfold Path is the best of all the truths the Four Noble Truths are the best of all things passionlessness is the best of men the Seeing One is the bestThis is the only path there is none other for the purification of insightTread this path and you will bewilder MaraWalking upon this path you will make an end of sufferingHaving discovered how to pull out the thorn of lust I make known the pathYou yourselves must strive the Buddhas only point the wayThose meditative ones who tread the path are released from the bonds of MaraAll conditioned things are impermanent  when one sees this with wisdom one turns away from sufferingThis is the path to purificationAll conditioned things are unsatisfactory  when one sees this with wisdom one turns away from sufferingThis is the path to purificationAll things are notself  when one sees this with wisdom one turns away from sufferingThis is the path to purificationThe idler who does not exert himself when he should who though young and strong is full of sloth with a mind full of vain thoughts  such an indolent man does not find the path to wisdomLet a man be watchful of speech well controlled in mind and not commit evil in bodily actionLet him purify these three courses of action and win the path made known by the Great SageWisdom springs from meditation without meditation wisdom wanesHaving known these two paths of progress and decline let a man so conduct himself that his wisdom may increaseCut down the forest but not the tree from the forest springs fearHaving cut down the forest and the underbrush be passionless O monksFor so long as the underbrush of desire even the most subtle of a man towards a woman is not cut down his mind is in bondage like the sucking calf to its motherCut off your affection in the manner of a man who plucks with his hand an autumn lotusCultivate only the path to peace Nibbana as made known by the Exalted OneHere shall I live during the rains here in winter and summer  thus thinks the foolHe does not realize the dangerAs a great flood carries away a sleeping village so death seizes and carries away the man with a clinging mind doting on his children and cattleFor him who is assailed by death there is no protection by kinsmenNone there are to save him  no sons nor father nor relativesRealizing this fact let the wise man restrained by morality hasten to clear the path leading to NibbanaNot by passing arbitrary judgments does a man become just a wise man is he who investigates both right and wrongHe who does not judge others arbitrarily but passes judgment impartially according to the truth that sagacious man is a guardian of law and is called justOne is not wise because one speaks muchHe who is peaceable friendly and fearless is called wiseA man is not versed in Dhamma because he speaks muchHe who after hearing a little Dhamma realizes its truth directly and is not heedless of it is truly versed in the DhammaA monk is not an elder because his head is grayHe is but ripe in age and he is called one grown old in vainOne in whom there is truthfulness virtue inoffensiveness restraint and selfmastery who is free from defilements and is wise  he is truly called an ElderNot by mere eloquence nor by beauty of form does a man become accomplished if he is jealous selfish and deceitfulBut he in whom these are wholly destroyed uprooted and extinct and who has cast out hatred  that wise man is truly accomplishedNot by shaven head does a man who is indisciplined and untruthful become a monkHow can he who is full of desire and greed be a monkHe who wholly subdues evil both small and great is called a monk because he has overcome all evilHe is not a monk just because he lives on others almsNot by adopting outward form does one become a true monkWhoever here lives a holy life transcending both merit and demerit and walks with understanding in this world  he is truly called a monkNot by observing silence does one become a sage if he be foolish and ignorantBut that man is wise who as if holding a balancescale accepts only the goodThe sage rejecting the evil is truly a sageSince he comprehends both worlds he is called a sageHe is not noble who injures living beingsHe is called noble because he is harmless towards all living beingsNot by rules and observances not even by much learning nor by gain of absorption nor by a life of seclusion nor by thinking I enjoy the bliss of renunciation which is not experienced by the worldling should you O monks rest content until the utter destruction of cankers is reachedLike a withered leaf are you now deaths messengers await youYou stand on the eve of your departure yet you have made no provision for your journeyMake an island for yourselfStrive hard and become wiseRid of impurities and cleansed of stain you shall enter the celestial abode of the Noble OnesYour life has come to an end now You are setting forth into the presence of Yama the king of deathNo resting place is there for you on the way yet you have made no provision for the journeyMake an island unto yourselfStrive hard and become wiseRid of impurities and cleansed of stain you shall not come again to birth and decayOne by one little by little moment by moment a wise man should remove his own impurities as a smith removes his dross from silverJust as rust arising from iron eats away the base from which it arises even so their own deeds lead transgressors to states of woeNonrepetition is the bane of scriptures neglect is the bane of a home slovenliness is the bane of personal appearance and heedlessness is the bane of a guardUnchastity is the taint in a woman niggardliness is the taint in a giverTaints indeed are all evil things both in this world and the nextA worse taint than these is ignorance the worst of all taintsDestroy this one taint and become taintless O monksEasy is life for the shameless one who is impudent as a crow is backbiting and forward arrogant and corruptDifficult is life for the modest one who always seeks purity is detached and unassuming clean in life and discerningOne who destroys life utters lies takes what is not given goes to another mans wife and is addicted to intoxicating drinks  such a man digs up his own root even in this worldKnow this O good man evil things are difficult to controlLet not greed and wickedness drag you to protracted miseryPeople give according to their faith or regardIf one becomes discontented with the food and drink given by others one does not attain meditative absorption either by day or by nightBut he in who this is fully destroyed uprooted and extinct he attains absorption both by day and by nightThere is no fire like lust there is no grip like hatred there is no net like delusion there is no river like cravingEasily seen is the fault of others but ones own fault is difficult to seeLike chaff one winnows anothers faults but hides ones own even as a crafty fowler hides behind sham branchesHe who seeks anothers faults who is ever censorious  his cankers growHe is far from destruction of the cankersThere is no track in the sky and no recluse outsideMankind delights in worldliness but the Buddhas are free from worldlinessThere is no track in the sky and no recluse outsideThere are no conditioned things that are eternal and no instability in the BuddhasOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels sanctuaryNow at that time a certain monk by the name of Elder was one who lived alone and extolled the virtues of living aloneAlone he entered the village for alms alone he returned alone he sat withdrawn alone he did walking meditationThen a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they informed him Lord there is a certain monk by the name of Elder who lives alone and extols the virtues of living aloneThen the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call the monk named Elder saying The Teacher calls you my friend As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to VenElder on arrival he said The Teacher calls you my friendAs you say my friend VenElder repliedThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Elder that you live alone and extol the virtues of living aloneYes lordBut how do you live alone and extol the virtues of living aloneLord alone I enter the village for alms alone I return alone I sit withdrawn alone I do walking meditationThat is how I live alone and extol the virtues of living aloneThere is that way of living alone ElderI dont say that there isntStill listen well to how your living alone is perfected in its details and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord VenElder respondedThe Blessed One said And how is living alone perfected in its detailsThere is the case where whatever is past is abandoned whatever is future is relinquished and any passion  desire with regard to states of being attained in the present is well subduedThat is how living alone is perfected in its detailsThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said it the One Wellgone further said thisI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryAnd on that occasion two factions in Rājagaha were infatuated with a certain courtesan their minds enthralledArguing quarreling  disputing they attacked one another with fists attacked one another with clods of dirt attacked one another with sticks attacked one another with knives so that they fell into death or deathlike painThen in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and  carrying their bowls  robes  went into Sāvatthī for almsHaving gone for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One At present two factions in Rājagaha are infatuated with a certain courtesan their minds enthralledArguing quarreling  disputing they attack one another with fists attack one another with clods of dirt attack one another with sticks attack one another with knives so that they fall into death or deathlike painThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryAnd on that occasion when VenUpasena Vaṅgantaputta was alone in seclusion this line of thinking appeared to his awareness What a gain what a true gain it is for me that my teacher is the Blessed One worthy and fully selfawakened that I have gone forth from home to the homeless life in a welltaught Dhamma  Vinaya that my companions in the holy life are virtuous and endowed with admirable qualities that I have achieved culmination in terms of the precepts that my mind is unified and wellconcentrated that I am an arahant with effluents ended that I have great power  great mightFortunate has been my life fortunate will be my deathThen the Blessed One comprehending with his awareness the line of thinking that had appeared to VenUpasena Vaṅgantaputtas awareness on that occasion exclaimedRenouncing the five pleasures of sense that entrance and delight the mind and in faith departing from home become one who makes an end of sufferingAssociate with good friends and choose a remote lodging secluded with little noiseBe moderate in eatingRobes almsfood remedies and a dwelling  do not have craving for these things do not be one who returns to the worldPractice restraint according to the Discipline and control the five sensefacultiesPractice mindfulness of the body and continually develop dispassionAvoid the sign of the beautiful connected with passion by meditating on the foul cultivate a mind that is concentrated and collectedMeditate on the Signless and get rid of the tendency to conceitBy thoroughly understanding and destroying conceit you will live in the peaceIn this manner the Lord repeatedly exhorted the Venerable RahulaIn AN VenAnanda asks the Buddha Could it be that a monk could attain a concentration of such a sort such that with regard to this conscious body he would have no Imaking or minemaking or obsession of conceit such that with regard to all external themes he would have no Imaking or minemaking or obsession of conceit and that he would enter  remain in the awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease in which there is no Imaking or minemaking or obsession of conceitThe Buddha answers that it is possible and that such a concentration can be attained when one is percipient in this way This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all mental processes the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding He then adds that it was in connection to this state of mind that he uttered the last verse in this poemIn AN the Buddha identifies four ways of developing concentration There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  nowThere is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge  visionThere is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to mindfulness  alertnessThere is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluents The Buddha then adds that he uttered the last verse of this poem in connection with these four ways of developing concentrationOn one occasion VenPindola Bharadvaja was staying in Kosambi at Ghositas monasteryThen King Udena went to him and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter this exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies the king sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenPindola Bharadvaja What is the reason master Bharadvaja what is the cause why young monks  blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life  without having played with sensual pleasures nevertheless follow the lifelong chaste life perfect  pure and make it last their entire livesGreat king this was said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy and rightly selfawakened Come now monks with regard to women who are old enough to be your mother establish the attitude you would have toward your motherWith regard to women who are old enough to be your sister establish the attitude youd have toward a sisterWith regard to women who are young enough to be your daughter establish the attitude youd have toward a daughter This is one reason this is one cause great king why young monks  blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life  without having played with sensual pleasures nevertheless follow the lifelong chaste life perfect  pure and make it last their entire livesThe mind is unruly master BharadvajaSometimes thoughts of greed arise even for women who are old enough to be your mother your sister young enough to be your daughterIs there another reason another cause why young monks without having played with sensual pleasures nevertheless follow the lifelong chaste life perfect  pure and make it last their entire livesGreat king this was said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy and rightly selfawakened Come now monks reflect on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin full of all sorts of unclean things In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine This too is a reason this too is a cause great king why young monks  blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life  without having played with sensual pleasures nevertheless follow the lifelong chaste life perfect  pure and make it last their entire livesFor those who are developed in body developed in virtue developed in mind developed in discernment master Bharadvaja that isnt hard to doBut for those who are undeveloped in body undeveloped in virtue undeveloped in mind undeveloped in discernment that is hard to doSometimes when one thinks Lets regard this as unattractive it actually comes to be attractiveIs there another reason another cause why young monks without having played with sensual pleasures nevertheless follow the lifelong chaste life perfect  pure and make it last their entire livesGreat king this was said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy and rightly selfawakened Come now monks Keep guarding the doors to your sense facultiesOn seeing a form with the eye do not grasp at any theme or variations by which  if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail youPractice with restraintGuard the faculty of the eyeAchieve restraint with regard to the faculty of the eyeOn hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an aroma with the noseOn tasting a flavor with the tongueOn feeling a tactile sensation with the bodyOn cognizing an idea with the intellect do not grasp at any theme or variations by which  if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail youPractice with restraintGuard the faculty of the intellectAchieve restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellectThis too is a reason this too is a cause great king why young monks  blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life  without having played with sensual pleasures nevertheless follow the lifelong chaste life perfect  pure and make it last their entire livesAmazing master BharadvajaStupendousHow well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy and rightly selfawakenedThis is the very reason this the very cause why young monks  blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life  without having played with sensual pleasures nevertheless follow the lifelong chaste life perfect  pure and make it last their entire livesI myself master Bharadvaja whenever I enter the inner apartments of the palace unguarded in body unguarded in speech unguarded in mind with mindfulness unestablished and my senses unrestrained Im overcome with thoughts of greedBut whenever I enter the inner apartments of the palace guarded in body guarded in speech guarded in mind with mindfulness established and my senses restrained then Im notMagnificent master BharadvajaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Bharadvaja  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksMay master Bharadvaja remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for lifeAt SavatthiAs he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Is there lord any one quality that keeps both kinds of benefit secure  benefits in this life  benefits in lives to comeThere is one quality great king that keeps both kinds of benefit secure  benefits in this life  benefits in lives to comeBut what lord is that one qualityHeedfulness great kingJust as the footprints of all living beings with legs can be encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephants footprint is declared to be supreme among them in terms of its great size in the same way heedfulness is the one quality that keeps both kinds of benefit secure  benefits in this life  benefits in lives to comeThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher said furtherAt this time King Pasenadi of Kosala was on the upper terrace of the palace with Queen MallikaaAnd the king asked her Mallikaa is there anyone dearer to you than yourselfYour Majesty there is no one dearer to me than myselfAnd you sire is anyone dearer to you than yourselfNor is there anyone dearer to me Mallikaa than myselfThen the king went down from the palace and visited the Blessed One And the Blessed One understanding thereupon uttered this verseAt SavatthiAs he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Just now lord as I was sitting in judgment I saw that even affluent nobles affluent brahmans  affluent householders  rich with great wealth  property with vast amounts of gold  silver vast amounts of valuables  commodities vast amounts of wealth  grain  tell deliberate lies with sensual pleasures as the cause sensual pleasures as the reason simply for the sake of sensual pleasuresThen the thought occured to me Ive had enough of this judgingLet some other fine fellow be known for his judgments Thats the way it is great kingThats the way it isEven affluent nobles affluent brahmans  affluent householders tell deliberate lies with sensual pleasures as the cause sensual pleasures as the reason simply for the sake of sensual pleasuresThat will lead to their longterm harm  painThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher said furtherAt SavatthiAs he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Just now lord while I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness Who have themselves protected and who leave themselves unprotected Then it occurred to me Those who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct leave themselves unprotectedEven though a squadron of elephant troops might protect them a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they leave themselves unprotectedWhy is thatBecause thats an external protection not an internal oneTherefore they leave themselves unprotectedBut those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct have

exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Now then does Master Gotama claim I have awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakeningIf great king one speaking rightly could say of anyone He has awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening one could rightly say that of meFor I great king have awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakeningBut Master Gotama those brahmans  contemplatives each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at large  ie Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccayana Sañjaya Belatthaputta and the Nigantha Nathaputta even they when I asked them whether they claimed to have awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening didnt make that claimSo who is Master Gotama to do so when he is still young  newly goneforthThere are these four things great king that shouldnt be despised  disparaged for being youngWhich fourA noble warrior great king shouldnt be despised  disparaged for being youngA snake A fire And a monk shouldnt be despised  disparaged for being youngThese are the four things

Blessed One Magnificent lordMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeThus have I heardOnce a large number of bhikkhus were living among the Kosalans on the slopes of the Himalayas in a forestlodgingAnd they were haughty unsteady garrulous of loose speech unmindful thoughtless without concentration with wandering minds and faculties uncontrolledNow Jantu son of the devas on a fifteenthday Uposatha came into the presence of those bhikkhus and addressed them in verseOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen Rohitassa the son of a deva in the far extreme of the night his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to the Blessed One Is it possible lord by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappearI tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappearIt is amazing lord and awesome how well that has been said by the Blessed One I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear Once I was a seer named Rohitassa a student of Bhoja a powerful skywalkerMy speed was as fast as that of a strong archer  welltrained a practiced hand a practiced sharpshooter  shooting a light arrow across the shadow of a palm treeMy stride stretched as far as the east sea is from the westTo me endowed with such speed such a stride there came the desire I will go traveling to the end of the cosmos I  with a onehundred year life a onehundred year span  spent one hundred years traveling  apart from the time spent on eating drinking chewing  tasting urinating  defecating and sleeping to fight off weariness  but without reaching the end of the cosmos I died along the waySo it is amazing lord and awesome how well that has been said by the Blessed One I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappearBut at the same time I tell you that there is no making an end of suffering  stress without reaching the end of the cosmosYet it is just within this fathomlong body with its perception  intellect that I declare that there is the cosmos the origination of the cosmos the cessation of the cosmos and the path of practice leading to the cessation of the cosmosAt RajagahaAs he was standing to one side Uttara the devas son recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monasteryAt that time Suriya the sun deity was seized by Rahu Lord of AsurasThereupon

also SNThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was staying at SaavatthiiThen Taayana son of the devas formerly a teacher of a sect spoke thus in verse before the Blessed OneSo said Taayana the devas son and so saying he passed with his right side to the Blessed One in salutation and vanished there and thenAnd when the night was past the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhusBhikkhus learn Taayanas verses learn them by heart Taayanas verses are for your good they pertain to the fundamentals of the holy lifeThe first verse in this discourse focuses on jhana as a crucial element in the path to releaseThe Buddhas awakening to jhana apparently refers to two points in his career as a bodhisatta the point when realizing the futility of selftorture he surmised that jhana might form the path to awakening and his realization of the extent to which jhana actually could lead to the knowledge that yielded in full awakeningIn the second verse the Buddha expands on Pañcalacandas understanding of the practice of jhana by pointing out that it has to be endowed with mindfulness to be genuinely right concentrationThis point is related to the fact that the various lists of activities constituting the path  such as the five faculties the seven factors for awakening and the noble eightfold path  always place right mindfulness before right concentrationIts also related to the statement in MN that the four satipatthanas  establishings of mindfulness or frames of reference  form the nimitta or theme of right concentrationANcontains an explanation of the first verse here in which VenAnanda identifies the first jhana as the opening offering escape from the confining place of sensual pleasures and each successive level of jhana as the opening offering escape from the confining place of the preceeding jhanaFinally he says the cessation of perception  feeling acts as the ultimate opening offering escape from all forms of confinementAt SavatthiAs he was standing to one side Pañcalacanda the devas son recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceAs she was standing to one side a devata recited this verse to the Blessed OneTranslators note Cullavagga VII tells of how Devadatta the Buddhas cousin tried unsuccessfully in various ways to wrest leadership of the Sangha from the BuddhaIn Cv VII he tries to kill the Buddha by hurling a rock down a mountainsideThe rock is crushed and so misses the Buddha but sends out a splinter that pierces the Buddhas foot drawing bloodAccording to the Commentary this discourse together with SNdescribe the Buddhas reaction to this attempt on his lifeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha at the Maddakucchi Deer ReserveNow at that time his foot had been pierced by a stone sliverExcruciating were the bodily feelings that developed within him  painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable  but he endured them mindful alert  unperturbedHaving had his outer robe folded in four and laid out he lay down on his right side in the lions posture with one foot placed on top of the other mindful  alertThen devatas from the Satullapa retinue in the far extreme of the night their extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Maddakucchi went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to him they stood to one sideAs she was standing there one of the devatas exclaimed in the Blessed Ones presence What a naga is Gotama the contemplativeAnd like a naga when bodily feelings have arisen  painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable  he endures them mindful alert  unperturbedThen another devata exclaimed in the Blessed Ones presence What a lion is Gotama the contemplativeAnd like a lion when bodily feelings have arisen  painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable  he endures them mindful alert  unperturbedThen another devata exclaimed in the Blessed Ones presence What a thoroughbred is Gotama the contemplativeAnd like a

a man thoroughbred of a man peerless bull of a man strong burdencarrier of a man such a tamed man should be violated what else is that if not blindnessthe deva spoke this versethe deva spoke this verseThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anathapindikas monasteryNow when night was passing a certain devataa lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with her surpassing beauty approached the LordHaving drawn near and prostrated herself she stood to one sideStanding there the devata saidThe Lord repliedThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was staying near Saavatthii at Jeta Grove in Anaathapindikas parkNow a certain deva as the night was passing away lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with his effulgent beauty approached the Blessed One and having approached stood on one sideStanding thus on one side the deva spoke this verse before the Blessed OneThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was staying at Raajagaha in the Tapodaa ParkNow the Venerable Samiddhi as dawn approached arose and went to the Hot Springs to batheHaving bathed he came out of the Hot Springs and stood clad in a single garment drying his limbsThen a certain shedeva as the night was passing away lighting up the entire Hot Springs lake with her effulgent beauty approached the Venerable Samiddhi and hovering in the air addressed him thus in verseThen the shedeva came down to earth and said to Samiddhi You are young bhikkhu to have left the world blackhaired with the bloom of youthIn your youthful prime you do not enjoy the pleasures of the sensesGet your fill bhikkhu of human pleasuresDont reject the present moment to pursue what time will bringI friend do not reject the present moment to pursue what time will bringI reject what time will bring to pursue the present momentTimes pleasures friend as the Blessed One has said are fraught with pain fraught with tribulation leading to greater dangerThis Dhamma is herepresent out of time inviting inspection leading onward to be realized by the wise each for himselfIn what way bhikkhu has the Blessed One said that times pleasures are fraught with pain fraught with tribulation and leading to greater dangerIn what way is this Dhamma herepresent out of time inviting inspection leading onward to be realized by the wise each for himselfI friend am fresh having not long left the world a newcomerI am not able to explain in detail this Dhamma and disciplineBut the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully SelfEnlightened One is staying at Raajagaha in the Tapodaa ParkGo to the Blessed One and ask him about the matterThen bear in the mind the explanation he gives to youIt is not easy for us bhikkhu to approach the Blessed OneHe is surrounded by other devas of great powerIf you bhikkhu will approach the Blessed One and ask him about the matter then perhaps we can come to hear the teachingVery well friend the Venerable Samiddhi replied to her and he went to the Blessed One made his obeisance and sat down to one sideIf Lord that deva was telling the truth she is right here not far awayWhen he had said this the deva said to the Venerable Samiddhi Ask him bhikkhu ask himIve managed to get hereThen the Blessed One addressed the deva in verseLord I do not fully grasp the meaning of what Your Blessedness has expressed in briefIt would be well for me Lord if your Blessedness would explain in full what has been expressed in brief that I may know its meaningLord neither do I full grasp the meaning of this which Your Blessedness has expressed in briefIt would be well for me Lord if Your Blessedness would explain in full what has been explained in brief that I may know its meaningLord the meaning of what Your Blessedness has expressed in brief I understand in full like thisTranslators note The Pali canon is unique in its approach to the spirit worldWhile confirming the existence of spirits and other more refined levels of beings it insists that they are not worthy of worshipThe Buddha after all is the teacher not only of human beings but also of heavenly beings and many heavenly beings are not especially knowledgeable or spiritually advanced in spite of their refined stateThe Canon illustrates this point in a number of gentle satiresThe most famous is the Kevatta Sutta where the ignorance  pomposity of a supposedly allknowing creator is lampoonedThis discourse is another entertaining example of the same genre pointing out the difficulties of teaching more advanced Dhamma to any being  human or divine  who is obsessed with sensual pleasuresOn hearing some verses concerning the awakened ones state of mind  which is not subject to time and is visible herenow  the devata cannot understand them and is able to grasp only a few very basic principles of Dhamma practiceIts unusual for the Buddha to aim his words so far over the heads of his listenersPerhaps in this case as in SN he wants to subdue the devatas prideAt any rate there is hope for her as the Commentary points out her understanding covers in a rudimentary fashion all the elements of the Noble Eightfold PathIf she follows through with her understanding shes on the road to the higher attainmentsThis discourse also contains some word play on the words time and subject to timeTime can mean not only time in the general sense but also ones time of deathThese two meanings of the word underlie the first exchange between VenSamiddhi and the devataSubject to time can mean obtainable only after a certain time or good only for a certain length of time these meanings underlie their second exchangeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha at Tapoda monasteryThen VenSamiddhi as night was ending got up  went to the Tapoda Hot Springs to bathe his limbsHaving bathed his limbs and gotten out of the springs he stood wearing only his lower robe letting his limbs dryThen a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entire Tapoda Hot Springs approached VenSamiddhiOn arrival while standing in the air she addressed him with this verseThen the devata coming down to earth said to VenSamiddhi You have gone forth while young monk  blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life  without having played with sensual pleasuresEnjoy human sensuality monkDont drop what is visible herenow in pursuit of whats subject to timeMy friend Im not dropping whats visible herenow in pursuit of whats subject to timeIm dropping whats subject to time in pursuit of whats visible herenowFor the Blessed One has said that sensual pleasures are subject to time of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks whereas this Dhamma is visible herenow not subject to time inviting all to come  see pertinent to be known by the wise for themselvesBut monk in what way has the Blessed One said that sensual pleasures are subject to time of much stress much despair  greater drawbacksAnd how is this Dhamma visible herenow not subject to time inviting all to come  see pertinent to be known by the wise for themselvesIm new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  disciplineI cant explain it in detailBut the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened is staying here in Rajagaha at Tapoda monasteryHaving gone to him ask him this matterAs he explains it thats how you should remember itMonk its not easy for us to go to the Blessed One as he is surrounded by other devas of great influenceBut if you go to the Blessed One and ask him this matter I will come along to hear the DhammaResponding to the devata As you say my friend VenSamiddhi went to the Blessed OneOn arrival he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one sideAs he was sitting thereNow lord if that devata was telling the truth she is not far from hereWhen this was said the devata said to VenSamiddhi Ask monkAskIve gotten throughThen the Blessed One recited this verse to the devataI dont understand lord the detailed meaning of the Blessed Ones brief statementIt would be good if the Blessed One would speak in such a way that I would understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed Ones brief statementI dont understand lord the detailed meaning of the Blessed Ones brief statementIt would be good if the Blessed One would speak in such a way that I would understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed Ones brief statementLord heres how I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed Ones brief statementOne should give up anger renounce pride and overcome all fettersSuffering never befalls him who clings not to mind and body and is detachedHe who checks rising anger as a charioteer checks a rolling chariot him I call a true charioteerOthers only hold the reinsOvercome the angry by nonanger overcome the wicked by goodness overcome the miser by generosity overcome the liar by truthSpeak the truth yield not to anger when asked give even if you only have a littleBy these three means can one reach the presence of the godsThose sages who are inoffensive and ever restrained in body go to the Deathless State where having gone they grieve no moreThose who are ever vigilant who discipline themselves day and night and are ever intent upon Nibbana  their defilements fade awayO AtulaIndeed this is an ancient practice not one only of today they blame those who remain silent they blame those who speak much they blame those who speak in moderationThere is none in the world who is not blamedThere never was there never will be nor is there now a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praisedBut the man whom the wise praise after observing him day after day is one of flawless character wise and endowed with knowledge and virtueWho can blame such a one as worthy as a coin of refined goldEven the gods praise him by Brahma too is he praisedLet a man guard himself against irritability in bodily action let him be controlled in deedAbandoning bodily misconduct let him practice good conduct in deedLet a man guard himself against irritability in speech let him be controlled in speechAbandoning verbal misconduct let him practice good conduct in speechLet a man guard himself against irritability in thought let him be controlled in mindAbandoning mental misconduct let him practice good conduct in thoughtThe wise are controlled in bodily action controlled in speech and controlled in thoughtThey are truly wellcontrolledGiving himself to things to be shunned and not exerting where exertion is needed a seeker after pleasures having given up his true welfare envies those intent upon theirsSeek no intimacy with the beloved and also not with the unloved for not to see the beloved and to see the unloved both are painfulTherefore hold nothing dear for separation from the dear is painfulThere are no bonds for those who have nothing beloved or unlovedFrom endearment springs grief from endearment springs fearFor one who is wholly free from endearment there is no grief whence then fearFrom affection springs grief from affection springs fearFor one who is wholly free from affection there is no grief whence then

dear him who embodies virtue and insight who is principled has realized the truth and who himself does what he ought to be doingOne who is intent upon the Ineffable dwells with mind inspired and is no more bound by sense pleasures  such a man is called One Bound Upstream When after a long absence a man safely returns from afar his relatives friends and wellwishers welcome him home on arrivalAs kinsmen welcome a dear one on arrival even so his own good deeds will welcome the doer of good who has gone from this world to the nextHappy indeed we live friendly amidst the hostileAmidst hostile men we dwell free from hatredHappy indeed we live friendly amidst the afflictedAmidst afflicted men we dwell free from afflictionHappy indeed we live free from avarice amidst the avariciousAmidst the avaricious men we dwell free from avariceHappy indeed we live we who possess nothingFeeders on joy we shall be like the Radiant GodsVictory begets enmity the defeated dwell in painHappily the peaceful live discarding both victory and defeatThere is no fire like lust and no crime like hatredThere is no ill like the aggregates and no bliss higher than the peaceHunger is the worst disease conditioned things the worst sufferingKnowing this as it really is the wise realize Nibbana the highest blissHealth is the most precious gain and contentment the greatest wealthA trustworthy person is the best kinsman Nibbana the highest blissHaving savored the taste of solitude and peace painfree and stainless he becomes drinking deep the taste of the bliss of the TruthGood is it to see the Noble Ones to live with them is ever blissfulOne will always be happy by not encountering foolsIndeed he who moves in the company of fools grieves for longingAssociation with fools is ever painful like partnership with an enemyBut association with the wise is happy like meeting ones own kinsmenTherefore follow the Noble One who is steadfast wise learned dutiful and devoutOne should follow only such a man who is truly good and discerning even as the moon follows the path of the starsBy what track can you trace that trackless Buddha of limitless range whose victory nothing can undo whom none of the vanquished defilements can ever pursueBy what track can you trace that trackless Buddha of limitless range in whom exists no longer the entangling and embroiling craving that perpetuates becomingThose wise ones who are devoted to meditation and who delight in the calm of renunciation  such mindful ones Supreme Buddhas even the gods hold dearHard is it to be born a man hard is the life of mortalsHard is it to gain the opportunity of hearing the Sublime Truth and hard to encounter is the arising of the BuddhasTo avoid all evil to cultivate good and to cleanse ones mind  this is the teaching of the BuddhasEnduring patience is the highest austerityNibbana is supreme say the BuddhasHe is not a true monk who harms another nor a true renunciate who oppresses othersNot despising not harming restraint according to the code of monastic discipline moderation in food dwelling in solitude devotion to meditation  this is the teaching of the BuddhasThere is no satisfying sensual desires even with the rain of gold coinsFor sensual pleasures give little satisfaction and much painHaving understood this the wise man finds no delight even in heavenly pleasuresThe disciple of the Supreme Buddha delights in the destruction of cravingDriven only by fear do men go for refuge to many places  to hills woods groves trees and shrinesSuch indeed is no safe refuge such is not the refuge supremeNot by resorting to such a refuge is one released from all sufferingHe who has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Teaching and his Order penetrates with transcendental wisdom the Four Noble Truths  suffering the cause of suffering the cessation of suffering and the Noble Eightfold Path leading to the cessation of sufferingThis indeed is the safe refuge this the refuge supremeHaving gone to such a refuge one is released from all sufferingHard to find is the thoroughbred man he is not born everywhereWhere such a wise man is born that clan thrives happilyBlessed is the birth of the Buddhas blessed is the enunciation of the sacred Teaching blessed is the harmony in the Order and blessed is the spiritual pursuit of the united truthseekerHe who reveres those worthy of reverence the Buddhas and their disciples who have transcended all obstacles and passed beyond the reach of sorrow and lamentation  he who reveres such peaceful and fearless ones his merit none can compute by any measureFollow not the vulgar way live not in heedlessness hold not false views linger not long in worldly existenceAriseDo not be heedlessLead a righteous lifeThe righteous live happily both in this world and the nextLead a righteous life lead not a base lifeThe righteous live happily both in this world and the nextOne who looks upon the world as a bubble and a mirage him the King of Death sees notComeBehold this world which is like a decorated royal chariotHere fools flounder but the wise have no attachment to itHe who having been heedless is heedless no more illuminates this world like the moon freed from cloudsHe who by good deeds covers the evil he has done illuminates this world like the moon freed from cloudsBlind is the world here only a few possess insightOnly a few like birds escaping from the net go to realms of blissSwans fly on the path of the sun men pass through the air by psychic powers the wise are led away from the world after vanquishing Mara and his hostFor a liar who has violated the one law who holds in scorn the hereafter there is no evil that he cannot doTruly misers fare not to heavenly realms nor indeed do fools praise generosityBut the wise man rejoices in giving and by that alone does he become happy hereafterBetter than sole sovereignty over the earth better than going to heaven better even than lordship over all the worlds is the supramundane Fruition of Stream EntranceIf one holds oneself dear one should diligently watch oneselfLet the wise man keep vigil during any of the three watches of the nightOne should first establish oneself in what is proper then only should one instruct othersThus the wise man will not be reproachedOne should do what one teaches others to do if one would train others one should be well controlled oneselfDifficult indeed is selfcontrolOne truly is the protector of oneself who else could the protector beWith oneself fully controlled one gains a mastery that is hard to gainThe evil a witless man does by himself born of himself and produced by himself grinds him as a diamond grinds a hard gemJust as a single creeper strangles the tree on which it grows even so a man who is exceedingly depraved harms himself as only an enemy might wishEasy to do are things that are bad and harmful to oneselfBut exceedingly difficult to do are things that are good and beneficialWhoever on account of perverted views scorns the Teaching of the Perfected Ones the Noble and Righteous Ones  that fool like the bamboo produces fruits only for self destructionBy oneself is evil done by oneself is one defiledBy oneself is evil left undone by oneself is one made purePurity and impurity depend on oneself no one can purify anotherLet one not neglect ones own welfare for the sake of another however greatClearly understanding ones own welfare let one be intent upon the goodWhen this world is ever ablaze why this laughter why this jubilationShrouded in darkness will you not see the lightBehold this body  a painted image a mass of heaped up sores infirm full of hankering  of which nothing is lasting or stableFully worn out is this body a nest of disease and fragileThis foul mass breaks up for death is the end of lifeThese dovecolored bones are like gourds that lie scattered about in autumnHaving seen them how can one seek delightThis city is built of bones plastered with flesh and blood within are decay and death pride and jealousyEven gorgeous royal chariots wear out and indeed this body too wears outBut the Dhamma of the Good does not age thus the Good make it known to the goodThe man of little learning grows old like a bullHe grows only in bulk but his wisdom does not growThrough many a birth in samsara have I wandered in vain seeking the builder of this houseRepeated birth is indeed sufferingO housebuilder you are seenYou will not build this house againFor your rafters are broken and your ridgepole shatteredMy mind has reached the Unconditioned I have attained the destruction of cravingThose who in youth have not led the holy life or have failed to acquire wealth languish like old cranes in the pond without fishThose who in youth have not lead the holy life or have failed to acquire wealth lie sighing over the past like worn out arrows a bowAll tremble at violence all fear deathPutting oneself in the place of another one should not kill nor cause another to killAll tremble at violence life is dear to allPutting oneself in the place of another one should not kill nor cause another to killOne who while himself seeking happiness oppresses with violence other beings who also desire happiness will not attain happiness hereafterOne who while himself seeking happiness does not oppress with violence other beings who also desire happiness will find happiness hereafterSpeak not harshly to anyone for those thus spoken to might retortIndeed angry speech hurts and retaliation may overtake youIf like a broken gong you silence yourself you have approached Nibbana for vindictiveness is no longer in youJust as a cowherd drives the cattle to pasture with a staff so do old age and death drive the life force of beingsWhen the fool commits evil deeds he does not realizeThe witless man is tormented by his own deeds like one burnt by fireHe who inflicts violence on those who are unarmed and offends those who are inoffensive will soon come upon one of these ten states Sharp pain or disaster bodily injury serious illness or derangement of mind trouble from the government or grave charges loss of relatives or loss of wealth or houses destroyed by ravaging fire upon dissolution of the body that ignorant man is born in hellNeither going about naked nor matted locks nor filth nor fasting nor lying on the ground nor smearing oneself with ashes and dust nor sitting on the heels can purify a mortal who has not overcome doubtEven though he be wellattired yet if he is poised calm controlled and established in the holy life having set aside violence towards all beings  he truly is a holy man a renunciate a monkOnly rarely is there a man in this world who restrained by modesty avoids reproach as a thoroughbred horse avoids the whipLike a thoroughbred horse touched by the whip be strenuous be filled with spiritual yearningBy faith and moral purity by effort and meditation by investigation of the truth by being rich in knowledge and virtue and by being mindful destroy this unlimited sufferingIrrigators regulate the waters fletchers straighten arrow shafts carpenters shape wood and the good control themselvesHasten to do good restrain your mind from evilHe who is slow in doing good his mind delights in evilShould a person commit evil let him not do it again and againLet him not find pleasure therein for painful is the accumulation of evilShould a person do good let him do it again and againLet him find pleasure therein for blissful is the accumulation of goodIt may be well with the evildoer as long as the evil ripens notBut when it does ripen then the evildoer sees his evil deedsIt may be ill with the doer of good as long as the good ripens notBut when it does ripen then the doer of good sees his good deedsThink not lightly of evil saying It will not come to me Drop by drop is the water pot filledLikewise the fool gathering it little by little fills himself with evilThink not lightly of good saying It will not come to me Drop by drop is the water pot filledLikewise the wise man gathering it little by little fills himself with goodJust as a trader with a small escort and great wealth would avoid a perilous route or just as one desiring to live avoids poison even so should one shun evilIf on the hand there is no wound one may carry even poison in itPoison does not affect one who is free from woundsFor him who does no evil there is no illLike fine dust thrown against the wind evil falls back upon that fool who offends an inoffensive pure and guiltless manSome are born in the womb the wicked are born in hell the devout go to heaven the stainless pass into NibbanaNeither in the sky nor in midocean nor by entering into mountain clefts nowhere in the world is there a place where one may escape from the results of evil deedsNeither in the sky nor in midocean nor by entering into mountain clefts nowhere in the world is there a place where one will not be overcome by deathBetter than a thousand useless words is one useful word hearing which one attains peaceBetter than a thousand useless verses is one useful verse hearing which one attains peaceBetter than reciting a hundred meaningless verses is the reciting of one verse of Dhamma hearing which one attains peaceThough one may conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle yet he indeed is the noblest victor who conquers himselfSelfconquest is far better than the conquest of othersNot even a god an angel Mara or Brahma can turn into defeat the victory of a person who is selfsubdued and ever restrained in conductThough month after month for a hundred years one should offer sacrifices by the thousands yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds that honor is indeed better than a century of sacrificeThough for a hundred years one should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds that worship is indeed better than a century of sacrificeWhatever gifts and oblations one seeking merit might offer in this world for a whole year all that is not worth one fourth of the merit gained by revering the Upright Ones which is truly excellentTo one ever eager to revere and serve the elders these four blessing accrue long life and beauty happiness and powerBetter it is to live one day virtuous and meditative than to live a hundred years immoral and uncontrolledBetter it is to live one day wise and meditative than to live a hundred years foolish and uncontrolledBetter it is to live one day strenuous and resolute than to live a hundred years sluggish and dissipatedBetter it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of thingsBetter it is to live one day seeing the Deathless than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the DeathlessBetter it is to live one day seeing the Supreme Truth than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Supreme TruthThe fever of passion exists not for him who has completed the journey who is sorrowless and wholly set free and has broken all tiesThe mindful ones exert themselvesThey are not attached to any home like swans that abandon the lake they leave home after home behindThose who do not accumulate and are wise regarding food whose object is the Void the Unconditioned Freedom  their track cannot be traced like that of birds in the airHe whose cankers are destroyed and who is not attached to food whose object is the Void the Unconditioned Freedom  his path cannot be traced like that of birds in the airEven the gods hold dear the wise one whose senses are subdued like horses well trained by a charioteer whose pride is destroyed and who is free from the cankersThere is no more worldly existence for the wise one who like the earth resents nothing who is firm as a high pillar and as pure as a deep pool free from mudCalm is his thought calm his speech and calm his deed who truly knowing is wholly freed perfectly tranquil and wiseThe man who is without blind faith who knows the Uncreated who has severed all links destroyed all causes and thrown out all desires  he truly is the most excellent of menInspiring indeed is that place where Arahants dwell be it a village a forest a vale or a hillInspiring are the forests in which worldlings find no pleasureThere the passionless will rejoice for they seek no sensual pleasuresShould one find a man who points out faults and who reproves let him follow such a wise and sagacious person as one would a guide to hidden treasureIt is always better and never worse to cultivate such an associationLet him admonish instruct and shield one from wrong he indeed is dear to the good and detestable to the evilDo not associate with evil companions do not seek the fellowship of the vileAssociate with the good friends seek the fellowship of noble menHe who drinks deep the Dhamma lives happily with a tranquil mindThe wise man ever delights in the Dhamma made known by the Noble OneIrrigators regulate the rivers fletchers straighten the arrow shaft carpenters shape the wood the wise control themselvesJust as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm even so the wise are not affected by praise or blameOn hearing the Teachings the wise become perfectly purified like a lake deep clear and stillThe good renounce everythingThe virtuous do not prattle with a yearning for pleasuresThe wise show no elation or depression when touched by happiness or sorrowHe is indeed virtuous wise and righteous who neither for his own sake nor for the sake of another who does not crave for sons wealth or kingdom and does not desire success by unjust meansFew among men are those who cross to the farther shoreThe rest the bulk of men only run up and down the hither bankBut those who act according to the perfectly taught Dhamma will cross the realm of Death so difficult to crossAbandoning the dark way let the wise man cultivate the bright pathHaving gone from home to homelessness let him yearn for that delight in detachment so difficult to enjoyGiving up sensual pleasures with no attachment let the wise man cleanse himself of defilements of the mindThose whose minds have reached full excellence in the factors of enlightenment who having renounced acquisitiveness rejoice in not clinging to things  rid of cankers glowing with wisdom they have attained Nibbana in this very lifeLong is the night to the sleepless long is the league to the wearyLong is worldly existence to fools who know not the Sublime TruthShould a seeker not find a companion who is better or equal let him resolutely pursue a solitary course there is no fellowship with the foolThe fool worries thinking I have sons I have wealth Indeed when he himself is not his own whence are sons whence is wealthA fool who knows his foolishness is wise at least to that extent but a fool who thinks himself wise is a fool indeedThough all his life a fool associates with a wise man he no more comprehends the Truth than a spoon tastes the flavor of the soupThough only for a moment a discerning person associates with a wise man quickly he comprehends the Truth just as the tongue tastes the flavor of the soupFools of little wit are enemies unto themselves as they move about doing evil deeds the fruits of which are bitterIll done is that action of doing which one repents later and the fruit of which one weeping reaps with tearsWell done is that action of doing which one repents not later and the fruit of which one reaps with delight and happinessSo long as an evil deed has not ripened the fool thinks it as sweet as honeyBut when the evil deed ripens the fool comes to griefMonth after month a fool may eat his food with the tip of a blade of grass but he still is not worth a sixteenth part of the those who have comprehended the TruthTruly an evil deed committed does not immediately bear fruit like milk that does not turn sour all at onceBut smoldering it follows the fool like fire covered by ashesTo his own ruin the fool gains knowledge for it cleaves his head and destroys his innate goodnessThe fool seeks undeserved reputation precedence among monks authority over monasteries and honor among householdersLet both laymen and monks think that it was done by meIn every work great and small let them follow me  such is the ambition of the fool thus his desire and pride increaseOne is the quest for worldly gain and quite another is the path to NibbanaClearly understanding this let not the monk the disciple of the Buddha be carried away by worldly acclaim but develop detachment insteadJust as a fletcher straightens an arrow shaft even so the discerning man straightens his mind  so fickle and unsteady so difficult to guardAs a fish when pulled out of water and cast on land throbs and quivers even so is this mind agitatedHence should one abandon the realm of MaraWonderful indeed it is to subdue the mind so difficult to subdue ever swift and seizing whatever it desiresA tamed mind brings happinessLet the discerning man guard the mind so difficult to detect and extremely subtle seizing whatever it desiresA guarded mind brings happinessDwelling in the cave the mind without form wanders far and aloneThose who subdue this mind are liberated from the bonds of MaraWisdom never becomes perfect in one whose mind is not steadfast who knows not the Good Teaching and whose faith waversThere is no fear for an awakened one whose mind is not sodden nor afflicted and who has gone beyond both merit and demeritRealizing that this body is as fragile as a clay pot and fortifying this mind like a wellfortified city fight out Mara with the sword of wisdomThen guarding the conquest remain unattachedEre long alasthis body will lie upon the earth unheeded and lifeless like a useless logWhatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy or a hater to a hater an illdirected mind inflicts on oneself a greater harmNeither mother father nor any other relative can do one greater good than ones own welldirected mindWho shall overcome this earth this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and godsWho shall bring to perfection the welltaught path of wisdom as an expert garlandmaker would his floral designA striveronthe path shall overcome this earth this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and godsThe striveronthepath shall bring to perfection the welltaught path of wisdom as an expert garlandmaker would his floral designRealizing that this body is like froth penetrating its miragelike nature and plucking out Maras flowertipped arrows of sensuality go beyond sight of the King of DeathAs a mighty flood sweeps away the sleeping village so death carries away the person of distracted mind who only plucks the flowersThe Destroyer brings under his sway the person of distracted mind who insatiate in sense desires only plucks the flowersAs a bee gathers honey from the flower without injuring its color or fragrance even so the sage goes on his almsround in the villageLet none find fault with others let none see the omissions and commissions of othersBut let one see ones own acts done and undoneLike a beautiful flower full of color but without fragrance even so fruitless are the fair words of one who does not practice themLike a beautiful flower full of color and also fragrant even so fruitful are the fair words of one who practices themAs from a great heap of flowers many garlands can be made even so should many good deeds be done by one born a mortalNot the sweet smell of flowers not even the fragrance of sandal tagara or jasmine blows against the windBut the fragrance of the virtuous blows against the windTruly the virtuous man pervades all directions with the fragrance of his virtueOf all the fragrances  sandal tagara blue lotus and jasmine  the fragrance of virtue is the sweetestFaint is the fragrance of tagara and sandal but excellent is the fragrance of the virtuous wafting even amongst the godsMara never finds the path of the truly virtuous who abide in heedfulness and are freed by perfect knowledgeUpon a heap of rubbish in the roadside ditch blooms a lotus fragrant and pleasingEven so on the rubbish heap of blinded mortals the disciple of the Supremely Enlightened One shines resplendent in wisdomHeedfulness is the path to the DeathlessHeedlessness is the path to deathThe heedful die notThe heedless are as if dead alreadyClearly understanding this excellence of heedfulness the wise exult therein and enjoy the resort of the Noble OnesThe wise ones ever meditative and steadfastly persevering alone experience Nibbana the incomparable freedom from bondageEver grows the glory of him who is energetic mindful and pure in conduct discerning and selfcontrolled righteous and heedfulBy effort and heedfulness discipline and selfmastery let the wise one make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelmThe foolish and ignorant indulge in heedlessness but the wise one keeps his heedfulness as his best treasureDo not give way to heedlessnessDo not indulge in sensual pleasuresOnly the heedful and meditative attain great happinessJust as one upon the summit of a mountain beholds the groundlings even so when the wise man casts away heedlessness by heedfulness and ascends the high tower of wisdom this sorrowless sage beholds the sorrowing and foolish multitudeHeedful among the heedless wideawake among the sleepy the wise man advances like a swift horse leaving behind a weak jadeBy Heedfulness did Indra become the overlord of the godsHeedfulness is ever praised and heedlessness ever despisedThe monk who delights in heedfulness and looks with fear at heedlessness advances like fire burning all fetters small and largeThe monk who delights in heedfulness and looks with fear at heedlessness will not fallHe is close to NibbanaMind precedes all mental statesMind is their chief they are all mindwroughtIf with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the oxMind precedes all mental statesMind is their chief they are all mindwroughtIf with a pure mind a person speaks or acts happiness follows him like his neverdeparting shadowHe abused me he struck me he overpowered me he robbed me Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatredHe abused me he struck me he overpowered me he robbed me Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatredHatred is never appeased by hatred in this worldBy nonhatred alone is hatred appeasedThis is a law eternalThere are those who do not realize that one day we all must dieBut those who do realize this settle their quarrelsJust as a storm throws down a weak tree so does Mara overpower the man who lives for the pursuit of pleasures who is uncontrolled in his senses immoderate in eating indolent and dissipatedJust as a storm cannot prevail against a rocky mountain so Mara can never overpower the man who lives meditating on the impurities who is controlled in his senses moderate in eating and filled with faith and earnest effortWhoever being depraved devoid of selfcontrol and truthfulness should don the monks yellow robe he surely is not worthy of the robeBut whoever is purged of depravity wellestablished in virtues and filled with selfcontrol and truthfulness he indeed is worthy of the yellow robeThose who mistake the unessential to be essential and the essential to be unessential dwelling in wrong thoughts never arrive at the essentialThose who know the essential to be essential and the unessential to be unessential dwelling in right thoughts do arrive at the essentialJust as rain breaks through an illthatched house so passion penetrates an undeveloped mindJust as rain does not break through a wellthatched house so passion never penetrates a welldeveloped mindThe evildoer grieves here and hereafter he grieves in both the worldsHe laments and is afflicted recollecting his own impure deedsThe doer of good rejoices here and hereafter he rejoices in both the worldsHe rejoices and exults recollecting his own pure deedsThe evildoer suffers here and hereafter he suffers in both the worldsThe thought Evil have I done torments him and he suffers even more when gone to realms of woeThe doer of good delights here and hereafter he delights in both the worldsThe thought Good have I done delights him and he delights even more when gone to realms of blissMuch though he recites the sacred texts but acts not accordingly that heedless man is like a cowherd who only counts the cows of others  he does not partake of the blessings of the holy lifeLittle though he recites the sacred texts but puts the Teaching into practice forsaking lust hatred and delusion with true wisdom and emancipated mind clinging to nothing of this or any other world  he indeed partakes of the blessings of a holy lifeOnce the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove near the Squirrels Feeding PlaceNow the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja heard this The brahman Bharadvaja it seems has become a monk under the Great Monk Gotama Angry and unhappy he went to where the Blessed One wasHaving approached the Blessed One he abused and criticized the Blessed One in foul and harsh wordsThus reviled the Blessed One spoke to the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja Well brahman do friends confidants relatives kinsmen and guests visit youYes Gotama sometimes friends confidants relatives kinsmen and guests do visit meWell brahman do you not offer them snacks or food or tidbitsYes Gotama sometimes I do offer them snacks or food or tidbitsBut if brahman they do not accept it who gets itIf Gotama they do not accept it I get it backEven so brahman you are abusing us who do not abuse you are angry with us who do not get angry you are quarreling with us who do not quarrelAll this of yours we dont acceptYou alone brahman get it back all this brahman belongs to youWhen brahman one abuses back when abused repays anger in kind and quarrels back when quarreled with this is called brahman associating with each other and exchanging mutuallyThis association and mutual exchange we do not engage inTherefore you alone brahman get it back all this brahman belongs to youPeople including the king know the Venerable Gotama thus The Monk Gotama is the Worthy One When does the Venerable Gotama become angrySaid the BuddhaWhen the Lord proclaimed this the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja said this to the Blessed One Wonderful indeed O Venerable GotamaHerewith I go to the Venerable Gotama for refuge to his Teaching and to his Holy Order of MonksMost venerable sir may I have the privilege to receive at the hands of the revered Lord Gotama the initial monastic ordination and also the higher ordination of a bhikkhuAnd the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja received at the hands of the Blessed One the initial monastic ordination and he also received the higher ordination of a bhikkhuAnd within a short time of his ordination the Venerable Akkosa Bharadvaja living alone secluded diligent zealous and unrelenting reached that incomparable consummation of holiness for which sons of noble families having totally abandoned the household life take to the life of homelessnessWith direct knowledge he realized the ultimate then and there and lived having access to itHe saw with his supernormal vision Ceased is rebirth lived is the holy life completed is the spiritual task and henceforth there is nothing higher to be achievedThe Venerable Akkosa Bharadvaja indeed became

the Evil One realizing The bhikkhuni Kisagotami knows me sad and disappointed disappeared right thereThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThen in the morning the bhikkhuni Alavika dressed and taking bowl and robe entered Savatthi for almsWhen she had walked for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the Blind Mens Grove seeking seclusionThen Mara the Evil One desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in the bhikkhuni Alavika desiring to make her fall away from seclusion approached her and addressed her in verseThen it occurred to the bhikkhuni Alavika Now who is it that recited the verse  a human being or a nonhuman being Then it occurred to her This is Mara the Evil One who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in me desiring to make me fall away from seclusionThen the bhikkhuni Alavika having understood This is Mara the Evil One replied to him in versesThen Mara the Evil One realizing The bhikkhuni Alavika knows me sad and disappointed disappeared right thereI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi tree  the tree of awakening  newly awakenedAnd on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseThen with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration in the first watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent coarising in forward order thusIn other wordsThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedNotice that dependent coarising is expressed in terms of processes  of events and actions  without reference to a framework containing those processesIn other words it doesnt mention the existence or nonexistence of agents doing the actions or of a framework in time and space in which these processes happenThus it makes possible a way of understanding the causes of suffering and stress without reference to the existence or nonexistence of an I or an other responsible for those eventsInstead the events are viewed simply as events in the context of the process  a way of viewing that makes it possible to abandon clinging for any of these events so as to bring suffering to an endEven the idea of an I or an other is seen simply as part of the processThis is what makes possible the abandoning of any attachment to the conceit I am as mentioned in Ud andIn this way the treatment of dependent coarising in the first three udānas while terse actually sets the stage for understanding some of the more paradoxical teachings that appear later in the collectionFor a discussion of dependent coarising in general see The Shape of SufferingFor further discussion of its role in framing and abandoning thoughts of I am see Skill in Questions chapters andI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi tree  the tree of awakening  newly awakenedAnd on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseThen with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration in the second watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent coarising in reverse order thusIn other wordsThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedOn one occasion VenSabhiya Kaccana was staying at atika in the Brick HallThen Vacchagotta the wanderer went to him and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenSabhiya Kaccana Now then Master Kaccana does the Tathagata exist after deathVaccha that has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata exists after death Well then Master Kaccana does the Tathagata not exist after deathVaccha that too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata does not exist after death Then does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after deathThat has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death Well then does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after deathThat too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death Now Master Kaccana when asked if the Tathagata exists after death you say That has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata exists after death When asked if the Tathagata does not exist after death you say That too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata does not exist after death When asked if the Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death you say That has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death When asked if the Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death you say That too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death Now what is the cause what is the reason why that has not been declared by Gotama the contemplativeVaccha whatever cause whatever reason there would be for describing him as possessed of form or formless or percipient or nonpercipient or neither percipient nor nonpercipient If that cause that reason were to cease totally everywhere totally in every way without remainder then describing him by what means would one describe him as possessed of form or formless or percipient or nonpercipient or neither percipient nor nonpercipientHow long has it been since you went forth Master KaccanaNot long my friendThree yearsWhoever has gained just this much in this much time has gained a great deal my friend  to say nothing of the things he has thus gone beyondSee also other suttas in the Avyakata Samyutta ANOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in Nigrodhas ParkThen Nandiya the Sakyan went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord the disciple of the noble ones in whom the factors of stream entry are altogether  in every way lacking Is he called a disciple of the noble ones who lives heedlesslyNandiya the person in whom the factors of stream entry are altogether  in every way lacking I call an outsider one who stands in the faction of the runofthemillBut as to how a disciple of the noble ones lives heedlessly and heedfully listen well and pay attention I will speak As you say lord Nandiya the Sakyan respondedThe Blessed One said And how Nandiya does a disciple of the noble ones live heedlesslyThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed Content with that verified confidence in the Awakened One he does not exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by nightFor him living thus heedlessly there is no

no serenityThere being no serenity he dwells in painWhen pained the mind does not become centeredWhen the mind is uncentered phenomena do not become manifestWhen phenomena are not manifest he is reckoned simply as one who dwells heedlesslyFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Sangha The Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world Content with that verified confidence in the Sangha he does not exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by nightFor him living thus heedlessly there is no joyThere being no joy there is no raptureThere being no rapture there is no serenityThere being no serenity he dwells in painWhen pained the mind does not become centeredWhen the mind is uncentered phenomena do not become manifestWhen

how a disciple of the noble ones lives heedfullySee also SN SNOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Ajjheya on the bank of the river GangesHe saw a large log being carried along by the current near the bank of the river Ganges and on seeing it said to the monks Monks do you see that large log being carried along by the current of the river GangesYes lordMonks if that log doesnt veer toward the near shore doesnt veer toward the far shore doesnt sink in the middle doesnt get washed up on high ground doesnt get snared by human beings doesnt get snared by nonhuman beings doesnt get snared in a whirlpool and doesnt become rotten inside it will tend to the ocean tilt to the ocean incline to the oceanWhy is thatBecause the current of the river Ganges tends to the ocean tilts to the ocean inclines to the oceanIn the same way monks if you dont veer toward the near shore dont veer toward the far shore dont sink in the middle dont get washed up on high ground dont get snared by human beings dont get snared by nonhuman beings dont get snared in a whirlpool and dont become rotten inside you will tend to Unbinding tilt to Unbinding incline to UnbindingWhy is thatBecause right view tends to Unbinding tilts to Unbinding inclines to UnbindingWhen this was said a certain monk addressed the Blessed One What lord is the near shoreWhat is the far shoreWhat is sinking in the middleWhat is being washed up on high groundWhat is being snared by human beingsWhat is being snared by nonhuman beingsWhat is being snared by a whirlpoolWhat is becoming rotten insideThe near shore monks stands for the six internal sense mediaThe far shore stands for the six external sense mediaSinking in the middle stands for passion  delightBeing washed up on high ground stands for the conceit I amAnd what monks is being snared by human beingsThere is the case where a monk lives entangled with householders delighting with them and sorrowing with them happy when they are happy pained when they are in pain taking on their affairs as his own dutyThis is called being snared by human beingsAnd what monks is being snared by nonhuman beingsThere is the case where a certain monk lives the holy life in hopes of a certain company of devas By means of this virtue or practice or austerity or holy life I will become one sort of deva or another This is called being snared by nonhuman beingsBeing snared by a whirlpool stands for the five strings of sensuality And what monks is becoming rotten insideThere is the case where a certain monk is unprincipled evil unclean and suspect in his undertakings hidden in his actions not a contemplative though claiming to be one not leading the holy life though claiming to do so inwardly rotten oozing with desire filthy by natureThis is called becoming rotten insideNow at that time Nanda the cowherd was standing not far from the Blessed OneThen he said to the Blessed One Lord I dont veer toward the near shore I dont veer toward the far shore I wont sink in the middle I wont get washed up on high ground I wont get snared by human beings I wont get snared by nonhuman beings I wont get snared in a whirlpool and I wont become rotten insideIt would be good lord if I could obtain the Goingforth if I could obtain the Full AcceptanceIn that case Nanda lead the cows back to their ownersThe cows will go back lord out of attachment for their calvesLead the cows back to their owners NandaThen having led the cows back to their owners Nanda the cowherd went to the Blessed One and on arrival told him The cows lord have been led back to their ownersLet me obtain the Goingforth in the Blessed Ones presenceLet me obtain the Full AcceptanceSo Nanda the cowherd obtained the Goingforth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained the Full AcceptanceAnd not long after his Acceptance  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenNanda became another one of the arahantsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi tree  the tree of awakening  newly awakenedAnd on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseThen with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration he surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened OneAs he did so he saw living beings burning with the many fevers and aflame with the many fires born of passion aversion  delusionThen on realizing the significance of that he on that occasion exclaimedWhatever contemplatives or brahmans say that liberation from becoming is by means of becoming all of them are not released from becoming I sayAnd whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that escape from becoming is by means of nonbecoming all of them have not escaped from becoming I sayI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Muccalinda tree newly awakenedAnd on that occasion he sat for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseAnd on that occasion a great outofseason stormcloud rose up with seven days of rainy weather cold winds  intense darknessThen Muccalinda the nāga king  leaving his dwelling place and encircling the Blessed Ones body seven times with his coils  stood with his great hood spread over the Blessed One Dont let the Blessed One be disturbed by coldDont let the Blessed One be disturbed by heatDont let the Blessed One be disturbed by the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  creeping thingsThen with the passing of seven days the Blessed One emerged from that concentrationMuccalinda the nāga king realizing that the sky had cleared and was free of clouds unraveled his coils from the body of the Blessed One dropped his own appearance and assuming the appearance of a young man stood in front of the Blessed One with hands before his heart paying homageThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryAnd on that occasion VenSāriputta and VenMahā Moggallāna were staying in Pigeon CaveThen on a moonlit night VenSāriputta  his head newly shaven  was sitting in the open air having attained a certain level of concentrationAnd on that occasion two yakkhas who were companions were flying from north to south on some business or otherThey saw VenSāriputta  his head newly shaven  sitting in the open airSeeing him the first yakkha said to the second Im inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the headWhen this was said the second yakkha said to the first Enough of that my good friendDont lay a hand on the contemplativeHes an outstanding contemplative of great power  great mightA second time the first yakkha said to the second Im inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the headA second time the second yakkha said to the first Enough of that my good friendDont lay a hand on the contemplativeHes an outstanding contemplative of great power  great mightA third time the first yakkha said to the second Im inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the headA third time the second yakkha said to the first Enough of that my good friendDont lay a hand on the contemplativeHes an outstanding contemplative of great power  great mightThen the first yakkha ignoring the second yakkha gave VenSāriputta a blow on the headAnd with that blow he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall or split a great rocky cragBut right there the yakkha  yelling Im burning  fell into the Great HellNow VenMoggallāna  with his divine eye pure and surpassing the human  saw the yakkha give VenSāriputta a blow on the headSeeing this he went to VenSāriputta and on arrival said to him I hope you are well friend SāriputtaI hope you are comfortableI hope you are feeling no painI am well friend MoggallānaI am comfortableBut I do have a slight headacheHow amazing friend SāriputtaHow astoundingHow great your power  mightJust now a yakkha gave you a blow on the headSo great was that blow that he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall or split a great rocky cragBut all you say is this I am well friend MoggallānaI am comfortableBut I do have a slight headacheHow amazing friend MoggallānaHow astoundingHow great your power  mightWhere you saw a yakkha just now I didnt even see a dust devilThe Blessed One  with the divine earproperty pure and surpassing the human  heard those two great beings conversing in this wayThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedA variant of this verse is attributed to VenKhitaka at ThagThen Vacchagotta the wanderer went to VenMaha Moggallana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenMaha Moggallana Now then Master Moggallana is the cosmos eternalThat has not been declared by the Blessed One Vaccha The cosmos is eternal Well then Master Moggallana is the cosmos not eternalVaccha that too has not been declared by the Blessed One The cosmos is not eternal Then is the cosmos finite Is the cosmos infinite Is the body the same as the soul Is the body one thing and the soul another Does the Tathagata exist after death Does the Tathagata not exist after death Does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death Does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after deathVaccha that too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after deathNow Master Moggallana what is the cause what is the reason why  when wanderers of other sects are asked in this way they answer that The cosmos is eternal or The cosmos is not eternal or The cosmos is finite or The cosmos is infinite or The body is the same as the soul or The body is one thing and the soul another or The Tathagata exists after death or The Tathagata does not exist after death or The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death yet when Gotama the contemplative is asked in this way he does not answer that The cosmos is eternal or The cosmos is not eternal or The cosmos is finite or The cosmos is infinite or The body is the same as the soul or The body is one thing and the soul another or The Tathagata exists after death or The Tathagata does not exist after death or The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after deathVaccha the members of other sects assume of the eye that This is mine this is my self this is what I am They assume of the ear the nose the tongue the body the intellect that This is mine this is my self this is what I am That is why when asked in this way they answer that The cosmos is eternal or that The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death But the Tathagata worthy and rightly selfawakened does not assume of the eye that This is mine this is my self this is what I am He does not assume of the ear the nose the tongue the body the intellect that This is mine this is my self this is what I am That is why when asked in this way he does not answer that The cosmos is eternal or that The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death Then Vacchagotta the wanderer getting up from his seat went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly

Banyan ParkNow at that time a new reception hall had just been built by the Kapilavatthu Sakyans and it had not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative brahman or anyone at all in human formSo the Kapilavatthu Sakyans went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to him Lord a new reception hall has just been built by the Kapilavatthu Sakyans and it has not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative brahman or anyone at all in human formMay the Blessed One be the first to use itWhen the Blessed One has used it first the Kapilavatthu Sakyans will use it afterwardsThat will be for their longterm welfare  happinessThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceSensing his acquiescence the Kapilavatthu Sakyans got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him and then went to the new reception hallOn arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lampThen they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down stood to one sideAs they were standing there they said to him Lord the reception hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raisedIt is now time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fitSo the Blessed One putting on his robe and taking up his bowl  outer robe went together with a community of monks to the reception hallOn arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing eastThe community of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the Blessed OneThe Kapilavatthu Sakyans washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One  having spent most of the night instructing urging rousing  encouraging the Kapilavatthu Sakyans with a Dhamma talk  dismissed them saying The night is far past GotamasDo what you now think it is time to doResponding As you say lord the Kapilavatthu Sakyans rose from their seats bowed down to the Blessed One and  circumambulating him keeping him to their right  departedThen not long after the Kapilavatthu Sakyans had left the Blessed One addressed VenMaha Moggallana Moggallana the community of monks is free of drowsinessGive them a Dhamma talk of your own devisingMy back achesI will rest itVenMaha Moggallana responded As you say lordThen the Blessed One having arranged his outer robe folded in four lay down on his right side in the lions sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful  alert having made a mental note to get upThen VenMaha Moggallana addressed the monks Friend monksYes friend the monks respondedVenMaha Moggallana said Friends I will teach you a discourse on being soggy and a discourse on not being soggyListen and pay careful attentionI will speakAs you say friend the monks repliedVenMaha Moggallana said And how is one soggyThere is the case where a monk when seeing a form via the eye is in the case of pleasing forms committed to forms and in the case of displeasing forms afflicted by formsHe remains with bodymindfulness not present and with limited awarenessAnd he does not discern as it actually is present the awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease where those evil unskillful qualities that have arisen cease without traceWhen hearing a sound via the earWhen smelling an aroma via the noseWhen tasting a flavor via the tongueWhen touching a tactile sensation via the bodyWhen cognizing an idea via the intellect he is in the case of pleasing ideas committed to ideas and in the case of displeasing ideas afflicted by ideasHe remains with bodymindfulness not

tongue soggy with tactile sensations cognizable via the body soggy with ideas cognizable via the intellectWhen a monk dwells in this way then if Mara comes to him via the eye Mara gains entry Mara gains a footholdIf Mara comes to him via the ear nose tongue body intellect Mara gains entry Mara gains a footholdJust as if there were a shack made of reeds or a shack made of grass  dry desiccated more than a year old  and if a man were to come to it from the east with a burning grass torch fire would gain entry fire would gain a footholdIf a man were to come to it from the west north south from below from above From whatever direction the man would come to it with a burning grass torch fire would gain entry fire would gain a footholdIn the same way when a monk dwells in this way then if Mara comes to him via the eye Mara gains entry Mara gains a footholdIf Mara comes to him via the ear nose tongue body intellect Mara gains entry Mara gains a footholdAnd when a monk dwells in this way forms overpower himHe does not overpower formsSounds overpower him Aromas Flavors Tactile sensations Ideas overpower himHe does not overpower ideasThis is called a monk overpowered by forms overpowered by sounds overpowered by aromas overpowered by flavors overpowered by tactile sensations overpowered by ideas  one overpowered who does not overpowerHe is overpowered by evil unskillful qualities that defile that lead to further becoming that are miserable that result in suffering  stress that tend toward future birth aging  deathIts in this way friends that one is soggyAnd how is one not soggyThere is the case where a monk when seeing a form via the eye is not in the case of pleasing forms committed to forms nor in the case of displeasing forms afflicted by formsHe remains with bodymindfulness present and with immeasurable awarenessAnd he discerns as it actually is present the awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease where those evil unskillful qualities that have arisen

miserable that result in suffering  stress that tend toward future birth aging  deathIts in this way friends that one is not soggyThen the Blessed One got up and said to VenMaha Moggallana Good good MoggallanaWhat you have said to the monks about the discourse on being soggy and the discourse on not being soggy is goodThat is what VenMaha Moggallana said and the Teacher approvedGratified the monks delighted in VenMaha Moggallanas wordsright up to the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionThen friends I thought The signless concentration of the heart the signless concentration of the heart they say  now what is thatThen I thought In this a monk paying no attention to any distinguishing signs enters on and dwells in that concentration of the heart which is without signsThis is called The signless concentration of heartThen friends paying no attention to any distinguishing signs I entered on and dwelt in that concentration of the heart which is without signsBut as I dwelt thus the consciousnessconformingtosigns aroseAnd then friends the Blessed One came to me by his powers and said Moggallaana Moggallaana Brahman do not slacken off in the signless concentration make your mind steady make the mind onepointed concentrate your mind in the signless concentrationAnd after that friends paying no attention to any distinguishing signs I entered on and dwelt in the signless concentration of the heartNow friends if anyone were to truly declare Through the Teachers compassion the disciple gained great superknowledge he could rightly declare this of meI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere VenMahā Moggallāna addressed the monks Friend monksYes friend the monks responded to himVenMahā Moggallāna said Friends once as I was withdrawn in seclusion this train of thought arose to my awareness  Noble silence noble silence it is saidBut what is noble silence Then the thought occurred to me There is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceThis is called noble silence So with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWhile I remained in that dwelling I was assailed by perceptions  attention connected with directed thoughtThen the Blessed One coming to me through his power said MoggallānaMoggallānaBrahman dont be heedless of noble silenceEstablish your mind in noble silenceMake your mind unified in noble silenceConcentrate your mind in noble silence So at a later time with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWhen one speaking rightly would say of someone A disciple attained to greatness of direct knowledge through the assistance of the Teacher its of me that one speaking rightly would say A disciple attained to greatness of direct knowledge through the assistance of the TeacherI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migāras motherAnd on that occasion a dear and beloved grandson of Visākhā Migāras mother had diedSo Visākhā Migāras mother  her clothes wet her hair wet  went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her Why have you come here Visākhā  your clothes wet your hair wet  in the middle of the dayWhen this was said she said to the Blessed One My dear and beloved grandson has diedThis is why I have come here  my clothes wet my hair wet  in the middle of the dayVisākhā would you like to have as many children  grandchildren as there are people in SāvatthīYes lord I would like to have as many children  grandchildren as there are people in SāvatthīBut how many people in Sāvatthī die in the course of a daySometimes ten people die in Sāvatthī in the course of a day sometimes nine eight seven six five four three two Sometimes one person dies in Sāvatthī in the course of a daySāvatthī is never free from people dyingSo what do you think VisākhāWould you ever be free of wet clothes  wet hairNo lordEnough of my having so many children  grandchildrenVisākhā those who have a hundred dear ones have a hundred sufferingsThose who have ninety dear ones have ninety sufferingsThose who have eighty seventy sixty fifty forty thirty twenty ten nine eight seven six five four three two Those who have one dear one have one sufferingThose who have no dear ones have no sufferingsThey are free from sorrow free from stain free from lamentation I tell youThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThis noble teaching on how to respond when faced with anger is placed in a mythical settingThe story is told by the Buddha of a great war between devas and asuras that took place in ancient timesThe devas are ultimately victorious and capture Vepacitti the ruler of the asurasBound in chains he is brought to Tavatimsa and into the presence of Sakka ruler of the godsBeing the demon that he his Vepacitti hurls a torrent of abuse at his captor calling him all sorts of insulting namesSakka however is unmoved inspiring Matali his charioteer to begin the following poetic exchangeThe poem is in the prevalent vatta meter with eight syllables per line and contains much subtle wordplayFor example the words bala and bala dance with one another throughout the piece nowhere more intimately than in the frolicking alliteration of lines andThe linking of the word titikkhati with the similarly sounding tikicchati is also a poignant touch that is hardly accidentalThis exchange shows well how the Buddha adapted the heroic ideals of his warriors heritage to the inner struggle for selfmasteryThe strength of the victorious Sakka lies in his wisdom and forbearanceThe weakness of the vanquished asura comes from his lack of understanding which renders him helpless to resist the passions raging withinThough these verses were penned years ago the truth behind them is timelessIt is the same that has helped many nonviolent social and political reform movements achieve dramatic results in our own centuryConquest is only the apparent victory of the shortsighted while transformation of oneself and others is the more lasting victory of the wiseRemaining unprovoked in the face of anger and hostility still offers the best hope for healing our troubled worldWhat a vivid image of insight meditationThe practice of mindfulness requires the focused attention of an acrobat balancing on a bamboo poleOne lapse one moment of distraction or carelessness and he tumbles to the groundThe picture is one of intensive inner awareness and concentration  almost a matter of life and deathBut the Buddhas parable goes even further for the safety and well being of the bamboo acrobats beloved assistant also hangs upon the masters successful practice of mindfulnessThe story is telling us that ultimately we are responsible for our own balance and would be foolish to direct our attention to others while neglecting our own inner focusAnd yet others are directly affected by how well we do thisInsight meditation is not a selfish undertaking because the quality of our interaction with all those around us depends on the degree of our own selfunderstanding and selfcontrolI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migāras motherAnd on that occasion Visākhā Migāras mother had some dealings with King Pasenadi Kosala that he did not settle as she had wishedSo in the middle of the day she went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her Well now Visākhā where are you coming from in the middle of the dayJust now lord I had some dealings with King Pasenadi Kosala that he did not settle as I had wishedThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedTranslators note This discourse dramatizes a problem that often arises in meditation practice  a speculative question arises that if followed pulls one out of concentrationSister Vajira shows how to deal with the situation recognize that the terms in which the question is expressed are just that  terms  and that whatever reality there is in the issue raised by the question can be reduced to phenomena observable in the immediate presentIn ultimate terms this comes down to the arising and passing away of stress which should be observed and comprehended to the point where one can see through to that which neither arises nor passes awayAt SavatthiThen early in the morning Vajira the nun put on her robes and taking her bowl  outer robe went into Savatthi for almsWhen she had gone for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the dayHaving gone deep into the Grove of the Blind she sat down at the foot of a tree for the days abidingThen Mara the Evil One wanting to arouse fear horripilation  terror in her wanting to make her fall away from concentration approached her  addressed her in verseThen the thought occurred to Vajira the nun Now who has recited this verse  a human being or a nonhuman one Then it occurred to her This is Mara the Evil One who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear horripilation  terror in me wanting to make me fall away from concentrationThen having understood that This is Mara the Evil One she replied to him in versesThen Mara the Evil One  sad  dejected at realizing Vajira the nun knows me  vanished right thereIt would be well for me Lord if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone in seclusion unwearied ardent and resoluteMonk if you cling to anything you are in bondage to MaaraIf you do not cling you are free of the Evil OneI have understood Blessed One I have understood WellfarerBut how monk do you understand in full what I have stated in briefLord if one clings to the body one is in bondage to MaaraIf one does not cling to the body one is free of the Evil OneThat Lord is how I understand in full the sense of what the Blessed One has stated in briefGood good monkYou have well understood in full the sense of what I stated in briefIf you cling to the body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness you are in bondage to MaaraIf you do not cling you are free of the Evil OneThat is how the sense of what I have stated in brief is to be understood in fullAt SavatthiThen early in the morning Sela the nun put on her robes and taking her bowl  outer robe went into Savatthi for almsWhen she had gone for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the dayHaving gone deep into the Grove of the Blind she sat down at the foot of a tree for the days abidingThen Mara the Evil One wanting to arouse fear horripilation  terror in her wanting to make her fall away from concentration approached her  addressed her

dejected at realizing Sela the nun knows me  vanished right thereIn the sky O monks various kinds of winds are blowing winds from the east west north and south winds carrying dust and winds without dust winds hot and cold gentle and fierceSimilarly monks there arise in this body various kinds of feelings pleasant feelings arise painful feelings arise and neutral feelings ariseStaying at SavatthiMonks gains offerings  fame are a cruel thing a harsh bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondageOnce monks a large family of turtles had lived for a long time in a certain freshwater lakeThen one turtle said to another My dear turtle dont go to that area But the turtle went to that area and because of that a hunter lanced him with a harpoonSo he went back to the first turtleThe first turtle saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to him I hope dear turtle that you didnt go to that areaI went to that area dear turtleThen I hope you havent been wounded or hurtI havent been wounded or hurt but theres this cord that keeps dragging around behind meYes dear turtle youre wounded youre hurtIt was because of that cord that your father  grandfather fell into misfortune  disasterNow go dear turtleYou are no longer one of usThe hunter monks stands for Mara the Evil OneThe harpoon stands for gains offerings  fameThe cord stands for delight  passionAny monk who relishes  revels in gains offerings  fame that have arisen is called a monk lanced by the harpoon who has fallen into misfortune  disasterThe Evil One can do with him as he willThats how cruel gains offerings  fame are a harsh bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondageSo you should train yourselves We will put aside any gains offerings  fame that have arisen and we will not let any gains offerings  fame that have arisen keep our minds consumed Thats how you should train yourselvesSee also SN SNStaying at SavatthiSuppose monks that there were a pond fifty leagues wide fifty leagues long  fifty leagues deep filled to overflowing with water so that a crow could drink from it and a man would draw some water out of it with the tip of a blade of grassWhat do you thinkWhich would be greater the water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass or the water in the pondThe water in the pond would be far greater lordThe water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass would be next to nothingIt wouldnt be a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth  the water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass  when compared with the water in the pondIn the same way monks for a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view an individual who has broken through the suffering  stress that is totally ended  extinguished is far greaterThat which remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing its not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth when compared with the previous mass of sufferingThats how great the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma monksThats how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eyeMonks suppose that this great earth were totally covered with water and a man were to toss a yoke with a single hole thereA wind from the east would push it west a wind from the west would push it eastA wind from the north would push it south a wind from the south would push it northAnd suppose a blind seaturtle were thereIt would come to the surface once every one hundred yearsNow what do you think would that blind seaturtle coming to the surface once every one hundred years stick his neck into the yoke with a single holeIt would be a sheer coincidence lord that the blind seaturtle coming to the surface once every one hundred years would stick his neck into the yoke with a single holeIts likewise a sheer coincidence that one obtains the human stateIts likewise a sheer coincidence that a Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened arises in the worldIts likewise a sheer coincidence that a doctrine  discipline expounded by a Tathagata appears in the worldNow this human state has been obtainedA Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened has arisen in the worldA doctrine  discipline expounded by a Tathagata appears in the worldTherefore your duty is the contemplation This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress Your duty is the contemplation This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressMonks when a monk knows as they really are both the arising and the destruction of states productive of suffering then indeed the sensepleasures are truly seen by himWhen he sees the sensepleasures the desire and love for sensepleasures the infatuation and feverish longing for sensepleasures that is inherent in them all this does not obsess himHis life and practice are so informed with wisdom that living thus he is not assailed by longing and depression which are evil and unskilled statesWhen monks a monk lives and practices like this it occasionally happens that through a lapse of mindfulness evil and unskilled states arise memories and thoughts pertaining to the fettersHis mindfulness is aroused only slowly but then he soon abandons that state drives it out abolishes it puts an end to itJust as if monks a man were to let fall two or three drops of water into an iron pot that had been heated all day those few drops would soon be wiped out and vanish  in the same way it occasionally happens to a monk living and practicing like this but he soon puts an end to itThus monks if a monks life and practice are so informed with wisdom that living thus he is not assailed by longing and depression which are evil states then monks if a kings ministers friends favorites kinsmen or bloodrelations should come and offer him wealth saying Come good masterWhy let these yellow robes torment youWhy go around with shaven head and bowlCome on return to the lower life enjoy possessions and do works of merit  monks for a monk so living and practicing to reject the training and revert to the lower life would just be impossibleOnce upon a time monks a hardshelled tortoise was foraging for food in the evening along the shore of a lakeAnd a jackal was also foraging for food in the evening along the shore of the lakeThe tortoise saw the jackal from afar foraging for food and so  withdrawing its four legs with its neck as a fifth into its own shell  it remained perfectly quiet and stillBut the jackal also saw the tortoise from afar foraging for food and so it went to the tortoise and on arrival hovered around it As soon as the tortoise stretches out one or another of its four limbs  or its neck as a fifth  Ill seize it right there tear it off and eat it But when the tortoise didnt stretch out any of its four limbs  or its neck as a fifth  the jackal not having gotten any opportunity lost interest and leftIn the same way monks Mara is continually ceaselessly hovering around you Perhaps Ill get an opportunity by means of the eye the ear the nose the tongue the bodyPerhaps Ill get an opportunity by means of the intellect Thus monks you should dwell with the doors to your senses wellguardedOn seeing a form with the eye do not grasp at any theme or details by which  if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail youPractice for its restraintGuard the faculty of the eyeSecure your restraint with regard to the faculty of the eyeOn hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an aroma with the noseOn tasting a flavor with the tongueOn touching a tactile sensation with the bodyOn cognizing an idea with the intellect do not grasp at any theme or details by which  if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail youPractice for its restraintGuard the faculty of the intellectSecure your restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellectWhen you dwell with the doors to your senses wellguarded Mara not getting any opportunity will lose interest and leave just as the jackal did with the tortoiseSee also SNI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi tree  the tree of awakening  newly awakenedAnd on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseThen with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration in the third watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent coarising in forward and reverse order thusIn other wordsThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAt SavatthiThere the Blessed One said Monks suppose there were a river flowing down from the mountains going far its current swift carrying everything with it and  holding on to both banks  kasa grasses kusa grasses reeds birana grasses  trees were growingThen a man swept away by the current would grab hold of the kasa grasses but they would tear away and so from that cause he would come to disasterHe would grab hold of the kusa grasses the reeds the birana grasses the trees but they would tear away and so from that cause he would come to disasterIn the same way there is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formThat form tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disasterHe assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feelingThat feeling tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disasterHe assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perceptionThat perception tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disasterHe assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabricationsThose fabrications tear away from him and so from that cause he would come to disasterHe assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in

future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling whatsoeverAny perception whatsoeverAny fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldTranslators note A comparative study among the records of various early Buddhist schools suggests that the verses here like those in I were originally separate poems spoken on separate occasions and that they have been gathered together because they share the same refrainStaying at SavatthiMonks suppose there were a sharpbladed spear and a man were to come along saying With my hand or fist I will bend back this sharpbladed spear fold it in two and roll it up What do you thinkWould that man be able with his hand or fist to bend back that sharpbladed spear fold it in two and roll it upNo lordWhy is thatBecause a sharpbladed spear isnt easy to bend back fold in two or roll upThe man would simply reap his share of trouble  vexationIn the same way monks when a monks awarenessrelease through goodwill is cultivated developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated  wellundertaken any nonhuman being who would think of possessing that monks mind would simply reap his share of trouble  vexationThus you should train yourselves Our awarenessrelease through goodwill will be cultivated developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated  wellundertakenThats how you should train yourselvesSee also ANTranslators note The refrain in this sutta is a subject of controversyThe text literally says Wander alone like a swordhorn which is the Pali term for rhinocerosThe commentary however insists that this term refers not to the animal but to its horn for the Indian rhinoceros unlike the African has only one hornStill some scholars have noted that while the Indian rhinoceros is a solitary animal rhinoceros horns dont wander and that in other verses in the Pali canon the phrase wander alone like takes a person or an animal not an animal part for its objectThus for example in Dhp one is told to wander alone like a king renouncing his kingdom like the elephant in the Matanga woods his herd Its possible that the rhinoceros was chosen here as an example of solitary wandering both because of its habits and because of its unusual single hornHowever in a translation its necessary to choose one reading over the otherThus because wandering like a rhinoceros sounds more natural than wandering like a horn I have chosen the former renderingKeep in mind though that the singularity of the rhinoceros horn reinforces the imageAs noted under I there is evidence suggesting that the verses here were originally separate poems composed on separate occasions and that they have been gathered together because of their common refrainI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Wood at the Gabled HallNow on that occasion the Blessed One with many lines of reasoning was giving the monks a talk on the unattractiveness was speaking in praise of unattractiveness was speaking in praise of the development of

Monks this concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisenJust as when in the last month of the hot season a great raincloud out of season immediately disperses  allays the dust  dirt that have been stirred up in the same way this concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisenAnd how is concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisenThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he

exhibit growth increase  proliferationWere someone to say I will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications that would be impossibleIf a monk abandons passion for the property of formIf a monk abandons passion for the property of feelingIf a monk abandons passion for the property of perceptionIf a monk abandons passion for the property of fabricationsIf a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness then owing to the abandonment of passion the support is cut off and there is no base for consciousnessConsciousness thus unestablished not proliferating not performing any function is releasedOwing to its release it is steadyOwing to its steadiness it is contentedOwing to its contentment it is not agitatedNot agitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is

longer poem of thirty seven verses preserved in the TheragathaThey describe a man who continues to spend his time in solitary meditation in the forest even after having attained the full awakening of the arahantThe elder keeps the dharma wheel of the Buddhas teaching rolling by such dedication to meditation practice and by exemplifying the attitude of nonattachment in all that he doesThe phrase may also refer to Sariputtas pivotal role in the development of the Abhidhamma traditionThe ocean the ocean monks says the ignorant worldlingBut that is not the ocean in the Ariyan discipline that is just a great heap of water a great flood of waterThe human eye monks is the ocean its impulsion is produced by visible formsWhoever withstands its buffeting produced by visible forms is said to have

lordThat jackal is suffering from mangeHe finds no pleasure whether he goes to a bluff to the foot of a tree or to the open airWherever he goes wherever he stands wherever he sits wherever he lies down he is sunk in miseryIn the same way there is the case where a certain monk is conquered by gains offerings  fame his mind consumedHe finds no pleasure whether he goes to an empty dwelling to the foot of a tree or to the open airWherever he goes wherever he stands wherever he sits wherever he lies down he is sunk in miseryThats how cruel gains offerings  fame are a harsh bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondageThus you should train yourselves We will put aside any gains offerings  fame that have arisen and we will not let any gains offerings  fame that have arisen keep our minds consumed Thats how you should train yourselvesSee also SN SNMonks be islands unto yourselves be your own refuge having no other let the Dhamma be an island and a refuge to you

uninstructed worldling Change occurs in this mans body and it becomes differentOn account of this change and difference sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ariseBut seeing the bodys impermanence its changeability its waning its ceasing he says formerly as now all bodies were impermanent and unsatisfactory and subject to change Thus seeing this as it really is with perfect insight he abandons all sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairHe is not worried at their abandonment but unworried lives at ease and thus living at ease he is said to be assuredly deliveredStaying at SavatthiSuppose monks that the great ocean were to go to extinction to its total end except for two or three drops of waterWhat do you thinkWhich would be greater the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction to its total end or the two or three remaining drops of waterLord the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction to its total end would be far greaterThe two or three remaining drops of water would be next to nothingThey wouldnt be a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth  the two or three remaining drops of water  when compared with the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction to its total endIn the same way monks for a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view an individual who has broken through the suffering  stress that is totally ended  extinguished is far greaterThat which remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing its not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth when compared with the previous mass of sufferingThats how great the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma monksThats how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eyeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one sideAs she was standing there she recited these verses in the Blessed Ones presenceMonks if anyone were to say Without having

composed this poem was Pajapati the Buddhas stepmother and a Queen of the SakyasHer younger sister was Maya married to King Suddhodana only after Pajapati herself was unable to conceive an heirQueen Maya died in childbirth and it was Pajapati who raised Gotama as her own sonAfter his enlightenment Pajapati also left the palace and became the first of the bhikkhunis the order of nunsThe third stanza suggests that her attainments included the recollection of past lives by which she was able to verify empirically the truth of continual rebirth the flowing on from one life to anotherThis process as she mentions in her poem is fueled by craving and by not understanding In the second and fourth stanzas Pajapati declares her attainment of nibbana of final and complete liberation in this very lifeIt is remarkable to think that when Maya is remembered in the last stanza the author has in mind not the icon of motherhood and sacrifice that Maya became in the Buddhist tradition but a dearlyloved younger sister who died tragically young without ever seeing what her son had becomeThen VenMalunkyaputta who was ardent  resolute went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down

should say My mind is raised above the Brahma worlds and is brought to the cessation of selfidentity then I tell you Mahanama there is no difference  in terms of release  between the release of that lay follower whose mind is released and the release of a monk whose mind is releasedThe BuddhaThe BuddhaThe BuddhaIf we assume that the instrumental case in the first sentence is meant in the sense of by means of then we are dealing  as Magandiya asserts  with plain nonsense the first sentence would say that a person cannot achieve purity by means of views etc while the second sentence would be saying that he cannot achieve purity by means of no view etcThe fact that the two sentences place the relevant terms in different grammatical cases though suggests that they are talking about two different kinds of relationshipsIf we take the instrumental in the first sentence in the sense of in terms of then the stanza not only makes sense but also fits in with teachings of the rest of the Pali discourses a person cannot be said to be pure simply because heshe holds to a particular view body of learning etcPurity is not defined in those termsThe second sentence goes on to say that a person doesnt arrive at purity from a lack of view etcPutting the two sentences together with the third the message is this One uses right views learning knowledge precepts  practices as a path a means for arriving at purityOnce one arrives one lets go of the path for the purity of inner peace in its ultimate sense is something transcending the means by which it is reachedIn the stanza immediately following this one its obvious that Magandiya has not caught this distinctionFor further illustrations of the role of Right View in taking one to a dimension beyond all views see AN AN and

large number of youths passed by as if jeering not far from the Blessed OneThe Blessed One saw the large number of youths passing by as if jeering not far awayThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryAnd on that occasion VenMahā Kassapa was staying at the Pipphali Cave sitting for seven days in a single session having attained a certain level of concentrationThen with the passing of seven days he emerged from that concentrationTo him emerging from that concentration the thought occurred What if I were to go into Rājagaha for almsNow on that occasion devatās were in a state of eagerness for the chance to give alms to VenMahā KassapaBut VenMahā Kassapa turning down those devatās early in the morning adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went into Rājagaha for almsNow on that occasion Sakka the devaking wanted to give alms to VenMahā KassapaSo assuming the appearance of a weaver he was working a loom while Sujātā an asuramaiden filled the shuttleThen as VenMahā Kassapa was going on an almsround that bypassed no donors in Rājagaha he arrived at Sakkas homeSakka saw him coming from afar and on seeing him came out of house to meet himTaking the bowl from his hand entered the house took cooked rice from the pot filled the bowl and gave it back to VenMahā KassapaAnd that gift of alms included many kinds of curry many kinds of saucesThe thought occurred to VenMahā Kassapa Now who is this being with such power  might as this Then the thought occurred to him This is Sakka the devaking isnt it On realizing this he said to Sakka Is this your doing KosiyaDont ever do anything like this againWe too need merit VenKassapaWe too have use for meritThen bowing down to VenMahā Kassapa and circling him to the right Sakka rose up into the air and while up in the sky exclaimed three timesO the alms the foremost alms wellestablished in KassapaO the alms the foremost alms wellestablished in KassapaO the alms the foremost alms wellestablished in KassapaThe Blessed One  with his divine hearingproperty surpassing that of the human  heard Sakka the devaking while up in the sky exclaiming three timesO the alms the foremost alms wellestablished in KassapaO the alms the foremost

between Savatthi and Saketa at ToranavatthuThen King Pasenadi Kosala while traveling from Saketa to Savatthi took up a onenight residence between Savatthia and Saketa at ToranavatthuThen he addressed a certain man Come now my good manFind out if in Toranavatthu theres the sort of brahman or contemplative I might visit todayAs you say sire the man replied to the king but having roamed all over Toranavatthu he did not see the sort of brahman or contemplative the king might visitBut he did see the bhikkhuni Khema residing in ToranavatthuOn seeing her he went to King Pasenadi Kosala and on arrival said to him Sire in Toranavatthu there is no brahman or contemplative of the sort your majesty might visitBut there is however a bhikkhuni named Khema a disciple of the Blessed One worthy and rightly selfawakenedAnd of this lady this admirable report has spread about She is wise competent intelligent learned a fluent speaker admirable in her ingenuity Let your majesty visit herThen King Pasenadi Kosala went to the bhikkhuni Khema and on arrival having bowed down to her sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to her Now then lady does the Tathagata exist after deathThat great king has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata exists after death Well then lady does the Tathagata not exist after deathGreat king that too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata does not exist after death Then does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after deathThat has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death Well then does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after deathThat too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death Now lady when asked if the Tathagata exists after death you say That has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata exists after death When asked if the Tathagata does not exist after death both exists and does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death you say That too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death Now what is the cause what is the reason why that has not been declared by the Blessed OneVery well then great king I will question you in return about this very same matterAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think great king Do you have an accountant or actuary or mathematician who can count the grains of sand in the river Ganges as so many grains of sand or so many hundreds of grains of sand or so many thousands of grains of sand or so many hundreds of thousands of grains of sandNo ladyThen do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician who can count the water in the great ocean as so many buckets of water or so many hundreds of buckets of water or so many thousands of buckets of water or so many hundreds of thousands of buckets of waterNo ladyWhy is thatThe great ocean is deep boundless hard to fathomEven so great king any physical form by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingFreed from the classification of form great king the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the oceanThe Tathagata

death doesnt applyAny feeling Any perception Any mental fabricationAny consciousness by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingFreed from the classification of consciousness great king the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the oceanThe Tathagata exists after death doesnt applyThe Tathagata doesnt exist after death doesnt applyThe Tathagata both exists and doesnt exist after death doesnt applyThe Tathagata neither exists nor doesnt exist after death doesnt apply Then King Pasenadi Kosala delighting in  approving of the bhikkhuni Khemas words got up from his seat bowed down to her and  keeping her to his right  departedThen at another time he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there Amazing lordAstoundingHow the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teachingRecently lord I went to the bhikkhuni Khema and on arrival asked her about this matter and she answered me with the same words the same phrasing as the Blessed OneAmazing lordAstoundingHow the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teachingNow lord we must goMany are our duties many our responsibilitiesThen do great king what you think it is now time to doSo King Pasenadi Kosala delighting in and approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and  keeping him to his right  departedThis explanation which borrows from Sister Vajiras verse in SN misses an important point raised in SNand SNIn SNthe Buddha states that one is measured and classified by what one is obsessed withIf one is not obsessed with anything then one is not measured or classified by it in the here and nowIn SNthe Buddha points out that the term being applies only where there is craving and passionThe Tathagata freed from craving and passion is thus indescribable in the present even though he obviously still functions in the presentSNelaborates on this point in great detailAnother problem raised by the Commentarys explanation for this sutta is how it would define the Tathagatas qualities and character for what are they composed of aside from aggregatesI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryAnd on that occasion VenMahā Kassapa was staying at the Pipphali Cave afflicted in pain  seriously illThen at a later time he recovered from his illnessWhen he had recovered from the illness the thought occurred to him What if I were to go into Rājagaha for almsNow on that occasion devatās were in a state of eagerness for the chance to give alms to VenMahā KassapaBut VenMahā Kassapa turning down those devatās early in the morning adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor the streets of the indigent the streets of the weaversThe Blessed One saw that VenMahā Kassapa had gone into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor the streets of the indigent the streets of the weaversThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedMonks just as if a fisherman were to cast a baited hook into a deep lake and a fish with its eye out for food would swallow it  so that the fish that had thus swallowed the fishermans hook would fall into misfortune  disaster and the fisherman could do with it as he will  in the same way there are these six hooks in the world for the misfortune of beings for the slaughter of those that breatheWhich sixThere are forms monks cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingIf a monk relishes

range and into the territory of othersIf only I had kept to my proper range today to my own ancestral territory this hawk would have been no match for me in battleBut what is your proper range the hawk askedWhat is your own ancestral territoryA newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned upSo the hawk without bragging about its own strength without mentioning its own strength let go of the quailGo quail but even when you have gone there you wont escape meThen the quail having gone to a newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned up and climbing up on top of a large clump of earth stood taunting the hawk Now come and get me you hawkNow come and get me you hawkSo the hawk without bragging about its own strength without mentioning its own strength folded its two wings and suddenly swooped down toward the quailWhen the quail knew The hawk is coming at me full speed it slipped behind the clump of earth and right there the hawk shattered its own breastThis is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of othersFor this reason you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of othersIn one who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others Mara gains an opening Mara gains a footholdAnd what for a monk is not his proper range and is the territory of othersThe five

the Samyutta Nikaya with a paradoxThe Commentary informs us that the Buddha teaches the devata in terms of the paradox in order to subdue her prideTo give this paradox some context you might want to read other passages from the Canon that discuss right effortI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to him she stood to one sideAs she was standing there she said to him Tell me dear sir how you crossed over the floodI crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in placeBut how dear sir did you cross over the flood without pushing forward without staying in placeWhen I pushed forward I was whirled aboutWhen I stayed in place I sankAnd so I crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in placeThat is what the devata saidThe Teacher approvedRealizing that The Teacher has approved of me she bowed down to him circumambulated him  keeping him to her right  and then vanished right thereAt SavatthiMonks there

eatI too brahman plow  sowHaving plowed  sown I eatBut contemplative I dont see the Master Gotamas yoke or plow plowshare goad or oxen and yet the Master Gotama says this I too brahman plow  sowHaving plowed  sown I eat Then the Kasi Bharadvaja addressed the Blessed One with a verseThen Kasi Bharadvaja having heaped up milkrice in a large bronze serving bowl offered it to the Blessed One May Master Gotama eat milkriceThe master is a plowman for the Master Gotama plows the plowing that has as its fruit the deathlessThen to whom Master Gotama should I give this milkriceBrahman I dont see that person in this world  with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its royalty  common people  by whom this milkrice having been eaten would be rightly digested aside from a Tathagata or a Tathagatas discipleIn that case brahman throw the milkrice away in a place without vegetation or dump it in water with no living beingsSo Kasi Bharadvaja dumped the milkrice in water with no living beingsAnd the milkrice when dropped in the water hissed  sizzled seethed  steamedJust as an iron ball heated all day when tossed in the water hisses  sizzles seethes  steams in the same way the

Buddhist practice will resonate with almost anyone who has embarked on the temporary homelessness of a retreat at IMS or elsewhereThe steady reply of the Buddha here admonishes Kamada to overcome his weaknesses and find the nobility within himself to tread the noble pathThe tone of this poem is so typical of the approach the Buddha displays throughout the Pali texts  compassionate yet firm reasoned but profoundly inspiringThe progression is also characteristic  from virtue to joy tranquillity to diligent development and finally cutting through the snares of death and rebirth and proceeding to undying nibbanaKamada is reminded that others have done gotten and tamed what he is having such difficulty doing getting and tamingOthers have taken the hard path to the goal and all he lacks is the resolve the heros determination to forge ahead despite the obstaclesThe lyrical almost singsong quality of the verse has been hopefully retained by translating it in something like its original meter of eight syllables per lineOn one occasion a large number of senior monks were living near Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango GroveThen Citta the householder went to them and on arrival having bowed down to them sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to them Venerable sirs may the senior monks acquiesce to tomorrows meal from meThe senior monks acquiesced by silenceThen Citta the householder sensing the senior monks acquiescence got up from his seat and having bowed down to them circumambulated them  keeping them to his right  and leftWhen the night had passed the senior monks put on their robes in the early morning and  taking their bowls  outer robes  went to Cittas residenceThere they sat down on the appointed seatsThen Citta the householder with his own hand served  satisfied them with exquisite milkrice mixed with gheeWhen the senior monks had finished eating and had rinsed their bowls  hands they got up from their seats and leftCitta the householder having said Give away the rest followed behind the senior monksNow on that occasion it was hot  swelteringThe senior monks went along with their bodies melting as it were from the meal they had finishedAnd on that occasion VenMahaka was the most junior of all the monks in that CommunityHe said to the senior monk Wouldnt it be nice venerable elder if a cool wind were to blow and there were a thundering cloud and rain would fall in scattered dropsYes friend Mahaka that would be nice Then VenMahaka willed a psychic feat such that a cool wind blew a thundering cloud developed and the rain fell in scattered dropsThe thought occurred to Citta the householder Such is the psychic power of the most junior of all the monks in this CommunityThen when VenMahaka reached the monasterypark he said to the senior monk Is that enough venerable sirThats enough friend Mahaka  what you have done what you have offeredThen the monks went to their separate dwellings and VenMahaka went to hisThen Citta the householder went to VenMahaka and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to him It would be good venerable sir if Master Mahaka would show me a superior human attainment a miracle of psychic powerIn that case householder spread out your upper robe on the porch and put a pile of grass on itResponding As you say venerable sir Citta the householder spread out his upper robe on the porch and put a pile of grass on itThen VenMahaka having entered his dwelling and bolted the door willed a psychic feat such that flame shot through the keyhole and the space around the door burning up the grass but not the robeThen Citta the householder having shaken out the robe stood to one side  in awe his hair standing on endVenMahaka came out of his dwelling and said Is that enough householderThats enough venerable sir  what you have done what you have offeredMay Master Mahaka delight in the charming Wild Mango Grove at MacchikasandaI will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisitesThat is admirably said householderThen VenMahaka  having set his lodging in order and taking his bowl  robes  left MacchikasandaAnd in leaving Macchikasanda he was gone for good and never returnedOn one occasion VenSariputta and VenMaha Kotthita were staying near Varanasi in the Game Refuge at IsipatanaThen in the evening VenMaha Kotthita emerged from his seclusion and went to VenSariputta and exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenSariputta Now then friend Sariputta does the Tathagata exist after deathThat friend has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata exists after death Well then friend Sariputta does the Tathagata not exist after deathFriend that too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata does not exist after death Then does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after deathThat has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death Well then does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after deathThat too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death Now friend Sariputta when asked if the Tathagata exists after death you say That has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata exists after death When asked if the Tathagata does not exist after death both exists and does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death you say That too has not been declared by the Blessed One The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death Now what is the cause what is the reason why that has not been declared by the Blessed OneFor one whose passion for form has not been removed whose desire affection thirst fever craving for form has not been removed there occurs the thought The Tathagata exists after death or The Tathagata does not exist after death or The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after deathFor one whose passion for feeling has not been removedFor one whose passion for perception has not been removedFor one whose passion for fabrications has not been removedFor one whose passion for consciousness has not been removed whose desire affection thirst fever craving for consciousness has not been removed there occurs the thought The Tathagata exists after death or The Tathagata does not exist after death or The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after deathBut for one whose passion for form has been removed whose desire affection thirst fever craving for form has been removed the thought The Tathagata exists after death or The Tathagata does not exist after death or The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesnt occurFor one whose passion for feeling has been removedFor one whose passion for perception has been removedFor one whose passion for fabrications has been removedFor one whose passion for consciousness has been removed whose desire affection thirst fever craving for consciousness has been removed the thought The Tathagata exists after death or The Tathagata does not exist after death or The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesnt occurThis is the cause this is the reason why that has not been declared by the Blessed OneSee also other suttas in the Avyakata Samyutta ANI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Gayā at Gayā HeadAnd on that occasion many ascetics  on the cold winter nights of the BetweentheEights when the snow was falling in Gayā  jumped up in the water jumped down in the water did a jumpingupdown in the water poured and performed the fire sacrifice Through this there is purityThe Blessed One saw those many ascetics  on the cold winter nights of the BetweentheEights when the snow was falling in Gayā  jumping up in the water jumping down in the water doing a jumpingupdown in the water pouring and performing the fire sacrifice Through this there is purityThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedCraving for becoming and nonbecoming are the two most subtle forms of craving that lead to continued existence  and suffering  in the round of birth  deathStaying at SavatthiMonks there once was a time when the Dasarahas had a large drum called Summoner Whenever Summoner was split the Dasarahas inserted another peg in it until the time came when Summoners original wooden body had disappeared and only a conglomeration of pegs remainedIn the same way in the course of the future there will be monks who wont listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata  deep deep in their meaning transcendent connected with emptiness  are being recitedThey wont lend ear wont set their hearts on knowing them wont regard these teachings as worth grasping or masteringBut they will listen when discourses that are literary works  the works of poets elegant in sound elegant in rhetoric the work of outsiders words of disciples  are recitedThey will lend ear and set their hearts on knowing themThey will regard these teachings as worth grasping  masteringIn this way the disappearance of the discourses that are words of the Tathagata  deep deep in their meaning transcendent connected with emptiness  will come aboutThus you should train yourselves We will listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata  deep deep in their meaning transcendent connected with

stanzasIt has three primary meanings covered successively through the poem  lovely or wellformed  good thorough or well done and  it is often used as a simple intensive prefix meaning something like very or mostThe plaintive call of the peacock commonplace during the threemonth rainy season retreats undertaken by the Buddhas monks and nuns is a favorite theme of their nature poetry preserved in the Theragatha and the TherigathaThe first stanza reflects the balanced appreciation of the natural world that comes from the focused but equanimous mind in meditationPleasurable sensations such as the ones described here in response to the beauty of nature can be experienced mindfully by those devoid of craving without the tendency present in most of us to cling to the pleasure or resist its inevitable passing awayEarly Buddhist poetry often points out the beauties of nature but seldom lingers on themThe second stanza leads one on to higher aspirationsIt inspires the listener to give up the mundane pursuits of the worldly life engage in the purifying and clarifying enterprise of meditation tread diligently the straight path pointed out by the Buddha and finally attain in this very lifetime the perfection of the human conditionOn one occasion many elder monks were staying at Kosambi in Ghositas ParkAnd at that time VenKhemaka was staying at the Jujube Tree Park diseased in pain

making it plain  just as he has in fact declared it taught it described it set it forth revealed it explained it made it plainThat is what VenKhemaka saidGratified the elder monks delighted in his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the minds of sixtysome monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentations  as was VenKhemakasOn that occasion Citta the householder was diseased in pain severely illThen a large number of garden devas forest devas tree devas and devas inhabiting herbs grasses  forest giants assembled and said to him Make a wish householder In the

with its devas Māras  Brahmas with its people with their contemplatives  brahmans their royalty  commonfolk  in whom when it was ingested it would go to a healthy change aside from the TathāgataResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Cunda buried the remaining pigdelicacy in a pit went to the Blessed One and on arrival after bowing down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One  after instructing urging rousing  encouraging him with Dhammatalk  got up from his seat and leftThen in the Blessed One after he had eaten Cundas meal there arose a severe

said to Vennanda nanda please fetch me some waterI am thirstyI will drinkResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Vennanda  taking a bowl  went to the riverAnd the meager river that cut by the wheels had been flowing turbid  disturbed on his approach flowed pristine clear  undisturbedThe thought occurred to him How amazingHow astounding the great power  great might of the Tathāgata in that this meager river that cut by the wheels was flowing turbid  disturbed on my approach flowed pristine clear  undisturbed Fetching water with the bowl he went to the Blessed One and on arrival said How

nothing further to add to what he has doneI however have something further to do and something further to add to what I have doneIf the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to go to the mango grove to exert myselfAs you are talking about exertion Meghiya what can we sayDo what you think it is now time to doThen VenMeghiya rising from his seat bowing down to the Blessed One and circling him to the right went to the mango groveOn arrival having gone deep into the grove he sat down at the root of a certain tree for the days abidingNow while VenMeghiya was staying in the mango grove he was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harmThe thought occurred to him How amazingHow astoundingEven though it was through faith that I went forth from home to the homeless life still I am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harmEmerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now while I was staying in the mango grove I was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harmThe thought occurred to me How amazingHow astoundingEven though it was through faith that I went forth from home to the homeless life still I am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harm Meghiya in one whose awarenessrelease is still immature five qualities bring it to maturityWhich fiveThere is the case where a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleaguesIn one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the first quality that brings it to maturityFurthermore the monk is virtuousHe dwells restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha consummate in his behavior  range of activityHe trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultsIn one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the second quality that brings it to maturityFurthermore he gets to hear at will easily and without difficulty talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness ie talk on modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of releaseIn one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the third quality that brings it to maturityFurthermore he keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities and for taking on skillful qualitiesHe is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualitiesIn one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the fourth quality that brings it to maturityFurthermore he is discerning endowed with the discernment related to arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressIn one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the fifth quality that brings it to maturityMeghiya in one whose awarenessrelease is still immature these are the five qualities that bring it to maturityMeghiya when a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues it is to be expected that he will be virtuous will dwell restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha consummate in his behavior  range of activity and will train himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultsWhen a monk has admirable people as friends  colleagues it is to be expected that he will get to hear at will easily and without difficulty talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness ie talk on modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of releaseWhen a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues it is to be expected that he will keep his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities and for taking on skillful qualities  steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualitiesWhen a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues it is to be expected that he will be discerning endowed with the discernment relating to arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressAnd furthermore when the monk is established in these five qualities there are four additional qualities he should develop He should develop the unattractive so as to abandon passionHe should develop good will so as to abandon ill willHe should develop mindfulness of inout breathing so as to cut off thinkingHe should develop the perception of inconstancy so as to uproot the conceit I am For a monk perceiving inconstancy the perception of notself is made steadyOne perceiving notself attains the uprooting of the conceit I am  unbinding right in the herenowThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAt SavatthiThen early in the morning Cala the nun put on her robes and taking her bowl  outer robe went into Savatthi for almsWhen she had gone for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the dayHaving gone deep into the Grove of the Blind she sat down at the foot of a tree for the days abidingThen Mara the Evil One wanting to arouse fear horripilation  terror in her wanting to make her fall away from concentration approached her  said What is it that you dont approve of nunI dont approve of birth my friendThen Mara the Evil One  sad  dejected at realizing Cala the nun knows me  vanished right thereThree entirely different moods are portrayed so sensitively in the first three stanzas of this poem by the monk Bhuta  the first wild and clamorous the second bright and benevolent the third dark and mysteriousConstant among these dramatic changes of nature is the meditating monk content in any settingMindful awareness allows all things to be just what they are undisturbed by the reconstructions of the petty egoLike the tiny figure in a Chinese landscape painting the monk blends into phenomena because of his transparency of selfThe original tristubh meter is an alteration of and syllables per line reproduced here in a and syllable translation that seems to work better in EnglishThe Pali images are so richly textured in this poem one could easily use twice as many English words and still not capture the nuancesThe second line alone for example evokes the image of twisted streams of water cascading down the steep streambeds of a mountain gorge and then transfers the image to the heavens where the plunging rivulets now course down the invisible tracks left everywhere in the sky by the passage of birdsThats a lot to fit into eleven syllablesTranslators note Passages in the Vinaya show that VenChanna  apparently Prince Siddhatthas horseman on the night of his Great Renunciation  was proud and obdurateAfter becoming a monk he was unwilling to accept instruction from any of the other monksDN tells of how the Buddha on the night of his parinibbana imposed the brahmapunishment on him he was to be left to his own ways without anyone to teach or correct himAccording to CvXI news of this punishment so shocked VenChanna that he faintedHe then went off into seclusion and practiced diligently to the point of attaining arahantshipAs VenAnanda later told him his attainment nullified the punishmentThis sutta tells a different version of Channas change of heartOn one occasion many elder monks were staying near Varanasi in the Deer Park at IsipatanaThen in the late afternoon VenChanna left his seclusion and taking his key went from dwelling to dwelling saying to the elder monks May the venerable elders exhort me may the venerable elders teach me may the venerable elders give me a Dhamma talk so that I might see the DhammaWhen this was said the elder monks said to VenChanna Form friend Channa is inconstantFeeling is inconstantPerception is inconstantFabrications are inconstantConsciousness is inconstantForm is notselfFeeling is notselfPerception is notselfFabrications are notselfConsciousness is notselfAll fabrications are inconstantAll phenomena are notselfThen the thought occurred to VenChanna I too think that form is inconstant feeling is inconstant perception is inconstant fabrications are inconstant consciousness is inconstant form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notself all fabrications are inconstant all phenomena are notselfBut still my mind does not leap up grow confident steadfast  released in the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingInstead agitation  clinging arise and my intellect pulls back thinking But who then is my self But this thought doesnt occur to one who sees the DhammaSo who might teach me the Dhamma so that I might see the DhammaThen the thought occurred to VenChanna This VenAnanda is staying at Kosambi in Ghositas ParkHe has been praised by the Teacher and is esteemed by his knowledgeable fellows in the holy lifeHe is capable of teaching me the Dhamma so that I might see the Dhamma and I have sudden trust in himWhy dont I go to VenAnandaSo setting his lodgings in order and carrying his robes  bowl VenChanna went to Kosambi to where VenAnanda was staying in Ghositas ParkOn arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with the VenAnandaAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he May VenAnanda exhort me may VenAnanda teach me may VenAnanda give me a Dhamma talk so that I might see the DhammaEven this much makes me feel gratified  satisfied with VenChanna that he opens up  breaks down his stubbornnessSo lend ear friend ChannaYou are capable of understanding the DhammaThen a sudden great rapture  joy welled up in VenChanna at the thought So I am capable of understanding the DhammaFacetoface with the Blessed One have I heard this friend ChannaFacetoface with him have I learned the exhortation he gave to the bhikkhu Kaccayanagotta By  large Kaccayana this world is supported by a polarity that of existence  nonexistenceBut when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment nonexistence with reference to the world does not occur to oneWhen one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment existence with reference to the world does not occur to oneBy  large Kaccayana this world is in bondage to attachments clingings  biasesBut one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions nor is he resolved on my self He has no uncertainty or doubt that when there is arising only stress is arising and that when there is passing away stress is passing awayIn this ones knowledge is independent of othersIt is to this extent Kaccayana that there is right view Everything exists That is one extremeEverything doesnt exist That is a second extremeAvoiding these two extremes the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabricationsFrom fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousnessFrom consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameformFrom nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense

sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into playSuch is the origination of this entire mass of stress  sufferingNow from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabricationsFrom the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousnessFrom the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameformFrom the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense mediaFrom the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contactFrom the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feelingFrom the cessation of feeling

becoming comes the cessation of birthFrom the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all ceaseSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  sufferingThats how it is friend Ananda for those who have friends in the holy life like VenAnanda  sympathetic helpful exhorting  teachingJust now for me listening to VenAnandas Dhammateaching has the Dhamma been penetratedStaying at SavatthiThen VenBhumija arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to VenSariputtaOn arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenSariputta Friend Sariputta there are some brahmans  contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are selfmadeThere are other brahmans  contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are othermadeThen there are other brahmans  contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are selfmade  othermadeAnd then there are still other brahmans  contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are neither selfmade nor othermade but arise spontaneouslyIn this case friend Sariputta what is the Blessed Ones doctrineWhat does he teachAnswering in what way will I speak in line with what the Blessed One has said not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual and answer in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticismThe Blessed One my friend has said that pleasure  pain are dependently coarisenDependent on whatDependent on contactOne speaking in this way would be speaking in line with what the Blessed One has said would not be misrepresenting the Blessed One with what is unfactual and would be answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma would have grounds for criticismWhatever brahmans  contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are selfmade even that is dependent on contactWhatever brahmans  contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are othermade even that is dependent on contactWhatever brahmans  contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are selfmade  othermade even that is dependent on contactWhatever brahmans  contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are neither selfmade nor othermade but arise spontaneously even that is dependent on contactThat any brahmans  contemplatives  teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are selfmade  would be sensitive to pleasure  pain otherwise than through contact that isnt possibleThat any brahmans  contemplatives  teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are othermade selfmade  othermade who declare that pleasure  pain are neither selfmade nor othermade but arise spontaneously  would be sensitive to pleasure  pain otherwise than through contact that isnt possibleNow it so happened that VenAnanda overheard this conversation between VenSariputta  VenBhumijaThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he reported the entire conversation to the Blessed OneExcellent AnandaExcellentOne rightly answering would answer as VenSariputta has doneI have said Ananda that pleasure  pain are dependently coarisenDependent on whatDependent on contactOne speaking in this way would be speaking in line with what I have said would not be misrepresenting me with what is unfactual and would be answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma would have grounds for criticismWhatever brahmans  contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are selfmade even that is dependent on contactWhatever brahmans  contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are othermade selfmade  othermade neither selfmade nor othermade but arise spontaneously even that is dependent on contactThat any brahmans  contemplatives  teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure  pain are selfmade  would be

neither selfmade nor othermade but arise spontaneously  would be sensitive to pleasure  pain otherwise than through contact that isnt possibleWhen there is a body pleasure  pain arise internally with bodily intention as the cause or when there is speech pleasure  pain arise internally with verbal intention as the cause or when there is intellect pleasure  pain arise internally with intellectual intention as the causeFrom ignorance as a requisite condition then either of ones own accord one fabricates bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure  pain arise internally or because of others one fabricates bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure  pain arise internallyEither alert one fabricates bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure  pain arise internally or unalert one fabricates bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure  pain arise internallyNow ignorance is bound up in these thingsFrom the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance there no longer exists the body on account of which that pleasure  pain internally ariseThere no longer exists the speech the intellect on account of which that pleasure  pain internally ariseThere no longer exists the field the site the dimension or the issue on account of which that pleasure  pain internally ariseTranslators note The poetic exchange in this discourse emphasizes the difference between appearances and actual visionThe brahman addressing the Buddha speaks in terms of conjecture and uses three compounds containing the word rupa or appearance  gambhirarupa sucarurupa and accherarupaThe Buddha however emphasizes not his appearance but what he seesWhats important about him is not how he looks to others but how he looks at thingsAnother contrast is that whereas the brahman conjectures about the goal the Buddha is striving for in the wilderness  attaining the heavens of the Brahmas  the Buddha points out that he has already arrived at a goal that is hidden even to BrahmasOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Kosalans in a certain forest groveThen a large number of firewoodgathering youths  students of a certain brahman of the Bharadvaja clan  went to the forest groveOn arrival they saw the Blessed One sitting in the grove  his legs folded crosswise his body set straight mindfulness established to the foreOn seeing him they went to the brahman of the Bharadvaja clan and on arrival said to him Sir you should know that Gotama the contemplative is in that grove over there sitting with his legs folded crosswise his body set straight mindfulness established to the foreSo the brahman of the Bharadvaja clan together with the youths went to the forest groveOn arrival he saw the Blessed One sitting in the grove  his legs folded crosswise his body set straight mindfulness established to the foreOn seeing him he went to the Blessed One and on arrival addressed him in verseThe compound brahmaraho Brahmaprivate can be read in either of two ways either private like a Brahma or private to  ie hidden from  BrahmaThe first reading would simply convey the fact that the practice of jhana puts one in a mental state equivalent to a BrahmaThe second reading points to the fact that the Buddha in having gained Awakening meditates in a way that even Brahmas cannot perceive or understandI have chosen this latter reading because it parallels the message in ANThus it has been heard by meOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi in the Jeta Forest in the private park owned by AnāthapiṇḍikaAlso at that time where the Blessed One was there Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf approached close behind many monksThe Blessed One saw Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf even from afar coming close behind many monks of bad complexion of bad appearance dwarfish of such a form as to be despised by most of the monksHaving seen him he addressed the monksMonks do you see that monk even from afar coming close behind many monks of bad complexion of bad appearance dwarfish of such a form as to be despised by most of the monksJust so Venerable SirMonks that monk is of great power of great eminenceThere is no wellgained attainment that has not already been attained by that monkFor that benefit for which sons of good lineage rightly go forth from home into homelessness that ultimate conclusion of the holy life even in this very life by himself having seen with his own eyes the higher knowledge and having attained he abidesAnd then having understood the meaning of that in that moment he breathed forth this utteranceDwelling in SāvatthiAnd then there where the Blessed One was there Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf approachedThe Blessed One saw Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf approaching even from afarHaving seen him he addressed the monksDo you see monks that monk approaching of bad complexion of bad appearance dwarfish of such a form as to be despised by the monksJust so Venerable SirMonks that monk is of great power of great eminenceThere is no wellgained attainment that has not already been attained by that monkFor that benefit for which sons of good lineage rightly go forth from home into homelessness that ultimate conclusion of the holy life even in this very life by himself having seen with his own eyes the higher knowledge and having attained he abidesThis was said by the Blessed OneHaving said that the Fortunate One the Teacher also said thisI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Anupiyā in the Mango GroveAnd on that occasion VenBhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling would repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissA large number of monks heard VenBhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat bliss and on hearing him the thought occurred to them Theres no doubt but that VenBhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son doesnt enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that when going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling he is repeatedly exclaiming What blissWhat bliss So they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they told him VenBhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son lord on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaims What blissWhat bliss Theres no doubt but that VenBhaddiya doesnt enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that when going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling he is repeatedly exclaiming What blissWhat bliss Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call Bhaddiya saying The Teacher calls you friend Bhaddiya Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk went to VenBhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son and on arrival he said to him The Teacher calls you friend BhaddiyaResponding As you say my friend to the monk VenBhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Bhaddiya that  on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling  you repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissYes lordWhat compelling reason do you have in mind that  when going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling  you repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissBefore when I has a householder maintaining the bliss of kingship lord I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countrysideBut even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful  afraidBut now on going alone to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident  unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deerThis is the compelling reason I have in mind that  when going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling  I repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat bliss Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedOf all the monks and nuns who awakened under the guidance of the Buddha none was more notorious than the author of these verses the robber and murderer AngulimalaOriginally named Ahimsaka he was the son of the brahman chaplain to the Kosala king and became a brilliant student in the medical school at TakkasilaOn account of a number of intrigues perpetrated by his jealous classmates he set upon a course of ambushing victims on the road and cutting off their thumbs in order to assemble a garland of thumbs which is the translation of his monastic name AngulimalaThe Buddha fearlessly confronted the robber and helped him to see the error of his waysThen in the face of tremendous opposition from the population he allowed Angulimala to join the Sangha and in due time he became an awakened ArahantThe karma of his previous deeds still followed him however and he was later stoned in the street by an angry mobComing into the teachers presence with blood running from his cut head with his bowl broken and with his outer robe torn the Buddha simply said Bear itbrahman Bear itYou are experiencing here and now the result of deeds It is within this context that the above verses were composedThe author is clearly referring to his own emergence from negligence and unwholesome deeds into a wiser and more wholesome understandingI cannot help but feel this story is timely whether referring to individuals who have committed terrible deeds yet being capable of radical transformation or to a nation looking more closely at its impact in the worldThe goodness that fills our world may well be poised to emerge like the bright moon from behind the clouds which far too often obscure itAt one time the Buddha was residing in Magadha near AndhakavindaAt that time the Buddha was seated under the open sky in the deep darkness of the night and the raingod was making it rain drop by dropThen the Brahma Sahampati as the night was passing away lighting up Andhakavinda with his surpassing brilliance approached the Buddha and stood to one sideAs he stood to one side the Brahma Sahampati offered up these verses in the presence of the BuddhaThe theme of Sahampatis first lines is fear a present issue for the followers of the Buddha who were encouraged to practice alone in the depths of the wildernessPoisonous snakes are a source of fear as are the thunder lightning and profound darkness of the nightThe dread overcome by the bhikkhu in the last line of the verse is literally the wonderful phrase the hair standing up on the back of ones neck It suggests the terrifying creeping anxiety of threatening forces only partly imagined or understoodThe play on words in the second line is clever equating freedom from fear with the liberation of nibbana which is sometimes given the epithet the fearless Since fear is always rooted in protection of the ego working with fear is a useful practice for overcoming the egos instinctive defensesAwakening results in fearlessness because one lets go of the need to protect the limited view of oneself as one gains a much wider perspectiveThe second verse allows that dwelling as a hermit though a powerful practice may not be appropriate for everybody for many it is better to live in communityBut one should not thereby consider oneself free from the objects of fear because ultimately these forces are all within usRemoved from the dangers of the wilderness a person must be especially attentive to watching over the workings of their own mindIn community the serpents of ill will the storms of desire and the darkness of delusions are equally dangerous for those seeking the peace of liberationAnd mindfulness is our greatest ally in watching over or guarding the workings of our minds as we try to get along with othersAt SavatthiThere the Blessed One said Monks do you develop mindfulness of inout breathingWhen this was said VenArittha replied to the Blessed One I develop mindfulness of inout breathing lordBut how do you develop mindfulness of inout breathing AritthaHaving abandoned sensual desire for past sensual pleasures lord having done away with sensual desire for future sensual pleasures and having thoroughly subdued perceptions of irritation with regard to internal  external events I breathe in mindfully and breathe out mindfullyThere is that mindfulness of inout breathing AritthaI dont say that there isntBut as to how mindfulness of inout breathing is brought in detail to its culmination listen and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord VenArittha responded to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said And how Arittha is mindfulness of inout breathing brought in detail to its culminationThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to rapture He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to rapture He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in calming mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the mind He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the mind He trains himself I will breathe in satisfying the mind He trains himself I will breathe out satisfying the mind He trains himself I will breathe in steadying the mind He trains himself I will breathe out steadying the mind He trains himself I will breathe in releasing the mind He trains himself I will breathe out releasing the mind He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on dispassion He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on dispassion He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on cessation He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on cessation He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on relinquishmentThis Arittha is how mindfulness of inout breathing is brought in detail to its culminationSee also MN SNThese mournful words were uttered by Ananda in the Theragatha the Poems of the Elders and reveal a very human side of one of the canons most sensitive charactersAnanda was the Buddhas cousin and personal attendant and was always to be found at the masters side throughout the many years of wandering and teachingAs Ananda put it For twenty five years I served the Lord with loving deeds loving words and loving thoughts  when the Buddha paced to and fro I paced along behind It is Ananda who washed his feet at the end of the day who arranged his interviews and protected his solitude as best he could and who tended him lovingly during his final illnessIt is Ananda also who we find weeping bitterly at the passing away of the Buddha and being gently admonished for it by the teacher of nonattachment to changing phenomenaAfter the Buddhas final passing Ananda seems to have been treated somewhat badly by some of the other monks who were jealous of his close relationship with the masterPoems like this one suggest that Ananda passed a lonely old age and never ceased mourning for his beloved teacher and friendI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks responded to himThe Blessed One said When Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting crosslegged in the sky in space entered  emerged from the fire

knows me the One WellGone knows me  vanished right thereMany discourses are set in Jetas Grove the monastery donated by AnathapindikaHere we learn how Anathapindika first met the BuddhaA dramatic point in the story revolves around the fact that most people knew of him by his epithet  Anathapindika means Almsgiver to those without protection  rather than by his given nameThus he is surprised to hear the Buddha at their first meeting address him correctlyThe Cullavagga gives this same story in greater detail and adds more incidents After reciting the verse with which this discourse ends the Buddha gives Anathapindika a stepbystep teaching culminating in an explanation of the four noble truthsAt the end of the teaching Anathapindika attains streamentryHe then returns home to Savatthi purchases a grove from Prince Jeta at immense price and establishes a monastery for the Buddha and the SanghaThere according to the commentaries the Buddha spent more rains retreats than at any other monasteryI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Cool GroveNow at that time Anathapindika the householder had arrived in Rajagaha on some businessHe heard An Awakened One they say has appeared in the world and he wanted to go right then to see the Blessed OneThen the thought occurred to him Today is not the proper time to go to see the Blessed OneTomorrow I will go to see the Blessed One at the proper time With his mindfulness immersed in the Awakened One he lay down to sleepThree times he got up during the night thinking it was lightThen he went to the gate to the charnel groundNonhuman beings opened the gateWhen Anathapindika the householder had left the city the light vanished and darkness appearedFear terror  horripilation arose and because of that he wanted to turn backThen Sivaka the yakkhaspirit invisible proclaimedThe darkness then vanished for Anathapindika and the light appearedThe fear terror  horripilation he had felt subsidedFor a second time a third time the light vanished and darkness appearedFear terror  horripilation arose and because of that Anathapindika wanted to turn backThen for a third time Sivaka the yakkhaspirit invisible proclaimedThe darkness then vanished for Anathapindika and the light appearedThe fear terror  horripilation he had felt subsidedSo Anathapindika went to the Cool GroveNow at that time the Blessed One  having gotten up as the night was ending  was pacing back  forth in the open airHe saw Anathapindika the householder coming from afarOn seeing him he got down from his meditation path and sat on a seat made readyAs he was sitting there he said to Anathapindika Come SudattaThen Anathapindika The Blessed One is calling me by my given name threw himself down right there at the Blessed Ones feet and said to him Lord I hope the Blessed One has slept in easeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryAnd on that occasion approximately monks headed by VenYasoja had arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed OneAs these visiting monks were exchanging greetings with the resident monks setting their lodgings in order and putting away their robes  bowls they made a loud racket a great racketThen the Blessed One said to Vennanda nanda what is that loud racket that great racket like fishermen with a catch of fishLord those are approximately monks headed by VenYasoja who have arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed OneAs these visiting monks are exchanging greetings with the resident monks setting their lodgings in order and putting away their robes  bowls they are making a loud racket a great racketIn that case nanda tell those monks in my name The Teacher calls you friends Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Vennanda went to the monks and said The Teacher calls you friendsResponding As you say friend to Vennanda the monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them Monks why were you making that loud racket that great racket like fishermen with a catch of fishWhen this was said VenYasoja said to the Blessed One Lord these monks have arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed OneAs they were exchanging greetings with the resident monks setting their lodgings in order and putting away their robes  bowls they made a loud racket a great racketGo away monksI dismiss youYou are not to stay in my vicinityResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monks got up from their seats bowed down to the Blessed One and left circling him to the rightSetting their lodgings in order and taking their robes  bowls they went wandering among the VajjiansAfter wandering by stages among the Vajjians they came to the River VaggamudāThere on the bank of the River Vaggamudā they made leafhuts and entered the Rains RetreatThen VenYasoja addressed the monks as they entered the Rains Retreat Friends the Blessed One dismissed us wishing for our benefit seeking our wellbeing being sympathetic and acting out of sympathyLets live in such a way that the Blessed One will be gratified by our way of livingAs you say friend the monks responded to VenYasojaAnd so living secluded ardent  resolute every one of them realized the Three Knowledges in the course of that very Rains RetreatThen the Blessed One having stayed as long as he liked in Sāvatthī went wandering in the direction of VesālīAfter wandering by stages he arrived in Vesālī and stayed there in the Peaked Roof Pavilion in the Great WoodThen encompassing with his awareness the awareness of the monks staying on the bank of the River Vaggamudā he said to Vennanda This direction seems bright to me nandaThis direction seems dazzling to meIts not at all repugnant for me to go  pay attention to where the monks on the bank of the River Vaggamudā are stayingSend a messenger into their presence to say The Teacher calls you friendsThe Teacher wants to see you Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Vennanda went to a certain monk and said Come now friendGo to the monks on the bank of the River Vaggamudā and say to them The Teacher calls you friendsThe Teacher wants to see you Responding As you say friend to Vennanda the monk  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  disappeared from the Peaked Roof Pavilion in the Great Wood and appeared in front of the monks on the bank of the River VaggamudāThen he said to them The Teacher calls you friendsThe Teacher wants to see youResponding As you say friend to the monk the monks set their lodgings in order and taking their robes  bowls disappeared from the bank of the River Vaggamudā  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  and appeared in the presence of the Blessed One in the Peaked Roof Pavilion in the Great WoodNow at that time the Blessed One was sitting in imperturbable concentrationThe thought occurred to the monks Now in which mental dwelling is the Blessed One now residing Then they realized He is residing in the imperturbable dwelling So they all sat in imperturbable concentrationThen Vennanda  when the night was far advanced at the end of the first watch  got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him The night lord is far advancedThe first watch has endedThe visiting monks have been sitting here a long timeMay the Blessed One greet them When this was said the Blessed One remained silentThen a second time when the night was far advanced at the end of the middle watch Vennanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage to him with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him The night lord is far advancedThe middle watch has endedThe visiting monks have been sitting here a long timeMay the Blessed One greet them When this was said the Blessed One remained silentThen a third time when the night was far advanced at the end of the last watch as dawn was approaching and the face of the night was beaming Vennanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage to him with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him The night lord is far advancedThe last watch has endedDawn is approaching and the face of the night is beamingThe visiting monks have been sitting here a long timeMay the Blessed One greet themThen the Blessed One emerging from his imperturbable concentration said to Vennanda nanda if you had known not even that much would have occurred to youI along with all of these monks have been sitting in imperturbable concentrationThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen Vennanda emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Its amazing sirIts astounding  how shortlived the Blessed Ones mother wasSeven days after the Blessed Ones birth she died and reappeared among the Contented groupThats the way it is nandaThats the way it is for the mothers of bodhisattas are shortlivedSeven days after the bodhisattas birth the bodhisattas mothers pass away and reappear among the Contented groupThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAt SavatthiThere VenAnanda addressed the monks Friend monksYes friend the monks responded to himVenAnanda said Friends VenPunna Mantaniputta was very helpful to us when we were newly ordainedHe exhorted us with this exhortationIts with possessiveness friend Ananda that there is I am not without possessivenessAnd through possessiveness of what is there I am not without possessivenessThrough possessiveness of form there is I am not without possessivenessThrough possessiveness of feeling perception fabrications Through possessiveness of consciousness there is I am not without possessivenessJust as if a young woman  or a man  youthful fond of adornment contemplating the image of her face in a mirror pure  bright or in a bowl of clear water would look with possessiveness not without possessivenessIn the same way through possessiveness of form there is I am not without possessivenessThrough possessiveness of feeling perception fabrications Through possessiveness of consciousness there is I am not without possessivenessWhat do you think friend Ananda  Is form constant or inconstantInconstant friendAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful friendAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo friend Is feeling constant or inconstantInconstant friend Is perception constant or inconstantInconstant friend Are fabrications constant or inconstantInconstant friendWhat do you think friend Ananda  Is consciousness constant or inconstantInconstant friendAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful friendAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo friendThus friend Ananda any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling whatsoeverAny perception whatsoeverAny fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessThrough disenchantment he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldFriends VenPunna Mantaniputta was very helpful to us when we were newly ordainedHe exhorted us with this exhortationAnd when I had heard this Dhammaexplanation from VenPunna Mantaniputta I broke through to the DhammaI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryAnd on that occasion VenMahā Kaccāyana was living among the people of Avantī on Pavatta Mountain near the Osprey HabitatAnd at that time the lay follower Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was VenMahā Kaccāyanas supporterThen as Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāyana teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellWhat if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessSo he went to VenMahā Kaccāyana and on arrival having bowed down to VenMahā Kaccāyana sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenMahā Kaccāyana Just now venerable sir as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāyana teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellWhat if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness Give me the goingforth Master Mahā KaccāyanaWhen this was said VenMahā Kaccāyana said to Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa Its hard Soṇa the lifelong onemealaday sleepingalone holy lifePlease right there as you are a householder devote yourself to the message of the Awakened Ones and to the propertime onemealaday sleepingalone holy life And so Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇas idea of goingforth subsidedThen a second time as Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāyana teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellWhat if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessSo he went to VenMahā Kaccāyana and on arrival having bowed down to VenMahā Kaccāyana sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenMahā Kaccāyana Just now venerable sir as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāyana teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellWhat if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness Give me the goingforth Master Mahā KaccāyanaWhen this was said VenMahā Kaccāyana said to Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa Its hard Soṇa the lifelong onemealaday sleepingalone holy lifePlease right there as you are a householder devote yourself to the message of the Awakened Ones and to the propertime onemealaday sleepingalone holy life And so Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇas idea of goingforth subsided a second timeThen a third time as Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāyana teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellWhat if I were to shave off my hair

its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellWhat if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness Give me the goingforth Master Mahā KaccāyanaSo VenMahā Kaccāyana gave Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa the goingforthNow at that time the southern country of Avantī was short of monksSo only after three years  having gathered from here  there with hardship  difficulty a quorumoften community of monks  did VenMahā Kaccāyana give full admission to VenSoṇaThen after having completed the Rains retreat as he was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to VenSoṇas awareness I havent seen the Blessed One facetofaceIve simply heard that he is like this and like thisIf my preceptor would give me permission I would go to see the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakenedSo leaving seclusion in the late afternoon he went to VenMahā Kaccāyana and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenMahā Kaccāyana Just now venerable sir as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness I havent seen the Blessed One facetofaceIve simply heard that he is like this and like thisIf my preceptor would give me permission I would go to see the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened Good SoṇaVery goodGo Soṇa to see the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakenedYou will see the Blessed One who is serene  inspires serene confidence his senses at peace his mind at peace one who has attained the utmost tranquility  poise tamed guarded his senses restrained a Great OneOn seeing him showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort Saying As you say venerable sir VenSoṇa  delighting in  approving of VenMahā Kaccāyanas words  got up from his seat bowed down to VenMahā Kaccāyana circled him to the right set his lodging in order and  taking his bowl  robes  set off wandering toward SāvatthīWandering by stages he arrived at Sāvatthī Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryHe went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord my preceptor VenMahā Kaccāyana shows reverence with his head to the Blessed Ones feet and asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfortAre you well monkAre you in good healthHave you come along the road with only a little fatigueAnd are you not tired of almsfoodI am well Blessed OneI am in good health Blessed OneI have come along the road lord with only a little fatigue and I am not tired of almsfoodThen the Blessed One addressed Vennanda saying nanda prepare bedding for this visiting monkThen the thought occurred to Vennanda When the Blessed One orders me nanda prepare bedding for this visiting monk he wants to stay in the same dwelling with that monkThe Blessed One wants to stay in the same dwelling with VenSoṇa So he prepared bedding for VenSoṇa in the dwelling in which the Blessed One was stayingThen the Blessed One having spent much of the night sitting in the open air washed his feet and entered the dwellingLikewise VenSoṇa having spent much of the night sitting in the open air washed his feet and entered the dwellingThen getting up toward the end of the night the Blessed One invited VenMahā Soṇa saying Monk I would like you to recite the DhammaResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One VenSoṇa chanted all sixteen parts of the Aṭṭhaka VaggaThe Blessed One at the conclusion of VenSoṇas intonation expressed high approval Good monkVery goodYou have learned the Aṭṭhaka Vagga well have considered them well have borne them well in mindYou have a fine delivery clear  faultless that makes the meaning intelligibleHow many Rains do you haveI have one Rains Blessed OneBut why did you take so longFor a long time lord I have seen the drawbacks in sensuality but the household life is confining with many duties many things to be doneThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAt SavatthiThere VenSariputta addressed the monks FriendsYes friend the monks respondedVenSariputta said Friends just now as I was withdrawn in seclusion this train of thought arose to my awareness Is there anything in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair Then the thought occurred to me There is nothing in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair When this was said VenAnanda said to VenSariputta Sariputta my friend even if there were change  alteration in the Teacher would there arise within you no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairEven if there were change  alteration in the Teacher my friend there would arise within me no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairStill I would have this thought What a great being of great might of great prowess has disappearedFor if the Blessed One were to remain for a long time that would be for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human  divine beings Surely its because VenSariputtas Imaking  minemaking and obsessions with conceit have long been well uprooted that even if there were change  alteration in the Teacher there would arise within him no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairSee also DN SNTranslators note This discourse is the source of many proverbs frequently quoted in Theravadin countriesIn when Thailand was celebrating the th anniversary of the founding of
