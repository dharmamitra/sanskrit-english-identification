Or alternatively he combats creatures fear by promoting their good and preventing their harm thus he is the Enlightened One 
the True Idea does so by providing the crossing of the Desert of Being and by giving consolation
the Community does so by causing the obtainment of great fruitfulness from small actions
so in this way the refuge is also that threefold Jewel
The going for refuge is the arising of cognizance with confidence therein and giving preponderance thereto from which defilement is eliminated and eradicated and which occurs in the mode of taking that as the highest value
The going for refuge has two main divisions it may be mundane or supramundane
The supramundane refuge is taken by those who have a vision of the Noble Truth  In the pathmoment  the supramundane refuge succeeds in exterminating any blemish that may still attach to the going for refuge It has Nibbana as its object and in its function it comprises the entire Triple Gem 
The mundane refuge is taken by worldlings  It succeeds in effecting a temporary repression of the blemishes attaching to their going for refuge Its objects are the noble qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha It consists in the acquisition of faith in these three objects It is this faith in the Triple Gem that is referred to when among the ten meritorious acts  the straightening of views is defined as Right Understanding rooted in faith 
This mundane refuge is of four kinds the surrender of self  acceptance as ones guiding ideal  acceptance of discipleship  homage by prostration 
The surrender of self is expressed as follows From today onward I surrender myself to the Buddha to the Dhamma to the Sangha
The acceptance of the guiding ideal From today onward the Buddha is my Guiding Ideal the Dhamma and the Sangha Thus may you know me
The acceptance of discipleship From today onward I am the Disciple of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha Thus may you know me
Homage by prostration From today onward I shall give respectful greeting devoted attendance the añjalisalutation and homage only to those three the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha Thus may you know me
To the Exalted One I am giving my self to the Dhamma I am giving my self to the Sangha I am giving my self
I am giving them my life Given is my self given my life Until my life ends I am taking refuge in the Buddha The Buddha is my refuge my shelter and my protection  This is also the giving over of ones self to the Triple Gem
Fain would I see the Master The Exalted One him I would wish to see Fain would I see the Blessed One The Exalted One him would I wish to see Fain would I see the Enlightened One The Exalted One him I would wish to see Then I prostrated myself before the Exalted One and addressed him thus The Exalted One O Lord is my Master and I am his disciple
From village to village from town to town Ill wend my way
lauding the Enlightened One and the perfection of His Law
Homage by prostration may be of four kinds being paid towards relatives out of fear towards ones teacher and towards those deserving highest veneration
Only the latter case  ie the prostration before those worthy of highest veneration  is to be regarded as going for refuge
Only if referring to the highest  refuge is taken or broken respectively Therefore if a member of the Sakya or Koliya clan worships the Buddha thinking He is our relative no refuge is taken in that case
Or one may think The recluse Gotama is honored by kings and has great influence If he is not worshipped he might do me harm If thinking thus one worships out of fear no refuge is taken in that case
Furthermore a person remembers to have learned something from the Blessed One while he was a Bodhisatta an aspirant to Buddhahood or after his attaining Buddhahood 
If for these reasons one regards the Buddha as ones teacher and worships him no refuge is taken in that case too
But if one pays worship to the Buddha in the conviction This is the most venerable being in the world only by such a one is refuge taken
A male or female lay devotee who has taken refuge in the Triple Gem worships a relative thinking He is my kinsman Even if that relative is a recluse of another faith the refuge in the Triple Gem is unbroken still less can it be said to be broken if it is not a recluse or a priest
When prostrating before a king out of fear If he who is honored by the whole country is not worshipped he will do me harm  in that case too the refuge is unbroken
If one has learned any science art or craft even from a nonBuddhist and one worships him in his capacity as ones teacher in that case too the refuge remains unbroken
The fruit of the supramundane refuge in the sense of being its karmic result  is the four fruitions of monkhood  viz the fruition of streamentry etc The fruit in the sense of advantage or blessing is the destruction of suffering
further the blessings mentioned in the following scriptural passage
It is impossible O monks that a person endowed with insight should regard any conditioned thing as permanent enjoyable or an ego that he should take the life of his mother his father or a saint that with a thought of hate he should shed the blood of the Blessed One that he should cause a split in the community of monks that he should choose another teacher There is no possibility of that
But the fruit of the mundane refuge is only the attainment of favorable rebirth and the attainment of property and enjoyment
In three cases the mundane refuge is defiled and without great brightness and radiating influence if connected with ignorance doubt and wrong views
The supramundane refuge is free from any defilements
A breach of the mundane refuge might be blameable or blameless
It is blameable when occurring as a going for refuge by selfsurrender etc to other religious masters in that case the breach will have undesirable results
The breach is blameless at the time of death as it will not cause any karmic result
The supramundane refuge is without breach
Even in another existence a holy disciple will not turn to another master
Now as to the going  etc it combats thus it is a refuge the meaning is that when people have gone for refuge then by that very going for refuge it combats dispels carries off and stops their fear anguish suffering risk of unhappy destination on rebirth and defilement

On one occasion the Exalted One By this phrase implying the nonexistence of the Exalted One  the Venerable nanda shows the parinibbāna of the formbody of the Buddha
Thus he inspires a sense of spiritual urgency in people intoxicated with the vanity of life and arouses in them a desire to hear the true Dhamma as though telling them Even the Exalted One the Teacher of the ariyan Dhamma the Bearer of the Ten Powers  whose body was like a mass of diamonds has passed away Who then can hope to live forever 
Reciting the word thus he shows that the sutta possesses a teaching
by the words have I heard that it possesses a listener
by the words on one occasion that it possesses a specific time
and by the words the Exalted One that it possesses a teacher
with a great company of bhikkhus That company was great on account of the greatness of its noble qualities and on account of the greatness of its number
Because its members were endowed with such noble qualities as fewness of wishes etc the company of bhikkhus was great in noble qualities
and because it was composed of five hundred bhikkhus it was great in number
the wanderer Suppiya A pupil of Sañjaya  He was a clothed wanderer 
He spoke in many ways  the word way occurs in the senses of turn leaching and reason
Here it is employed in the sense of reason  Therefore the meaning is for many a reason with many reasons
in dispraise of the Buddha Although the Exalted Buddha was altogether flawless and possessed countless praiseworthy qualities he spoke in dispraise criticism and blame of the Buddha groundlessly charging him with one of the following faults The recluse Gotama does not perform the proper duties such as salutation etc towards those advanced in years These duties are called in common idiom the taste of concord therefore the recluse Gotama is lacking in taste He is worthless He teaches a doctrine denying the moral efficacy of action He is an annihilationist a detester a nihilist a tormentor incapable of higher rebirth
The recluse Gotama has attained no state transcending the merely human level no distinguished knowledge and vision worthy of the ariyans
He teaches a doctrine hammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thought
The recluse Gotama is not omniscient not a knower of the worlds not supreme not the foremost individual
 the Dhamma and the Saṅgha Just as he spoke in dispraise of the Buddha he also spoke in dispraise of the Dhamma groundlessly declaring The Dhamma of the recluse Gotama is wrongly expounded wrongly penetrated not liberating not conducive to peace
And as he spoke in dispraise of the Dhamma he also spoke in dispraise of the Saṅgha The recluse Gotamas community of disciples is practicing wrongly and perversely It has entered upon a warped distorted unrighteous course of practice
But his pupil the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha His pupil Brahmadatta thought Our teacher misapprehends something that should not be misapprehended and attacks something that should not he attacked For if he speaks in dispraise of the praiseworthy Triple Gem he will come to ruin and destruction as surely as if he were to swallow fire seize a sword with his hand try to shatter Mount Sineru with his fist play with the teeth of a saw or try to slop a ferocious rutting elephant with his hand
If the teacher were to tread upon dung fire thorns or a black viper or to mount a stake eat deadly poison step into a violent stream or throw himself down a cliff there is no reason for the pupil to follow suit
For beings are the owners of their kamma and they each go their own way according to their own kamma
The father does not inherit the sons kamma nor the son the fathers the mother does not inherit the sons kamma nor the son the mothers the brother does not inherit the sisters kamma nor the sister the brothers the teacher does not inherit the pupils kamma nor the pupil the teachers
My teacher speaks in dispraise of the Triple Gem this is a terrible blameworthy deedthe reviling of the ariyans
Emerging from such wise reflections since he was a naturally intelligent young man he began to speak in many ways in praise of the Triple Gem confuting his teachers views and supporting himself with cogent reasons
Thus these two  followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus
Why was the Exalted One travelling along that highway
And why did Suppiya follow behind him
And why did he speak in dispraise of the Triple Gem
At that time the Exalted One had been residing in one of the eighteen large monasteries in the vicinity of Rājagaha In the morning after attending to his bodily needs the Exalted One walked for alms in Rājagaha at the time for the almsround surrounded by the company of bhikkhus
by his presence making it easy for the bhikkhus to obtain alms Following the meal after returning from the almsround he made the bhikkhus bring his bowl and outer robe and announced Now I will set out for Nālandā  He then left Rājagaha and set out on the highway
At the same time Suppiya too was residing in the vicinity of Rājagaha in one of the monasteries reserved for the wanderers Surrounded by his company of wanderers he walked for alms in Rājagaha
that morning by his presence making it easy for the wanderers to obtain alms When he had finished his morning meal he made his wanderers bring his set of requisites and announced Now i will set out for Nālandā  Thus he set forth on his journey following closely behind the Exalted One without realizing that the Exalted One was travelling along the same highway
For if he had known he would not have followed behind
While going along unknowingly he lifted his neck looked around and saw the Exalted One ahead of him radiant with the glory of a Buddha like the shimmering crest of a golden mountain enveloped in a crimson mantle
At that time it is told the sixcolored rays of the Bearer of the Ten Powers issued forth from his body filling and pervading an area eighty feet on all sides The forest clearing through which they were walking appeared then as though it were bestrewn with garlands and wreathes made of gems or with the dust of pulverized gems as though it were a beautiful golden cloth embroidered with gems as though it were sprinkled over with the essence of red gold or filled with a hundred meteors or bestrewn with clustered kanikāra flowers as though it were bestrewn with red China lead reduced to powder and scattered about by gusts of wind or as though it were irradiated and illuminated throughout by the splendor of rainbows streaks of lightning and the multitudinous host of stars
The Exalted Ones body adorned with the eighty minor marks of physical beauty was like a lake filled with blooming lotus flowers and water lilies like a pāricchattaka tree in full blossom like the canopy of the sky sparkling with the light of the stars smiling down with glory from above And with his thirtytwo characteristics of physical beauty woven as it were into a garland shining with splendor for a fathom all around be surpassed in glory the glory of a garland composed of thirtytwo moons or thirtytwo suns the glory even of thirtytwo worldruling monarchs of thirtytwo celestial kings or of thirtytwo Mahābrahmās
Surrounding the Exalted One stood bhikkhus all of few wishes content fond of solitude aloof exhorters censors of evil teachers tolerant of correction endowed with virtue concentration wisdom emancipation and the knowledge and vision of emancipation
Standing in their midst the Exalted One was like a golden pillar surrounded by a red woolen rampart like a golden boat amidst a cluster of red lotus flowers like a lower of flame encircled by a coral railing or like the full moon surrounded by the host of stars The sight filled the eyes even of the birds and beasts with joy much more then did it bring joy to the eyes of gods and humans
On that day most of the eighty great disciples accompanied the Exalted One With their cloudcolored ragrobes arranged over one shoulder carrying their walking slicks they appeared like perfumed elephants clad in solid armorall free from corruptions their corruptions ejected their defilements shattered their tangles disentangled and their bonds cut
The Exalted One free from lust hatred and delusion himself stood surrounded by those free from lust hatred and delusion free from craving himself he stood surrounded by those free from craving devoid of defilements himself he stood surrounded by those devoid of defilements enlightened himself he stood surrounded by those enlightened after him Travelling along that road like the moon across the sky with the inconceivable incomparable grace of a Buddha produced through the power of merit accumulated over an immeasurable period of time the Exalted One appeared like the filament surrounded by petals like a pericarp surrounded by filaments like a sixtusked elephant king surrounded by eight thousand bull elephants like a royal swan surrounded by ninety thousand swans like a worldruling monarch surrounded by his complete army like Sakka the king of the gods surrounded by the multitude of gods like the Mahābrahmā Hārita surrounded by the multitude of Brahmā gods
Having seen the Exalted One moving with the incomparable grace of a Buddha and those bhikkhus with downcast gaze tranquil faculties and tranquil minds honoring the Exalted One like the full moon in the vault of heaven the wanderer Suppiya then surveyed his own assembly
He saw his followers leaning on the poles they were carrying heaped up with a big load of requisitesdilapidated stools tridents peacockfans earthen bowls sacks waterpots etc
They were looselongued noisy vociferous unsightly and uninspiring
Seeing them he was filled with remorse
Now just then it would have been proper for him to have praised the Exalted One
But since his gain and honor as well as his following had diminished  he was constantly jealous of the Buddha
For so long as a Buddha does not appear in the world the monks of other sects acquire abundant gain and honor But when a Buddha appears then their gain and honor diminish just as the light of the glowworm becomes indiscernible with the rising of the sun
Moreover when Upatissa and Kolita went forth into homelessness under Sanjaya their assembly swelled with numbers  But when these two left him the assembly of wanderers was split
Thus for these two reasons the diminishing of his gains and the loss of his followers the wanderer Suppiya was constantly jealous of the Buddha Vomiting up the poison of his jealousy he spoke in dispraise of the Triple Gem
 There too the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha When night had fallen the wanderer Suppiya having arrived at the resthouse looked across at the Exalted One
At the time lamps were burning all around like scattered stars The Exalted One was silting in their midst surrounded by the company of bhikkhus
Not even one bhikkhu fidgeted with his hands or feet or made any sound of coughing or sneezing
The entire assembly through its masterly self discipline and out of reverence for the Teacher sat together as still and motionless as the flame of a lamp in a windless place
Having seen this wonder the wanderer then surveyed his own assembly
There some were playing with their hands some with their feet some were chitchatting while others slept their tongues hanging out of their mouths dribbling gnashing their teeth snoring and snorting in their sleep
Then loo he should have praised the noble qualities of the Triple Gent but because of his jealousy he spoke in dispraise
Brahmadatta however again spoke in their praise
 It is wonderful and marvellous friends how the Exalted One he who knows and sees  has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings The Exalted One after fulfilling the complete thirty pāramīs and destroying all defilements awakened to the supreme perfect enlightenment He is one who knows because he knows the propensities and latent tendencies of the various kinds of sentient beings He is one who sees  because he sees all knowable dhammas as clearly as a fruit held in the palm of the hand
He knows through the knowledge of past lives etc and he sees through the divine eye
He knows through the three kinds of clear knowledge and the six kinds of direct knowledge  and he sees through the universal eye of unimpeded penetration
He knows through the wisdom that is capable of knowing all dhammas and with the fully purified fleshly eye he sees things outside the visual range of other beings such as forms hidden behind walls etc
He knows through the wisdom of penetration which secures his own welfare and has concentration as its proximate cause and he sees through the wisdom of teaching which secures the welfare of other beings and has compassion as its proximate cause
By this statement it is meant that the Exalted One has perfectly penetrated the truth Beings bhikkhus come together and encounter one another because of some common element Those of low disposition meet and encounter those of low disposition those of noble disposition meet and encounter those of noble disposition
So it was in the past so it will he in the future and so it is at present  Thus as though measuring them with a ruler or weighing them on a pair of scales the Buddha has realized through his knowledge of omniscience and his comprehension of the dispositions of beings that beings have diverse dispositions inclinations views acquiescences and preferences
It is hard to find even two beings of identical inclinations in the world
If one person wants to go the other wants to stay if one wants to drink the other wants to eat
 The Exalted One realizing the turn their discussion had taken He heard it through his knowledge of omniscience
But what was he doing that he heard it
He was engaged in the activity of the last watch of the night There are two kinds of activities  the beneficial and the useless
Of these all tendencies to useless activity were abolished by the Exalted One with his attainment of the path of arahatship at the root of the Bodhi Tree
But from then on he remained engaged in beneficial activity
 The Exalted Ones activities were divided into five groups the activities of the morning of the afternoon of the first watch of the night of the middle watch and of the last watch
These were his morning activities
The Exalted One would rise early in the morning and attend to his morning ablutions out of compassion for his attendant and for the sake of his physical wellbeing Then he would remain seated in seclusion until the time for the almsround When the time for the almsround arrived he would change his lower robe fasten the waistband put on the upper robe and taking his bowl enter the village or town for alms Sometimes he would go alone sometimes with a retinue of bhikkhus sometimes he would enter in a natural manner sometimes giving a display of wonders
Thus when the Lord would walk for alms gentle winds would precede him at each step clearing the ground Clouds would sprinkle drops of water to still the dust along the path and then remain as a canopy overhead Other winds would gather flowers and strew them along the road The elevated areas of the ground would lower themselves and the depressed areas raise themselves so that the ground was always level beneath die tread of his feet Sometimes delicate lotus flowers would spring up to receive his feet
As soon as he placed his right foot within the towngale the sixcolored rays issuing from his body would radiate in all directions adorning the mansions gabled houses and other buildings so that they appeared as though enveloped in the sheen of rarefied gold or in a cloak of many hues Elephants horses and birds standing in their own places would break out into melodious sounds while musical instruments such as drums and lutes as also the ornaments of the people would spontaneously give forth music
By these signs the people would know The Exalted One has come for alms
Then well dressed and well groomed bringing scents flowers and other offerings they would issue forth from their houses into the street respectfully present their offerings to the Exalted One do homage to him and say Lord give us ten bhikkhus for alms give us twenty give us fifty give us a hundred  Taking the Exalted Ones bowl they would lead him to a seat and respectfully serve him with almsfood
When he had finished his meal the Exalted One would survey the mental dispositions of the people present Then he would teach the Dhamma to them in such a way that some would become established in the refuges some in the five precepts some in the fruits of sanctitythe fruits of streamentrv oncereturner or non returner Others having gone forth into homelessness would attain to the supreme fruit of arahatship
After benefitting the multitude in this way he would rise from his seat and return to the monastery
Upon his return he would sit down in the pavilion in the special seat prepared just for him and wait until the bhikkhus finished their meal
When the bhikkhus had finished eating the attendant would inform the Exalted One
The Exalted One would then enter the Fragrant Cottage
With the morning activities completed the Exalted One would sit down in the antechamber of the Fragrant Cottage and wash his feet Then getting up on a footstool he would exhort the Bhikkhu Saṅgha Bhikkhus strive for your deliverance with diligence Rare is the appearance of a Buddha in the world rare the acquisition of the human state rare the gain of optimal supporting conditions rare the going forth into homelessness rare the opportunity of hearing the true Dhamma
Some bhikkhus would then request a subject of meditation
and the Exalted One would assign them subjects appropriate for their particular temperaments
Thereupon all the bhikkhus would do homage to the Master and retire to their individual day and night quarters
some to the forest some to the foot of a tree some to a place in the mountains and some to the various sensesphere heavens
Following this the Exalted One would enter the Fragrant Collage If he wished he would lie down for a few moments on his right side in the lion posture mindful and clearly comprehending
When his body was refreshed he would rise and pass the second part of the afternoon surveying the world
In the third part of the afternoon the people of the village or town near which he was dwelling who had given alms in the morning would assemble in the monastery welldressed and wellgroomed bringing scents flowers and other offerings
The Exalted One would approach displaying whatever wonders were appropriate for the assembly present Then sitting down in his special seal in the assembly hall he would teach the Dhamma in a way fitting the time and occasion When the discourse was finished he would dismiss the assembly and the people having done homage to him would depart
 These were his afternoon activities
When he had finished his afternoon activities if he wanted to bathe he would rise up from his seat enter the bathroom and refresh his body with water brought by his attendant
The attendant would also take the seat and prepare it in a cell in the Fragrant Collage
The Exalted One having put on a fresh welldyed lower robe fastened the waistband and arranged his upper robe over one shoulder would return to his cell and sit alone for a few moments in solitary meditation Thereafter the bhikkhus would arrive from various directions to attend upon the Master
Some would ask questions some would request meditation subjects some would ask about points of Dhamma
The Exalted One would pass the first watch of the night complying with their requests
 These were his activities during the first watch of the night
When the first watch activities were completed and the bhikkhus had paid homage to the Master and departed the deities of the entire tenthousandfold world system would gain the opportunity to see the Exalted One Having approached him they would ask whatever questions might occur to them even one only four syllables in length
and the Exalted One would pass the middle watch of the night replying to their questions
 These were his activities during the middle watch of the night
He divided the last watch of the night into three parts Because his body ached from silting continuously since early morning he would spend one part pacing up and down to dispel the discomfort
In the second part he would enter the Fragrant Cottage and lie down on his right side in the lion posture mindful and clearly comprehending
In the third part he would rise take a seat and survey the world with the Buddhaeye in order to discover individuals who had observed their course of duties such as giving alms and observing precepts in the presence of the Buddhas of the past
 These were his activities during the last watch of the night
On that day the Exalted One after concluding his morning activities in Rājagaha set out on his journey in the afternoon In the first watch of the night he explained meditation subjects to the bhikkhus and in the middle watch answered the questions of the deities In the last watch while pacing up and down on the walkway he learned of the discussion taking place among the bhikkhus concerning his knowledge of omniscience having heard it with his knowledge of omniscience itself Hence it was said above He heard it through his knowledge of omniscience
Realizing this he thought These bhikkhus are holding a discussion concerning my knowledge of omniscience The working of the knowledge of omniscience is not clear to them it is clear only to me
But when I have gone there they will immediately tell me all about their discussion Then making their discussion the occasion for a discourse as though lifting up Mount Sineru or pounding the sky with a golden mallet I will teach the Brahmajāla Suita Within it I will analyze the three classes of virtue roar my irreversible lions roar over the sixtytwo cases of views subsume the views under the law of conditionality and having elucidated the Buddhaqualities I will bring the teaching to a climax with the attainment of arahatship causing the tenthousandfold world system to quake This teaching of mine will help beings to attain the deathless the supreme state of nibbāna even five thousand years following my parinibbāna
sat down on the prepared seat In the time of the Buddha it is told wherever even a single bhikkhu dwelt a seat was always prepared for the Master
Why
When a bhikkhu had received a meditation subject from the Master and went to dwell at a place convenient to himself the Exalted One would direct his attention to him thinking such and such a bhikkhu has received a meditation subject from me and gone away Will he be able to attain a state of spiritual distinction or not
Then he would see that bhikkhu having dropped his meditation subject reflecting upon an unwholesome thought The Exalted One would think How is this After this clansman has received a subject of meditation from a Master such as myself should unwholesome thoughts overwhelm him and drive him on through the suffering of the beginningless round of existence  In order to help him the Exalted One would show himself to the bhikkhu admonish him and rising into the air return to his own dwelling place
Then those bhikkhus who had been admonished would reflect The Master knowing our minds came here and showed himself standing in our presence
If at that moment we have to go about searching for a seat where the Master could be invited to sit that would be troublesome
Therefore they kept a seat prepared
He who had a chair prepared his chair
He who had none prepared a bed a bench a log a rock or a heap of sand
If that was not available they gathered old leaves and spread a rag over them
But here there was a royal seat The bhikkhus dusted it by beating prepared it and sat around it praising the excellence of the Exalted Ones knowledge of the dispositions of others
 At this point the introductory narrative spoken by the Venerable nanda is completed The introduction by mentioning the time place teacher background story assembly and region helps facilitate comprehension of this sutta perfect in meaning and phrasing illustrating the greatness of the spiritual power of the Buddhaqualities
Now with the words If bhikkhus others speak in dispraise of me the time has come to comment on the sutta delivered by the Exalted One
And since this commentary will be clearer if we first examine the grounds on which the Exalted One delivers a sutta we will deal with this latter point first
There are four grounds for the delivery of a sutta personal inclination  the inclinations of others  the proposal of a question and the occurrence of a special incident 
Among these those suttas that the Exalted One declares entirely through his own inclination wiihout being requested by others have personal inclination as the ground for their delivery Some examples of this class are the kaṅkheyya Sutta  the Vattha Sutta  the Mahasatipaṭṭhana Sutta  the Mahāsaḷāyatana Sulla  the Ariyavamsa Sutta  and many suttas on the right endeavors the bases of spiritual success the faculties powers factors of enlightenment and factors of the path
Those suttas that he declares by reason of the inclinations of others after discerning their inclination acquiescence state of mind aspiration and capacity for understanding have the inclinations of others as the ground for their delivery An instance is the case of Rāhula when the Exalted One perceived that the factors maturing in emancipation had reached maturity in Rāhula he thought Let me now lead Rāhula to the destruction of the cankers  Some suttas of this class are the Cūḷarāhula Sulla  the Mahārāhula Sutta  the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta  and the Dhātuvibhanga Sutta 
When the four assemblies the four classes nāgas supaṇṇas gandhabbas asuras yakkhas the gods of the sensesphere heavens and Mahābrahmas approach the Exalted One and ask questions about the factors of enlightenment
hindrances clinging aggregates
the best treasure of man and so onand the Exalted One speaks a sutta in reply those suttas have the proposal of a question as the ground for their delivery
To this class belong numerous suttas of the Saṃyutta Nikaya and the Sakkapañha  Cūḷavedalla  Mahāvedalla  Sāmaññaphala  and other suttas
And those suttas declared because a special incident had occurredthese have the occurrence of a special incident as the ground for their pronouncement Examples are the suttas Dhammadāyāda  Cūḷasīhanāda  the Candūpama Puttamaṃsūpama Dārukkhandhūpama Aggikkhandūpama Phenapiṇḍūpama and Pāricchattakūpama
Of the four this Brahmajāla Sutta has the occurrence of a special incident as the ground for its delivery
since it was delivered by the Exalted One on account of the occurrence of a special incident
And what was that incident
Praise and dispraise
The teacher Suppiya spoke in dispraise of the Triple Gem while his pupil Brahmadatta spoke in their praise
Thus making praise and dispraise the occasion the Exalted One skilled in teaching began the discourse with the words If bhikkhus others speak in dispraise of me
Although there was no resentment in those bhikkhus the Buddha set up a guideline in order to prohibit clansmen in the future from arousing unwholesome states of mind under similar circumstances
In the passage  by the first statement the Master prohibits ill will By the second if you were to become angry or upset  you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves he shows the danger involved in ill will
that anger or displeasure would present an obstacle to attaining the first jhāna etc
Having thus shown the danger by the third statement in the form of the question would you be able to recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken
he shows that an angry person cannot even recognize the meaning of a statement
As it is said
The angry person does not know the meaning The angry person does not see the Dhamma
Only a mass of blinding gloom remains When anger overpowers a person
Anger is an agent of harm Anger is a disturbance of mind
The danger produced on account of this That the people do not understand 
You should unravel what is false and point it out as false Having thus prohibited ill will now the Master shows the proper course of conduct
This is the interpretation If you should hear others say Your teacher is not omniscient the Dhamma is badly expounded the Saṅgha is practicing wrongly etc you should not remain silent
You should reply What you say is false For this reason it is false for this reason it is untrue There is no such thing in us this is not found among us Our teacher is omniscient the Dhamma is well expounded the Saṅgha is practicing the good path Such and such is the reason
This unraveling should be undertaken only in the case of dispraise not in other cases
For if someone were to say You are depraved and your teacher did this and that you should remain silent and hear it patiently You should be cautious
Putting away ill will you may unravel the dispraise
Bui if anyone should abuse you with any of the ten forms of abusecalling you a buffalo an ox etcyou should look upon him with equanimity and practice forbearance and patience
In the previous section he showed equipoise in the case of dispraise now he shows the same quality in the case of praise
By the first statement he prohibits exhilaration By the second if you were to become jubilant etc he shows the danger therein
that exhilaration would present an obstacle to the first jhāna etc
Query Why is this said
Hasnt the Buddha
in many suttas spoken in praise of the rapture and joy that arise over the Triple Gem
Reply This is true he has praised it But that is the rapture and joy connected with renunciation
Here the intention is the rapture and joy that arise connected with worldliness the kind that arise by thinking Our Buddha our Dhamina our Saṅgha
For that is what creates an obstacle to attaining the first jhāna etc
This rapture is associated with greed
and greed is similar to anger
As it is said
The greedy person does not know the meaning The greedy person does not see the Dhamma
Only a mass of blinding gloom remains When greed overpowers a person
Greed is an agent of harm Greed is a disturbance of mind
The danger produced on account of this That the people do not understand 
A third statement has not come down here but it should be understood as implicit
For the greedy man like the angry man does not understand the meaning of what is spoken
This is the interpretation of the section showing the proper course of practice If you should hear others say Your teacher is omniscient a Worthy One a perfectly enlightened Buddha the Dhamma is well expounded the Saṅgha is practicing the good path  you should not remain silent
You should acknowledge it What you say is a fact For this reason it is a fact for this reason it is true
The Exalted One for such and such a reason is a Worthy One a perfectly enlightened Buddha the Dhamma for such and such a reason is well expounded visible here and now the Saṅgha for such and such a reason is practicing the good path practicing the straight path
If asked Are you virtuous  you may claim I am virtuous
If asked Have you gained the first jhāna  etc or Are you an arahat  then you may admit the fact  but only to fellow bhikkhus
In this way domination by evil desires is avoided and the fruitfulness of the Dispensation of the Buddha is made plain
What is the sequential structure of this sutta
This sutta is bound together by two terms praise and dispraise
Dispraise is refuted by pointing out For such and such a reason this is false this is untrue  etc just as fire is extinguished by submerging it in water
And praise is confirmed by acknowledging fact as fact thus For such and such a reason this is a fact
Praise is of two kinds that spoken by Brahmadatta and that spoken by the company of bhikkhus
The Master will show the sequel to the praise spoken by the company of bhikkhus later in the sutta in the section on the elucidation of emptiness 
Here he begins the teaching by showing the sequel to the praise spoken by Brahmadatta
It is bhikkhus only to trifling and insignificant matters to the minor details of mere moral virtue
Query Isnt it true that virtue is the supreme ornamentation of a yogi
As it is said by the ancients
Virtue is the adornment of a yogi Virtue is a yogis ornament
A yogi adorned with virtuous conduct Has gained the very foremost ornament
And the Exalted One himself has extolled virtue in many hundreds of suttas
e g  If bhikkhus a bhikkhu should wish May I be dear and agreeable to my companions in the holy life revered and esteemed he should be perfect in fulfilling the rules of conduct  etc
And so too in many other suttas virtue is extolled
Then why is virtue here said to be trifling
Reply Virtue is trifling in comparison with higher qualities
For virtue does not reach the level of the excellence of concentration and concentration does not reach the level of the excellence of wisdom Therefore in comparison with the higher qualities the inferior ones are called insignificant
How is it that virtue does not reach the level of the excellence of concentration
In the seventh year following the enlightenment the Exalted One while sitting beneath a celestial white parasol three yojanas wide on a divan a yojana wide in a jewelled pavilion twelve yojanas wide at the foot of Kaṇḍas mango tree by the citygate of Sāvatthā performed the twin miracle before an assembly of people extending for twelve yojanas in all directions   Thereby he showed his acceptance of the challenge posed by the sectarians and quelled their forces From the upper part of his body a mass of fire issued forth from the lower part a stream of water issued forth  from each single hairpore a mass of fire issued forth and from each single hairpore came a stream of water of six colors 
The goldencolored rays issuing from his golden colored body continued on to the summit of existence adorning the entire tenthousandfold world sphere The remaining colored rays issuing from his body in turn according to color came forth that they appeared to come forth simultaneously at a single moment
 There is no occurrence of two acts of consciousness at a single moment
But in the case of the Buddhas by reason of the brevity of their stay in the bhavaṅga  and through their fivefold mastery  the differently colored rays appeared to come forth at a single moment
But in reality the adverting preparation and resolution for each colored ray is done separately
The Exalted One attains the blue kasiṇa absorption in order to produce the blue rays the yellow kasina in order to produce the yellow rays the red and white kasiṇas in order to produce the red and white rays the fire kasiṇa in order to produce the mass of fire and the water kasina in order to produce the stream of water
The Master paces up and down while projected images of himself stand or sit or lie down and so on all may he explained at length 
In all this there is not even one thing that was accomplished by virtue All was accomplished by concentration
Therefore virtue does not reach to the excellence of concentration
 After fulfilling the pāramīs for four incalculables and a hundred thousand great aeons the Exalted One in his twenty ninth year renounced his palace which was like the glorious abode of a worldruling monareh went forth into homelessness on the bank of the Anomā River and devoted himself to striving and exertion for six years On the full moon day of the month of Visākha he ate a meal of honeyed milkrice infused with celestial nectar offered by Sujātā in Uruvelā That evening he entered the terrace of enlightenment via the path running front north to south circumambulated the royal assallha tree three times and standing on the northeastern side spread a seat of straw fourteen feet across Taking his seat on that excellent divan with the Bodhi tree fifteen feet behind him  its trunk standing like a silver column upon a golden pedestal its branches towering above like a jewelled parasol and its tendrils drooping like veins of coral on a golden clothhe folded his legs crosswise in the triple jointed posture developed the preliminary meditation of loving kindness complete in four factors and made a firm determination not to relax his energy until he attained enlightenment As the sun set he defeated the army of Māra In the first watch of the night he recollected his past lives in the middle watch he purified the divine eye and in the early hours of dawn he immersed his faculty of knowledge in the law of conditionality Then as is the custom of all Buddhas he entered the fourth jhāna by mindfulness of breathing and making that the basis developed insight Thereby he attained in succession each of the four supramundane paths until with the attainment of the path of arahatship he expelled all defilements and penetrated all the Buddhaqualities This is was all accomplished bywisdom
Thus concentration does not reach to the excellence of wisdom
Thus when each lower quality is compared to each higher quality virtue is found to be trifling and insignificant
a worldling would refer when speaking in praise of the Tathāgata Here
The Enlightened One the kinsman of the sun Speaks of the worldling in a twofold way 
One is the worldling blinded by darkness The other the worldling noble and good
The blind worldling is the worldling who has not studied interrogated learned memorized and reviewed the teachings on the aggregates elements sense bases etc
The worldling who has done so is the good worldling 
The derivation is twofold
He is called a worldling for such reasons As that he generates a multitude of things
Because he is immersed in the herd And because he is a person who is distinct
The worldling is socalled because he generates a multitude of diverse defilements etc
As it is said
They generate a multitude of defilements hence they are worldlings They have not destroyed the multiple forms of personality view they look up to a multitude of teachers they have not emerged from the multitude of destinations they form multiple kammaformations they are swept away by a multitude of floods afflicted by a multitude of afflictions consumed by a multitude of fevershence they are worldlings They are lustful and greedy for the live multiple strands of sense pleasure therein they are bound infatuated addicted attached fastened and confined hence they are worldlings They are obstructed hindered and enveloped by the five multiple hindrances there they are enclosed concealed and incarcerated  hence they are worldlings 
Again one who is included among the incalculable multitude of people who live according to an inferior doctrine and are averse to the doctrine of the ariyans is called a worldling And a person distinct or remote from the ariyans endowed with such noble qualities as virtue learning etc is called a worldling
 Having abandoned the destruction of life the recluse Gotama abstains from the destruction of life The word life signifies in conventional discourse a living being  in the ultimate sense it is the lifefaculty  The destruction of life is the volition of killing in one who perceives a living being as such occurs through the door of either the body or of speech and occasions an act of cutting off the lifefaculty of that living being
In the case of beings devoid of moral qualities such as animals the act of killing is less blameworthy when the being is small in size more blameworthy when the being is big Why
Because of the magnitude of the effort involved in killing a being with a big body
But even when the effort is the same the act of killing a bigbodied being is still more blameworthy because of the magnitude of its physical substance
In the case of beings endowed with moral qualities such as humans the act of killing is less blameworthy when the being has low moral qualities and more blameworthy when the being has high moral qualities
But when the physical body and moral qualities of the victims are equal the act of killing is less blameworthy when the defilements and force of the effort are mild more blameworthy when they are powerful
The act of killing hits five components  a living being the perception of the living being as such the thought of killing the act and the death of the being by means of the act
There are six means of killing ones own person  commanding  mobile weapons  stationary devices  magical formulas and psychic power
It is in this way bhikkhus that a worldling would speak This is a synopsis The worldling speaking in praise of the Tathāgata would speak thus The recluse Gotama does not kill living beings or order others to do so nor does he approve of such action He abstains from this depravity Oh how great are the Buddhas qualities Having aroused great zeal desiring to speak praise he mentions only something trifling and insignificant mere virtue and good conduct
The worldling is unable to speak praise referring to those qualities of the Tathāgata that he does not share in common with others
But not only the worldling Streamenterers oncereturners nonreturners arahats and even paccekabuddhas cannot speak of that The Talhāgata alone can do so
Having abandoned taking what is not given the recluse Gotoma abstains from taking what is not given Taking what is not given is stealing the belongings of others theft or robbery
When another person exercises free control over a particular article and is unimpeachable and irreproachable for so doing that article is his or her property
Taking what is not given is the volition of theft in one who perceives anothers property as such which volition occasions the act of taking away that property from the owner
The act is less blameworthy when the article stolen is low in value more blameworthy when it is high in value Why
Because of the superior value of the article
When the articles stolen are equal in value the stealing of an article belonging to one of superior moral qualities is more blameworthy
the stealing of an article belonging to one of inferior moral qualities is less blameworthy
The act of stealing has five components property belonging to another the perception of the property belonging to another as such the thought of stealing the act and the removal of the article
 Having abandoned false speech the recluse Gotama abstains from false speech Here falsity is the bodily or vocal effort destroying the welfare of others of one who is bent on deceiving False speech is the volition with intention to deceive occasioning the bodily or vocal effort to deceive others
Another method of explanation is as follows False is a situation that is not fact untrue
False speech is the intimation that such a case is fact or truth
According to characteristic false speech denotes the volition occasioning such an act of intimation in one who wishes to make another believe that an untrue situation is true
When the welfare that it destroys is slight it is less blameworthy when the welfare is great it is more blameworthy
Further when a householder reluctant to part with a certain possession denies that he owns it it is of little blame but when he is called to witness and lies for the sake of destroying anothers welfare then the blame is heavy For monks the blame is light when they exaggerate in jest e g  if after getting a little oil or ghee they say Oil flows like a river in the village today But the blame is heavy when they claim to have seen something they did not see 
There are four components an untrue situation the thought of deceiving the corresponding effort and the communication of the meaning to another
There is one means ones own person
and it operates by the action of deceiving another with the body or with an object connected with the body or with speech
If another understands the meaning conveyed one is hound by the kamma of false speech at the very moment the volition occurred occasioning the act 
Having abandoned slander Slander is the volition occasioning bodily or vocal effort in one who with a defiled mind aims at dividing others or winning the affection of others for oneself
The act is less blameworthy when the person one divides is of inferior moral qualities more blameworthy when he or she is of superior moral qualities
There are four components a person to be divided the disposition to create a division or to win affection and trust for oneself the effort and the communication of the meaning
Having abandoned harsh speech Harsh speech is the definitely harsh volition occasioning bodily or vocal effort that cuts into the quick of anothers heart
Though there is such effort cutting into the quick of anothers heart it does not count as harsh speech when it is backed by tenderness of mind
For parents sometimes tell their children May robbers cut you into bits But in truth they do not want even a lotus leaf to fall on them
And preceptors and teachers sometimes say to their pupils What is the use with you shameless rascals Get out Yet they wish their success in study and spiritual achievement
Harsh speech is less blameworthy when the person at whom it is directed is of inferior moral qualities more blameworthy when the person is of superior moral qualities
There are three components a person to he abused an angry mind and the act of abusing
Having abandoned idle chatter Idle chatter is the unwholesome volition occasioning the bodily or vocal effort to communicate something useless
It is less blameworthy when indulgence is mild more blameworthy when indulgence is great There are two components the disposition to engage in useless talk such us talk on the great war of India or the abduction of Sīta and the act of engaging in such talk
Having explained in detail the three classes of moral virtue as the sequel to the praise spoken by Brahmadatta with the words There are bhikkhus other dhammas the Exalted One begins the elucidation of emptiness as the sequel to the praise spoken by the company of bhikkhus
There are bhikkhus other dhammas The word dhamma is used in various senses noble quality  the teaching  the scriptures  impersonal states  etc
Dhamma and nondhamma are two different things Which lead to two dissimilar results
Nondhamma will lead lo hell in the end While dhamma finally leads to heaven 
 In verse dhamma means noble quality
In the passage I will teach you the Dhamma bhikkhus good in the beginning etc it means the teaching
In the passage Herein a bhikkhu masters the Dhammathe suttas songs etc  it means the scriptures
And in the passage On that occasion there are dhammas there are aggregates  etc  it means impersonal states
Here the meaning noble quality applies
Thus the sentence means There are other noble qualities of the Tathāgata 
deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise Deep just as a mosquito cannot get a fooling on the great ocean so the knowledge of anyone other than the Tathāgata cannot get a footing in these dhammas They are difficult to see because of their depth
and difficult to understand because they are difficult to see
They are peaceful because all the fevers of passion become pacified or because they occur in regard to peaceful objects
They are sublime because one cannot be satiated with them as with delicious food
They are beyond the sphere of reasoning because the objective domain of the uttermost knowledge cannot be encompassed by reasoning
They are subtle because they are abstruse and recondite in nature
And they are comprehensible only to the wise that is they must be understood by the wise for they are not the objective domain of fools
What are these dhammas extolled by the Talhāgata
The knowledge of omniscience 
If so why is it described in the plural 
Because il is associated with multiple classes of consciousness and because it takes a multiplicity of objects
For the knowledge of omniscience is found in the four great functional classes of consciousness associated with knowledge    And the knowledge of omniscience does not take only a single dhamma as its object 
As it is said It knows the entire past thus it is the knowledge of omniscience It knows everything therein without obstruction thus it is the unobstructed knowledge  etc 
Therefore because it is associated with multiple classes of consciousness and because it takes a multiplicity of objects on the successive occasions of its arising it is described in the plural
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins
Why is this teaching undertaken in this way
Because on four occasions the thundering of the Buddhas becomes truly great their knowledge enters its proper field the greatness of the Buddha knowledge becomes manifest and their teaching becomes deep stamped with the three characteristics connected with emptiness
What are these four occasions
The promulgation of the Discipline  the classification of the diversity of planes bhūmantara the exposition of conditionality  and the classification of the diversity of creeds 
The promulgation of the Discipline is the promulgation of a training rule in a parlicular case which has arisen thus This is a light offence this a heavy offence This is curable this incurable This is an offence this not an offence This leads to expulsion this to rehabilitation this to confession This is a fault according to the world this according to the rules of the Order In such a case such should be promulgated  in this matter others have neither the capacity nor the power for this is not the domain of others It is the domain only of the Talhāgata
Thus in the promulgation of the Discipline the thundering of the Buddhas becomes truly great their knowledge enters its proper field and so on
The classification of the diversity of planes is the analysis of the Abhidhamma Piṭaka with its twentyfourfold universal pattern and its infinite methods proceeding thus These are the four foundations of mindfulness  this the Noble Eightfold Path There are five aggregates twelve sense bases eighteen elements four truths twenty two faculties nine root causes four nutriments seven contacts seven feelings seven perceptions seven volitions and seven types of consciousness
Among these so many dhammas pertain to the sense sphere so many to the finematerial and immaterial spheres So many dhammas are mundane so many are supramundane  Others have neither the capacity nor the power to explain this mailer for this is not the domain of others It is the domain only of the Tathāgata
Thus in the classification of the diversity of planes the thundering of the Buddhas becomes truly great their knowledge enters its proper field and so on 
The exposition of conditionality is the analysis of dependent origination that is the occurrence of a particular dharnma as a condition in such and such ways for some other dhamma This has three rounds three periods of time three links four sections and twenty modes and is expounded as follows Ignorance is a condition for kammafornmations in nine modes it is a condition as arising occurrence sign accumulation conjunction impediment origination cause and condition
As it is said What is wisdom in the discernment of conditions the knowledge of the structure of dhammas
Ignorance is the basis for kammaformations as the arising occurrence sign accumulation conjunction impediment origination cause and condition for kammaformations Ignorance is a condition in these nine modes the kammaformations are conditionally arisen both these dhaminas are conditionally arisenthis is wisdom in the discernment of conditions the knowledge of the structure of dhammas
In the past it was so in the future it will be so And so on as far as Birth is the basis for aging and death as the arising  and condition for aging and death Birth is a condition in these nine modes aging and death are conditionally arisen both these dhammas are conditionally arisen this is wisdom in the discernment of conditions the knowledge of the structure of dhammas 
Others have neither the capacity nor the power to explain this matter for this is not the domain of others It is the domain only of the Tathāgata Thus in the exposition of conditionality the thundering of the Buddhas becomes truly great their knowledge enters its proper field and so on
The classification of the diversity of creeds is the analysis disentangling and unraveling of the sixty two speculative views proceeding thus There are four eternalists four partialeternalists four extensionists four endless equivocators and two fortuitous originationists there are sixteen who hold doctrines of percipient immortality eight who hold doctrines of nonpercipient immortality and eight who hold doctrines of neither percipient nor nonpercipient immortality there are seven annihilationists and five who hold doctrines of nibbāna here and now
Depending upon this they assume this  Others have neither the capacity nor the power to explain this matter for this is not the domain of others It is the domain only of the Tathāgata
Thus in the classification of the diversity of creeds the thundering of the Buddhas becomes truly great their knowledge enters its proper field and so on
In this place the classification of the diversity of creeds is found Therefore in order to show the greatness of his knowledge of omniscience and in order to give through the discourse an explication and elucidation of emptiness the King of the Dhamma enters into the diversity of creeds and begins his answer to the question with the words  There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past
Speculators about the past  they apprehend after thinking and speculating about the past 
The word anta here has the meaning of portion 
Kappa here signifies craving and views
As it is said There are two thought constructions the thought construction governed by craving and the thought construction governed by views 
Therefore the meaning of speculators about the past should be understood as follows they persistently think and speculate about the past portion of the aggregates by way of craving and views
who hold settled views about the pst As they thus persistently speculate about the past their views by arising repeatedly become settled on the past  thus they hold settled views about the past 
and who on eighteen grounds assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past  Holding such views they try to convert other people to their views by asserting on eighteen grounds various conceptual theorems referring to the past
the word conceptual theorems  means designational terms 
Views are called adhivutti because they do violence to the real meaning and do not apprehend things according to their true nature 
Adhivuttipadāni therefore are terms signifying views
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are eternalists and who on four grounds proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
Apprehending one of the aggregates such as material form etc to be the self and the world they proclaim it to be eternal immortal permanent and stable
As it is said They proclaim the self and the world thus Material form is the self and the world it is eternal Again they proclaim the self and the world thus Feeling  perception  menial formations  consciousness is the self and the world it is eternal 
Barren  like barren cattle or barren land the self and the world do not bear fruit and do not produce anything
By this statement he denies that the jhānas etcapprehended as the self and the world produce anything such as material form etc
By the two expressions steadfast as a mountain peak 
and standing firm like a pillar 
he illustrates the indestructibility of the world
But some read the text as īsikaṭṭhayiṭṭhito  explaining the term thus The world stands like a reed in muñja grass
This is the purport that which is said to he born emerges as something already existing  like a reed that comes out from a sheath of muñja grass
Because exist immanently like a reed it is said these beings roam on in saṃsara i c  from here they go elsewhere
and though these beings roam and wander  pass away and rearise  wander they transmigrate from one state of existence to another
Pass away they are reckoned thus 
Our theorist here undermines his own doctrine for having first said the self and the world are eternal he now says these beings roam and wander  The theorists view is inconsistent It is fickle like a stake implanted in a heap of chaff The good and the bad alike are mixed in it like pieces of cake feces and cowdung in the basket of a madman
yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself He conceives them to be like the great earth Mount Sineru the sun or the moon on account of their permanent existence
Conceiving the self to be like these he asserts they remain the same just like eternity itself
What is the reason
Because I recollect my numerous past lives 
for this reason I know this the self and the world are eternal Now in order to prove his assertion that the self and the world are eternal the theorist gives his reason With the words for this reason I know this he shows through this distinguished achievement I know this through direct experience  I do not speak from mere faith alone for the purpose of converting others
This bhikkhus is the first case This is the first among the four cases referred to by the word ground in the phrase on four grounds  The meaning is the first cause consisting in the recollection of several hundred thousand past lives
The same method of explanation applies to the following two sections only
where the first section speaks in terms of the recollection of many hundred thousands of past births
the following two speak in terms of the recollection of ten and forty aeons of world contraction and expansion respectively
For a sectarian with dull intelligence can recollect several hundred thousand past births one with medium intelligence can recollect ten aeons of world contraction and expansion and one with keen intelligence can recollect forty aeons but not more than that
Some recluse or brahmin is a rationalist an investigator Rationalist 
is a designation lor a theorist who assumes his views via reasoning and initial thought 
Investigation is pondering preferring acquiescing 
Just as a man descends into water after investigating its depth with a stick the investigator ponders forms a preference acquiesces and assumes his view
There are four kinds of rationalists
One who reasons from hearsay  He hears about King Vessantara and reasons If the Exalted One was Vessantara there must be an eternal self  Then he assumes this view
One who reasons from memory of past births  He remembers two or three past births and reasons I myself was so and so in the past therefore there must be an eternal self 
One who reasons from fortune  He reasons on the basis of his fortune As my self is happy now so it was in the past and so it will be in the future and then assumes his view
One who follows pure reason  The pure rationalist is one who assumes his view as a result of mere reasoning alone thus If this exists that exists
Outside of these there is none The Buddha roars his irreversible lions roar Outside of these grounds there is not even one cause for the proclaiming of eternalism 
The first sentence may be paraphrased Bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands this fourfold speculative view in its diverse aspects 
Showing what he understands in addition to this he says These standpoints etc Here the views themselves are called standpoints
And further a reason ground or cause for views is also a standpoint
As it is said
What are the eight standpoints 
The aggregates ignorance contact perception initial thought unwise reflection evil friends and the voice of another
The aggregates are a cause and condition in the sense of an origin for a standpoint thus the aggregates are also a standpoint
Ignorance 
the voice of another is a cause and condition in the sense of an origin for a standpoint thus the voice of another is also a standpoint
Thus assumed  Firstly the standpoints consisting in the views that hold the self and the world to be eternal are assumed  i e  taken up and made to occur
They are thus misapprehended  ie  apprehended again and again with an unquestioning mind and consummated with the conclusion This alone is truth any other view is false 
Secondly since the standpoints consisting in the grounds for views give rise to views when they are assumed they are assumed by way of object  by way of occurrence  that is evil friends and the voice of another
They are misapprehended by assuming them again and again as long as the danger inherent in them is not perceived
They lead to such a future destination  that is they lead to the hells the animal kingdom or the realm of ghosts
The following phrase is a synonym for the former
He understands as well what transcends this The Tathāgata does not understand only this fourfold speculative view together with its grounds and destinations but he understands all that and he understands what transcends it that is virtue concentration and the knowledge of omniscience
yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend Although he understands such incomparable states of distinction he does not think I understand this etc misapprehending it by way of craving views and conceit
And because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace With nonmisapprehension as condition he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace  the pacification of the defilements of misapprehension
He shows Bhikkhus nibbāna is evident to the Tathāgata 
Having understood as they really are In order to show the practice by means of which he achieved the state of perfect peace the Tathāgata now explains the meditation subject in terms of those very feelings enamored with which the sectarians enter the jungle of views thinking Here we shall be happy We shall be happy here
Having understood as they really are  He understood as it really is the origin of feelings by way of the following five characteristics He sees the rise of the aggregate of feelings in the sense of its conditioned origination  thus through the origination of ignorance feelings originate through the origination of craving  of kamma  of contact feelings originate
Seeing as well the characteristic of production  he sees the rise of the aggregate of feelings He understood as it really is the passing away of feelings by way of the following five characteristics He sees the fall of the aggregate of feelings in the sense of its conditioned cessation  thus with the cessation of ignorance feelings cease with the cessation of craving  of kamma  of contact feelings cease
Seeing as well the characteristic of change  he sees the fall of the aggregate of feelings He understood as it really is the satisfaction in feelings thus The pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on feelings this is the satisfaction in feelings  He understood as it really is the unsatisfactoriness in feelings thus That feelings are impermanent suffering subject to change this is the unsatisfactoriness in feelings  He understood as it really is the escape from feelings thus The removal and abandoning of desireandlust for feelings this is the escape from feelings  And having understood all this The Tathāgala bhikkhus devoid of clinging through the disappearance of desireandlust is emancipated through nonclinging  Since one might cling to something so long as clinging is present through the absence of clinging and of any aggregates that might exist as a result of past clinging the Tathāgala is emancipated without clinging to anything whatsoever
These are those dhammas bhikkhus  This is a paraphrase I asked What bhikkhus are those dhammas that are deep etc  It is these dhummas pertaining to the knowledge of omniscience expounded in the above passage that are deep difficult to see  comprehensible only to the wise
Concerning these neither the worldling the streamenterer nor anyone else can speak in praise of the Tathāgata in accordance with reality The Tathāgata alone can do so  Asking thus he asked only in reference to the knowledge of omniscience and answering he answered by reference to the same But other views remain to be analyzed
Partialeternalists are of two kinds partialeternalists in regard to beings and partialeternalists in regard to formations 
Both kinds are included here
beings for the most part are reborn in the bhassara Brahmaworld For the most part that is except those who are reborn in the higher Brahmaworlds or in the immaterial realms or 
There they dwell mindmade Mindmade  because they have been reborn through the jhānamind
an empty palace of Brahmā appears The plane of Brahmās company is produced  It was originally empty since no beings were as yet reborn there
It has no maker or creator but is a gemstudded plane produced through kamma as condition and temperature as mode of origin in the way described in the Visuddhimagga
Gardens celestial wishing trees etc are produced here in the natural places for their production
Then a certain being Then an attachment to their dwelling place spontaneously arises in those beings Having developed the first jhāna they descend from there 
Due to the exhaustion of his life span those beings who have done lofty deeds of merit and are reborn in a celestial world with a short life span cannot remain there solely by the power of their merit but pass away because of the length of the life span in that world These beings are said to pass away due to the exhaustion of their life span
Or the exhaustion of his merit those beings who have done inferior deeds of merit and are reborn in a celestial world with a long life span cannot remain for the full life span of that world but pass away in the middle of their life These are said to pass away due to the exhaustion of their merit
There arises in him discontent and agitation Discontent  the longing for the arrival of another being
But dissatisfaction associated with aversion does not exist in the Brahmaworld
Agitation  anxiety  trembling  This is fourfold
the fear fright consternation horripilation and mental disquietude
that arise on account of birth aging disease and death  Agitation through fear 
Agitation through craving  this occurs in the wish Oh that other beings might come to this place
Agitation through views  this is agitation and vacillation 
Agitation through knowledge  this is found in the passage Those gods on hearing the tathāgatas discourse on Dhamma generally feel fear a sense of urgency and terror 
In the above passage both agitation through craving and agitation through views apply
I am  the lord I am the Lord of the world I am the Maker and Creator of the world the earth the Himalayas Mount Sineru the worldspheres the great ocean the moon and the sun have been created by me
the ordainer  I am the one who appoints beings to their place You be a khaltiya you a brahmin you a merchant you a serf You be a householder you a monk
You he a camel you a cow 
What is the reason Now after claiming These beings have been created by me  he sets out to substantiate this with a reason
We have been created by him Although they passed away and rearose by reason of their own kamma through sheer imagination alone they imagined that they had been created by him and bowing before him like crooked pegs being inserted into crooked holes they flocked to his feet 
He is permanent stable eternal not subject to change Not having seen him rearise they say he is permanent  Not seeing him die they say he is stable  Eternal means everexisting He is not subject to change due to the absence of change by way of aging
There are bhikkhus certain gods called corrupted by play Corrupted by play  They are corrupted  i e  destroyed  by play
These gods spend They become forgetful about their food
These gods it is said celebrate a festival in honor of their own great beauty and splendor attained through their distinguished merit They then become so absorbed in their greal enjoyment that they do not even know whether or not they have eaten
But when they have passed up the time even for a single meal though they eat and drink immediately afterwards they pass away and cannot remain
Why
Because of the strength of their kammaborn heat element and the delicacy of their material bodies 
In the case of humans the kammaborn heat clement is delicate and the material body strong Because of the delicacy of their heat and the strength of their bodies they can subsist for even seven days on warm water clear gruel etc
But in the case of gods the heat clement is strong and the body delicate
If they pass up the time even for a single meal they cannot endure
Just as a red or blue lotus placed on a heated rock at midday in the hot season would not be able to resume its original condition in the evening even if one were to pour a hundred jars of water over it but would only perish
in the same way though they cat and drink immediately after these gods pass away and cannot remain
But who are these gods
This matter is not investigated in the Commentary  But since it is said In the case of gods the heat element is strong and the body delicate  without making any distinctions we can understand that all gods living on material food who act thus pass away
Some however say that only the nimmānarati and the paranimmitavasavatti gods are meant
There are bhikkhus certain gods called corrupted by mind Corrupted by mind  they are corrupted i e  destroyed by mind These are the Cātumahārājika gods
One young god among these it is told wishing to celebrate a festival set out by chariot on the roadway along with his retinue Another of those gods going out for a walk saw the first one riding ahead of him He became angry and exclaimed That miserable wretch There he is going along puffed up with rapture to the bursting point as if he had never seen a festival before
The first turning around and realizing that the other was angryangry people being easy to recognizebecame angry in turn and retorted What have you got to do with me you hotheaded fellow My prosperity was gained entirely by my own meritorious works It has nothing to do with you
Now if one of these gods gets angry but the other remains unangered the latter protects the former 
But if both get angry the anger of one will become the condition for the anger of the other and both will pass away with their harems weeping
This is the natural law 
The rationalist sees the breakup of the eye etc but because every preceding act of consciousness  in ceasing conditions the arising of its successor he does not see the breakup of consciousness even though the latter is more prominent than the breakup of the eye etc
Since he does not see the breakup of consciousness he assumes that when the bodily frame breaks up the consciousness goes elsewhere in the same way a bird leaves one tree and settles on another This he declares as his view
Extensionists are those who profess the doctrines of finitude or infinity i e  doctrines occurring with reference to finitude infinity finitude and infinity or neither finitude nor infinity
Without having extended the counterpart sign to the boundaries of the worldsphere apprehending it as the world he abides perceiving the world as finite But he who has extended the kasiṇaimage to the boundaries of the worldsphere perceives the world to be infinite Not extending the sign in the upward and downward directions but extending it across he perceives the world as finite in the upward and downward directions and infinite across
The rationalist doctrine should be understood by the method stated
These four theorists are included among the speculators about the past because they apprehend their view as a consequence of what was previously seen by themselves
Endless equivocation  it does not die thus it is endless 
What is this
The view and speech of this theorist which go on hedging without limits
Equivocation  tossing back and forth in diverse ways  Endless equivocation equivocation through endless views and speech Another method of derivation amarā is the name of a kind of fish  Because they roam about in the water diving in and out it is impossible to catch hold of them Analogously this doctrine roams about here and there and is impossible to catch hold of
therefore it is called eelwriggling 
 does not understand He does not understand as they really are the ten courses of wholesome
and unwholesome kamma
That would distress me it might distress me by producing remorse over having spoken falsely The meaning is that it would be painful
That distress would be an obstacle for me i e  an obstacle to attaining heaven or the path
Out of fear and loathing of making a false statement due to moral dread and shame
I do not take it thus  this is indeterminate equivocation
I do not take it in that way  he rejects the externalist doctrine that the self and the world are eternal
Nor do I take it in some other way  i e  in some way other than eternalism by this he rejects partialeternalism
I do not say that it is not  he rejects the annihilationist doctrine that the Tathāgata does not exist after death 
Nor do I say that it is neither this nor that  he rejects the rationalist doctrine that the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death 
 When asked he does not himself declare anything as wholesome or unwholesome
When asked Is this wholesome he says I do not take it thus
Asked What is it then unwholesome  he says I do not take it that way
Asked Is it then something other than these two  he says Nor do I lake il in some other way
Asked If it is neither of these three what is your opinion  he says I do not say that it is not
Asked In your opinion is it neither this nor that  he says Nor do I say that it is neither this nor that  Thus he resorts to equivocation and does not take a stand on any single side
desire and lust  might arise in me Without understanding he suddenly declares the wholesome to be wholesome and the unwholesome to be unwholesome Then afterwards he asks other wise men I explained thus to so and so Was my explanation right  If they should say You explained rightly goldmouth you declared the wholesome to be wholesome and the unwholesome lo be unwholesome he might think There is no wise man equal to me thus desire and lust might arise in me
Here desire is weak attachment lust strong attachment
or hatred and aversion might arise in me If he declares the wholesome to be unwholesome and the unwholesome to be wholesome and asks wise men about his reply they will say You explained wrongly  Then he will think I do not even know this much  thus hatred and aversion might arise in me  Here hatred is weak anger aversion strong anger
That would be clinging on my part Such clinging would distress me The pair desire and lust would be clinging on my part the pair hatred and aversion would distress me
Or both pairs are clinging because they are forms of holding firmly and both are distress because they cause distress
For lust takes hold of the object like a leech not desiring to let go of it
And hatred takes hold of it like a poisonous snake desiring to destroy it
And both pairs cause distress in the sense that they are afflicting Thus they are called both clinging and distress 
 They might crossexamine me They might ask me my opinion What is wholesome What is unwholesome State your opinion
They might press me for reason If I say This is my opinion  they might ask for my reasons For what reason do you hold this 
They might refute my statements If I say For this reason they would point out the errors in my reasons and would examine me thus You do not understand this Accept this Answer this
These four endless equivocators are included among the speculators about the past because they apprehend their view as a consequence of some dhamma occurring in the past
To originate fortuitously  to originate without a cause 
There are bhikkhus certain gods called nonpercipient beings Nonpercipient beings  this is the heading of the teaching Because they arise without mind their individual forms consist of mere materiality 
Their origin is explained as follows Someone who has gone forth into a sectarian order practices the preliminary work of meditation on the wind kasiṇa and develops the fourth jhāna After emerging from the jhāna he sees the fault in mind thus When there is mind one is exposed to the suffering of having ones hands mutilated etc and to all kinds of perils Enough with mind The unconscious state alone is peaceful  Having thus seen the fault in mind if he passes away without having fallen away from the jhāna he is reborn among the nonpercipient beings With the cessation of his final deathconsciousness his mental process desists here in the human world and the mere aggregate of material form becomes manifest in the nonpercipient realm
Just as an arrow driven by the propulsive force of the howsiring travels through space to a distance exactly proportional to the propulsive force of the siring
in the same way this being taking rebirth through the propulsive force of the jhāna remains in that realm for a time exactly proportional to the propulsive force of the jhāna When the force of the jhana is exhausted the aggregate of material form disappears there and a rebirthlinking perception arises here 
Because their passing away from the nonpercipient realm is discerned through the arising of perception here it is said When perception arises in them those gods pass away from that plane
The rest is evident
The self is material  apprehending the material form of the kasiṇa object as the self and the perception as the selfs perception or by mere reasoning as in the case of the jīvakas  etc they proclaim The self is immutable after death percipient and material
 Apprehending the signs of the immaterial attainments as the self and the perception occurring as the selfs perception or by mere reasoning as in the case of the Nigaṇṭhas  etc they proclaim The self is immutable after death percipient and immaterial
The third view arises by combining the views
the fourth through reasoning
The second tetrad should be understood by th method stated in the discussion of extensionism
In the third tetrad the doctrine that the self is of uniform perception pertains to one who gains the meditative attainments the doctrine that the self is of diversified perception pertains to the nonattainer the doctrine that the self is of limited perception pertains to one who employs a limited kasiṇa and the doctrine that the self is of boundless perception pertains to one who employs an expanded kasiṇa
With the fourth tetrad having seen with the divine eye a being taking rebirth on the plane of the first three or four jhānas he holds that the self is exclusively happy
Having seen a being reborn in hell he holds that the self is exclusively miserable
Having seen a being reborn in the human world he holds that the self is both happy and miserable
Having seen a being reborn among the Vehapphala gods  he holds that the self is neither happy nor miserable
Generally those who gain the recollection of past lives speculate about the past those who gain the divine eye speculate about the future
The doctrines of nonpercipient immortality should be understood in terms of the first two tetrads of the doctrine of percipient immortality
and also those of neither percipient nor nonpercipient immortality
Only those theorists held the view that the self is percipient while these respectively hold that it is nonpercipient and neither percipient nor nonpercipient
No special reason need be sought for this
for the theorists assumptions are like the basket of a madman
There are two types of people who hold the annihilationist view the possessor and the nonpossessor
The possessor adopts the annihilationist view when with the divine eye he perceives the passing away of an arahat without seeing any rebirth or when he perceives the mere passing away without seeing their rebirth
The nonpossessor adopts the annihilationist view because he does not know of any world beyond or because he is greedy for sense pleasures
or by way of reasoning eg  as follows Beings are just like leaves which fall from a tree and never grow again 
The seven annihilationist views arise on account of craving and views in one way or another or by proceeding eclectically
Originates from mother and father
What is that
Semen and blood
Thus the first theorist asserts the human form under the heading of the material body to be the self
The second rejecting this doctrine asserts the divine form to be the self
Divine means originating in the world of the gods
Pertaining to the sense sphere means included among the six classes of sensesphere gods
In the third mindmade means produced through the jhāna mind
Not destitute of any faculties complete in its faculties
This is said by way of the faculties existing in the Brahmaworld and the figures of the others
The meaning of the fourth etc is explained in the Visuddhimagga 
Here and now  a directly experienceable dhamma  This is a designation for the individuality obtained in this or that state of existence
Nibbāna here and now means the subsiding of suffering in this very individuality
Revels he allows his sense faculties to roam and wander among the strands of sense pleasure according to his wish and indulges in them in this way and that
Or else he sports delights and plays with them
The strands of sense pleasure are twofold the human and the divine
The human are like those enjoyed by King Mandhatu the divine are like those enjoyed by the king of the Paranimmitavasavattī gods
The theorists proclaim the achievement of nibbana here and now only for those who have acquired such sense pleasures
At this point all the sixtytwo views have been explained
Seven of these views belong to annihilationism the remainder to eternalism
Now collecting into one all the speculators about the future in the section beginning it is on these fortyfour grounds  the Exalted One reveals his knowledge of omniscience
And collecting into one all the speculators about the past the future in the section beginning it is on these sixtytwo grounds  he again reveals this same knowledge of omniscience
Thus when in the beginning he asked And what bhikkhus are those dhammas that are deep etc  he asked only in reference to the knowledge of omniscience And answering this question the Exalted One answers by means of the same knowledge of omniscience bringing forth the sixtytwo speculative views just as if he were weighing the inclinations of beings with a pair of scales or removing the sand from the foot of Mount Sineru
This teaching has come down by way of a sequence of meaning dictated by the natural structure of the teaching
For suttas have three kinds of sequence of meaning a sequence of meaning based on a question  a sequence of meaning dictated by inclination  and a sequence of meaning dictated by the natural structure of the teaching 
Herein the sequence of meaning based on a question is found in those suttas the Exalted One pronounced in response to those who questioned him as the following passage illustrates When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the Exalted One What Lord is the lower shore What is the further shore What is sinking in the middle What is being thrown up on dry land What is seizure by humans by nonhumans and by a whirlpool What is inner putridity  
as the following passage illustrates Then the following line of thought arose in the mind of a certain bhikkhu It is said sir that material form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself mental formations are notself consciousness is nonself What self then do kammas done without a self affect
Then the Exalted One discerning with his mind this bhikkhus thought addressed the bhikkhus It is possible bhikkhus that a certain foolish man here confused immersed in ignorance and dominated by craving may imagine in his mind that he can overshoot the dispensation of the Master thus It is said sir that material form is non self etc
What do you think bhikkhus is material form permanent or impermanent  etc 
 The sequence of meaning dictated by inclination can be understood through those suttas the Exalted One pronounced after he had understood the inclinations of others
The sequence of meaning dictated by the natural structure of the teaching can be understood through those suttas in which the teaching progresses from its initial subject to its culmination by way of counterparts or by way of the opposites of the initial subject
For example in the ākaṅkheyya Sutta the teaching is set up at the beginning by way of virtue and culminates in the six kinds of direct knowledge
In the Vattha Suita  the teaching is set up by way of the defilements and culminates in the sublime abodes 
In the Kosambiya Sutta  the teaching is set up by way of schism and culminates in the principles of fraternal harmony
In the Simile of the Saw  the teaching is set up by way of impatience and culminates in the simile
And in this Brahmajāla Sutta the teaching is set up at the beginning by way of views and culminates in the elucidation of emptiness
Thus it is said This teaching has come down by way of a sequence of meaning dictated by the natural structure of the teaching 
Now in order to mark the boundaries the following teaching is undertaken
 The satisfaction of views  the pleasure of views  the feeling of views  on account of which those recluses and brahmins on four grounds joyously proclaim the self and the world to be eternal that is only the feeling of those who do not know and do not see the true nature of dhammas as it really is  it is only the feeling of those who are entirely immersed in craving And it is only the agitation and vacillation  it is only vacillation shaking and wavering caused by the agitation of craving and views
Like a stake planted in a heap of chaff it is not unshakable like the vision of a streamenterer
The same method applies to all the views
This teaching is undertaken in order to show the succession of conditions 
By this the Master shows that the satisfaction pleasure or feeling of views on account of which these recluses and brahmins joyously proclaim the self and the world to be eternal is a palpitation of craving and views a feeling conditioned by contact 
That they can experience that feeling without contact such a case is impossible This statement is made in order to show the strength of the condition for the feeling of views
Just as a prop is a strong condition for bolstering up a dilapidated house which would not be able to stand if it were not bolstered up by the prop in the same way contact is a strong condition for feeling and without contact there would be no feeling of views
All these recluses and brahmins experience these feelings only by repeated contacts through the six bases of contact In the present passage the Exalted One lumps together all the feelings of views
Why
In order to relate them once more to contact
How
By the statement All these recluses and brahmins experience these feelings only by repeated contacts through the six bases of contact
The six bases of contact are the eye as a base of contact the ear nose tongue body and mind as bases of contact
The word base occurs in the texts with four meanings place of origin  place of convergence  cause  and as a mere designation of place 
In the statement Kamboja is the base for horses the southern region the base for cows it signifies place of origin
The birds resort to that delightful basehere it signifies place of convergence
When there is a basis here it signifies cause
They lived in leafhuts in a forest basehere it is a mere designation of place
In the present case the first three meanings apply
For the pentad of contact originates in and converges upon the sense faculties and these latter are its cause thus they are called bases
Here the bases of contact etc are mentioned in order to show the succession of conditions making contact the starting point and arranging the teaching under the heading of contact in accordance with the method of the following passage Dependent on the eye and visible forms eyeconsciousness arises The meeting of the three is contact etc 
Although the statement by repeated contacts through the six bases of contact gives the impression that the six bases themselves exercise the function of contacting this would be a wrong interpretation
For it is not the bases that contact the object rather it is contact itself that contacts the various objects The bases are shown as incorporated within contact Therefore the meaning of the present passage should be understood thus All these recluses and brahmins experience the feeling of views by contacting objects such as visible forms etc by means of contact originating through the six bases of contact
With feeling as condition there arises in them craving Feeling is here the feeling originating through the six bases of contact
It is a condition for cravingdivided into craving for visible forms etc under the crest of decisive support condition
Thus it is said With feeling as condition there arises in them craving
Craving in turn is a condition for the four types of clinging under the crests of decisivesupport and conascence 
Clinging is a condition for existence in the same way
Existence is a condition for birth under the crest of decisivesupport
Birth here is the five aggregates together with their alterations  Birth is a condition for aging and death and for sorrow etc under the crest of decisivesupport
This is a brief explanation The detailed explanation can he found in the discussion of dependent origination in the Visuddhimagga 
But what is given here is sufficient
When he gives an exposition of the round the Exalted One sometimes discusses it under the heading of ignorance as when he says No first point of ignorance can be discerned bhikkhus before which there was no ignorance and after which it arose And though this is said bhikkhus nevertheless it can be discerned that ignorance has a specific condition  Sometimes he discusses it under the heading of craving No first point of craving for existence can be discerned bhikkhus etc nevertheless craving for existence has a specific condition  And sometimes he discusses it under the heading of the view of existence  No first point of the view of existence can be discerned bhikkhus etc nevertheless the view of existence has a specific condition  Here he discusses it under the heading of views
Having first explained the views that arise through lust for feeling he discusses dependent origination as rooted in feeling
In this way he shows These theorists holding these views roam and wander here and there back and forth through the three realms of existence the four modes of origin the five destinations the seven stations of consciousness and the nine abodes of beings Like an ox yoked to a millwheel like a dog chained to a post or like a ship tossed about in a storm they revolve in the round of suffering and are not even able to lift their heads up out of the round 
Having discussed the round in terms of the theorists the Exalted One now shows the ending of the round expressing it in terms of a bhikkhu devoted to meditation
The six bases of contact the same six bases of contact as those on account of which the theorists experiencing feelings by means of contact revolve in the round
The origin etc of the six bases of contact should be understood in accordance with the method stated in the meditation subject of feeling thus Through the origination of ignorance the eye originates etc
But while it was said above that feeling originates and ceases through the origination and cessation of contact here it should be noted that the eye and the other physical sense bases originate and cease through the origination and cessation of nutriment 
But the mindbase originates and ceases through the origination and cessation of mentalitymateriality 
He understands what transcends all these views the theorist knows only his view
but this bhikkhu understands these views and also what transcends these views namely virtue concentration wisdom and emancipation culminating in arahatship
Who understands this
The cankerfree arahat understands the non returner the oncereturner the streamenterer the bhikkhu who is a learned master of the scriptures and the bhikkhu who has aroused insight
But the teaching is concluded with its culmination in arahatship
Having discussed the ending of the round the Exalted One now expounds the above statement in order to show that there are no theorists free from the net of this teaching
Whenever they emerge  etc
This is meant Whether they sink downwards or rise upwards they sink and rise caught within the net of my teaching contained within the net of my teaching
 There are no theorists not included herein
The Exalted One is like the fisherman the teaching is like the net the tenthousandfold world system is like the small pool of water the theorists are like the sizable creatures
Just as the fisherman standing on the shore surveying the net sees all the sizable creatures trapped within his net so the Exalted One sees all the theorists caught within the net of this teaching The application of the simile of the fisherman is as follows 
Having shown that because their views are all included in these sixtytwo views all the theorists are included in the net of this teaching the Exalted One makes the above statement in order to show that he himself is not contained anywhere
The leash that bound it to existence  they lead by this  thus it is called a leash 
This is the name for a rope with which they drag an animal along after tying it around his neck
Here it is craving for existence that is intended by the word leash since such craving is similar to a leash
For craving for existence tied around the neck of the multitude leads and drags the multitude to one realm of existence or another
But for the Tathāgata the leash of existence has been cut off with the sword of the path of arahatship thus his body stands with the leash that bound it to existence cut 
The exhaustion of the lifefaculty when he has reached the state where there is no further rebirthlinkage 
Gods and men shall see him no more he will go to the indescribable state 
The application of the mango simile is as follows
The body of the Tathāgata is like the mango tree The craving that occurred in the past supported by that body is like the great stalk growing on the tree
Like the bunch of mangoes connected to the stalk numbering five twelve or eighteen fruits are the five aggregates twelve bases and eighteen elements connected with craving which would have been produced in the future if craving were to continue to exist
But just as when the stalk is cut all those mangoes follow along with and accompany the stalk and with the cutting off of the stalk are also cut off in the same way all those dhammasthe five aggregates twelve bases and eighteen elementsthat would have arisen in the future if the stalk of the leash of existence were not cut off all follow along with and accompany the leash of existence when the leash is cut they also are cut
When the tree is gradually withered and killed by contact with a poisonous maṇḍuka thorn no one sees the tree anymore but people say In this place such and such a tree stood  using the word tree as a mere expression  In the same way when the body of the Tathāgata brought into contact with the noble paths is gradually withered and broken up through the exhaustion of the moisture of craving with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the life faculty gods and men shall see the Tathāgata no more When people say This is the Dispensation of such and such a Master  will be a mere expression Thus the Exalted One concludes the teaching by bringing it to a climax with the nibbāna element without residue 
When the Exalted One had finished speaking this sutta the Elder nanda who had been attending to the entire sutta from the beginning thought The Exalted One elucidating the power of the Buddha has not given a title to the sutta he has just expounded Let me then ask him to give it a title  Thus he said to the Exalted One What venerable sir is the title of this exposition of the Dhamma 
The Master replied nanda you may remember this exposition of the dhamma as the Net of the Good as the Net of the Dhamma as the Supreme Net as the Net of Views You may remember it also as the Incomparable Victory in Battle This is the interpretation of the meaning nanda because the good pertaining to the present world and the good pertaining to the world beyond have been analyzed in this exposition of the Dhamma you should remember it as the Net of the Good  And because many threads of Dhamma have been discussed here you should remember it as the Net of the Dhamma  And because the knowledge of omniscience called Brahma in the sense of supreme  has been analyzed here you should remember it as the Supreme Net  And because the sixtytwo views have been analyzed here you should remember it as the Net of Views  And because after hearing this exposition one is able to crush Mārai e  the deity Māra the Māra of the aggregates the Māra of death and the Māra of the defilementstherefore you should remember it as the Incomparable Victory in Battle 
 Thus spoke the Exalted One By speaking this entire sutta from the end of the introduction up to the concluding words the Incomparable Victory in Battle  the Exalted One revealed his supremely deep knowledge of omniscience wherein the wisdom of others cannot find a footing and he dispelled the great darkness of speculative views just as the sun dispels the darkness of the night
And while this exposition was being spoken the tenthousandfold world system shook Tenthousandfold world system a world system numbering ten thousand worldspheres 
It should not be thought that the world system shook only at the conclusion of the sutta
For it is said while it was being spoken 
Therefore it should be understood that while these sixtytwo speculative views were being taught and unravelled it shook on sixtytwo occasions namely at the conclusion of the exposition of each of the sixtytwo views
Herein there are eight causes for an earthquake a disturbance of the elements the exercise of psychic power the conception of the bodhisattva the birth of the bodhisattva the attainment of enlightenment the setting in motion of the Wheel of the Dhamma the relinquishing of the remainder of the life span and the parinibbāna
But the great earth also shook on eight other occasions when the bodhisattva made his great renunciation when he approached the terrace of enlightenment when he took up dustheap rags when he washed them and on the occasions of teaching the Kālakārāma Sutta  the Gotamaka Sutta  the Vessantara Jātaka and the Brahmajāla Sutta
Herein on the occasions of the great renunciation and the approaching of the terrace of enlightenment the earth shook through the power of energy 
On the occasion of taking up dustheap rags the earth shook through being struck by the impact of wonder us if thinking The Exalted One has indeed done something extremely difficultabandoning dominion over the four great continents and their retinue of two thousand islands going forth into homelessness going to the charnel ground and taking up dustheap rags
On the occasions of washing the rags and the teaching of the Vessantara Jataka it shook through the shock of surprise
At the teaching of the Kālakārāma Sutta and of the Gotamaka Sutta it shook as a way of bearing witness as if saying I am a witness Lord 
But in the case of the Brahmajāla Sutta when the sixtytwo speculative views were taught disentangled and unravelled it shook as a sign of applause
It was not only on these occasions that the earth shook but also at the time of the three councils and on the day when the Elder Mahinda the Great after coming to this island of Sri Lanka taught the Dhamma while sitting in the Grove of Light
Further a Piṇḍapātika Elder at the Kalyāna Vihāra after sweeping the terrace around the shrine sal down there and filled with rapture by meditating on the Buddha started to recite this sutta at the conclusion of the recital the earth shook to its boundaries of water
Again cast of the Brazen Palace there is the Place of the Mango Shoot 
There the elders who were reciters of the Dīgha Nikāya sat down and started to recite the Brahmajāla Sutta At the conclusion of their recitation the earth shook to its boundaries of water
Therefore the wise should thoroughly master The meaning and text of this supreme sutta The net of Brahmā proclaimed by the SelfAwakened Which caused the earth to tremble many times
And when they have fully grasped the meaning Let them practice it with mind set straight
The commentary to the Brahmajāla Sutta is concluded
The praise spoken by the company of bhikkhus was that beginning It is wonderful and marvelous friends
This is the connection Those qualities that are clear to you bhikkhus are not the only qualities of the Buddha But there are bhikkhus other dhammas that are not clear  These he will now explain in detail
The elucidation of emptiness this teaching has the explication of emptiness as its principal theme for the following reasons With its refrain These standpoints thus assumed etc it reveals the emptiness of the mode in which these standpoints such as eternalism etc are assumed With its refrain yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend signifying that the nonmisapprehension of virtue is essential to liberation it reveals the absence of any permanent substance  In the passage Having understood as they really are the origin and passing away of feelings it is indicated that these vacillations of views arise in outside recluses and brahmins because they have not gotten rid of lust for feelings Now by showing the absence of any specificnatured experiencer behind the feelings and the absence of any specificnatured agent behind the delusion functioning as conditions for those feelings the teaching reveals the absence of a self and of any property of a self in all dhammas And with its refrain the Tathāgata is emancipated through nonclinging it points to the state of parinibbāna without clinging 
Some other meanings of the word dhamma are the truths  things endowed with a specific nature  concentration  wisdom  nature  merit  a disciplinary offence  the knowable  etc
In the passage It is through not understanding four dhammas bhikkhus  it means the truths in the passage wholesome dhammas unwholesome dhammas  things endowed with a specific nature in the passage Those Exalted Ones were of such dhammas  concentration in the passage truth dhamma fortitude and renunciation with these one does not sorrow in leaving this world  it means wisdom in the passage to beings of a dhamma to be born such a wish arises etc  it means nature in the passage Dhamma well practiced issues in happiness  it means merit in the passage four dhammas entailing defeat  it means a disciplinary offence and in the passage All dhammas in all their modes enter the threshold of the Exalted Ones portal of knowledge  it means the knowable
It takes a multiplicity of objects by this he shows that it accomplishes the functions of the numerous types of knowledge
For the knowledge of omniscience according to circumstances accomplishes the functions of the numerous types of knowledge divisible into many hundreds of thousands of kinds the unimpeded knowledge of the three times the knowledge encompassing the four modes of origin and the five destinations  the remainder among the six types of knowledge not held in common with others the knowledge illuminating the seven types of ariyan individuals the unwavering knowledge of the eight assemblies the knowledge fully understanding the nine abodes of beings the ten powers of knowledge etc It does this by taking us its own object the many dhammas that serve as object for these kinds of knowledge
Query If this is so how is it possible for a single limited type of knowledge to penetrate without omission the entire range of the knowable with its inconceivable immeasurable subdivisions Reply Who says the Buddhaknowledge is limited
Like the knowable itself the Buddhaknowledge is infinite
For it is said As far as that knowledge extends so far does the knowable extend
as far as the knowable extends so far does that knowledge extend 
It may be objected that if the knowable with its numerous subdivisions by way of class plane specific nature etc and by way of direction place time etc is apprehended in succession it is impossible to penetrate it in its totality without remainder But that is not so
Why
Because whatever it is that the Exalted One wishes to know whether in its entirely or in part
that he knows by direct experience through the unimpeded movement in that object And on the basis of the statement The knowledge of the Exalted Buddha is subject to his wish it cannot be denied that the Exalted Buddha who is always concentrated with an undistracted mind is able to know by direct experience whatever he wishes to know For the Buddhas knowledge at the time he is comprehending numerous dhammas does not occur in an undifferentiated mode like the cognition of those seeing a painting from a distance or the insight of those contemplating all dhammas as nonself This should be accepted For the spiritual power of the Buddhaknowledge is inconceivable
Hence it is said The objective domain of the Buddha is inconceivable 
This is the ruling With the abandoning of the entire obstruction of the knowable the Exalted One gained the unobstructed knowledge that occurs subject to his wish and is capable of comprehending all dhammas in all their modes By means of this knowledge the Exalted One was capable of penetrating all dhammas in continuous succession  therefore he was omniscient or allknowing in the way fire is called all consuming through its ability to burn all its fuel in continuous succession He was not however omniscient in the sense that he could comprehend all dhammas simultaneously
The diversity of planes is the distinction of the modalities and positions of dhammas 
The distinction of modality is the division of dhammas such as mindfulness etc into such categories as the foundations of mindfulness faculties powers enlightenment factors path factors etc
The distinction of position is their division into the sense sphere etc
Depending upon this they assume this  depending upon ignorance of specific conditionally So also depending upon the apprehension of the aspect of unity found in the succession of dhammas actually existing in the ultimate sense without applying to it the method of diversity  due to a failure to analyze the compact continuity into its component factors connected together by the relation of cause and effect
They assume this adhering to the assumption of eternalism they express their views Partialeternalism and the other views can also be explained by the same method making changes where appropriate 
This is said because they first think about the past with the initially formed thoughtconstructions of craving and views  then speculate about it when their thoughts gain force through repetition and diversified considerations and finally apprehend their views through the subsequently formed assumptions of craving and views through these as modes of adherence they adhere to these views and tenaciously cling to them
Or the thinking and apprehending can be understood by way of craving and clinging respectively
since craving is the condition for clinging 
By way of craving and views by way of the craving which is the decisive support for a wrong view and the conascent delight  and by way of the false assumption of one adhering to eternalism etc
The past portion of the aggregates since it is speculation having as its domain the dhammas that occurred in the past that is intended here the word pubba signifying past time is used and since there is no base for speculation apart from the aggregates of material form  the word anta signifying a portion is used
 Designational terms this signifies conceptual terms 
A designation is a concept as for example in calling servants one uses as an aid a mere word like Sirivaḍḍhaka
 Or else the prefix adhi signifies existing above  A designation is a word   for what exists above that is it is a derivative concept  conceived in reference to something above such as primary and derived matter etc Therefore conceptual theorems should be considered as terms signifying conceptual entities 
For things such as self and world are mere conceptual entities  not ultimate realities like material form feeling etc
Views are called adhivutti because of their excessive character 
For views superimpose upon the specificnatured dhammas a superfluous unreal meaning such as eternity nature substantiality soul and body etc
This refers to five kinds of personality view  that is he regards material form feeling perception mental formations or consciousness as the self
The remaining fifteen kinds of personality view beginning with the view of the self as possessing material form etc are obtained as follows In each case he apprehends four aggregates to be the self and proclaims the fifth to be the world
Again apprehending one aggregate to be the self he proclaims the remaining four to be the world ie the field for the selfs enjoyment Or he apprehends the aggregates included in his own continuum to be the self and proclaims anything other than that to be the world 
The jhānas are mentioned here because the dhammas constituting the jhanas enter the jhanaattainers threshold of awareness with particular distinctness The remaining dhammas are comprised under that heading
He denies that they produce anything
for if they had a productive capacity they would exist in dependence on conditions like material form etc and like happiness etc and therefore would have an origin But if they had an origin they would inevitably also have a cessation and there would he no room for their permanence
By the expression steadfast as a mountain peak the absence of impermanence is maintained by the expression firm as a pillar the absence of mutation
Something already existing  by showing the existence of the effect in the cause he indicates the doctrine of emergent manifestation 
It emerges it comes to full manifestation 
How can something already existing in the mode of potentiality previously unmanifest afterwards come to full manifestation in the mode of manifestation
 As a jar concealed by darkness becomes manifest by means of light
This must be examined What does the light actually do to reveal the jar If it is said that it reveals the jar by producing a cognition that has the jar as its object the doctrine of emergent manifestation would be invalidated for this assertion implies the arising of a previously unarisen cognition
If next it is held that it reveals the jar by dispelling the darkness that obstructs the cognition of the jar  the doctrine of emergent manifestation is again invalidated
For if the cognition of the jar exists how can the darkness obstruct it Just as it is not correct to hold to the manifestation of the jar so too it is not correct to hold to the manifestation of the self postulated by our theorist
Then too if the arising of a hitherto unarisen cognition occurs through the concurrence of the sensefaculty senseobject etc the doctrine of emergent manifestation is invalidated by the very term arising for that term exceeds the bounds of the mere manifestation and signifies the actual arising of an unarisen cognition
So once again the doctrine of eternalism is invalidated for the very same reason
They are reckoned thus because of its permanence there can be according to the eternalist no real passing away or rearising of the self  and because of its omnipresence  it cannot really roam and wander They are reckoned thus by a distinction in the modes of occurrence of mere attributes The purport is that they are conventionally designated thus
The commentator thereby shows the doctrine of change  according to which the mere attributes of the attributehearer i c  of an enduring self arise and perish  
This view will be examined below
By the use of the word roaming which implies the fact of impermanence he undermines the eternalist doctrine he himself previously proposed 
Gives his reason the theorist gives the reason for his assertion to those before whom he proclaims the self and the world to be eternal
He has not proven the reality of his own view even to himself through direct experience But by means of a fact directly experienced by himself  he tries to prove a fact that he has not directly experienced 
and he communicates it to others as if it were ascertained by himself not as unascertained
This is his argument Throughout the course of these many hundreds of thousands of births this my self and the world have remained one and the same as proven by the fact of recollection
For the one who recollects an experience is the same as the one who originally experienced it not someone else
It is not possible for one person to recollect something experienced by a different person e g  Dhammarakkhita cannot recollect what was experienced by Buddharakkhita
And as it is with these existences  so it is with earlier ones too
Therefore my self and the world are eternal
And as it is with me so it is with other beings for them too the self and the world are eternal
Thus leaping into the jungle of views by way of eternalism the theorist establishes others in his view as well According to the statements in the text they assert various conceptual theorems and
he speaks thus the argument is intended
Causes are of three kinds
Cause of obtainment  e g  the noble path is the cause for the obtainmcnt of nibbāna Cause of generation  e g  the seed is the cause for the generation of the sprout Cause of communication  e g  the conditioned arising of things etc is the cause for communicating the truth of impermanence etc Here  the cause of communication alone is intended
For that which communicates is the cause for the knowledge which has the meaning to be communicated for its domain
Reasoning is discursive thought characterized by striking or discrimination serving as a basis for views
Investigation is examination According to its denotation it is an act of consciousness accompanied by greed functioning as a counterfeit of wisdom  or it is unwise reflection  that is a wrong adherence  or it is the antecedent phase of the vacillation of views
He reasons If things were impermanent it would follow that one individual acts and another experiences the results Such being the case there would be the destruction of kamma performed and the encounter with results of kamma that was not performed
But if things are permanent then the one who acts and the one who experiences the results are the same and one does not commit any errors Here the commentator shows the way the rationalist searches for a proof for his eternalist view
As a result of mere reasoning alone by pure reason without the aid of scripture or spiritual achievement and apart from hearsay etc
Query The eternalists who gain spiritual distinction identify the self and the world with their own mental continua and what has transpired therein through the experience of several hundred thousand past births ten aeons or forty aeons which they can recollect by means of this achievement Now isnt it true that they become adherents of eternalism by drawing inferences  That is they infer that the continuum which had evolved thus far back existed in retrogressively carlier births and also that the same state of affairs holds with regard to all beings  If so shouldnt all the eternalists be classified as rationalists since like those who reason from hearsay etc these form their views by reasoning based upon a ground experienced by themselves And surely the aforementioned kinds of reasoning must be admitted as valid Otherwise the eternalist who gains spiritual distinction would have to be classified with partialeternalist or with the fortuitous originationist 
Reply The matter should not be seen in this way For the recollection of the aggregatecontinuum over a long period of timewhether minimum medium or maximumin the case of those who gain spiritual distinction is a special cause for the assumption of eternalism not held in common with the others
Thus when it was said I recollect my numerous past lives 
For this reason I know this  his recollection itself is shown as the principal cause
The reasoning that occurs is not the principal cause here for it is subordinate to and dependent upon the recollection of past lives
Query If so doesnt it follow that the hearsay etc is the principal cause 
Reply No For these latter their reasoning is the principal cause since they lack realization And both in the Buddhas Dispensation and in worldly discourse a descriptive term is phrased with reference to the principal cause as in the terms eyeconsciousness and corn sprout 
Or else the achievement of spiritual distinction is stated as a separate cause for the assumption of eternalism in order to show reasoning that is not grounded in spiritual achievement as a distinct cause for the eternalist view
Query are these four grounds the theorists reason for his own adherence to eternalism or for establishing others in his view
If they are the reasons for his own adherence why are only recollection of past lives and reasoning mentioned and not the inversion of perception  etc
For an inverted perception unwise reflection the company of bad people and listening to false doctrine are also grounds for the origination of wrong views
And if they are the means for establishing others in his view scripture should be mentioned along with spiritual achievement and rational proof for like them it also is a means for establishing others In either case it is going too far to say outside of these there is none 
Reply That is not so
Why
Firstly in regard to his own adherence to eternalism the theorist adheres to the aggregates as an eternal self and world through the aforementioned recollection and reasoning only after he has kept company with bad people listened to false doctrine emerged from unwise reflection acquired thereby a perverted perception overshot the bounds of rational proof by not comprehending the momentary dissolution of the aggregates and wrongly applied the method of unity
Recollection of past lives and reasoning are alone mentioned here because they are the proximate and principal causes for eternalism and because when they are mentioned the other conditions are implicitly included along with them
Then in regard to the establishment of others scripture is grouped under rational proof which is alone shown in order to take a particular case of the use of reason ie by outsiders who have no recognized scriptures Thus recollection and reasoning are alone mentioned as the grounds for these views
Moreover there are two kinds of characteristics pertaining to ultimately real dhammas  the characteristic of the specific nature  and the general characteristic 
The comprehension of the characteristic of the specific nature is direct experiential knowledge  the comprehension of the general characteristic is inferential knowledge  Scripture as the means for acquiring wisdom born of learning  issues only in inferential knowledge But by considering the things learned one becomes established in reflective acquiescence gives rise to the wisdom born of reflection  and by meditative development gradually achieves direct experiential knowledge
Thus scripture does not transcend the sphere of reasoning and so is implied by the reference to reasoning through hearsay in the commentary Therefore it is correct to say Outside of these there is none
On the basis of the statements they assert various conceptual theorems and they proclaim the self and the world to be eternal  the intention here is that these are grounds for establishing others in his view
Lead to such a future destination this may also be interpreted they go thus i e  they are concluded thus
They are broken up destroyed and consummated by the following crossexamination This is meant these standpoints called views are assumed and misapprehended by the superimposition of eternal existence upon a self which is nonexistent in the ultimate sense They are the mere prattle of fools which continue only so long as the wise do not crossexamine them
But when they are crossexamined by the wise lacking any durable ground and unable to stand up under pressure they break up perish and disappear like drops of dew or the light of a glowworm with the rising of the sun
Now follows a brief examination of eternalism If the self or the world postulated by the opponent were eternal it would be impossible to take them as the basis for attaining any state of spiritual distinction For on account of their immutability they would always retain their original form  and then any instruction the eternalist may give for the purpose of turning away from evil and practicing virtue would be useless For if they cannot undergo alteration how could such instruction be effective And for such a self meritorious actions such as giving etc and harmful actions such as injuring etc would no more be possible than for empty space
So too it is not tenable for the eternalist to hold that the self is determined to experience pleasure and pain for such a self cannot be bound by kamma And because it is impossible for an eternal self to undergo birth etc what need does it have for liberation If the opponent asserts Expressions such as action etc do pertain to the self insofar as its mere attributes arise and perish we reply that it is impossible to ascribe mere attributes to an enduring self that always retains its original form Those attributes of the self that constitute its modes must be either different from the self or identical with it
If they are different  it must be admitted that those attributes through which the self acts experiences  passes away and rearises make no difference to the self 
Therefore this alternative leads to the same position as that discussed above It is saddled with the same error
and moreover makes even the postulation of attributes purposeless On the other hand if the self and its attributes are identical  then when the modes are subject to arising and destruction the self which is identical with them must likewise be subject to arising and destruction And in such a case how could one maintain that it is permanent If one holds that the attributes as well as the self are permanent bondage and emancipation would be impossible Thus eternalism is not tenable
There is no eternalist capable of giving a perfectly sound proof of the eternal existence of things And a doctrine that cannot he proven is not satisfying to the minds of the wise
Thus it was said above They continue only so long as the wise do not crossexamine them 
The knowledge of omniscience is mentioned because that is the subject under analysis here But when the omniscient knowledge is mentioned its foundationthe knowledge of the destruction of the cankers and all the Buddhas ten powers of knowledge etc which are inseparable from it are also implied
This is meant The Tathāgata does not even adhere to those essential states of distinction the qualities such as virtue etc which transcend speculative views much less to the bail of the round 
I understand this here I indicates misapprehension by way of views and conceit
while etc implies misapprehension by way of craving as mine
A misapprehension is an apprehension of dhammas in a mode contrary to actuality overshooting their true nature
For there is nothing in the aggregates which can be held to as I or mine
Those very feelings Among the numerous discourses of the Buddha
dealing with the Four Noble Truths in terms of the aggregates sense bases etc this in order to show that the theorists leap into the jungle of views on account of their wrong practice in regard to feelings thus feeling alone is brought forth in order to show the ground for full understanding 
The meditation subject referred to is the meditation subject of the four truths
Having understood as they really are having known i e  having penetrated the origin of feelings etc with insightwisdom by way of the penetration of the object  and with pathwisdom by way of the penetration of nondelusion  
In the sense of their conditioned origination their origination because they have not been extirpated by the noble path and through the arising of their conditions such us ignorance etc as described in the standard formula This being that exists through the arising of this that arises
The characteristic of production is the characteristic of arising  that is their genesis 
In the sense of their conditioned cessation the meaning should be understood as the reverse of the method stated for origination
The satisfaction a previous feelings capacity to serve as an objectcondition for subsequent pleasure and joy or the pleasure and joy themselves
This is the meaning in brief when joy has arisen taking as object a previously arisen feeling the previous feelings quality of giving satisfaction by serving as a condition and joys quality of finding satisfactionthis is the satisfaction in the previously arisen feeling
The unsatisfactoriness by the term impermanent he states the unsatisfactoriness in equanimous feeling  or in all feelings by way of the suffering inherent in formations By the other two terms he shows the unsatisfactoriness in painful and pleasant feeling respectively by way of the other two types of suffering Or all three terms can he applied to all feelings without distinction
This is the unsatisfactoriness in feelings their impermanence in the sense of their nonexistence after having been their subjection to suffering in the sense of their oppression by rise and fall and their twofold changeablaness through aging and death
The escape from feeling as long as one does not abandon the desire and lust bound up with feeling one is attached to feeling but when one abandons desire and lust then one is released and detached from feeling
And here when feeling is mentioned the material and immaterial dhammas that are conascent support and object conditions for feeling are also included Thus all the five aggregates of clinging are included
The five clingingaggregates included by the mentioning of feelings make up the truth of suffering  The ignorance etc included by mentioning the origin of feelings make up the truth of the origin  The terms passing away and escape imply the truth of cessation  And the understanding of feelings as they really are implies the truth of the path  Thus the Four Noble Truths can be found in this passage 
Devoid of clinging through the disappearance of desireandlust this is said because clinging to sense pleasures is the root of the other types of clinging and because when clinging to sense pleasures is abandoned the other types of clinging come to an end
 is emancipated through nonclinging the Exalted One shows his own attainment of the paths and fruits
By this entire passage on feelings the King of the Dhamma shows the ground for the origination of his knowledge of omniscience together with its preliminary practice for that is the element of Dhamma the full penetration of which enabled him to analyze in detail these speculative views together with their grounds and destinations
Partialeternalism is the doctrine that something among beings and formations is eternal
The first three doctrines are analyzed in terms of beings the fourth in terms of formations
When the expression partialeternalists in regard to formations is used this is intended to show the dhammas assumed to be eternal in accordance with their true nature not to show them in the way they are conceived by the partialeternalist himself
For in his theory the things conceived to be eternal are regarded as unconditioned 
Hence he says That which is called mind  is a permanent stable self
For it is impossible for anyone in his right mind to maintain that some entity he admits to be produced by conditions is permanent and stable
Hence the doctrine of the sevenfold predicable which maintains that entities possessing rise fall and stability may be permanent  may be impermanent  or may be unclassifiable can be demonstrated to be untenable
The demonstration follows If one should say That nature in terms of which a thing is said to be is the very same nature in terms of which it is said not to be  etcthis may be the doctrine of relativism
and again it may not be the doctrine of relativism
It is not fitting to mention here the relation to a different place etc for everyone acknowledges this and hence there is no dispute concerning it 
Some however say When an ornament is made out of a golden jar the state of a jar is destroyed and the state of an ornament arises but the state of gold remains So for all entities one attribute is destroyed another attribute arises but the intrinsic nature remains
They should be refuted thus What is the gold that remains the same in both the jar and the ornament If it is said to be materiality etc then it is impermanent like sound
If it is said to be an aggregation of materiality etc an aggregation is a mere conventional term
to which neither existence nor nonexistence nor permanence apply Thus no doctrine of relativism can obtain here
The error in affirming either the difference or identity of the attributes and attributebearer has already been dealt with in the examination of eternalism
therefore it should be understood by the method explained above
Furthermore it cannot be maintained that the self and the world are existent in the ultimate sense but possess a nature that may be permanent impermanent or unclassifiable depending on the point of view as in the example of lamps etc
For lamps etc are subject by their nature to rise and fall and hence no intrinsic nature that may he permanent impermanent or unclassifiable can be discerned in them  And so too no such nature can be discerned for a soul  Thus the sevenfold scheme of predication as well as any other divisioned scheme of predication is impossible In this way the doctrine of the sevenfold predicable is shown to be untenable
Partialeternalists in regard to beings are for example the theists  who maintain that God is permanent and other beings impermanent
Partialeternalists in regard to formations are for example the followers of Kaṇāda who maintain that the atoms are permanent and stable the molecules etc impermanent
Query Isnt it true that in the doctrine that some dhammas are eternal some noneternal the conviction that the eye etc are noneternal is a comprehension of things according to their true nature  If so then why is it a wrong view Reply Who says the conviction that the eye etc are noneternal is a wrong view
The wrong view is the adherence to some of the noneternal things as eternal
And since they maintain a wrong view in one section of their doctrine their comprehension that the eye etc are noneternal is vitiated by the admixture with wrong view just as cream of ghee is vitiated by the admixture with poison It cannot be classified under right view because it is incapable of performing the proper function of right view
Moreover it is impossible to deny that their comprehension is a wrong view for though the eye etc are recognized to be noneternal the theorists still attribute to them the nature of a soul when they say The eye  the body that self is impermanentetc
When this point is made clear there is no room for the criticism that the doctrine of analysis in maintaining a distinction between the unconditioned and conditioned elements becomes a form of partial eternalism which holds Some dhammas are eternal some non eternal For the doctrine of analysis accords with the unperverted true nature of dhammas 
In the higher Brahmaworlds in the finematerial Brahmaworlds such as the Parittasubha plane
The destruction of the aeon by fire is intended here since this occurs most frequently
The word or signifies the alternative or in world systems other than those that are contracting
For it is inconceivable that all beings in the planes of misery will then rearise in the finematerial or immaterial spheres since it is impossible for those with the longest life spans in the planes of misery to be reborn in the human world
Although for all beings rebirth occurs through the kammically formative states of consciousness the beings of the fine material sphere are called mindmade because they are reborn through mind alone without external conditions
Such being the case one might ask shouldnt the state of being mindmade also apply to beings of spontaneous origin in the sensesphere existence
No it should not For the expression mindmade applies only to beings reborn through the distinguished type of mind pertaining to the higher consciousness Showing this the commentator says because they have been reborn through the jhānamind 
Does the state of being mindmade also apply to beings in the immaterial sphere
No for it is unnecessary to emphasize that they have been reborn through mind alone since there is not even a suspicion that they could be reborn there through external conditions
And in common usage the expression mindmade is applied to beings of the finematerial sphere
Thus the teachers of the Vedas speak about a fivefold self a self made of food made of breath made of mind made of bliss made of consciousness  
How is it that beings living in the superior plane of the second jhāna rearise in the inferior plane of the first jhāna  In order to explain how the commentator says
Due to the length of the life span of that world due to the limited length of the maximum life span
Query But what is this maximum life span  And how is it of a limited length 
Reply The life span is the specific duration of the succession of resultant aggregates of the various beings in each particular realm of existence Like their distinctive bodies organs colors shapes sizes etc it is generally of fixed limits for the different destinations orders of beings etc it is determined by the decisive support of a previously formed longing for existence and is fortified by present conditions such as semen blood temperature and food etc in the case of mammals temperature and food etc in the case of sense sphere deities and temperature etc in the case of beings of the finematerial sphere The material and immaterial lifefaculties which support the momentarily enduring material and immaterial dhammas respectively conascent with themselves maintain them not only by causing their momentary duration but also by causing the nondisruption of the continuous succession until the bhavaṅga is cut off  Therefore because the specific duration of life is rooted in the lifeforce  by a metaphorical use of the causes name for its fruit it is itself called the life span 
For gods and denizens of hell the life span is generally of fixed limits for human beings living in Uttarakuru it is exclusively of fixed limits  For animals ghosts and the remainder of humankind the life span is without fixed limits since at a time when kamma conducive to longevity is prevalent it may be longer or shorter depending upon such conditions as the continuum connected with the kamma the semen and blood is produced and upon certain conditions rooted in the kamma such as the evenness or unevenness of the revolutions of the sun and moon etc and the evenness or unevenness of the temperature and nutriment from which it is produced etc Just as the distinctive color shape etc of the beings in the different destinations orders of beings etc is determined by way of a previously formed longing for existence as well as by the completion of their apprehension from the beginning as a result of seeing hearsay etc
so too the limitation of the life span the specific duration of which is generally the same for the beings reborn in the same plane of rebirthis determined from the beginning by way of the effected longing for existence which is formed as a result of seeing hearsay etc and adheres as supreme
Although kamma is capable of producing in the various planes of rebirth the specific colors etc that are fixed for the beings in each plane as well as deviations from the norm it cannot produce resultants exceeding the limits of the life span in planes of rebirth where the life span is of fixed limits Therefore it is said they pass away because of the limited length of the life span
Dissatisfaction is the mental distress over the lack or loss of a loved object It denotes an act of consciousness accompanied by grief 
Agitation here signifies the craving and views based on his discontent which arise in him as he enjoys the delight of the jhanas over a long period of lime and become the causes for the assumptions of mine and I
When in drawing out the meanings the passage Oh that other beings might come to this place was cited to illustrate the agitation through craving this was done to elicit from the statement the agitation of craving alone since a separate citation was given for the agitation of views It should not be taken to mean that the agitation of views is absent on such an occasion 
 fear is the knowledge of fearfulness arisen as the fear of all formations in one practicing contemplation of dissolution 
A sense of spiritual urgency is knowledge together with moral dread or just moral dread 
Terror is knowledge terrified of all formations resulting from the contemplation of danger and the contemplation of disenchantment 
Although this Brahma had acquired the knowledge of the ownership of kamma in previous births due to the instability of a worldlings views he discarded it Induced by his creation of beings through a mere act of consciousness exercising the psychic power of transformation he deceived himself and leaping upon the  doctrine of the creative play of God  thinking I am the Lord the Maker and Creator he became established in it as his conviction But this statement does not yet serve to establish others  since it is said  thinks to himself  In order to show that this conviction was formulated also as a means of establishing others in his view it is said after claiming and desiring to substantiate this with a reason
Query Isnt it true that immediately after they are reborn gods possess the reviewing knowledge Having passed away from such a destination we have rearisen here as a result of such and such kamma
Reply This is true in the case of those whose dispositions in previous births were perfectly grounded in the knowledge of the ownership of kamma
But these beings adhered to the view of the creative play of God in previous births as well
Therefore they thought We have been created by him
By a mind corrupted through an envious nature
Or the meaning can be understood as mental corruption ie the corruption of the mind by jealousy is the cause of their destruction thus they are corrupted by mind
If one remains unangered the anger of the other not getting any fuel will arise for only one turn and then subside It will become extinguished like fire immersed in water and cannot cause his death But if both get angry the anger of each will grow stronger and stronger intensifying the anger of the other and become fierce in its attacks capable of consuming the support  Then their anger will burn up the heartbase and destroy their extremely delicate material body Subsequently the entire individual form will disappear
The natural law
the purport is that their passing away from that plane is due to the delicacy of their material bodies and the strength of their arisen anger as well as to the specific nature of their material and immaterial dhammas
He sees the breakup of the eye etc due to the grossness of the breakup of material dhammas he sees their destruction when he sees them undergo alteration in the encounter with contrary conditions and finally disappear from sight 
Conditions the arising becomes a condition by proximity condition etc
 is more pronounced this is said because the breakup of consciousness is quicker
For in the time a single material dhamma endures sixteen acts of consciousness break up
He does not see the breakup of consciousness although consciousness is breaking up moment after moment each act of consciousness in breaking up becomes the proximity condition for the following act of consciousness Because each succeeding act of consciousness arises concealing as it were the absence of its predecessor the aspect of presence alone is strong and clear not the aspect of absence  Thus he does not see the destruction of consciousness This matter becomes very clear by the example of the firedisc 
Because the rationalistic partialexternalist is still more remote from understanding and applying the method of diversity and wrongly applies the method of unity he arrives at the conviction This very consciousness which always occurs with a single nature is a permanent self
The finitude or infinity of what
Of the self  which is here called the world because it is looked upon by theorists desiring to escape from saṃsāra or because merit demerit and their results are looked for there by those theorists
Thus the Exalted One has said They proclaim the world to be finite or infinite
But what is that self
It is the sign of the kasiṇa functioning as the objective domain of jhāna
For it is this that the theorist perceives as the world
Thus it is said below Having apprehended that as the world
But some say that the jhāna itself together with its concomitant dhammas is apprehended as the self or the world
Query It is proper to describe the first three doctrines as forms of extensionism since these refer to the finitude infinity and finitude and infinity  respectively But how can the last doctrine be described as a form of extensionism when it repudiates both terms 
Reply precisely because it repudiates both terms
For the doctrine that repudiates the finitude and infinity of the world since it refers to that matter has the worlds finitude and infinity as its objective domain
Referring to this it is said in the commentary occurring with reference to
Or else just as in the case of the third doctrine both the finitude and infinity of one and the same world are included by way of a distinction in spatial direction  in the same way the rationalist doctrine includes both by wav of a distinction in time speaking of them in terms of their mutual incompatibility
Infinity is implied by the repudiation of finitude and finitude by the repudiation of infinity The inclusion of finitude and infinity here however is not identical with that of the third doctrine for in the present case a distinction in time is intended 
This is meant Since through hearsay he has heard that the great seers who achieved spiritual distinction sometimes witnessed the selfhere labelled the worldto be infinite the rationalist concludes that it is not finite
And since he has heard that those same seers sometimes witnessed the self to be finite he concludes that it is not infinite
What is said here concerning the rationalists who reason from hearsay can also be applied with due alterations to those who reason from memory of past births and the other types of rationalist
After extending the previously unextended counterpart sign the rationalist does not directly experience  either before or during the extension of the sign Therefore referring to the time when the sign is extended he takes his stand upon mere hearsay etc and rejects  objecting it is not finite
And referring to the time when the sign is unextended he rejects  objecting it is not infinite This position does not assert the complete absence of finitude and infinity but should be taken rather like the term neither perception nor nonperception  
His own rejection of the first three doctrines is based on the discrepancy of characteristics pertaining to each case Surely this must be understood in such a way Otherwise the fourth doctrine would have to be classified under the category of equivocation
For there is no conception of the self altogether divorced from finitude infinity or the conjunction of both and the rationalist is one who searches for a rational proof and there is nothing untenable in attributing both terms to one and the same world by way of a distinction in time
But some explain the fourth doctrine to originate through the following process of reasoning If the self were finite its rebirth in distant places could not be recollected
And if it were infinite one living in this world would be able to experience the happiness of the heavenly worlds and the suffering in the hells etc
If one holds it to be both finite and infinite one would incur the errors of both the previous positions
Therefore the self cannot he declared to he either finite or infinite 
Query It is proper to describe the doctrines of the last two theorists as forms of extensionism for these doctrines have both the finitude and infinity of the world as their objective domain
But how can the first two views be separately described as forms of extensionism 
Reply By a figurative application 
For the word extensionist which occurs in reference to the last two theorists by way of the total of their views also applies by linguistic convention to the first two theorists individually  just as the term method of the eight liberations applies individually to each immaterial jhāna or as the term abode of beings applies to the world
Or else the expression was given to them by way of its applicability to the times prior to their adherence
For these theorists at a time prior to their achievement of such mental concentration were finite infinitizers insofar as their reasoning was suspended in between both positions  Is the world finite or is it infinite But even after they make a definite assumption through their gain of distinction the older expression is still applied to them
As a consequence of what was previously seen that is by recollecting the finite  etc which was previously experienced by consciousness here called seeing
Having made this clear the rationalists who reason from hearsay and the pure rationalists are included by implication
Or else by mentioning the seen the heard should be understood as implied
Since these four doctrines occur as the misapprehension an everexistent self claimed to be finite etc they are included in eternalism
The equivocators do not have sufficient intelligence even to know the difference between the natures of unwholesome states and states superior to the human level They do not understand the terms wholesome and unwholesome by way of the wholesome and unwholesome courses of kamma
 the first method serves to illustrate endless equivocation as indefinite equivocating the second to illustrate the similarity of the equivocation to the wriggling of an eel
The pair desire and lust are alone said to be clinging according to the Abhidhamma method
For in the Abhidhamma only craving and views are set down as clinging But in the suttas hatred is also sometimes called clinging
Although the first three equivocators are dull insofar as they do not comprehend the nature of wholesome and unwholesome dhammas they at least distinctly comprehend the fact that they do not comprehend these dhammas But the fourth lacks even this much intelligence and is thus said to be dull and stupid 
Query But isnt it true on the basis of his equivocal statement that he does comprehend his own noncomprehension of these dhammas
Reply Although he does unlike the first three he does not have fear and loathing of making false statements etc in declaring things he has not fully understood Therefore he is extremely deluded
Or else the fact that he does not comprehend his own noncomprehension of those dhammas is shown by the way he sets up the question If you should ask me whether there is another world  etc in order to equivocate over the reply But I do not take it thus etc Thus he alone is distinguished as dull and stupid
Hence Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta was called the dullest and stupidest of all these recluses and brahmins 
Among the questions the question Is there a world beyond is asked from the standpoint of eternalism or from the standpoint of right view
the question Is it there no world beyond from the nihilist standpoint or from the standpoint of right view
the question Is it that there both is and is not a world beyond from the standpoint of annihilationism or of right view
since no alternative mode is possible when the first three modes have been rejected the question Is it that there neither is nor is not a world beyond  is asked from the standpoint of right view when it means that the world beyond is indescribable in terms of existence or nonexistence or out of a preference for equivocation
The remaining three tetrads should be understood in conformity with the method stated
For just as the triad of kammaformations concerned with merit is included by the triad of kammaformalions through body speech and mind so the meaning of the latter three tetrads is included by the first
These three have the same significance by way of the misapprehension of a self and a criticism of the fruitfulness of merit etc
Since the endless equivocator does not approve of the eternalist view of the self  he practices equivocation by saying I do not take it thus  etc
These statements of his equivocate by repudiating each point on which he is questioned
Query Isnt it true that insofar as he takes a stand on the side of equivocation he makes a positive affirmation of the equivocal position
Reply No because he is utterly deluded about that as well and because the doctrine of equivocation occurs only by way of rejection
For example when Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta was asked by King Ajātasattu about an immediately visible fruit of recluseship he equivocated by repudiating the triad of views on the world beyond etc
Query All the endless equivocators resort to mere equivocation when questioned on this or that point because they do not comprehend as they really are the wholesome dhammas etc and the triad on the world beyond etc If so how can they be characterized as theorists
Like someone who does not desire to speak he cannot be properly called a theorist merely because he resorts to equivocation when he does not understand the matter he is questioned about
Reply He is not called a theorist merely because he resorts to equivocation when asked a question but because he holds a wrong conviction
For this person actually holds the wrong conviction of eternalism but due to his dull intelligence he cannot comprehend wholesome dhammas as they really are etc or the triad of views on the world beyond etc So because he is afraid of making a false statement and because he cannot convince others of a matter he has not understood himself he resorts to equivocation
Thus the commentator will afterwards classify him with the eternalists Another explanation is possible The doctrine of endless equivocation can be considered as a single distinct view like the Jain doctrine of the sevenfold predicable It arises when one who does not comprehend or believe in merit and evil and their respective results resorts to equivocation in response to a question having these matters as its domain Acquiescing in and approving of such equivocation as good he adheres to it
Hence the commentator says The view and speech of this theorist are without limits
But how does his view come to be included under eternalism
Because he does not hold the conviction of annihilationism
Besides there is to he found in his view a fragment of eternalism  Considering the multitude of disputations in the world there is no one who has understood things as they really are Yet since beginningless time there has been reflection upon teachings leading to such exclamations as This is the way it is  
The heading of the teaching perception is mentioned as the principal factor in the teaching For the Exalted One delivered this teaching making perception alone the burden but he did not intend to suggest that the other immaterial dhammas exist there
Hence he says Because they arise without mind
For when the Exalted One teaches supramundane dhammas he makes concentration or wisdom the burden and when he teaches mundane dhammas he makes mind or perception the burden
This is illustrated by the following citations On the supramundane On the occasion when one develops the supramundane jhana  right concentration endowed with five factors  right concentration endowed with five kinds of knowledge  and having seen with wisdom his cankers are eliminated  etc On the mundane On the occasion when a wholesome state of consciousness pertaining to the sense sphere has arisen  What were you conscious of bhikkhu   mind is the forerunner of dhammas there are bhikkhus beings diverse in body and diverse in perception and the base of neither perception nor nonperception 
A sectarian order in a creed of the sectarians outside the Buddhas Dispensation
For the sectarians perceiving emancipation a distinguished form of rebirth or seeing the danger in perception and the benefits in its fading away develop the nonpercipient meditative attainment and take rebirth in an inopportune plane of existence  But not those belonging to the Buddhas Dispensation
He practices the preliminary work of meditation on the wind kasina having attained the first three jhānas on the wind kasina having achieved mastery over the third jhāna he emerges from it and practices the preliminary work for the attainment of the fourth jhāna
Query Why is the preliminary work on the wind kasiṇa alone mentioned
Reply Just as the particular immaterial meditative attainment called the development of the fading away of the material is realized by the elimination of materiality in the particular kasiṇas which serve as the counterparts of materiality in the same way the particular material attainment called the development of the fading away of the immaterial is attained by the elimination of the immaterial factors in the particular kasiṇa which because it lacks a distinct shape serves as the counterpart of the immaterial Herein the determination upon the material attainment is formed by seeing the danger in the occurrence of the immaterial through the contemplation Perception is a sickness perception is a boil etc or Away with consciousness consciousness is despicable  etc and by holding the conviction that the peaceful and sublime state is to be found in the absence of the immaterial The development of the fading away of the material is the immaterial attainments together with their access in particular the first immaterial jhāna
Query If so shouldnt the limited space kasiṇa also be mentioned
For this too is a counterpart of the immaterial
Reply This is actually accepted by some but because it was not included by the ancient teachers it is not stated here
However there is nothing wrong if it is said that the fading away of the immaterial can be accomplished in virtue of the fact that certain dhammas can be made to fade away and that it becomes manifest in any particular domain serving as the counterpart of those dhammas But because this is the practice the sectarians themselves must undertake for this attainment and because they practice this jhāna which is closely connected with the objective domain  the keenvisioned teachers of old have mentioned only the preliminary work on the wind kasiṇa as the practice for the development of the fading away of the immaterial
Moreover it is common knowledge that the jhāna on the first three element kasiṇas  like that on the color kasiṇas takes as its conceptual object the afterimage of a color
therefore the Visuddhimagga describes the earthkasiṇa by the similes of the minor and the disc of the moon But the kasiṇa of the fourth element enters the range of the jhāna only as the afterimage of the element Thus it is proper to call it the counterpart of the immaterial and to mention the preliminary work on the wind kasiṇa alone
Query If as the commentary says the mere aggregate of material form becomes manifest in the nonpercipient realm how can materiality occur there without dependence on the immaterial factors Reply This is no objection and it is not applicable to other cases how the immaterial factors in the immaterial realm can occur without dependence on materiality This state of affairs belongs to the same category
Why
Because it is never seen here
Along the same lines no materiality should occur in the finematerial realm without edible nutriment For what reason
Because it is never seen here
Furthermore the mental continuum that has for its generative cause the nondisappearance of craving for materiality because it originates together with materiality occurs in dependence on the latter The mental continuum that has for its generative cause the disappearance of craving for materiality because of its indifference to materiality occurs without the latter Similarly the succession of material dhammas that has for its generative cause the disappearance of craving for the immaterial occurs without the immaterial dhammas 
Query How can it be believed that the bare succession of material dhammas continues there for such a long time without contemporaneous conditions for its support And for how long a time does it occur Reply Anticipating such a question the commentary says Just as an arrow by the propulsive force of the bowstring etc By this he shows that not only scripture but this analogy as well demonstrates the point
The nonpercipient beings remain in that realm for at most five hundred great aeons
The propulsive force of the jhāna is the force of the kamma accumulated in the nonpercipient meditative attainment
Query How after the lapse of many hundreds of aeons can consciousness again originate from a consciousness series that has ceased so long ago
No visual consciousness is ever seen to originate when the eye has ceased
Reply This should not be considered onesidedly
For if no consciousness of the same class has arisen in the interval even the consciousness that has ceased long ago can act as a proximity condition for the rebirthconsciousness It is not the seed kamma alone is the seed
But on account of that kamma functioning as the seed when beings pass away from the nonpercipient realm a rebirthconsciousness with its conditions such as object condition etc arises in the sense sphere
Thus the commentary says A rebirthlinking perception arises here 
When a scion is removed from a tree which in accordance with the order of the seasons blossoms at a fixed time by the force of the scission the blossoming of the scion does not necessarily occur at the same time as that of the parent tree In the same way when by the development of the fading away of the material or of the immaterial a scission is made in the material and immaterial dhammas occurring inseparably in fiveconstituent existence by reason of the incisive force of the attainment the aggregates in the immaterial realm and in the nonpercipient realm occur devoid of their material and immaterial counterparts respectively
Query Isnt it possible to divide the fortuitous originationists after the manner of the eternalists according to whether their existence in the nonpercipient realm endures for a hundred thousand births for ten aeons of world contraction etc or for some period within these intervals
Reply True it is possible But because existence in the non percipient plane occurs without intermission the fortuitous originationist is shown as singlefold merely to point out the method
Or else because the doctrine of fortuitous origination is included in eternalism the entire method of teaching that has come down in the discussion of eternalism can be applied to the doctrine of fortuitous origination wherever appropriate For the sake of showing this distinction the Exalted One has explained the doctrine of fortuitous origination without subdividing its adherents who gain jhāna
And surely it must be admitted that the doctrine of fortuitous origination is included in eternalism for the defiled inclinations of beings are two 
Query But isnt it incorrect to include the doctrine of fortuitous origination in eternalism
For the former maintains Previously I did not exist but now I am Not having been I sprang into being In maintaining this thesis it assumes the manifestation of a previously nonexistent being while eternalism in contrast assumes the alltime existence of the self and the world maintaining that they exist just like eternity itself
Reply No it is not incorrect
because the doctrine of fortuitous origination does not recognize any end point in the future For although this doctrine in maintaining its thesis that previously I did not exist etc wrongly assumes a first beginning for the self and the world it still does not recognize any end for them from the present onwards into the future And because it does not recognize any end for them in the present or in the future it is distinctly a doctrine of eternalism
As the eternalist says They will remain the same just like eternity itself
Query Shouldnt the self here be distinct from material form since the latter like perception is held to be the property of the self 
When it is said that the self is percipient  perception itself is not the self 
hence it is said above apprehending  the perception as the selfs perception
Such being the case why is the material form of the kasiṇa apprehended as the self
Reply It shouldnt he thought that the self is material in the sense that material form belongs to it but rather in the sense that it is characterized by deformation 
And the deformation of the material form of the kasiṇa which makes it resemble material form is the differentiation it undergoes when at one time it is extended and at another unextended And it is impossible to deny that this is so since kasiṇas do undergo such differentiation as limited and expanded
Query If so isnt it wrong to include this doctrine in eternalism 
Reply No it is not wrong For it is the immutability of the self following the breakup of the body that is intended
Thus it is said the self is immutable after death 
Or by mere reasoning as in the case of the Ajīvakas none of the Ajīvakas gain the jhānas for they are fatalists and reject kamma and its fruits
The Ajīvakas are only rationalists Some Ajīvakas maintain that there is a self among the six classes of man the dark class etc
Immutable  it undergoes no sickness ie no dissolution The word aroga is a synonym for permanent  By means of this term the theorist claims the permanence of the self due to its immutability
The signs of the immaterial attainments the space left by the removal of the kasiṇa the consciousness of the first immaterial attainment the nonexistence  and the base of nothingness these are the respective signs of the four immaterial attainments As in the case of the Nigaṇṭhas the Nigaṇṭhas hold that the immaterial self abides in the body extending over it like the bitter taste in a nimba leaf
By combining the views by apprehending the signs of the material and immaterial attainments together as a single self and the perceptions occurring in these attainments its the selfs perceptions
For this theorist when he gains the material and immaterial attainments apprehends their signs as a self with a material aspect and an immaterial aspect and therefore formulates his conviction that the self is both material and immaterial like the Ajjhattavadins  Or else by apprehending the combinations of material and immaterial dhammas through mere reasoning he holds the self is both material and immaterial 
The fourth through reasoning through the reasoning that occurs thus The self is not material like a conglomerate of posts wattle and daub or of hands feet etc for like the subtle residual formations  it is incapable of performing the specific function on account of its extremely subtle nature yet it is not immaterial for it does not transcend the specific nature of materiality
Or else the meaning can be understood by way of the mutual contradiction of the first two positions as in the tetrad of extensionist doctrines
Only there is this distinction in the earlier case the third and fourth doctrines were shown to originate through a difference in spatial direction and lime respectively while here they originate through a difference in time and base 
For the third doctrine originates through a difference in time since the signs of the material and immaterial attainments cannot be present simultaneously
And the fourth doctrine originates through a difference in base since it maintains by way of reasoning that the aggregation of material and immaterial dhammas is a single self 
Since each attainment has a different perception the doctrine that the self has diversified perception may also be held by the theorist who possesses the eight attainments
Nevertheless because the perception in the attainment presents itself as uniform the commentary ascribes to the attainer the doctrine that the self is of uniform perception
Or else this doctrine may pertain to one who possesses only a single attainment
And though there is a difference in perceptions corresponding to the differences in attainments the doctrine that the self is of diversified perception is ascribed to the non attainer in order to show the perceptual diversity by way of the gross diversity of perception arising through a multiplicity of external objects
The statement of the third doctrine indicates that this doctrine identifies perception itself with the self since the kasiṇa is here a dhamma separate from the perception
The kasiṇa is mentioned in order to show the object of the perception the perception is limited because of its object The same method should also be applied to the ease of the expanded kasiṇa 
When this is done a valid distinction is made between these two doctrines on the one hand and the first and second extensionist doctrines and the finite and infinite doctrines of the present section on the other Otherwise these two doctrines would be distinguishable from one pair merely in terms of the difference between the periods of time with which their speculations are concerned  and would be indistinguishable from the other 
Or else of limited perception may mean that the self is percipient and limited as in the views of those who say the self is the size of a thumb or the size of corn or is a mere atom  like Kapila Kaṇāda etc And of boundless perception may mean that the self is percipient and boundless as is held by those who claim that the self is allpervasive 
Since the destruction of the nonexistent is impossible the words  of an existent being are used signifying annihilation based on existence 
The word being is used in order to show the following The specific matured dhammas occurring as causes and effects included in a single continuum exhibit a certain distinction insofar as they may belong to different continuities  Misapplying the method of diversity  these theorists misapprehend the real differentiation between the causes and the effects and arrive at the conclusion that the differentiation is absolute as though belonged to completely different continua  Hence the reason for the adherence to annihilationism is the misapplication of the method of diversity A second reason is the misapplication of the method of unity  Here despite the existing differentiation in their specific natures the dhammas occurring as causes and effects in a single continuity are apprehended as an absolutely undifferentiated whole on account of their inclusion in a single continuity  In order to show this ie that it is a being possessed of existence which serves as the objective domain of the theorists doctrine the word being is used in the text
For the assumption of a being arises when the compact of aggregates occurring in the form of a continuum is not dissected  And since it is held that the self exists so long as it is not annihilated the assumption of annihilationism is based on the assumption of the existence of a being 
The nonpossessor adopts the annihilationist position because he does not understand that there is a world beyond this due either to his nihilistic scepticism or to his stupidity
Or he holds that the domain of the world extends only as far as the range of the senses
due to his greed lor sense pleasures like the king who took hold of his own daughters hand 
Or he holds the opinion that just as a withered leaf separated from its branch cannot be rejoined to it in the same way all beings undergo death with no further rebirthlinkage they do not take rebirth they are consummated by death they do not undergo any renewed existence
For beings are like water bubbles because they never rearise 
Unlike the doctrines of endless equivocation which are shown exclusively in terms of the nonpossessor  and unlike the tetrad of doctrines on percipient immortality which are shown exclusively in terms of the possessor the present doctrine is held by both possessors and nonpossessors like eternalism partialeternalism etc
For it is said There are two types of people who hold the annihilationist view
If so why is the method of teaching employed here different from that used in the exposition of eternalism etc
Reply For the sake of displaying elegance of leaching 
For the Exalted Buddhas display elegance of teaching when they teach the Dhamma in diversified modes to conform to the inclinations of the beings to be trained Thus here as well as elsewhere the Exalted One could have given the teaching by distinguishing between the possessor of spiritual distinction and the rationalist as follows Herein bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin by means of ardor  with his mind thus concentrated he directs his mind to the knowledge of the passing away and rearising of beings With the divine eye purified and surpassing the human he sees the death consciousness of an arahat or of ordinary beings but does not see any rearising following it He declares  etc Therefore in order to conform to the inclinations of the beings to be trained through elegance of teaching the method of leaching employed here is different from that used in the exposition of eternalism etc
Or else the Exalted One has taught the annihilationist doctrine in a way distinct from the previous doctrines in order to reveal this difference in the case of annihilationism the doctrine held by the meditative attainer does not involve a mode of formulation different from the doctrine held by the rationalist  But rather since their classification is identical their modes of formulation are also identical
For the doctrine is formulated by the rationalist in the same way it is by the one possessing the attainments
Or else the Exalted One does not teach these views either as future occurrences or as mere probable postulations  But in whatever way the theorists proclaim their views saying This alone is truth any other view is false  in exactly that way the Exalted One has delimited them with his knowledge of omniscience and revealed them as they really are
It is through this that the deep transcending Buddhaqualities are disclosed and it is by praising it that the Tathāgatas are rightly extolled
And since the annihilationists who perceive successively higher states of existence establish their respective doctrines by repudiating the doctrines of those who perceive lower states the teaching occurs thus  Therefore the employment of a teaching method different from those used earlier should not be criticized
Further it should be recognized that the annihilationist position could have been further broken down by way of the subdivisions in the sense sphere and finematerial sphere  as was done in the case of the immaterial sphere 
Or alternatively it could have been stated without having broken down the immaterial sphere by a concise method as in the case of the treatment of the sense sphere and fine material sphere Such being the case there is no room for the criticism that the annihilationist doctrine contains either more or fewer divisions than the seven stated by the Exalted One
Query In the first three doctrines it is right to say with the breakup of the body  for these refer to an individual form included in fiveconstituent existence  But why is this expression used in the last four views when those refer to an individual form in fourconstituent existence
Isnt it true that the immaterial beings do not own a body
Reply That is true But the theorist himself uses this expression attributing the word body which is usually used in reference to the material form to the immaterial individual form
And the Exalted One shows their views in exactly the way the theorists proclaim them Or else the descriptive term body can be considered to apply to the immaterial formthat is to the aggregation of dhammas such as contact etcsince this has the character of an immaterial body
Query The characterization of the second and following doctrines as speculations about the future is correct for these doctrines proclaiming the extermination without remainder of the individual form of sensesphere gods etctake the future period as their domain But isnt that characterization out of place in the case of the first doctrine for the latter which proclaims the annihilation of the human form directly experienced by the theorist takes the present as its domain
The second and following doctrines because they teach the annihilation of a self arisen in some state of existence successively higher than the self mentioned in each immediately preceding doctrine are correctly classed as speculations about the future Thus they say But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated  And when they say For there is good sir another self this is said in reference to the distinction between the lower individual forms beginning with the human form But there is no such contrast in every case
Reply No it is not incorrect For though the self spoken of by the first doctrine is included in the present world it is the future time that is intended as the domain of the doctrine  Thus there is no contradiction in the characterization of the first doctrine its a speculation about the future
 Just as the longing for delicious food etc increases in one overcome by hunger and thirst so the longing for objects of clinging distinctly increases in one who deprives himself of sense pleasures But just as one who has eaten his fill of deliciously flavored food no longer has any appetite so one who has satisfied himself with as much as he wants of excellently flavored sense pleasures no longer has any thirst for them And when one has lost ones longing for the object like a leech one will automatically let go even of tantalizing objects Emerging from such unwise reflections the first theorist declares the suffering of saṃsāra to subside by the satiation of sense pleasures
The second and following theorists seeing the unsatisfactoriness in sense pleasures and the peacefulness of the happiness of the first jhāna etc declare that the suffering of saṃsāra ends by satisfying the happiness of the first jhāna etc The examination given in the section on annihilationism may be brought in here too with due alterations
There is however the following distinction these five doctrines are found in a single individuality 
Thus in the text no separate mention is made of another self as is made in the section on annihilationism
Query But why when it proclaims the absolute extension of the self is the doctrine of the nibbāna here and now of the self included in the eternalist rather than in the annihilationist view
Reply Because they teach the persistence of the purified self in its own form when it is liberated from bondage by obtaining this or that particular endowment of happiness
Query What is the reason why only the past and the future are shown as the objective domains of the adherence to views and not the two in conjunction
Reply Because it is impossible to do so
For whereas theoretical speculations are possible in regard to the past and the future due to its evanescence no such speculations are possible in regard to the exact midpoint between the two apart from the two themselves since it is the mere interval between the past and the future On the other hand if the middle term is taken as the present individuality insofar as its nature relating to past and future is amenable to theoretical speculation it is already comprised under the speculations about the past and the future
Or alternatively because it possesses a past and a future the exact midpoint is called the past and the future together That can be considered to be referred to by the Exalted One separately from the past and the future when he says Recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past and the future together hold settled views about the past and the future 
In the commentary also it can be considered to be included under the common description all the speculators about the past the future  or under a single division of that description Otherwise it would be meaningless to combine the speculators together with a single expression
And who are these speculators about the past and the future together
Those who adhere to a combination of speculations about the past and the future such as those who are extensionists and hold the doctrine of nibbāna here and now  etc
According to this statement of the sutta there are no theorists outside of these three groups those who speculate about the past the future and both together Therefore those doctrines found in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta and in various other suttas such as the doctrines of the inefficacy of action  of moral acausality  of nihilism  etc as well ns the speculative views about God  the Lord of Creation  the Primordial Spirit  time  nature  fate  chance  etc found outside the suttas should all be included and comprised in these three groups
How
The doctrine of the inefficacy of action because it denies the reality of morally efficacious action and holds that deeds are barren and steadfast like a mountain peak is comprised within eternalism So too is the doctrine of Pakudha Kaccāyana which maintains These seven groups  etc The doctrine of moral acausality because it asserts there is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings  is comprised in the doctrine of fortuitous origination
Nihilism because it asserts there is no world beyond  is comprised in annihilationism
Thus in the same passage it is said With the breakup of the body fools and the wise alike are annihilated
By the first etc  the doctrines of the Nigaṇṭhas and others are included
Although the doctrine of Nāṭaputta has come down in the texts by way of the fourfold restraint  nevertheless because of the evasiveness involved in its method of the sevenfold predicable  it is included in the doctrine of endless equivocation just as Sañjayas doctrine is
The doctrines that maintain the soul and the body are the same and the soul and the body are different are included in the doctrines that the self is immutable after death and materialimmaterial
The doctrines that the Tathāgata exists after death and there are beings spontaneously reborn are included in eternalism the doctrines the Tathāgata does not exist alter death and there are no beings spontaneously reborn in annihilationism
The doctrines the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death and there both are and are not beings spontaneously reborn in partialeternalism 
the doctrines the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death and there neither are nor are not beings spontanceously reborn in endless equivocation
The doctrines of God the Lord of Creation the Primordial Spirit and time are comprised in partialeternalism so also is the doctrine of Kaṇāda 
The doctrines of nature fate and chance are included in the doctrine of fortuitous origination
In this way the speculative views found in various suttas and those outside them in the creeds of the sectarians are comprised within these sixtytwo views
Just as if he were weighing the inclinations of beings with a pair of scales inclination here is the inclination towards views
For the inclination of beings subject to defilement is twofold towards eternalism and towards annihilationism And though this twofold inclination is divided into numerous classes insofar as it arises in the immeasurable domain of knowledge of innumerable beings in innumerable world systems the Exalted One has delimited it with his knowledge of omniscience and summarized it into sixtytwo categories beginning with the four types of eternalists just as if he had placed it on a measuring scale
As if removing the sand from the foot of Mount Sineru by this he shows that it is impossible for any other kind of knowledge than the knowledge of omniscience to originate this teaching due to its extreme profundity
It is said  etc this bhikkhu reveals his own disapproval of the emptiness of selfhood as it is taught by the Exalted One
Kammas done without a self kammas not done by any self or kammas done by the aggregates that are nonself
He asks If there is no self and the aggregates are momentary what self do kammas affect when they produce their fruits The meaning is Who experiences the fruit of kamma
He is confused because he is unskilled in the ariyan dhamma due to lack of learning etc
he is immersed in ignorance because he has not abandoned ignorance due to lack of discipline in the ariyan dhamma
and he is dominated by craving because he has come under the domination of craving thinking If there is no one called I who experiences the fruit of the kamma done by me But if there is an I there may well be the enjoyment of the fruit
In his mind in a mind accompanied by clinging to a doctrine of self
That he can overshoot the dispensation of the Master though formations are momentary the kamma and the fruit in the assemblage of dhammas are connected together by the fact that the fruit arises in the same continuum in which the kamma was originally done But because he wrongly applies the method of unity to this connection he concludes that there must be a single selfidentical agent and experiencer  Thus he conceives that he can pass beyond the dispensation of the Master which elucidates the emptiness of a self and of any property of a self
The first example shows the sequence of meaning by way of counterparts the others the sequence of meaning by way of opposites
In the Brahmajāla Sutta the teaching is set up by way of the speculative views proclaiming a permanent substance etc and concludes with the elucidation of the emptiness of any permanent substance etc
Relating feeling to contact means showing the conditioning role of contact thus The experiencing of the six objects through the six internal bases invariably occurs by reason of the six types of contact
The meeting of the three contact is to be apprehended as the meeting of the three factorsobject  faculty  and consciousness 
Thus it has concurrence as its manifestation
In accordance with the method of the following passage although other concomitant dhammas are also found in the sutta cited the teaching is set up under the heading of contact in order to show contact as the principal cause for feeling In the same way here in the Brahmajāla Sutta when it is said by repealed contacts through the six bases of contact contact is made the starting point of the sequence beginning with contact as condition feeling etc in order to show the succession of conditions by teaching dependent origination as extending into the future 
It is contact itself that contacts the various objects contact though an immaterial dhamma occurs as though contacting  i e  it occurs in the mode of contacting without adhering to the object on any one side Hence it is said Contact has contacting as its characteristic the act of impingement as its function 
The bases themselves do not exercise the function of contacting but they are shown as possessing this function by an attributive expression as when it is said The beds made a sound  They are incorporated in contact included within contact set up metaphorically in the role of contact
For a metaphor is a mere expression and not the basis for a derivation of meaning
Feeling is in brief sixfold by way of the six types of contact that function as its respective conditions i e  feeling born of eyecontact down to feeling horn of mindcontact In detail it is divided into a hundred and eight kinds in accordance with the hundredandeightfold method
Craving is in brief of six classes craving for visible forms etc down to craving for mental objects In detail it is of a hundred and eight types
Under the crest of decisivesupport condition 
Query Why is only the decisivesupport condition brought forth here Arent pleasant feeling and neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling conditions for craving in  fourfold way by way of simple object  objectpredominance  objectdecisivesupport  and natural decisive support  And is not painful feeling a condition in a twofold way by way of simpleobject and natural decisivesupport
Reply This is true But all of those are already comprised in the decisivesupport condition
Query It is correct to include the objectdecisivesupport within decisivesupport for both have the common nature of decisive support But how can the simpleobject and objectpredominance conditions be included therein
Reply Because they are included within objectdecisivesupport since they all have the common nature of the object But they are not included within naturaldecisivesupport
In order to express the aforementioned fact the commentary does not say simply that feeling is a decisivesupport condition but that it is a condition under the crest of decisivesupport condition
Craving is a condition for the four types of clinging that is for clinging to sense pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Query Is not craving itself the same as clinging to sense pleasures If so how can one thing be a condition for itself 
Reply This is true
But one may understand the distinction between them as follows In the present context weak craving is stated as craving itself and powerful craving as clinging to sense pleasures
Or else craving is the longing for an object that has not yet been acquired like a thief stretching out his hand in the dark
clinging is the grasping of an object that one has obtained like the thief grasping the treasure reached with his hand
Craving is opposed to fewness of wishes clinging to contentment
Craving is the root of the suffering involved in searhing for what one needs clinging is the root of the suffering involved in protecting ones acquisitions
Craving is a condition for nonconascent clinging under the crest of decisivesupport for the other clinging under the crest of conascence
Herein craving is a condition for the proximate clinging as a proximity contiguity proximatedecisive support absence disappearance and repetition condition for the nonproximate clinging as a decisivesupport condition and when it becomes the object of clinging as either an objectpredominance and objectdccisivcsupport condition or as a simpleobject condition When it is said under the crest of decisivesupport condition  all of this is included within decisivesupport
Since one who through craving finds satisfaction in visible forms etc acquires a thirst for sense pleasures craving is the decisivesupport for clinging to sense pleasures
And since one who is confused about visible forms etc takes hold of the wrong view that there is no giving etc while one desiring liberation from saṃsāra takes what is not the path to purity to be the path or adopts a personality view which recognizes a self and selfs property in the five aggregates craving is also the decisive support for the other three types of clinging
And finally craving is a condition for conascent clinging by way of conascence mutuality support association presence nondisappearance and root cause conditions
All this is implied when it is said under the crest of conascence 
Clinging is a condition for existence in the same way that is under the crest of decisivesupport and under the crest of conascence
Existence is kammaexistence and rebirthexisistence 
Herein kammaexistence is all kamma that leads to existence i e  volition and its concomitants Rebirthexisitence consists in the nine slates of existence  The fourfold clinging is a condition for rebirthexistence as a naturaldecisivesupport since it is the cause and concomitant of kammaexistence which is in turn the cause of rebirthexistence
Out at a time when kamma is taken as object the clinging to sense pleasures conascent with the kamma becomes an object condition for rebirthexistence
The conascent clinging is a condition for conascent kammaexistence in numerous ways as conascence mutuality support association presence and nondisappearance condition and also as a rool cause and path condition For the nonconascent and proximate kammaexistence clinging is a proximity contiguity proximatedecisivesupport absence disappearance and repetition condition for the other ie the nonproximate it is a naturaldecisivesupport condition At times of insight comprehension etc it is an object condition
Having incorporated the proximity condition etc in the decisive support condition and the conascencc condition etc in the conascence condition it is said under the crest of decisivesupport and under the crest of conascence 
Existence is a condition for birth here it is kammaexistence alone
and not rebirthexistence that is intended by existence  for kammaexistence alone is a condition for birth
Rebirthexistence is birth itself since the latter consists in the aggregates that are first produced at the initial moment of rebirth
Thus it is said Birth here is the five aggregates together with their alterations
The phrase with their alterations means with their alterations due to the alteration of production Those aggregates are the rebirthexistence itself
which cannot be its own cause
Kammaexistence is a condition for rebirth existence that is for birth as a kamma condition and decisivesupport condition Thus he says existence is a condition for birth under the crest of decisivesupport
And since aging and death arise only when there is birth not in its absence and since sorrow etc arise in a fool afflicted by aging and death etc birth is the condition for aging and death etc
 As regards the next kind called virtue concerning requisites Herein reflecting wisely is reflecting as the means and as the way by knowing by reviewing is the meaning
And here it is the reviewing stated in the way beginning For protection from cold that should be understood as reflecting wisely
Herein the robe is any one of those beginning with the inner cloth
He uses he employs dresses in as inner cloth or puts on as upper garment
Only is a phrase signifying invariability in the definition of a limit of a purpose the purpose in the meditators making use of the robes is that much only namely protection from cold etc not more than that
From cold from any kind of cold arisen either through disturbance of elements internally or through change in temperature externally
For protection for the purpose of warding off
for the purpose of eliminating it so that it may not arouse affliction in the body
For when the body is afflicted by cold the distracted mind cannot be wisely exerted That is why the Blessed One permitted the robe to be used for protection from cold
So in each instance
except that from heat means from the heat of fire
the origin of which should be understood as forest fires and so on
From contact with gadflies and flies wind and burning and creeping things here gadflies are flies that bite they are also called blind flies
Flies are just flies
Wind is distinguished as that with dust and that without dust
Burning is burning of the sun
Creeping things are any long creatures such as snakes and so on that move by crawling Contact with them is of two kinds contact by being bitten and contact by being touched And that does not worry him who sits with a robe on So he uses it for the purpose of protection from such things
Only the word is repeated in order to define a subdivision of the invariable purpose for the concealment of the private parts is an invariable purpose the others are purposes periodically
Herein private parts are any parts of the pudendum
For when a member is disclosed conscience is disturbed  offended It is called private parts because of the disturbance of conscience 
For the purpose of concealing the private parts for the purpose of the concealment of those private parts
As well as the reading hirikopīnapaṭicchādanatthaṃ there is a reading hirikopīnaṃ paṭicchādanatthaṃ 
Alms food is any sort of food
For any sort of nutriment is called alms food because of its having been dropped into a bhikkhus bowl during his alms round 
Or alms food is the dropping of the lumps  it is the concurrence  the collection of alms obtained here and there is what is meant
Neither for amusement neither for the purpose of amusement as with village boys etc for the sake of sport is what is meant
Nor for intoxication not for the purpose of intoxication as with boxers etc for the sake of intoxication with strength and for the sake of intoxication with manhood is what is meant
Nor for smartening not for the purpose of smartening as with royal concubines courtesans etc for the sake of plumpness in all the limbs is what is meant
Nor for embellishment not for the purpose of embellishment as with actors dancers etc for the sake of a clear skin and complexion is what is meant
And here the clause neither for amusement is stated for the purpose of abandoning support for delusion
nor for intoxication is said for the purpose of abandoning support for hate
nor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the purpose of abandoning support for greed
And neither for amusement nor for intoxication is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for oneself
Nor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for another
And the abandoning of both unwise practice and devotion to indulgence of sense pleasures should be understood as stated by these four
Only has the meaning already stated
Of this body of this material body consisting of the four great primaries
For the endurance for the purpose of continued endurance
And continuance for the purpose of not interrupting lifes continued occurrence or for the purpose of endurance for a long time
He makes use of the alms food for the purpose of the endurance for the purpose of the continuance of the body as the owner of an old house uses props for his house and as a carter uses axle grease not for the purpose of amusement intoxication smartening and embellishment
Furthermore endurance is a term for the life faculty So what has been said as far as the words for the endurance and continuance of this body can be understood to mean for the purpose of maintaining the occurrence of the life faculty in this body
For the ending of discomfort hunger is called discomfort in the sense of afflicting
He makes use of alms food for the purpose of ending that like anointing a wound like counteracting heat with cold and so on
For assisting the life of purity for the purpose of assisting the life of purity consisting in the whole dispensation and the life of purity consisting in the path
For while this bhikkhu is engaged in crossing the desert of existence by means of devotion to the three trainings depending on bodily strength whose necessary condition is the use of alms food he makes use of it to assist the life of purity just as those seeking to cross the desert used their childs flesh just as those seeking to cross a river use a raft and just as those seeking to cross the ocean use a ship
Thus I shall put a stop to old feelings and shall not arouse new feelings thus as a sick man uses medicine he uses alms food thinking By use of this alms food I shall put a stop to the old feeling of hunger and I shall not arouse a new feeling by immoderate eating like one of the proverbial brahmans that is one who eats till he has to be helped up by hand or till his clothes will not meet or till he rolls there on the ground or till crows can peck from his mouth or until he vomits what he has eaten
Or alternatively there is that which is called old feelings because being conditioned by former kamma it arises now in dependence on unsuitable immoderate eating
I shall put a stop to that old feeling forestalling its condition by suitable moderate eating
And there is that which is called new feeling because it will arise in the future in dependence on the accumulation of kamma consisting in making improper use of the requisite of alms food now
I shall also not arouse that new feeling avoiding by means of proper use the production of its root This is how the meaning should be understood here
What has been shown so far can be understood to include proper use of requisites abandoning of devotion to selfmortification and not giving up lawful bliss 
And I shall be healthy In this body which exists in dependence on requisites I shall by moderate eating have health called long endurance since there will be no danger of severing the life faculty or interrupting the continuity of the postures  Reflecting in this way he makes use of the alms food as a sufferer from a chronic disease does of his medicine
And blameless and live in comfort  he makes use of them thinking I shall have blamelessness by avoiding improper search acceptance and eating and I shall have a comfortable abiding by moderate eating
Or he does so thinking I shall have blamelessness due to absence of such faults as boredom sloth sleepiness blame by the wise etc that have unseemly immoderate eating as their condition and I shall have a comfortable abiding by producing bodily strength that has seemly moderate eating as its condition
Or he does so thinking I shall have blamelessness by abandoning the pleasure of lying down lolling and torpor through refraining from eating as much as possible to stuff the belly and I shall have a comfortable abiding by controlling the four postures through eating four or five mouthfuls less than the maximum
For this is said
With four or five lumps still to eat Let him then end by drinking water
For energetic bhikkhus needs This should suffice to live in comfort 
Now what has been shown at this point can be understood as discernment of purpose and practice of the middle way
Resting place  this is the bed and seat 
For wherever one sleeps  whether in a monastery or in a leanto etc that is the bed 
wherever one seats oneself  sits  that is the seat 
Both together are called restingplace 
For the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and enjoying retreat the climate itself in the sense of imperilling is perils of climate 
Unsuitable climatic conditions that cause mental distraction due to bodily affliction can be warded off by making use of the resting place it is for the purpose of warding off these and for the purpose of the pleasure of solitude is what is meant
Of course the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by the phrase protection from cold etc too
but just as in the case of making use of the robes the concealment of the private parts is stated as an invariable purpose while the others are periodical purposes so here also this last should be understood as mentioned with reference to the invariable warding off of the perils of climate
Or alternatively this climate of the kind stated is just climate
but perils are of two kinds evident perils and concealed perils 
Herein evident perils are lions tigers etc
while concealed perils are greed hate and so on
When a bhikkhu knows and reflects thus in making use of the kind of resting place where these perils do not owing to unguarded doors and sight of unsuitable visible objects etc cause affliction he can be understood as one who reflecting wisely makes use of the resting place for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate
The requisite of medicine as cure for the sick here cure is in the sense of going against illness in the sense of countering is the meaning
This is a term for any suitable remedy
It is the medical mans work because it is permitted by him thus it is medicine 
Or the cure for the sick itself as medicine is medicine as cure for the sick  Any work of a medical man such as oil honey ghee etc that is suitable for one who is sick is what is meant
A requisite  however in such passages as It is well supplied with the requisites of a city is equipment
in such passages as The chariot has the requisite of virtue the axle of jhāna the wheel of energy it is an ornament
in such passages as The requisites for the life of one who has gone into homelessness that should be available  it is an accessory
But here both equipment and accessory are applicable
For that medicine as a cure for the sick is equipment for maintaining life because it protects by preventing the arising of affliction destructive to life
and it is an accessory too because it is an instrument for prolonging life That is why it is called requisite
So it is medicine as cure for the sick and that is a requisite thus it is a requisite of medicine as cure for the sick
He makes use of that requisite of medicine as cure for the sick
any requisite for life consisting of oil honey molasses ghee etc that is allowed by a medical man as suitable for the sick is what is meant
From arisen from born become produced
Hurtful here hurt  is a disturbance of elements and it is the leprosy tumours boils etc originated by that disturbance
Hurtful because arisen in the form of hurt 
Feelings painful feelings feelings resulting from unprofitable kamma
from those hurtful feelings
For complete immunity from affliction for complete freedom from pain
so that all that is painful is abandoned is the meaning
This is how this virtue concerning requisites should be understood In brief its characteristic is the use of requisites after wise reflection
The wordmeaning here is this because breathing things go  move proceed using what they use in dependence on these robes etc these robes etc are therefore called requisites 
concerning requisites is concerning those requisites
Now as to the words one that suits his temperament  there are six kinds of temperament that is greedy temperament hating temperament deluded temperament faithful temperament intelligent temperament and speculative temperament
Some would have fourteen taking these six single ones together with the four made up of the three double combinations and one triple combination with the greed triad and likewise with the faith triad
But if this classification is admitted there are many more kinds of temperament possible by combining greed etc with faith etc therefore the kinds of temperament should be understood briefly as only six
As to meaning the temperaments are one that is to say personal nature idiosyncrasy
According to these there are only six types of persons that is one of greedy temperament one of hating temperament one of deluded temperament one of faithful temperament one of intelligent temperament and one of speculative temperament
Herein one of faithful temperament is parallel to one of greedy temperament because faith is strong when profitable kamma occurs in one of greedy temperament owing to its special qualities being near to those of greed
For in an unprofitable way greed is affectionate and not overaustere and so in a profitable way is faith
Greed seeks out sense desires as object while faith seeks out the special qualities of virtue and so on
And greed does not give up what is harmful while faith does not give up what is beneficial
One of intelligent temperament is parallel to one of hating temperament because understanding is strong when profitable kamma occurs in one of hating temperament owing to its special qualities being near to those of hate
For in an unprofitable way hate is disaffected and does not hold to its object and so in a profitable way is understanding
Hate seeks out only unreal faults while understanding seeks out only real faults
And hate occurs in the mode of condemning living beings while understanding occurs in the mode of condemning formations
One of speculative temperament is parallel to one of deluded temperament because obstructive applied thoughts arise often in one of deluded temperament who is striving to arouse unarisen profitable states owing to their special qualities being near to those of delusion
For just as delusion is restless owing to perplexity so are applied thoughts that are due to thinking over various aspects
And just as delusion vacillates owing to superficiality
so do applied thoughts that are due to facile conjecturing
Others say that there are three more kinds of temperament with craving pride and views
Herein craving is simply greed and pride is associated with that so neither of them exceeds greed
And since views have their source in delusion the temperament of views falls within the deluded temperament
What is the source of these temperaments
And how is it to be known that such a person is of greedy temperament that such a person is of one of those beginning with hating temperament
What suits one of what kind of temperament
Herein as some say the first three kinds of temperament to begin with have their source in previous habit and they have their source in elements and humours
Apparently one of greedy temperament has formerly had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying work to do or has reappeared here after dying in a heaven
And one of hating temperament has formerly had plenty of stabbing and torturing and brutal work to do or has reappeared here after dying in one of the hells or the nāga existences
And one of deluded temperament has formerly drunk a lot of intoxicants and neglected learning and questioning or has reappeared here after dying in the animal existence It is in this way that they have their source in previous habit they say
Then a person is of deluded temperament because two elements are prominent that is to say the earth element and the water element
He is of hating temperament because the other two elements are prominent
But he is of greedy temperament because all four are equal
And as regards the humours one of greedy temperament has phlegm in excess
and one of deluded temperament has wind in excess
Or one of deluded temperament has phlegm in excess
and one of greedy temperament has wind in excess So they have their source in the elements and the humours they say
Now it can rightly be objected that not all of those who have had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying work to do and who have reappeared here after dying in a heaven are of greedy temperament or the others respectively of hating and deluded temperament
and there is no such law of prominence of elements as that asserted
and only the pair greed and delusion are given in the law of humours and even that subsequently contradicts itself
and no source for even one among those beginning with one of faithful temperament is given
Consequently this definition is indecisive
The following is the exposition according to the opinion of the teachers of the commentaries or this is said in the explanation of prominence The fact that these beings have prominence of greed prominence of hate prominence of delusion is governed by previous rootcause
For when in one man at the moment of his accumulating rebirthproducing kamma greed is strong and nongreed is weak nonhate and nondelusion are strong and hate and delusion are weak then his weak nongreed is unable to prevail over his greed
but his nonhate and nondelusion being strong are able to prevail over his hate and delusion
That is why on being reborn through rebirthlinking given by that kamma he has greed is goodnatured and unangry and possesses understanding with knowledge like a lightning flash
When at the moment of anothers accumulating kamma greed and hate are strong and nongreed and nonhate weak and nondelusion is strong and delusion weak then in the way already stated he has both greed and hate
but possesses understanding with knowledge like a lightning flash like the Elder DattaAbhaya
When at the moment of his accumulating kamma greed nonhate and delusion are strong and the others are weak then in the way already stated he both has greed and is dull but is goodtempered and unangry like the Elder Bahula
Likewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma the three namely greed hate and delusion are strong and nongreed etc are weak then in the way already stated he has both greed and hate and is deluded
When at the moment of his accumulating kamma nongreed hate and delusion are strong and the others are weak then in the way already stated he has little defilement and is unshakable even on seeing a heavenly object but he has hate and is slow in understanding
When at the moment of his accumulating kamma nongreed nonhate and nondelusion are strong and the rest weak then in the way already stated he has no greed and no hate and is goodtempered but slow in understanding
Likewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma nongreed hate and nondelusion are strong and the rest weak then in the way already stated he both has no greed and possesses understanding but has hate and is irascible
Likewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma the three that is nonhate nongreed and nondelusion are strong and greed etc are weak then in the way already stated he has no greed and no hate and possesses understanding like the Elder MahāSaṅgharakkhita 
One who as it is said here has greed is one of greedy temperament
one who has hate and one who is dull are respectively of hating temperament and deluded temperament
One who possesses understanding is one of intelligent temperament
One who has no greed and one who has no hate are of faithful temperament because they are naturally trustful
Or just as one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by nondelusion is of intelligent temperament so one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by strong faith is of faithful temperament
one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by thoughts of sense desire is of speculative temperament
and one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by mixed greed etc is of mixed temperament
So it is the kamma productive of rebirthlinking and accompanied by someone among the things beginning with greed that should be understood as the source of the temperaments
But it was asked and how is it to be known that This person is of greedy temperament   and so on
This is explained as follows
By the posture by the action By eating seeing and so on
By the kind of states occurring May temperament be recognized
Herein by the posture when one of greedy temperament is walking in his usual manner he walks carefully puts his foot down slowly puts it down evenly lifts it up evenly and his step is springy 
One of hating temperament walks as though he were digging with the points of his feet puts his foot down quickly lifts it up quickly and his step is dragged along
One of deluded temperament walks with a perplexed gait puts his foot down hesitantly lifts it up hesitantly and his step is pressed down suddenly
And this is said in the account of the origin of the Māgandiya Sutta
The step of one of greedy nature will be springy
The step of one of hating nature dragged along
Deluded he will suddenly press down his step
And one without defilement has a step like this 
The stance of one of greedy temperament is confident and graceful That of one of hating temperament is rigid That of one of deluded temperament is muddled
likewise in sitting
And one of greedy temperament spreads his bed unhurriedly lies down slowly composing his limbs and he sleeps in a confident manner When woken instead of getting up quickly he gives his answer slowly as though doubtful
One of hating temperament spreads his bed hastily anyhow with his body flung down he sleeps with a scowl When woken he gets up quickly and answers as though annoyed
One of deluded temperament spreads his bed all awry and sleeps mostly face downwards with his body sprawling When woken he gets up slowly saying Hum 
Since those of faithful temperament etc are parallel to those of greedy temperament etc their postures are therefore like those described above
This firstly is how the temperaments may be recognized by the posture
By the action also in the acts of sweeping etc one of greedy temperament grasps the broom well and he sweeps cleanly and evenly without hurrying or scattering the sand as if he were strewing sinduvāra flowers
One of hating temperament grasps the broom tightly and he sweeps uncleanly and unevenly with a harsh noise hurriedly throwing up the sand on each side
One of deluded temperament grasps the broom loosely and he sweeps neither cleanly nor evenly mixing the sand up and turning it over
As with sweeping so too with any action such as washing and dyeing robes and so on One of greedy temperament acts skilfully gently evenly and carefully
One of hating temperament acts tensely stiffly and unevenly
One of deluded temperament acts unskilfully as if muddled unevenly and indecisively
Also one of greedy temperament wears his robe neither too tightly nor too loosely confidently and level all round
One of hating temperament wears it too tight and not level all round
One of deluded temperament wears it loosely and in a muddled way
Those of faithful temperament etc should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallel
This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the actions
By eating One of greedy temperament likes eating rich sweet food When eating he makes a round lump not too big and eats unhurriedly savouring the various tastes He enjoys getting something good
One of hating temperament likes eating rough sour food When eating he makes a lump that fills his mouth and he eats hurriedly without savouring the taste He is aggrieved when he gets something not good
One of deluded temperament has no settled choice When eating he makes a small unrounded lump and as he eats he drops bits into his dish smearing his face with his mind astray thinking of this and that
Also those of faithful temperament etc should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallel
This is how the temperament may be recognized by eating
And by seeing and so on when one of greedy temperament sees even a slightly pleasing visible object he looks long as if surprised he seizes on trivial virtues discounts genuine faults and when departing he does so with regret as if unwilling to leave
When one of hating temperament sees even a slightly unpleasing visible object he avoids looking long as if he were tired he picks out trivial faults discounts genuine virtues and when departing he does so without regret as if anxious to leave
When one of deluded temperament sees any sort of visible object he copies what others do if he hears others criticizing he criticizes if he hears others praising he praises but actually he feels equanimity in himselfthe equanimity of unknowing
So too with sounds and so on
And those of faithful temperament etc should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallel
This is how the temperaments may be recognized by seeing and so on
By the kind of states occurring in one of greedy temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as deceit fraud pride evilness of wishes greatness of wishes discontent foppery and personal vanity
In one of hating temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as anger enmity disparaging domineering envy and avarice
In one of deluded temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as stiffness torpor agitation worry uncertainty and holding on tenaciously with refusal to relinquish
In one of faithful temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as free generosity desire to see Noble Ones desire to hear the Good Dhamma great gladness ingenuousness honesty and trust in things that inspire trust
In one of intelligent temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as readiness to be spoken to possession of good friends knowledge of the right amount in eating mindfulness and full awareness devotion to wakefulness a sense of urgency about things that should inspire a sense of urgency and wisely directed endeavour
In one of speculative temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as talkativeness sociability boredom with devotion to the profitable failure to finish undertakings smoking by night and flaming by day  and mental running hither and thither 
This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the kind of states occurring
However these directions for recognizing the temperaments have not been handed down in their entirety in either the texts or the commentaries they are only expressed according to the opinion of the teachers and cannot therefore be treated as authentic
For even those of hating temperament can exhibit postures etc ascribed to the greedy temperament when they try diligently
And postures etc never arise with distinct characteristics in a person of mixed temperament
Only such directions for recognizing temperament as are given in the commentaries should be treated as authentic
for this is said A teacher who has acquired penetration of minds will know the temperament and will explain a meditation subject accordingly one who has not should question the pupil
So it is by penetration of minds or by questioning the person that it can be known
whether he is one of greedy temperament or one of those beginning with hating temperament
What suits one of what kind of temperament A suitable lodging for one of greedy temperament has an unwashed sill and stands level with the ground and it can be either an overhanging rock with an unprepared dripledge  a grass hut or a leaf house etc It ought to be spattered with dirt full of bats dilapidated too high or too low in bleak surroundings threatened by lions tigers etc with a muddy uneven path where even the bed and chair are full of bugs And it should be ugly and unsightly exciting loathing as soon as looked at
Suitable inner and outer garments are those that have tornoff edges with threads hanging down all round like a net cake harsh to the touch like hemp soiled heavy and hard to wear
And the right kind of bowl for him is an ugly clay bowl disfigured by stoppings and joints or a heavy and misshapen iron bowl as unappetizing as a skull
The right kind of road for him on which to wander for alms is disagreeable with no village near and uneven
The right kind of village for him in which to wander for alms is where people wander about as if oblivious of him where as he is about to leave without getting alms even from a single family people call him into the sitting hall saying Come venerable sir and give him gruel and rice but do so as casually as if they were putting a cow in a pen
Suitable people to serve him are slaves or workmen who are unsightly illfavoured with dirty clothes illsmelling and disgusting who serve him his gruel and rice as if they were throwing it rudely at him
The right kind of gruel and rice and hard food is poor unsightly made up of millet kudusaka broken rice etc stale buttermilk sour gruel curry of old vegetables or anything at all that is merely for filling the stomach
The right kind of posture for him is either standing or walking
The object of his contemplation should be any of the colour kasiṇas beginning with the blue whose colour is not pure This is what suits one of greedy temperament
A suitable resting place for one of hating temperament is not too high or too low provided with shade and water with wellproportioned walls posts and steps with wellprepared frieze work and lattice work brightened with various kinds of painting with an even smooth soft floor adorned with festoons of flowers and a canopy of manycoloured cloth like a Brahmāgods divine palace with bed and chair covered with wellspread clean pretty covers smelling sweetly of flowers and perfumes and scents set about for homely comfort which makes one happy and glad at the mere sight of it 
The right kind of road to his lodging is free from any sort of danger traverses clean even ground and has been properly prepared
And here it is best that the lodgings furnishings are not too many in order to avoid hidingplaces for insects bugs snakes and rats even a single bed and chair only
The right kind of inner and outer garments for him are of any superior stuff such as China cloth Somāra cloth silk fine cotton fine linen of either single or double thickness quite light and well dyed quite pure in colour to befit an ascetic
The right kind of bowl is made of iron as well shaped as a water bubble as polished as a gem spotless and of quite pure colour to befit an ascetic
The right kind of road on which to wander for alms is free from dangers level agreeable with the village neither too far nor too near
The right kind of village in which to wander for alms is where people thinking Now our lord is coming prepare a seat in a sprinkled swept place and going out to meet him take his bowl lead him to the house seat him on a prepared seat and serve him carefully with their own hands
Suitable people to serve him are handsome pleasing well bathed well anointed scented with the perfume of incense and the smell of flowers adorned with apparel made of variouslydyed clean pretty cloth who do their work carefully
The right kind of gruel rice and hard food has colour smell and taste possesses nutritive essence and is inviting superior in every way and enough for his wants
The right kind of posture for him is lying down or sitting The object of his contemplation should be anyone of the colour kasiṇas beginning with the blue whose colour is quite pure This is what suits one of hating temperament
The right lodging for one of deluded temperament has a view and is not shut in where the four quarters are visible to him as he sits there As to the postures walking is right
The right kind of object for his contemplation is not small that is to say the size of a winnowing basket or the size of a saucer
for his mind becomes more confused in a confined space so the right kind is an amply large kasiṇa
The rest is as stated for one of hating temperament This is what suits one of deluded temperament
For one of faithful temperament all the directions given for one of hating temperament are suitable
As to the object of his contemplation one of the recollections is right as well
For one of intelligent temperament there is nothing unsuitable as far as concerns the lodging and so on
For one of speculative temperament an open lodging with a view where gardens groves and ponds pleasant prospects panoramas of villages towns and countryside and the blue gleam of mountains are visible to him as he sits there is not right for that is a condition for the running hither and thither of applied thought So he should live in a lodging such as a deep cavern screened by woods like the Overhanging Rock of the Elephants Belly  or Mahindas Cave
Also an amplesized object of contemplation is not suitable for him
for one like that is a condition for the running hither and thither of applied thought
A small one is right
The rest is as stated for one of greedy temperament This is what suits one of speculative temperament
These are the details with definition of the kind source recognition and what is suitable as regards the various temperaments handed down here with the words that suits his own temperament 
However the meditation subject that is suitable to the temperament has not been cleared up in all its aspects yet
This will become clear automatically when those in the following list are treated in detail 
Now it was said above and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament  Here the exposition of the meditation subject should be first understood in these ten ways as to enumeration as to which bring only access and which absorption at to the kinds of jhāna as to surmounting as to extension and nonextension as to object as to plane as to apprehending as to condition as to suitability to temperament
Herein as to enumeration it was said above from among the forty meditation subjects  Herein the forty meditation subjects are these ten kasiṇas  ten kinds of foulness ten recollections four divine abidings four immaterial states one perception one defining
Herein the ten kasiṇas are these earth kasiṇa water kasiṇa fire kasiṇa air kasiṇa blue kasiṇa yellow kasiṇa red kasiṇa white kasiṇa light kasiṇa and limitedspace kasiṇa 
The ten kinds of foulness are these the bloated the livid the festering the cut up the gnawed the scattered the hacked and scattered the bleeding the worm infested and a skeleton 
The ten kinds of recollection are these recollection of the Buddha  recollection of the Dhamma  recollection of the Sangha  recollection of virtue recollection of generosity recollection of deities recollection of death mindfulness occupied with the body mindfulness of breathing and recollection of peace
The four divine abidings are these lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity
The four immaterial states are these the base consisting of boundless space the base consisting of boundless consciousness the base consisting of nothingness and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception
The one perception is the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment
The one defining is the defining of the four elements This is how the exposition should be understood as to enumeration 
 As to which bring access only and which absorption the eight recollections excepting mindfulness occupied with the body and mindfulness of breathing the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment and the defining of the four elements are ten meditation subjects that bring access only
The others bring absorption
This is as to which bring access only and which absorption 
As to the kind of jhāna among those that bring absorption the ten kasiṇas together with mindfulness of breathing bring all four jhānas
The ten kinds of foulness together with mindfulness occupied with the body bring the first jhāna
The first three divine abidings bring three jhānas
The fourth divine abiding and the four immaterial states bring the fourth jhāna This is as to the kind of jhāna 
As to surmounting there are two kinds of surmounting that is to say surmounting of factors and surmounting of object
Herein there is surmounting of factors in the case of all meditation subjects that bring three and four jhānas because the second jhāna etc have to be reached in those same objects by surmounting the jhāna factors of applied thought and sustained thought and so on
Likewise in the case of the fourth divine abiding
for that has to be reached by surmounting joy in the same object as that of lovingkindness and so on
But in the case of the four immaterial states there is surmounting of the object
for the base consisting of boundless space has to be reached by surmounting one or other of the first nine kasiṇas
and the base consisting of boundless consciousness etc have respectively to be reached by surmounting space and so on
With the rest there is no surmounting This is as to surmounting 
As to extension and nonextension only the ten kasiṇas among these forty meditation subjects need be extended
For it is within just so much space as one is intent upon with the kasiṇa that one can hear sounds with the divine ear element see visible objects with the divine eye and know the minds of other beings with the mind
Mindfulness occupied with the body and the ten kinds of foulness need not be extended
Why
Because they have a definite location and because there is no benefit in it
The definiteness of their location will become clear in explaining the method of development 
If the latter are extended it is only a quantity of corpses that is extended and there is no benefit
And this is said in answer to the question of Sopāka Perception of visible forms is quite clear Blessed One perception of bones is not clear 
for here the perception of visible forms is called quite clear in the sense of extension of the sign
while the perception of bones is called not quite clear in the sense of its nonextension
But the words I was intent upon this whole earth with the perception of a skeleton are said of the manner of appearance to one who has acquired that perception
For just as in the Emperor Dhammāsokas time the Karavīka bird uttered a sweet song when it saw its own reflection in the looking glass walls all round and perceived Karavīkas in every direction so the Elder Siṅgāla Pitar thought when he saw the sign appearing in all directions through his acquisition of the perception of a skeleton that the whole earth was covered with bones
If that is so then is what is called the measurelessness of the object of jhāna produced on foulness contradicted
It is not contradicted
For one man apprehends the sign in a large bloated corpse or skeleton
another in a small one
In this way the jhāna of the one has a limited object
and of the other a measureless object
Or alternatively With a measureless object is said of it referring to one who extends it seeing no disadvantage in doing so
But it need not be extended because no benefit results
The rest need not be extended likewise
Why
When a man extends the sign of inbreaths and outbreaths only a quantity of wind is extended and it has a definite location the nosetip
So it need not be extended because of the disadvantage and because of the definiteness of the location
And the divine abidings have living beings as their object When a man extends the sign of these only the quantity of living beings would be extended and there is no purpose in that So that also need not be extended
When it is said Intent upon one quarter with his heart endued with loving kindness  etc that is said for the sake of comprehensive inclusion
For it is when a man develops it progressively by including living beings in one direction by one house by two houses etc that he is said to be intent upon one direction
not when he extends the sign
And there is no counterpart sign here that he might extend
Also the state of having a limited or measureless object can be understood here according to the way of inclusion too
As regards the immaterial states as object space need not be extended since it is the mere removal of the kasiṇa materiality
for that should be brought to mind only as the disappearance of the kasiṇa materiality
if he extends it nothing further happens
And consciousness need not be extended since it is a state consisting in an individual essence and it is not possible to extend a state consisting in an individual essence
The disappearance of consciousness need not be extended since it is mere nonexistence of consciousness
And the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception as object need not be extended since it too is a state consisting in an individual essence 
The rest need not be extended because they have no sign
For it is the counterpart sign that would be extendable
and the object of the recollection of the Buddha etc is not a counterpart sign Consequently there is no need for extension there This is as to extension and nonextension 
 As to object of these forty meditation subjects twentytwo have counterpart signs as object that is to say the ten kasiṇas the ten kinds of foulness mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied with the body
the rest do not have counterpart signs as object
Then twelve have states consisting in individual essences as object that is to say eight of the ten recollectionsexcept mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied with the bodythe perception of repulsiveness in nutriment the defining of the elements the base consisting of boundless consciousness and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception and twentytwo have counterpart signs as object
that is to say the ten kasiṇas the ten kinds of foulness mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied with the body
while the remaining six have notso classifiable objects
Then eight have mobile objects in the early stage though the counterpart is stationary that is to say the festering the bleeding the worminfested mindfulness of breathing the water kasiṇa the fire kasiṇa the air kasiṇa and in the case of the light kasiṇa the object consisting of a circle of sunlight etc
the rest have immobile objects This is as to object
 As to plane here the twelve namely the ten kinds of foulness mindfulness occupied with the body and perception of repulsiveness in nutriment do not occur among deities
These twelve and mindfulness of breathing do not occur in the Brahmāworld
But none except the four immaterial states occur in the immaterial becoming
All occur among human beings This is as to plane 
As to apprehending here the exposition should be understood according to the seen the touched and the heard
Herein these nineteen that is to say nine kasiṇas omitting the air kasiṇa and the ten kinds of foulness must be apprehended by the seen
The meaning is that in the early stage their sign must be apprehended by constantly looking with the eye
In the case of mindfulness occupied with the body the five parts ending with skin must be apprehended by the seen and the rest by the heard so its object must be apprehended by the seen and the heard
Mindfulness of breathing must be apprehended by the touched the air kasiṇa by the seen and the touched the remaining eighteen by the heard
The divine abiding of equanimity and the four immaterial states are not apprehendable by a beginner
but the remaining thirtyfive are This is as to apprehending 
 As to condition of these meditation subjects nine kasiṇas omitting the space kasiṇa are conditions for the immaterial states The ten kasiṇas are conditions for the kinds of directknowledge Three divine abidings are conditions for the fourth divine abiding Each lower immaterial state is a condition for each higher one The base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is a condition for the attainment of cessation All are conditions for living in bliss for insight and for the fortunate kinds of becoming This is as to condition 
As to suitability to temperament here the exposition should be understood according to what is suitable to the temperaments
That is to say first the ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness occupied with the body are eleven meditation subjects suitable for one of greedy temperament
The four divine abidings and four colour kasiṇas are eight suitable for one of hating temperament
Mindfulness of breathing is the one recollection as a meditation subject suitable for one of deluded temperament and for one of speculative temperament
The first six recollections are suitable for one of faithful temperament
Mindfulness of death the recollection of peace the defining of the four elements and the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment are four suitable for one of intelligent temperament
The remaining kasiṇas and the immaterial states are suitable for all kinds of temperament
And anyone of the kasiṇas should be limited for one of speculative temperament and measureless for one of deluded temperament
This is how the exposition should be understood here as to suitability to temperament   All this has been stated in the form of direct opposition and complete suitability
But there is actually no profitable development that does not suppress greed etc and help faith and so on
And this is said in the Meghiya Sutta
One should in addition develop these four things
foulness should be developed for the purpose of abandoning greed 
Lovingkindness should be developed for the purpose of abandoning ill will
Mindfulness of breathing should be developed for the purpose of cutting off applied thought
Perception of impermanence should be cultivated for the purpose of eliminating the conceit I am 
Also in the Rāhula Sutta in the passage beginning Develop lovingkindness Rāhula  seven meditation subjects are given for a single temperament
So instead of insisting on the mere letter the intention should be sought in each instance This is the explanatory exposition of the meditation subject referred to by the words he should apprehendone meditation subject 
Now the words and he should apprehend are illustrated as follows
After approaching the good friend of the kind described in the explanation of the words then approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject  the meditator should dedicate himself to the Blessed One the Enlightened One or to a teacher and he should ask for the meditation subject with a sincere inclination of the heart and sincere resolution
Herein he should dedicate himself to the Blessed One the Enlightened One in this way Blessed One I relinquish this my person to you
For without having thus dedicated himself when living in a remote abode he might be unable to stand fast if a frightening object made its appearance and he might return to a village abode become associated with laymen take up improper search and come to ruin
But when he has dedicated himself in this way no fear arises in him if a frightening object makes its appearance
in fact only joy arises in him as he reflects Have you not wisely already dedicated yourself to the Enlightened One
Suppose a man had a fine piece of Kāsi cloth He would feel grief if it were eaten by rats or moths
but if he gave it to a bhikkhu needing robes he would feel only joy if he saw the bhikkhu tearing it up to make his patched cloak
And so it is with this
When he dedicates himself to a teacher he should say I relinquish this my person to you venerable sir
For one who has not dedicated his person thus becomes unresponsive to correction hard to speak to and unamenable to advice or he goes where he likes without asking the teacher Consequently the teacher does not help him with either material things or the Dhamma and he does not train him in the cryptic books
Failing to get these two kinds of help he finds no footing in the Dispensation and he soon comes down to misconducting himself or to the lay state
But if he has dedicated his person he is not unresponsive to correction does not go about as he likes is easy to speak to and lives only in dependence on the teacher
He gets the twofold help from the teacher and attains growth increase and fulfilment in the Dispensation Like the Elder Cūḷa PiṇḍapātikaTissas pupils
Three bhikkhus came to the elder it seems
One of them said Venerable sir I am ready to fall from a cliff the height of one hundred men if it is said to be to your advantage
The second said Venerable sir I am ready to grind away this body from the heels up without remainder on a flat stone if it is said to be to your advantage
The third said Venerable sir I am ready to die by stopping breathing if it is said to be to your advantage
Observing These bhikkhus are certainly capable of progress the elder expounded a meditation subject to them
Following his advice the three attained Arahantship This is the benefit in selfdedication
Hence it was said above dedicating himself to the Blessed One the Enlightened One or to a teacher 
With a sincere inclination of the heart and sincere resolution  the meditators inclination should be sincere in the six modes beginning with non greed
For it is one of such sincere inclination who arrives at one of the three kinds of enlightenment
according as it is said Six kinds of inclination lead to the maturing of the enlightenment of the Bodhisattas With the inclination to non greed Bodhisattas see the fault in greed With the inclination to nonhate Bodhisattas see the fault in hate With the inclination to nondelusion Bodhisattas see the fault in delusion With the inclination to renunciation Bodhisattas see the fault in house life With the inclination to seclusion Bodhisattas see the fault in society With the inclination to relinquishment Bodhisattas see the fault in all kinds of becoming and destiny 
For streamenterers oncereturners nonreturners those with cankers destroyed  Paccekabuddhas and Fully Enlightened Ones whether past future or present all arrive at the distinction peculiar to each by means of these same six modes
That is why he should have sincerity of inclination in these six modes
He should be wholeheartedly resolved on that
The meaning is that he should be resolved upon concentration respect concentration incline to concentration be resolved upon Nibbāna respect Nibbāna incline to Nibbāna
When with sincerity of inclination and wholehearted resolution in this way he asks for a meditation subject then a teacher who has acquired the penetration of minds can know his temperament by surveying his mental conduct and a teacher who has not can know it by putting such questions to him as
What is your temperament
or What states are usually present in you
or What do you like bringing to mind
or What meditation subject does your mind favour 
When he knows he can expound a meditation subject suitable to that temperament
And in doing so he can expound it in three ways
it can be expounded to one who has already learnt the meditation subject by having him recite it at one or two sessions
it can be expounded to one who lives in the same place each time he comes
and to one who wants to learn it and then go elsewhere it can be expounded in such a manner that it is neither too brief nor too long
Herein when first he is explaining the earth kasiṇa there are nine aspects that he should explain They are the four faults of the kasiṇa the making of a kasiṇa the method of development for one who has made it the two kinds of sign the two kinds of concentration the seven kinds of suitable and unsuitable the ten kinds of skill in absorption evenness of energy and the directions for absorption
In the case of the other meditation subjects each should be expounded in the way appropriate to it
All this will be made clear in the directions for development
But when the meditation subject is being expounded in this way the meditator must apprehend the sign as he listens
Apprehend the sign means that he must connect each aspect thus This is the preceding clause this is the subsequent clause this is its meaning this is its intention this is the simile
When he listens attentively apprehending the sign in this way his meditation subject is well apprehended
Then and because of that he successfully attains distinction but not otherwise This clarifies the meaning of the words and he must apprehend 
At this point the clauses approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament have been expounded in detail in all their aspects
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
Now it was said earlier After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to live in one that is favourable  In the first place one who finds it convenient to live with the teacher in the same monastery can live there while he is making certain of the meditation subject
If it is inconvenient there he can live in another monastery a suitable onea quarter or a half or even a whole league distant
In that case when he finds he is in doubt about or has forgotten some passage in the meditation subject then he should do the duties in the monastery in good time and set out afterwards going for alms on the way and arriving at the teachers dwelling place after his meal He should make certain about the meditation subject that day in the teachers presence Next day after paying homage to the teacher he should go for alms on his way back and so he can return to his own dwelling place without fatigue
But one who finds no convenient place within even a league should clarify all difficulties about the meditation subject and make quite sure it has been properly attended to Then he can even go far away and avoiding a monastery unfavourable to development of concentration live in one that is favourable
Herein one that is unfavourable has anyone of eighteen faults
These are largeness newness dilapidatedness a nearby road a pond edible leaves flowers fruits famousness a nearby city nearby timber trees nearby arable fields presence of incompatible persons a nearby port of entry nearness to the border countries nearness to the frontier of a kingdom unsuitability lack of good friends One with any of these faults is not favourable
He should not live there
Why
Firstly people with varying aims collect in a large monastery They conflict with each other and so neglect the duties
The Enlightenmenttree terrace etc remain unswept
the water for drinking and washing is not set out
So if he thinks I shall go to the almsresort village for alms and takes his bowl and robe and sets out perhaps he sees that the duties have not been done or that a drinkingwater pot is empty and so the duty has to be done by him unexpectedly Drinking water must be maintained
By not doing it he would commit a wrongdoing in the breach of a duty
But if he does it he loses time He arrives too late at the village and gets nothing because the alms giving is finished
Also when he goes into retreat he is distracted by the loud noises of novices and young bhikkhus and by acts of the Community being carried out
However he can live in a large monastery where all the duties are done and where there are none of the other disturbances
In a new monastery there is much new building activity People criticize someone who takes no part in it
But he can live in such a monastery where the bhikkhus say Let the venerable one do the ascetics duties as much as he likes We shall see to the building work 
 In a dilapidated monastery there is much that needs repair People criticize someone who does not see about the repairing of at least his own lodging When he sees to the repairs his meditation subject suffers
 In a monastery with a nearby road by a main street visitors keep arriving night and day
He has to give up his own lodging to those who come late and he has to go and live at the root of a tree or on top of a rock
And next day it is the same So there is no opportunity to practice his meditation subject
But he can live in one where there is no such disturbance by visitors
 A pond is a rock pool Numbers of people come there for drinking water Pupils of citydwelling elders supported by the royal family come to do dyeing work When they ask for vessels wood tubs etc they must be shown where these things are So he is kept all the time on the alert
 If he goes with his meditation subject to sit by day where there are many sorts of edible leaves then women vegetablegatherers singing as they pick leaves nearby endanger his meditation subject by disturbing it with sounds of the opposite sex
And where there are many sorts of flowering shrubs in bloom there is the same danger too
 Where there are many sorts of fruits such as mangoes roseapples and jakfruits people who want fruits come and ask for them and they get angry if he does not give them any or they take them by force When walking in the monastery in the evening he sees them and asks Why do you do so lay followers  they abuse him as they please
and even try to evict him
When he lives in a monastery that is famous and renowned in the world like Dakkhiṇagiri Hatthikucchi Cetiyagiri or Cittalapabbata there are always people coming who want to pay homage to him supposing that he is an Arahant which inconveniences him But if it suits him he can live there at night and go elsewhere by day
In one with a nearby city objects of the opposite sex come into focus Womenpot carriers go by bumping into him with their jars and giving no room to pass Also important people spread out carpets in the middle of the monastery and sit down
One with nearby timber trees where there are timber trees and osiers useful for making framework is inconvenient because of the woodgatherers there like the gatherers of branches and fruits already mentioned
If there are trees in a monastery people come and cut them down to build houses with When he has come out of his meditation room in the evening and is walking up and down in the monastery if he sees them and asks Why do you do so lay followers  they abuse him as they please and even try to evict him
People make use of one with nearby arable fields quite surrounded by fields They make a threshing floor in the middle of the monastery itself They thresh corn there dry it in the forecourts and cause great inconvenience
And where there is extensive property belonging to the Community the monastery attendants impound cattle belonging to families and deny the water supply to their crops Then people bring an ear of paddy and show it to the Community saying Look at your monastery attendants work
For one reason or another he has to go to the portals of the king or the kings ministers This matter of property belonging to the Community is included by a monastery that is near arable fields
Presence of incompatible persons where there are bhikkhus living who are incompatible and mutually hostile when they clash and it is protested Venerable sirs do not do so they exclaim We no longer count now that this refuserag wearer has come 
One with a nearby water port of entry or land port of entry is made inconvenient by people constantly arriving respectively by ship or by caravan and crowding round asking for space or for drinking water or salt
In the case of one near the border countries people have no trust in the Buddha etc there
In one near the frontier of a kingdom there is fear of kings
For perhaps one king attacks that place thinking It does not submit to my rule and the other does likewise thinking It does not submit to my rule
A bhikkhu lives there when it is conquered by one king and when it is conquered by the other
Then they suspect him of spying and they bring about his undoing
Unsuitability is that due to the risk of encountering visible data etc of the opposite sex as objects or to haunting by nonhuman beings
Here is a story
An elder lived in a forest it seems
Then an ogress stood in the door of his leaf hut and sang
The elder came out and stood in the door She went to the end of the walk and sang
The elder went to the end of the walk
She stood in a chasm a hundred fathoms deep and sang
The elder recoiled
Then she suddenly grabbed him saying Venerable sir it is not just one or two of the likes of you I have eaten 
Lack of good friends where it is not possible to find a good friend as a teacher or the equivalent of a teacher or a preceptor or the equivalent of a preceptor
the lack of good friends there is a serious fault One that has any of those eighteen faults should be understood as unfavourable
And this is said in the commentaries
A large abode a new abode One tumbling down one near a road
One with a pond or leaves or flowers Or fruits or one that people seek
In cities among timber fields Where people quarrel in a port
In border lands on frontiers Unsuitableness and no good friend
These are the eighteen instances A wise man needs to recognize
And give them full as wide a berth As any footpadhunted road
One that has the five factors beginning with not too far from and not too near to the alms resort is called favourable
For this is said by the Blessed One And how has a lodging five factors bhikkhus
Here bhikkhus a lodging is not too far not too near and has a path for going and coming It is little frequented by day with little sound and few voices by night There is little contact with gadflies flies wind burning sun and creeping things One who lives in that lodging easily obtains robes alms food lodging and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick
In that lodging there are elder bhikkhus living who are learned versed in the scriptures observers of the Dhamma observers of the Vinaya observers of the Codes and when from time to time one asks them questions How is this venerable sir What is the meaning of this  then those venerable ones reveal the unrevealed explain the unexplained and remove doubt about the many things that raise doubts
This bhikkhus is how a lodging has five factors
These are the details for the clause After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to live in one that is favourable 
Then he should sever the lesser impediments  one living in such a favourable monastery should sever any minor impediments that he may still have
that is to say long head hair nails and body hair should be cut
mending and patching of old robes should be done
or those that are soiled should be dyed
If there is a stain on the bowl the bowl should be baked
The bed chair etc should be cleaned up
These are the details for the clause Then he should sever the lesser impediments 
Now with the clause And not overlook any of the directions for development  the time has come for the detailed exposition of all meditation subjects starting with the earth kasiṇa
THE EARTH KASIA When a bhikkhu has thus severed the lesser impediments then on his return from his alms round after his meal and after he has got rid of drowsiness due to the meal he should sit down comfortably in a secluded place and apprehend the sign in earth that is either made up or not made up
For this is said
One who is learning the earth kasiṇa apprehends the sign in earth that is either made up or not made up that is bounded not unbounded limited not unlimited with a periphery not without a periphery circumscribed not uncircumscribed either the size of a bushel or the size of a saucer 
He sees to it that that sign is well apprehended well attended to well defined
Having done that and seeing its advantages and perceiving it as a treasure building up respect for it making it dear to him he anchors his mind to that object thinking Surely in this way I shall be freed from aging and death
Secluded from sense desires  he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna 
Herein when in a previous becoming a man has gone forth into homelessness in the Dispensation or outside it with the rishis going forth and has already produced the jhāna tetrad or pentad on the earth kasiṇa and so has such merit and the support of past practice of jhāna as well then the sign arises in him on earth that is not made up that is to say on a ploughed area or on a threshing floor as in the Elder Mallakas case
It seems that while that venerable one was looking at a ploughed area the sign arose in him the size of that area
He extended it and attained the jhāna pentad Then by establishing insight with the jhāna as the basis for it he reached Arahantship
MAKING AN EARTH KASIA  But when a man has had no such previous practice he should make a kasiṇa guarding against the four faults of a kasiṇa and not overlooking any of the directions for the meditation subject learnt from the teacher
Now the four faults of the earth kasiṇa are due to the intrusion of blue yellow red or white
So instead of using clay of such colours he should make the kasiṇa of clay like that in the stream of the Gangā which is the colour of the dawn
And he should make it not in the middle of the monastery in a place where novices etc are about
but on the confines of the monastery in a screened place either under an overhanging rock or in a leaf hut He can make it either portable or as a fixture
Of these a portable one should be made by tying rags of leather or matting onto four sticks and smearing thereon a disk of the size already mentioned using clay picked clean of grass roots gravel and sand and well kneaded
At the time of the preliminary work it should be laid on the ground and looked at
A fixture should be made by knocking stakes into the ground in the form of a lotus calyx lacing them over with creepers
If the clay is insufficient then other clay should be put underneath and a disk a span and four fingers across made on top of that with the quite pure dawncoloured clay
For it was with reference only to measurement that it was said above either the size of a bushel or the size of a saucer 
But that is bounded not unbounded was said to show its delimitedness
So having thus made it delimited and of the size prescribed he should scrape it down with a stone trowela wooden trowel turns it a bad colour
so that should not be employedand make it as even as the surface of a drum Then he should sweep the place out and have a bath On his return he should seat himself on a wellcovered chair with legs a span and four fingers high prepared in a place that is two and a half cubits that is two and a half times elbow to fingertip from the kasiṇa disk
For the kasiṇa does not appear plainly to him if he sits further off than that and if he sits nearer than that faults in the kasiṇa appear
If he sits higher up he has to look at it with his neck bent and if he sits lower down his knees ache
STARTING CONTEMPLATION So after seating himself in the way stated he should review the dangers in sense desires in the way beginning Sense desires give little enjoyment and arouse longing for the escape from sense desires for the renunciation that is the means to the surmounting of all suffering He should next arouse joy of happiness by recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha then awe by thinking Now this is the way of renunciation entered upon by all Buddhas Paccekabuddhas and noble disciples and then eagerness by thinking In this way I shall surely come to know the taste of the bliss of seclusion After that he should open his eyes moderately apprehend the sign and so proceed to develop it 
If he opens his eyes too wide they get fatigued and the disk becomes too obvious which prevents the sign becoming apparent to him
If he opens them too little the disk is not obvious enough and his mind becomes drowsy which also prevents the sign becoming apparent to him
So he should develop it by apprehending the sign  keeping his eyes open moderately as if he were seeing the reflection of his face on the surface of a looking glass  The colour should not be reviewed The characteristic should not be given attention
But rather while not ignoring the colour attention should be given by setting the mind on the name concept as the most outstanding mental datum relegating the colour to the position of a property of its physical support
That conceptual state can be called by anyone he likes among the names for earth such as earth  the Great One  the Friendly One  ground  the Provider of Wealth  the Bearer of Wealth  etc whichever suits his manner of perception
Still earth is also a name that is obvious so it can be developed with the obvious one by saying earth earth
It should be adverted to now with eyes open now with eyes shut
And he should go on developing it in this way a hundred times a thousand times and even more than that until the learning sign arises
When while he is developing it in this way it comes into focus as he adverts with his eyes shut exactly as it does with his eyes open then the learning sign is said to have been produced
After its production he should no longer sit in that place
he should return to his own quarters and go on developing it sitting there
But in order to avoid the delay of foot washing a pair of single soled sandals and a walking stick are desirable
Then if the new concentration vanishes through some unsuitable encounter he can put his sandals on take his walking stick and go back to the place to reapprehend the sign there When he returns he should seat himself comfortably and develop it by reiterated reaction to it and by striking at it with thought and applied thought
THE COUNTERPART SIGN  As he does so the hindrances eventually become suppressed the defilements subside the mind becomes concentrated with access concentration and the counterpart sign arises
The difference between the earlier learning sign and the counterpart sign is this In the learning sign any fault in the kasiṇa is apparent But the counterpart sign appears as if breaking out from the learning sign and a hundred times a thousand times more purified like a lookingglass disk drawn from its case like a motherofpearl dish well washed like the moons disk coming out from behind a cloud like cranes against a thunder cloud
But it has neither colour nor shape
for if it had it would be cognizable by the eye gross susceptible of comprehension by insight and stamped with the three characteristics  But it is not like that
For it is born only of perception in one who has obtained concentration being a mere mode of appearance
But as soon as it arises the hindrances are quite suppressed the defilements subside and the mind becomes concentrated in access concentration
THE TWO KINDS OF CONCENTRATION Now concentration is of two kinds that is to say access concentration and absorption concentration
the mind becomes concentrated in two ways that is on the plane of access and on the plane of obtainment
Herein the mind becomes concentrated on the plane of access by the abandonment of the hindrances
and on the plane of obtainment by the manifestation of the jhāna factors
The difference between the two kinds of concentration is this The factors are not strong in access It is because they are not strong that when access has arisen the mind now makes the sign its object and now reenters the life continuum just as when a young child is lifted up and stood on its feet it repeatedly falls down on the ground
But the factors are strong in absorption It is because they are strong that when absorption concentration has arisen the mind having once interrupted the flow of the lifecontinuum carries on with a stream of profitable impulsion for a whole night and for a whole day just as a healthy man after rising from his seat could stand for a whole day
The arousing of the counterpart sign which arises together with access concentration is very difficult
Therefore if he is able to arrive at absorption in that same session by extending the sign it is good
If not then he must guard the sign diligently as if it were the foetus of a Wheelturning Monarch 
So guard the sign nor count the cost And what is gained will not be lost
Who fails to have this guard maintained Will lose each time what he has gained
Herein the way of guarding it is this
Abode resort and speech and person The food the climate
and the posture Eschew these seven different kinds Whenever found unsuitable
But cultivate the suitable For one perchance so doing finds
He need not wait too long until Absorption shall his wish fulfil
 Herein an abode is unsuitable if while he lives in it the unarisen sign does not arise in him or is lost when it arises and where unestablished mindfulness fails to become established and the unconcentrated mind fails to become concentrated
That is suitable in which the sign arises and becomes confirmed in which mindfulness becomes established and the mind becomes concentrated as in the Elder PadhāniyaTissa resident at Nāgapabbata
So if a monastery has many abodes he can try them one by one living in each for three days and stay on where his mind becomes unified
For it was due to suitability of abode that five hundred bhikkhus reached Arahantship while still dwelling in the Lesser Nāga Cave in Tambapaṇṇi Island after apprehending their meditation subject there
There is no counting the stream enterers who have reached Arahantship there after reaching the noble plane elsewhere
so too in the monastery of Cittalapabbata and others
An almsresort village lying to the north or south of the lodging not too far within one kosa and a half and where alms food is easily obtained is suitable
The opposite kind is unsuitable 
 Speech that included in the thirtytwo kinds of aimless talk is unsuitable for it leads to the disappearance of the sign
But talk based on the ten examples of talk is suitable though even that should be discussed with moderation 
Person one not given to aimless talk who has the special qualities of virtue etc by acquaintanceship with whom the unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or the concentrated mind becomes more so is suitable
One who is much concerned with his body who is addicted to aimless talk is unsuitable
for he only creates disturbances like muddy water added to clear water And it was owing to one such as this that the attainments of the young bhikkhu who lived at Koṭapabbata vanished not to mention the sign
Food Sweet food suits one sour food another
Climate a cool climate suits one a warm one another
So when he finds that by using certain food or by living in a certain climate he is comfortable or his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind becomes more so then that food or that climate is suitable
Any other food or climate is unsuitable
Postures walking suits one standing or sitting or lying down suits another
So he should try them like the abode for three days each and that posture is suitable in which his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind becomes more so
Any other should be understood as unsuitable
So he should avoid the seven unsuitable kinds and cultivate the suitable
For when he practices in this way assiduously cultivating the sign then he need not wait too long until absorption shall his wish fulfil 
However if this does not happen while he is practicing in this way then he should have recourse to the ten kinds of skill in absorption
Here is the method Skill in absorption needs to be dealt with in ten aspects making the basis clean maintaining balanced faculties skill in the sign he exerts the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted he restrains the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained he encourages the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged he looks on at the mind with equanimity when it should be looked on at with equanimity avoidance of unconcentrated persons cultivation of concentrated persons resoluteness upon that 
 Herein making the basis clean is cleansing the internal and the external basis
For when his head hair nails and body hair are long or when the body is soaked with sweat then the internal basis is unclean and unpurified
But when an old dirty smelly robe is worn or when the lodging is dirty then the external basis is unclean and unpurified
When the internal and external bases are unclean then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness concomitants that arise is unpurified like the light of a lamps flame that arises with an unpurified lampbowl wick and oil as its support
formations do not become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with unpurified knowledge and when he devotes himself to his meditation subject it does not come to growth increase and fulfilment
But when the internal and external bases are clean then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants that arise is clean and purified like the light of a lamps flame that arises with a purified lamp bowl wick and oil as its support
formations become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with purified knowledge and as he devotes himself to his meditation subject it comes to growth increase and fulfilment
Maintaining balanced faculties is equalizing the five faculties of faith and the rest
For if his faith faculty is strong and the others weak then the energy faculty cannot perform its function of exerting the mindfulness faculty its function of establishing the concentration faculty its function of not distracting and the understanding faculty its function of seeing So in that case the faith faculty should be modified either by reviewing the individual essences of the states concerned that is the objects of attention or by not giving them attention in the way in which the faith faculty became too strong
And this is illustrated by the story of the Elder Vakkali 
Then if the energy faculty is too strong the faith faculty cannot perform its function of resolving nor can the rest of the faculties perform their several functions So in that case the energy faculty should be modified by developing tranquillity and so on
And this should be illustrated by the story of the Elder Soṇa 
So too with the rest for it should be understood that when anyone of them is too strong the others cannot perform their several functions
However what is particularly recommended is balancing faith with understanding and concentration with energy
For one strong in faith and weak in understanding has confidence uncritically and groundlessly
One strong in understanding and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as hard to cure as one sick of a disease caused by medicine
With the balancing of the two a man has confidence only when there are grounds for it
Then idleness overpowers one strong in concentration and weak in energy since concentration favours idleness
Agitation overpowers one strong in energy and weak in concentration since energy favours agitation
But concentration coupled with energy cannot lapse into idleness
and energy coupled with concentration cannot lapse into agitation So these two should be balanced
for absorption comes with the balancing of the two
Again concentration and faith should be balanced One working on concentration needs strong faith
since it is with such faith and confidence that he reaches absorption
Then there is balancing of concentration and understanding One working on concentration needs strong unification
since that is how he reaches absorption
and one working on insight needs strong understanding
since that is how he reaches penetration of characteristics
but with the balancing of the two he reaches absorption as well
Strong mindfulness however is needed in all instances
for mindfulness protects the mind from lapsing into agitation through faith energy and understanding which favour agitation and from lapsing into idleness through concentration which favours idleness So it is as desirable in all instances as a seasoning of salt in all sauces as a prime minister in all the kings business
Hence it is said in the commentaries  And mindfulness has been called universal by the Blessed One
For what reason
Because the mind has mindfulness as its refuge and mindfulness is manifested as protection and there is no exertion and restraint of the mind without mindfulness 
Skill in the sign is skill in producing the as yet unproduced sign of unification of mind through the earth kasiṇa etc and it is skill in developing the sign when produced and skill in protecting the sign when obtained by development The last is what is intended here
How does he exert the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted
When his mind is slack with overlaxness of energy etc then instead of developing the three enlightenment factors beginning with tranquillity he should develop those beginning with investigationofstates
For this is said by the Blessed One
Bhikkhus suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up and he put wet grass on it put wet cowdung on it put wet sticks on it sprinkled it with water and scattered dust on it would that man be able to make the small fire burn up
No venerable sir
So too bhikkhus when the mind is slack that is not the time to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor or the equanimity enlightenment factor
Why is that
Because a slack mind cannot well be roused by those states
When the mind is slack that is the time to develop the investigationofstates enlightenment factor the energy enlightenment factor and the happiness enlightenment factor
Why is that
Because a slack mind can well be roused by those states
Bhikkhus suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up and he put dry grass on it put dry cowdung on it put dry sticks on it blew on it with his mouth and did not scatter dust on it would that man be able to make that small fire burn up
Yes venerable sir 
And here the development of the investigationofstates enlightenment factor etc should be understood as the nutriment for each one respectively
for this is said
Bhikkhus there are profitable and unprofitable states reprehensible and blameless states inferior and superior states dark and bright states the counterpart of each other
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen investigationofstates enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen investigationofstates enlightenment factor
Likewise Bhikkhus there is the element of initiative the element of launching and the element of persistence
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen energy enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen energy enlightenment factors
Likewise Bhikkhus there are states productive of the happiness enlightenment factor
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen happiness enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen happiness enlightenment factor 
Herein wise attention given to the profitable etc is attention occurring in penetration of individual essences and of the three general characteristics
Wise attention given to the element of initiative etc is attention occurring in the arousing of the element of initiative and so on
Herein initial energy is called the element of initiative
The element of launching is stronger than that because it launches out from idleness
The element of persistence is still stronger than that because it goes on persisting in successive later stages
States productive of the happiness enlightenment factor is a name for happiness itself
and attention that arouses that is wise attention
There are besides seven things that lead to the arising of the investigation ofstates enlightenment factor asking questions making the basis clean balancing the faculties avoidance of persons without understanding cultivation of persons with understanding reviewing the field for the exercise of profound knowledge resoluteness upon that investigation of states
Eleven things lead to the arising of the energy enlightenment factor reviewing the fearfulness of the states of loss such as the hell realms etc seeing benefit in obtaining the mundane and supramundane distinctions dependent on energy reviewing the course of the journey to be travelled thus The path taken by the Buddhas Paccekabuddhas and the great disciples has to be taken by me and it cannot be taken by an idler being a credit to the alms food by producing great fruit for the givers reviewing the greatness of the Master thus My Master praises the energetic and this unsurpassable Dispensation that is so helpful to us is honoured in the practice not otherwise reviewing the greatness of the heritage thus It is the great heritage called the Good Dhamma that is to be acquired by me and it cannot be acquired by an idler removing stiffness and torpor by attention to perception of light change of postures frequenting the open air etc avoidance of idle persons cultivation of energetic persons reviewing the right endeavours resoluteness upon that energy
Eleven things lead to the arising of the happiness enlightenment factor the recollections of the Buddha of the Dhamma of the Sangha of virtue of generosity and of deities the recollection of peace avoidance of rough persons cultivation of refined persons reviewing encouraging discourses resoluteness upon that happiness
So by arousing these things in these ways he develops the investigationof states enlightenment factor and the others
This is how he exerts the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted
How does he restrain the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained
When his mind is agitated through overenergeticness etc then instead of developing the three enlightenment factors beginning with investigationof states he should develop those beginning with tranquillity
for this is said by the Blessed One
Bhikkhus suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire and he put dry grass on it  and did not scatter dust on it would that man be able to extinguish that great mass of fire
No venerable sir
So too bhikkhus when the mind is agitated that is not the time to develop the investigationofstates enlightenment factor the energy enlightenment factor or the happiness enlightenment factor
Why is that
Because an agitated mind cannot well be quieted by those states
When the mind is agitated that is the time to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor and the equanimity enlightenment factor
Why is that
Because an agitated mind can well be quieted by those states 
Bhikkhus suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire and he put wet grass on it  and scattered dust on it would that man be able to extinguish that great mass of fire
Yes venerable sir 
And here the development of the tranquillity enlightenment factor etc should be understood as the nutriment for each one respectively
for this is said
Bhikkhus there is bodily tranquillity and mental tranquillity
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen tranquillity enlightenment factor or leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen tranquillity enlightenment factor
Likewise Bhikkhus there is the sign of serenity the sign of nondiversion
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen concentration enlightenment factor or it leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen concentration enlightenment factor
Likewise Bhikkhus there are states productive of the equanimity enlightenment factor
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen equanimity enlightenment factor or it leads to the growth fulfilment development and perfection of the arisen equanimity enlightenment factor 
Herein wise attention given to the three instances is attention occurring in arousing tranquillity etc by observing the way in which they arose in him earlier
The sign of serenity is a term for serenity itself
and nondiversion is a term for that too in the sense of nondistraction
There are besides seven things that lead to the arising of the tranquillity enlightenment factor using superior food living in a good climate maintaining a pleasant posture keeping to the middle avoidance of violent persons cultivation of persons tranquil in body resoluteness upon that tranquillity
Eleven things lead to the arising of the concentration enlightenment factor making the basis clean skill in the sign balancing the faculties restraining the mind on occasion exerting the mind on occasion encouraging the listless mind by means of faith and a sense of urgency looking on with equanimity at what is occurring rightly avoidance of unconcentrated persons cultivation of concentrated persons reviewing of the jhānas and liberations resoluteness upon that concentration
Five things lead to the arising of the equanimity enlightenment factor maintenance of neutrality towards living beings maintenance of neutrality towards formations  avoidance of persons who show favouritism towards beings and formations cultivation of persons who maintain neutrality towards beings and formations resoluteness upon that equanimity
So by arousing these things in these ways he develops the tranquillity enlightenment factor as well as the others
This is how he restrains the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained
How does he encourage the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged
When his mind is listless owing to sluggishness in the exercise of understanding or to failure to attain the bliss of peace then he should stimulate it by reviewing the eight grounds for a sense of urgency
These are the four namely birth aging sickness and death with the suffering of the states of loss as the fifth and also the suffering in the past rooted in the round of rebirths the suffering in the future rooted in the round of rebirths and the suffering in the present rooted in the search for nutriment
And he creates confidence by recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
This is how he encourages the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged
How does he look on at the mind with equanimity on an occasion when it should be looked on at with equanimity
When he is practicing in this way and his mind follows the road of serenity occurs evenly on the object and is unidle unagitated and not listless then he is not interested to exert or restrain or encourage it he is like a charioteer when the horses are progressing evenly
This is how he looks on at the mind with equanimity on an occasion when it should be looked on at with equanimity
 Avoidance of unconcentrated persons is keeping far away from persons who have never trodden the way of renunciation who are busy with many affairs and whose hearts are distracted
Cultivation of concentrated persons is approaching periodically persons who have trodden the way of renunciation and obtained concentration
Resoluteness upon that is the state of being resolute upon concentration the meaning is giving concentration importance tending leaning and inclining to concentration
This is how the tenfold skill in concentration should be undertaken
Any man who acquires this sign This tenfold skill will need to heed
In order for absorption to gain Thus achieving his bolder goal
But if in spite of his efforts No result comes that might requite
His work still a wise wight persists Never this task relinquishing
Since a tiro if he gives up Thinking not to continue in
The task never gains distinction Here no matter how small at all
A man wise in temperament Notices how his mind inclines
Energy and serenity Always he couples each to each
Now his mind seeing that it holds back He prods now the restraining rein
Tightening seeing it pull too hard Guiding with even pace the race
Wellcontrolled bees get the pollen Wellbalanced efforts meet to treat
Leaves thread and ships and oiltubes too Gain thus not otherwise the prize
Let him set aside this lax Also this agitated state
Steering here his mind at the sign As the bee and the rest suggest
Here is the explanation of the meaning When a too clever bee learns that a flower on a tree is blooming it sets out hurriedly overshoots the mark turns back and arrives when the pollen is finished
and another not clever enough bee who sets out with too slow a speed arrives when the pollen is finished too
but a clever bee sets out with balanced speed arrives with ease at the cluster of flowers takes as much pollen as it pleases and enjoys the honeydew
Again when a surgeons pupils are being trained in the use of the scalpel on a lotus leaf in a dish of water one who is too clever applies the scalpel hurriedly and either cuts the lotus leaf in two or pushes it under the water
and another who is not clever enough does not even dare to touch it with the scalpel for fear of cutting it in two or pushing it under
but one who is clever shows the scalpel stroke on it by means of a balanced effort and being good at his craft he is rewarded on such occasions
Again when the king announces Anyone who can draw out a spiders thread four fathoms long shall receive four thousand one man who is too clever breaks the spiders thread here and there by pulling it hurriedly
and another who is not clever enough does not dare to touch it with his hand for fear of breaking it
but a clever man pulls it out starting from the end with a balanced effort winds it on a stick and so wins the prize
Again a too clever skipper hoists full sails in a high wind and sends his ship adrift
and another not clever enough skipper lowers his sails in a light wind and remains where he is
but a clever skipper hoists full sails in a light wind takes in half his sails in a high wind and so arrives safely at his desired destination
Again when a teacher says Anyone who fills the oiltube without spilling any oil will win a prize one who is too clever fills it hurriedly out of greed for the prize and he spills the oil
and another who is not clever enough does not dare to pour the oil at all for fear of spilling it
but one who is clever fills it with a balanced effort and wins the prize
Just as in these five similes so too when the sign arises one bhikkhu forces his energy thinking I shall soon reach absorption Then his mind lapses into agitation because of his minds overexerted energy and he is prevented from reaching absorption
Another who sees the defect in overexertion slacks off his energy thinking What is absorption to me now Then his mind lapses into idleness because of his minds too lax energy and he too is prevented from reaching absorption
Yet another who frees his mind from idleness even when it is only slightly idle and from agitation when only slightly agitated confronting the sign with balanced effort reaches absorption One should be like the lastnamed
It was with reference to this meaning that it was said above
Wellcontrolled bees get the pollen Wellbalanced efforts meet to treat
Leaves thread and ships and oiltubes too Gain thus not otherwise the prize
Let him set aside then this lax Also this agitated state
Steering here his mind at the sign As the bee and the rest suggest
So while he is guiding his mind in this way confronting the sign then knowing Now absorption will succeed there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the occurrence of consciousness as lifecontinuum and evoked by the constant repeating of earth earth
After that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object
the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere The rest are of the sense sphere
but they have stronger applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss and unification of mind than the normal ones They are called preliminary work consciousnesses because they are the preliminary work for absorption and they are also called access consciousnesses because of their nearness to absorption because they happen in its neighbourhood just as the words village access and city access are used for a place near to a village etc and they are also called conformity consciousnesses because they conform to those that precede the preliminary work consciousnesses and to the absorption that follows
And the last of these is also called change oflineage because it transcends the limited sensesphere lineage and brings into being the exalted finematerialsphere lineage 
But omitting repetitions then either the first is the preliminary work the second access the third conformity and the fourth changeoflineage
or else the first is access the second conformity and the third changeof lineage Then either the fourth in the latter case or the fifth in the former case is the absorption consciousness
For it is only either the fourth or the fifth that fixes in absorption And that is according as there is swift or sluggish direct knowledge 
Beyond that impulsion lapses
and the lifecontinuum takes over
But the Abhidhamma scholar the Elder Godatta quoted this text Preceding profitable states are a condition as repetition condition for succeeding profitable states  Adding It is owing to the repetition condition that each succeeding state is strong so there is absorption also in the sixth and seventh  That is rejected by the commentaries with the remark that it is merely that elders opinion
adding that It is only either in the fourth or the fifth that there is absorption
Beyond that impulsion lapses It is said to do so because of nearness of the lifecontinuum
And that has been stated in this way after consideration so it cannot be rejected
For just as a man who is running towards a precipice and wants to stop cannot do so when he has his foot on the edge but falls over it so there can be no fixing in absorption in the sixth or the seventh because of the nearness to the lifecontinuum
That is why it should be understood that there is absorption only in the fourth or the fifth
But that absorption is only of a single conscious moment
For there are seven instances in which the normal extent of the cognitive series does not apply They are in the cases of the first absorption the mundane kinds of direct knowledge the four paths fruition next after the path lifecontinuum jhāna in the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception as condition for cessation of perception and feeling and the fruition attainment in one emerging from cessation
Here the fruition next after the path does not exceed three consciousnesses in number
the consciousnesses of the base consisting of neither perception nor non perception as condition for cessation do not exceed two in number there is no measure of the number of consciousnesses in the lifecontinuum in the fine material and immaterial kinds of becoming
In the remaining instances the number of consciousnesses is one only
So absorption is of a single consciousness moment
After that it lapses into the lifecontinuum
Then the lifecontinuum is interrupted by adverting for the purpose of reviewing the jhāna next to which comes the reviewing of the jhāna
THE FIRST JHNA At this point Quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with happiness and bliss born of seclusion 
and so he has attained the first jhāna which abandons five factors possesses five factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa
Herein quite secluded from sense desires means having secluded himself from having become without having gone away from sense desires
Now this word quite should be understood to have the meaning of absoluteness
Precisely because it has the meaning of absoluteness it shows how on the actual occasion of entering upon and dwelling in the first jhāna sense desires as well as being nonexistent then are the first jhānas contrary opposite and it also shows that the arrival takes place only through the letting go of sense desires
How
When absoluteness is introduced thus quite secluded from sense desires what is expressed is this sense desires are certainly incompatible with this jhāna when they exist it does not occur just as when there is darkness there is no lamplight
and it is only by letting go of them that it is reached just as the further bank is reached only by letting go of the near bank
That is why absoluteness is introduced
Here it might be asked But why is this word quite mentioned only in the first phrase and not in the second How is this might he enter upon and dwell in the first jhāna even when not secluded from unprofitable things
It should not be regarded in that way
It is mentioned in the first phrase as the escape from them
for this jhāna is the escape from sense desires since it surmounts the sensedesire element and since it is incompatible with greed for sense desires
according as it is said The escape from sense desires is this that is to say renunciation 
But in the second phrase the word eva should be adduced and taken as said as in the passage Bhikkhus only here is there an ascetic here a second ascetic 
For it is impossible to enter upon and dwell in jhāna unsecluded also from unprofitable things in other words the hindrances other than that sense desire
So this word must be read in both phrases thus Quite secluded from sense desires quite secluded from unprofitable things
And although the word secluded as a general term includes all kinds of seclusion that is to say seclusion by substitution of opposites etc and bodily seclusion etc still only the three namely bodily seclusion mental seclusion and seclusion by suppression should be regarded here
But this term sense desires should be regarded as including all kinds that is to say sense desires as object as given in the Niddesa in the passage beginning What are sense desires as object They are agreeable visible objects   and the sense desires as defilement given there too and in the Vibhaṅga thus Zeal as sense desire  greed as sense desire zeal and greed as sense desire thinking as sense desire greed as sense desire thinking and greed as sense desire 
That being so the words quite secluded from sense desires properly mean quite secluded from sense desires as object and express bodily seclusion
while the words secluded from unprofitable things properly mean secluded from sense desires as defilement or from all unprofitable things and express mental seclusion
And in this case giving up of pleasure in sense desires is indicated by the first since it only expresses seclusion from sense desires as object while acquisition of pleasure in renunciation is indicated by the second since it expresses seclusion from sense desire as defilement
And with sense desires as object and sense desires as defilement expressed in this way it should also be recognized that the abandoning of the objective basis for defilement is indicated by the first of these two phrases and the abandoning of the subjective defilement by the second
also that the giving up of the cause of cupidity is indicated by the first and the giving up of the cause of stupidity by the second
also that the purification of ones occupation is indicated by the first and the educating of ones inclination by the second
This firstly is the method here when the words from sense desires are treated as referring to sense desires as object
But if they are treated as referring to sense desires as defilement then it is simply just zeal for sense desires in the various forms of zeal  greed  etc that is intended as sense desires 
And although that lust is also included by the word unprofitable it is nevertheless stated separately in the Vibhaṅga in the way beginning Herein what are sense desires Zeal as sense desire  because of its incompatibility with jhāna
Or alternatively it is mentioned in the first phrase because it is sense desire as defilement and in the second phrase because it is included in the unprofitable
And because this lust has various forms therefore from sense desires is said instead of from sense desire 
And although there may be unprofitableness in other states as well nevertheless only the hindrances are mentioned subsequently in the Vibhaṅga thus Herein what states are unprofitable Lust   etc in order to show their opposition to and incompatibility with the jhāna factors
For the hindrances are the contrary opposites of the jhāna factors what is meant is that the jhāna factors are incompatible with them eliminate them abolish them
And it is said accordingly in the Peṭaka  Concentration is incompatible with lust happiness with ill will applied thought with stiffness and torpor bliss with agitation and worry and sustained thought with uncertainty 
So in this case it should be understood that seclusion by suppression of lust is indicated by the phrase quite secluded from sense desires
and seclusion by suppression of all five hindrances by the phrase secluded from unprofitable things But omitting repetitions that of lust is indicated by the first and that of the remaining hindrances by the second
Similarly with the three unprofitable roots that of greed which has the five cords of sense desire as its province is indicated by the first and that of hate and delusion which have as their respective provinces the various grounds for annoyance  etc by the second
Or with the states consisting of the floods etc that of the flood of sense desires of the bond of sense desires of the canker of sense desires of sensedesire clinging of the bodily tie of covetousness and of the fetter of greed for sense desires is indicated by the first and that of the remaining floods bonds cankers clingings ties and fetters is indicated by the second
Again that of craving and of what is associated with craving is indicated by the first and that of ignorance and of what is associated with ignorance is indicated by the second
Furthermore that of the eight thought arisings associated with greed is indicated by the first and that of the remaining kinds of unprofitable thoughtarisings is indicated by the second
This in the first place is the explanation of the meaning of the words quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things 
So far the factors abandoned by the jhāna have been shown And now in order to show the factors associated with it which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought is said
Herein applied thinking is applied thought  hitting upon is what is meant
It has the characteristic of directing the mind on to an object  Its function is to strike at and thresh
for the meditator is said in virtue of it to have the object struck at by applied thought threshed by applied thought
It is manifested as the leading of the mind onto an object
Sustained thinking is sustained thought  continued sustainment  is what is meant
It has the characteristic of continued pressure on the object Its function is to keep conascent mental states occupied with that It is manifested as keeping consciousness anchored on that object
And though sometimes not separate applied thought is the first impact of the mind in the sense that it is both gross and inceptive like the striking of a bell
Sustained thought is the act of keeping the mind anchored in the sense that it is subtle with the individual essence of continued pressure like the ringing of the bell
Applied thought intervenes being the interference of consciousness at the time of first arousing thought like a birds spreading out its wings when about to soar into the air and like a bees diving towards a lotus when it is minded to follow up the scent of it
The behaviour of sustained thought is quiet being the near noninterference of consciousness like the birds planing with outspread wings after soaring into the air and like the bees buzzing above the lotus after it has dived towards it
In the commentary to the Book of Twos this is said Applied thought occurs as a state of directing the mind onto an object like the movement of a large bird taking off into the air by engaging the air with both wings and forcing them downwards For it causes absorption by being unified
Sustained thought occurs with the individual essence of continued pressure like the birds movement when it is using its wings for the purpose of keeping hold on the air For it keeps pressing the object That fits in with the latters occurrence as anchoring
This difference of theirs becomes evident in the first and second jhānas in the fivefold reckoning
Furthermore applied thought is like the hand that grips firmly and sustained thought is like the hand that rubs when one grips a tarnished metal dish firmly with one hand and rubs it with powder and oil and a woollen pad with the other hand
Likewise when a potter has spun his wheel with a stroke on the stick and is making a dish  his supporting hand is like applied thought and his hand that moves back and forth is like sustained thought
Likewise when one is drawing a circle the pin that stays fixed down in the centre is like applied thought which directs onto the object and the pin that revolves round it is like sustained thought which continuously presses
So this jhāna occurs together with this applied thought and this sustained thought and it is called accompanied by applied and sustained thought as a tree is called accompanied by flowers and fruits
But in the Vibhaṅga the teaching is given in terms of a person in the way beginning He is possessed fully possessed of this applied thought and this sustained thought 
The meaning should be regarded in the same way there too
Born of seclusion here secludedness is seclusion  the meaning is disappearance of hindrances
Or alternatively it is secluded  thus it is seclusion the meaning is the collection of states associated with the jhāna is secluded from hindrances
Born of seclusion is born of or in that kind of seclusion
Happiness and bliss it refreshes  thus it is happiness 
It has the characteristic of endearing  Its function is to refresh the body and the mind or its function is to pervade  It is manifested as elation
But it is of five kinds as minor happiness momentary happiness showering happiness uplifting happiness and pervading happiness
Herein minor happiness is only able to raise the hairs on the body
Momentary happiness is like flashes of lightning at different moments
Showering happiness breaks over the body again and again like waves on the sea shore
Uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body and make it spring up into the air
For this was what happened to the Elder MahāTissa resident at Puṇṇavallika He went to the shrine terrace on the evening of the fullmoon day Seeing the moonlight he faced in the direction of the Great Shrine at Anurādhapura thinking At this very hour the four assemblies are worshipping at the Great Shrine By means of objects formerly seen there he aroused uplifting happiness with the Enlightened One as object and he rose into the air like a painted ball bounced off a plastered floor and alighted on the terrace of the Great Shrine
And this was what happened to the daughter of a clan in the village of Vattakālaka near the Girikaṇḍaka Monastery when she sprang up into the air owing to strong uplifting happiness with the Enlightened One as object
As her parents were about to go to the monastery in the evening it seems in order to hear the Dhamma  they told her My dear you are expecting a child you cannot go out at an unsuitable time We shall hear the Dhamma and gain merit for you  So they went out
And though she wanted to go too she could not well object to what they said She stepped out of the house onto a balcony and stood looking at the kāsacetiya Shrine at Girikaṇḍaka lit by the moon She saw the offering of lamps at the shrine and the four communities as they circumambulated it to the right after making their offerings of flowers and perfumes and she heard the sound of the massed recital by the Community of Bhikkhus
Then she thought How lucky they are to be able to go to the monastery and wander round such a shrine terrace and listen to such sweet preaching of Dhamma Seeing the shrine as a mound of pearls and arousing uplifting happiness
she sprang up into the air and before her parents arrived she came down from the air into the shrine terrace where she paid homage and stood listening to the Dhamma
When her parents arrived they asked her What road did you come by
She said I came through the air not by the road and when they told her My dear those whose cankers are destroyed come through the air But how did you come  she replied As I was standing looking at the shrine in the moonlight a strong sense of happiness arose in me with the Enlightened One as its object
Then I knew no more whether I was standing or sitting but only that I was springing up into the air with the sign that I had grasped and I came to rest on this shrine terrace 
So uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body make it spring up into the air
But when pervading happiness arises the whole body is completely pervaded like a filled bladder like a rock cavern invaded by a huge inundation
Now this fivefold happiness when conceived and matured perfects the twofold tranquillity that is bodily and mental tranquillity
When tranquillity is conceived and matured it perfects the twofold bliss that is bodily and mental bliss
When bliss is conceived and matured it perfects the threefold concentration that is momentary concentration access concentration and absorption concentration
Of these what is intended in this context by happiness is pervading happiness which is the root of absorption and comes by growth into association with absorption
But as to the other word pleasing is bliss  Or alternatively it thoroughly devours  consumes  bodily and mental affliction thus it is bliss  It has gratifying as its characteristic Its function is to intensify associated states It is manifested as aid
And wherever the two are associated happiness is the contentedness at getting a desirable object
and bliss is the actual experiencing of it when got
Where there is happiness there is bliss 
but where there is bliss there is not necessarily happiness
Happiness is included in the formations aggregate
bliss is included in the feeling aggregate
If a man exhausted in a desert saw or heard about a pond on the edge of a wood he would have happiness
if he went into the woods shade and used the water he would have bliss
And it should be understood that this is said because they are obvious on such occasions
Accordingly this happiness and this bliss are of this jhāna or in this jhāna so in this way this jhāna is qualified by the words with happiness and bliss and also born of seclusion
Or alternatively the words happiness and bliss can be taken as the happiness and the bliss independently like the Dhamma and the Discipline 
and so then it can be taken as seclusionborn happinessandbliss of this jhāna or in this jhāna so in this way it is the happiness and bliss rather than the jhāna that are born of seclusion
For just as the words born of seclusion can as at  be taken as qualifying the word jhāna so too they can be taken here as at  as qualifying the expression happiness and bliss and then that total expression is predicated of this jhāna So it is also correct to call happinessandbliss bornofseclusion a single expression
In the Vibhaṅga it is stated in the way beginning This bliss accompanied by this happiness 
The meaning should be regarded in the same way there too
First jhāna this will be explained below 
Enters upon  arrives at reaches is what is meant
or else taking it as makes enter  then producing is what is meant
In the Vibhaṅga this is said Enters upon the gaining the regaining the reaching the arrival at the touching the realizing of the entering upon 
the meaning of which should be regarded in the same way
And dwells in  by becoming possessed of jhāna of the kind described above through dwelling in a posture favourable to that jhāna he produces a posture a procedure a keeping an enduring a lasting a behaviour a dwelling of the person
For this is said in the Vibhaṅga Dwells in poses proceeds keeps endures lasts behaves dwells hence dwells is said 
Now it was also said above which abandons five factors possesses five factors  Herein the abandoning of the five factors should be understood as the abandoning of these five hindrances namely lust ill will stiffness and torpor agitation and worry and uncertainty
for no jhāna arises until these have been abandoned
and so they are called the factors of abandoning
For although other unprofitable things too are abandoned at the moment of jhāna still only these are specifically obstructive to jhāna
The mind affected through lust by greed for varied objective fields does not become concentrated on an object consisting in unity
or being overwhelmed by lust it does not enter on the way to abandoning the sensedesire element
When pestered by ill will towards an object it does not occur uninterruptedly
When overcome by stiffness and torpor it is unwieldy
When seized by agitation and worry it is unquiet and buzzes about
When stricken by uncertainty it fails to mount the way to accomplish the attainment of jhāna
So it is these only that are called factors of abandoning because they are specifically obstructive to jhāna
But applied thought directs the mind onto the object sustained thought keeps it anchored there Happiness produced by the success of the effort refreshes the mind whose effort has succeeded through not being distracted by those hindrances and bliss intensifies it for the same reason
Then unification aided by this directing onto this anchoring this refreshing and this intensifying evenly and rightly centres the mind with its remaining associated states on the object consisting in unity Consequently possession of five factors should be understood as the arising of these five namely applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss and unification of mind
For it is when these are arisen that jhāna is said to be arisen
which is why they are called the five factors of possession
Therefore it should not be assumed that the jhāna is something other which possesses them
But just as The army with the four factors and Music with the five factors and The path with the eight factors  are stated simply in terms of their factors so this too should be understood as stated simply in terms of its factors when it is said to have five factors or possess five factors 
And while these five factors are present also at the moment of access and are stronger in access than in normal consciousness
they are still stronger here than in access and acquire the characteristic of the finematerial sphere
For applied thought arises here directing the mind on to the object in an extremely lucid manner
and sustained thought does so pressing the object very hard
and the happiness and bliss pervade the entire body
Hence it is said And there is nothing of his whole body not permeated by the happiness and bliss born of seclusion 
And unification too arises in the complete contact with the object that the surface of a boxs lid has with the surface of its base This is how they differ from the others
Although unification of mind is not actually listed among these factors in the summary version beginning which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought  nevertheless it is mentioned later in the Vibhaṅga as follows Jhāna it is applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss unification and so it is a factor too
for the intention with which the Blessed One gave the summary is the same as that with which he gave the exposition that follows it
Is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics  the goodness in three ways is in the beginning middle and end
The possession of the ten characteristics should be understood as the characteristics of the beginning middle and end too
Here is the text
Of the first jhāna purification of the way is the beginning intensification of equanimity is the middle and satisfaction is the end Of the first jhāna purification of the way is the beginning how many characteristics has the beginning
The beginning has three characteristics the mind is purified of obstructions to that jhāna because it is purified the mind makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity because it has made way the mind enters into that state
And it is since the mind becomes purified of obstructions and through being purified makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity and having made way enters into that state
that the purification of the way is the beginning of the first jhāna These are the three characteristics of the beginning
Hence it is said The first jhāna is good in the beginning which possesses three characteristics 
Of the first jhāna intensification of equanimity is the middle how many characteristics has the middle
The middle has three characteristics He now looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity he looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity
And in that he now looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified and looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity and looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity
that intensification of equanimity is the middle of the first jhāna These are the three characteristics of the middle
Hence it is said The first jhāna is good in the middle which possesses three characteristics 
Of the first jhāna satisfaction is the end how many characteristics has the end
The end has four characteristics The satisfaction in the sense that there was nonexcess of any of the states arisen therein and the satisfaction in the sense that the faculties had a single function and the satisfaction in the sense that the appropriate energy was effective and the satisfaction in the sense of repetition
are the satisfaction in the end of the first jhāna These are the four characteristics of the end
Hence it is said The first jhāna is good in the end which possesses four characteristics 
Herein purification of the way is access together with its concomitants
Intensification of equanimity is absorption
Satisfaction is reviewing So some comment
But it is said in the text The mind arrived at unity enters into purification of the way is intensified in equanimity and is satisfied by knowledge  and therefore it is from the standpoint within actual absorption that purification of the way firstly should be understood as the approach with intensification of equanimity as the function of equanimity consisting in specific neutrality and satisfaction as the manifestation of clarifying knowledges function in accomplishing nonexcess of states
How
Firstly in a cycle of consciousness in which absorption arises the mind becomes purified from the group of defilements called hindrances that are an obstruction to jhāna
Being devoid of obstruction because it has been purified it makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity
Now it is the absorption concentration itself occurring evenly that is called the sign of serenity
But the consciousness immediately before that reaches that state by way of change in a single continuity  and so it is said that it makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity And it is said that it enters into that state by approaching it through having made way for it
That is why in the first place purification of the way while referring to aspects existing in the preceding consciousness should nevertheless be understood as the approach at the moment of the first jhānas actual arising
Secondly when he has more interest in purifying since there is no need to repurify what has already been purified thus it is said that he looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified
And when he has no more interest in concentrating again what has already made way for serenity by arriving at the state of serenity it is said that he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity
And when he has no more interest in again causing appearance of unity in what has already appeared as unity through abandonment of its association with defilement in making way for serenity it is said that he looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity
That is why intensification of equanimity should be understood as the function of equanimity that consists in specific neutrality
And lastly when equanimity was thus intensified the states called concentration and understanding produced there occurred coupled together without either one exceeding the other And also the five faculties beginning with faith occurred with the single function of deliverance owing to deliverance from the various defilements And also the energy appropriate to that which was favourable to their state of nonexcess and single function was effective And also its repetition occurs at that moment  Now all these four aspects are only produced because it is after seeing with knowledge the various dangers in defilement and advantages in cleansing that satisfiedness purifiedness and clarifiedness ensue accordingly That is the reason why it was said that satisfaction should be understood as the manifestation of clarifying knowledges function in accomplishing nonexcess etc of states 
Herein satisfaction as a function of knowledge is called the end since the knowledge is evident as due to onlooking equanimity
according as it is said He looks on with complete equanimity at the mind thus exerted then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to equanimity Owing to equanimity the mind is liberated from the many sorts of defilements then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to liberation
Because of being liberated these states come to have a single function
then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to development in the sense of the single function 
Now as to the words and so he has attained the first jhāna  of the earth kasiṇa  Here it is first because it starts a numerical series also it is first because it arises first
It is called jhāna because of lighting the object and because of burning up opposition 
The disk of earth is called earth kasiṇa in the sense of entirety and the sign acquired with that as its support and also the jhāna acquired in the earthkasiṇa sign are so called too
So that jhāna should be understood as of the earth kasiṇa in this sense
with reference to which it was said above and so he has attained to the first jhāna  of the earth kasiṇa
When it has been attained in this way the mode of its attainment must be discerned by the meditator as if he were a hairsplitter or a cook
For when a very skilful archer who is working to split a hair actually splits the hair on one occasion he discerns the modes of the position of his feet the bow the bowstring and the arrow thus
I split the hair as I stood thus with the bow thus the bowstring thus the arrow thus
From then on he recaptures those same modes and repeats the splitting of the hair without fail
So too the meditator must discern such modes as that of suitable food etc thus I attained this after eating this food attending on such a person in such a lodging in this posture at this time
In this way when that absorption is lost he will be able to recapture those modes and renew the absorption or while familiarizing himself with it he will be able to repeat that absorption again and again
And just as when a skilled cook is serving his employer he notices whatever he chooses to eat and from then on brings only that sort and so obtains a reward so too this meditator discerns such modes as that of the food etc at the time of the attaining and he recaptures them and reobtains absorption each time it is lost
So he must discern the modes as a hairsplitter or a cook does
And this has been said by the Blessed One
Bhikkhus suppose a wise clever skilful cook set various kinds of sauces before a king or a kings minister such as sour bitter sharp sweet peppery and unpeppery salty and unsalty sauces
then the wise clever skilful cook learned his masters sign thus today this sauce pleased my master or he held out his hand for this one or he took a lot of this one or he praised this one or today the sour kind pleased my master or he held out his hand for the sour kind or he took a lot of the sour kind or he praised the sour kind  or he praised the unsalty kind
then the wise clever skilful cook is rewarded with clothing and wages and presents
Why is that
Because that wise clever skilful cook learned his masters sign in this way
So too bhikkhus here a wise clever skilful bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body as a body  He dwells contemplating feelings as feelings  consciousness as consciousness  mental objects as mental objects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
As he dwells contemplating mental objects as mental objects his mind becomes concentrated his defilements are abandoned He learns the sign of that
Then that wise clever skilful bhikkhu is rewarded with a happy abiding here and now he is rewarded with mindfulness and full awareness
Why is that
Because that wise clever skilful bhikkhu learned his consciousnesss sign 
And when he recaptures those modes by apprehending the sign he just succeeds in reaching absorption but not in making it last
It lasts when it is absolutely purified from states that obstruct concentration
When a bhikkhu enters upon a jhāna without first completely suppressing lust by reviewing the dangers in sense desires etc and without first completely tranquillizing bodily irritability by tranquillizing the body and without first completely removing stiffness and torpor by bringing to mind the elements of initiative etc  and without first completely abolishing agitation and worry by bringing to mind the sign of serenity etc and without first completely purifying his mind of other states that obstruct concentration then that bhikkhu soon comes out of that jhāna again like a bee that has gone into an unpurified hive like a king who has gone into an unclean park
But when he enters upon a jhāna after first completely purifying his mind of states that obstruct concentration then he remains in the attainment even for a whole day like a bee that has gone into a completely purified hive like a king who has gone into a perfectly clean park
Hence the Ancients said
So let him dispel any sensual lust and resentment
Agitation as well and then torpor and doubt as the fifth
There let him find joy with a heart that is glad in seclusion
Like a king in a garden where all and each corner is clean
So if he wants to remain long in the jhāna he must enter upon it after first purifying his mind from obstructive states
EXTENSION OF THE SIGN In order to perfect the development of consciousness he should besides extend the counterpart sign according as acquired
Now there are two planes for extension namely access and absorption
for it is possible to extend it on reaching access and on reaching absorption
But the extending should be done consistently in one or the other
which is why it was said he should besides extend the counterpart sign according as acquired
The way to extend it is thisThe meditator should not extend the sign as a clay bowl or a cake or boiled rice or a creeper or a piece of cloth is extended He should first delimit with his mind successive sizes for the sign according as acquired that is to say one finger two fingers three fingers four fingers and then extend it by the amount delimited just as a ploughman delimits with the plough the area to be ploughed and then ploughs within the area delimited or just as bhikkhus fixing a boundary first observe the marks and then fix it
He should not in fact extend it without having delimited the amount it is to be extended by
After that has been done he can further extend it doing so by delimiting successive boundaries of say a span a ratana  the veranda the surrounding space the monastery and the boundaries of the village the town the district the kingdom and the ocean making the extreme limit the worldsphere or even beyond
Just as young swans first starting to use their wings soar a little distance at a time and by gradually increasing it eventually reach the presence of the moon and sun so too when a bhikkhu extends the sign by successive delimitations in the way described he can extend it up to the limit of the world sphere or even beyond
Then that sign appears to him like an ox hide stretched out with a hundred pegs over the earths ridges and hollows river ravines tracts of scrub and thorns and rocky inequalities in any area to which it has been extended
When a beginner has reached the first jhāna in this sign he should enter upon it often without reviewing it much
For the first jhāna factors occur crudely and weakly in one who reviews it much
Then because of that they do not become conditions for higher endeavour
While he is endeavouring for the unfamiliar higher jhāna he falls away from the first jhāna and fails to reach the second
Hence the Blessed One said
Bhikkhus suppose there were a foolish stupid mountain cow with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains
who thought What if I walked in a direction I never walked in before ate grass I never ate before drank water I never drank before
and without placing her forefoot properly she lifted up her hind foot then she would not walk in the direction she never walked in before or eat the grass she never ate before or drink the water she never drank before
What if I walked in a direction I never walked in before  drank water I never drank before
and also she would not get back safely to the place where she had thought
Why is that
Because that mountain cow was foolish and stupid with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains So too bhikkhus here is a certain foolish stupid bhikkhu with no knowledge of fields and no skill quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things in entering upon and dwelling in the first jhāna which is accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought with happiness and bliss born of seclusion
he does not repeat develop or cultivate that sign or properly establish it He thinks What if with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought I entered upon and dwelt in the second jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of concentration
He is unable with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought to enter upon and dwell in the second jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of concentration
Then he thinks What if quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things I entered upon and dwelt in the first jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of seclusion
He is unable quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things to enter upon and dwell in the first jhāna which is  with happiness and bliss born of seclusion
This bhikkhu is called one who has slipped between the two who has fallen between the two just like the foolish stupid mountain cow with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains  
Therefore he should acquire mastery in the five ways first of all with respect to the first jhāna
Herein these are the five kinds of mastery mastery in adverting mastery in attaining mastery in resolving  mastery in emerging and mastery in reviewing
He adverts to the first jhāna where when and for as long as he wishes he has no difficulty in adverting thus it is mastery in adverting
He attains the first jhāna where  he has no difficulty in attaining thus it is mastery in attaining 
and all the rest should be quoted in detail 
The explanation of the meaning here is this When he emerges from the first jhāna and first of all adverts to the applied thought then next to the adverting that arose interrupting the lifecontinuum either four or five impulsions impel with that applied thought as their object
Then there are two lifecontinuum consciousnesses Then there is adverting with the sustained thought as its object and followed by impulsions in the way just stated When he is able to prolong his conscious process uninterruptedly in this way with the five jhāna factors then his mastery of adverting is successful
But this mastery is found at its acme of perfection in the Blessed Ones Twin Marvel  or for others on the aforesaid occasions
There is no quicker mastery in adverting than that
The venerable MahāMoggallānas ability to enter upon jhāna quickly as in the taming of the royal nāgaserpent Nandopananda  is called mastery in attaining
Ability to remain in jhāna for a moment consisting in exactly a finger snap or exactly ten fingersnaps is called mastery in resolving 
Ability to emerge quickly in the same way is called mastery in emerging
The story of the Elder Buddharakkhita may be told in order to illustrate both these last
Eight years after his admission to the Community that elder was sitting in the midst of thirty thousand bhikkhus possessed of supernormal powers who had gathered to attend upon the sickness of the Elder Mahā Rohanagutta at Therambatthala He saw a royal supaṇṇa swooping down from the sky intending to seize an attendant royal nāgaserpent as he was getting ricegruel accepted for the elder The Elder Buddharakkhita created a rock meanwhile and seizing the royal nāga by the arm he pushed him inside it
The royal supaṇṇa gave the rock a blow and made off
The senior elder remarked Friends if Rakkhita had not been there we should all have been put to shame 
Mastery in reviewing is described in the same way as mastery in adverting
for the reviewing impulsions are in fact those next to the adverting mentioned there 
When he has once acquired mastery in these five ways then on emerging from the now familiar first jhāna he can regard the flaws in it in this way This attainment is threatened by the nearness of the hindrances and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the applied and sustained thought He can bring the second jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the first jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the second
When he has emerged from the first jhāna applied and sustained thought appear gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness while happiness and bliss and unification of mind appear peaceful Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factors and obtaining the peaceful factors knowing now the second jhāna will arise there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the lifecontinuum
After that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere belonging to the second jhāna
The rest are of the sense sphere of the kinds already stated 
THE SECOND JHNA  And at this point With the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and dwells in the second jhāna which has internal confidence and singleness of mind without applied thought without sustained thought with happiness and bliss born of concentration 
and so he has attained the second jhāna which abandons two factors possesses three factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa
Herein with the stilling of applied and sustained thought with the stilling with the surmounting of these two namely applied thought and sustained thought with their nonmanifestation at the moment of the second jhāna is what is meant
Herein although none of the states belonging to the first jhāna exist in the second jhāna
for the contact etc  in the first jhāna are one and here they are another
it should be understood all the same that the phrase with the stilling of applied and sustained thought is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the attaining of the other jhānas beginning with that of the second from the first is effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case
Internal here ones own internal is intended
but that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too with the words internally in oneself 
And since ones own internal is intended the meaning here is this born in oneself generated in ones own continuity
Confidence it is faith that is called confidence
The jhāna has confidence because it is associated with confidence
as a cloth has blue colour because it is associated with blue colour
Or alternatively that jhāna is stated to have confidence because it makes the mind confident with the confidence possessed by it and by stilling the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought
And with this conception of the meaning the word construction must be taken as confidence of mind
But with the firstmentioned conception of the meaning the words of mind must be construed with singleness
Here is the construction of the meaning in that case Unique it comes up  thus it is single  the meaning is it comes up as the superlative the best because it is not overtopped by applied and sustained thought
for the best is called unique in the world
Or it is permissible to say that when deprived of applied and sustained thought it is unique without companion
Or alternatively it evokes associated states thus it is an evoker  the meaning is it arouses
And that is unique in the sense of best and it is an evoker  thus it is a unique evoker  This is a term for concentration
Then since the second jhāna gives existingness to  augments this single thing it gives singleness 
But as this single thing is a minds not a beings or a souls so singleness of mind is said
It might be asked But does not this faith exist in the first jhāna too and also this concentration with the name of the single thing Then why is only this second jhāna said to have confidence and singleness of mind
It may be replied as follows It is because that first jhāna is not fully confident owing to the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought like water ruffled by ripples and wavelets That is why although faith does exist in it it is not called confidence
And there too concentration is not fully evident because of the lack of full confidence That is why it is not called singleness there
But in this second jhāna faith is strong having got a footing in the absence of the impediments of applied and sustained thought and concentration is also evident through having strong faith as its companion That may be understood as the reason why only this jhāna is described in this way
But that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too with the words Confidence is faith having faith trust full confidence
Singleness of mind is steadiness of consciousness  right concentration 
And this commentary on the meaning should not be so understood as to conflict with the meaning stated in that way but on the contrary so as to agree and concur with it
Without applied thought without sustained thought since it has been abandoned by development there is no applied thought in this or of this jhāna thus it is without applied thought
The same explanation applies to sustained thought
Also it is said in the Vibhaṅga So this applied thought and this sustained thought are quieted quietened stilled set at rest set quite at rest done away with quite done away with dried up quite dried up made an end of hence it is said without applied thought without sustained thought 
Here it may be asked Has not this meaning already been established by the words with the stilling of applied and sustained thought
So why is it said again without applied thought without sustained thoughts
It may be replied Yes that meaning has already been established But this does not indicate that meaning Did we not say earlier The phrase with the stilling of applied and sustained thought is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the act of attaining the other jhānas beginning with that of the second from the first is effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case  
Besides this confidence comes about with the act of stilling not the darkness of defilement but the applied and sustained thought
And the singleness comes about not as in access jhāna with the abandoning of the hindrances nor as in the first jhāna with the manifestation of the factors but with the act of stilling the applied and sustained thought So that first clause indicates the cause of the confidence and singleness
In the same way this jhāna is without applied thought and without sustained thought not as in the third and fourth jhānas or as in eyeconsciousness etc with just absence but with the actual act of stilling the applied and sustained thought So that first clause also indicates the cause of the state without applied and sustained thought it does not indicate the bare absence of applied and sustained thought
The bare absence of applied and sustained thought is indicated by this second clause namely without applied thought without sustained thought
Consequently it needs to be stated notwithstanding that the first has already been stated
Born of concentration born of the firstjhāna concentration or born of associated concentration is the meaning
Herein although the first was born of associated concentration too still it is only this concentration that is quite worthy to be called concentration because of its complete confidence and extreme immobility due to absence of disturbance by applied and sustained thought So only this jhāna is called born of concentration and that is in order to recommend it
With happiness and bliss is as already explained
Second second in numerical series
Also second because entered upon second
Then it was also said above which abandons two factors possesses three factors  Herein the abandoning of two factors should be understood as the abandoning of applied thought and sustained thought
But while the hindrances are abandoned at the moment of the access of the first jhāna in the case of this jhāna the applied thought and sustained thought are not abandoned at the moment of its access
It is only at the moment of actual absorption that the jhāna arises without them
Hence they are called its factors of abandoning
Its possession of three factors should be understood as the arising of the three that is happiness bliss and unification of mind
So when it is said in the Vibhaṅga Jhāna confidence happiness bliss unification of mind  this is said figuratively in order to show that jhāna with its equipment
But excepting the confidence this jhāna has literally three factors qua factors that have attained to the characteristic of lighting 
according as it is said What is jhāna of three factors on that occasion It is happiness bliss unification of mind 
The rest is as in the case of the first jhāna
Once this has been obtained in this way and he has mastery in the five ways already described then on emerging from the now familiar second jhāna he can regard the flaws in it thus This attainment is threatened by the nearness of applied and sustained thought Whatever there is in it of happiness of mental excitement proclaims its grossness  and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the happiness so expressed He can bring the third jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the second jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the third
When he has emerged from the second jhāna happiness appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness while bliss and unification appear peaceful
Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors knowing now the third jhāna will arise there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the lifecontinuum
After that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere belonging to the third jhāna The rest are of the kinds already stated 
THE THIRD JHNA  And at this point With the fading away of happiness as well he dwells in equanimity and mindful and fully aware he feels bliss with his body he enters upon and dwells in the third jhāna on account of which the Noble Ones announce He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful 
and so he has attained the third jhāna which abandons one factor possesses two factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa
Herein with the fading away of happiness as well  fading away is distaste for or surmounting of happiness of the kind already described
But the words as well between the two words pītiyā and virāgā have the meaning of a conjunction they conjoin to them either the word stilling or the expression the stilling of applied and sustained thought in the description of the second jhāna
Herein when taken as conjoining stilling the construction to be understood is with the fading away and what is more with the stilling of happiness
With this construction fading away has the meaning of distaste so the meaning can be regarded as with distaste for and with the stilling of happiness
But when taken as conjoining the words stilling of applied and sustained thought then the construction to be understood is with the fading of happiness and further with the stilling of applied and sustained thought
With this construction fading away has the meaning of surmounting so this meaning can be regarded as with the surmounting of happiness and with the stilling of applied and sustained thought 
Of course applied and sustained thought have already been stilled in the second jhāna too However this is said in order to show the path to this third jhāna and in order to recommend it
For when with the stilling of applied and sustained thought is said it is declared that the path to this jhāna is necessarily by the stilling of applied and sustained thought
And just as although mistaken view of individuality etc are not abandoned in the attaining of the third noble path but in the first yet when it is recommended by describing their abandonment thus With the abandoning of the five lower fetters  then it awakens eagerness in those trying to attain that third noble path so too when the stilling of applied and sustained thought is mentioned though they are not actually stilled here but in the second this is a recommendation
Hence the meaning expressed is this With the surmounting of happiness and with the stilling of applied and sustained thought 
He dwells in equanimity it watches things as they arise  thus it is equanimity 
it sees fairly sees without partiality  is the meaning
A possessor of the third jhāna is said to dwell in equanimity since he possesses equanimity that is clear abundant and sound
Equanimity is of ten kinds sixfactored equanimity equanimity as a divine abiding equanimity as an enlightenment factor equanimity of energy equanimity about formations equanimity as a feeling equanimity about insight equanimity as specific neutrality equanimity of jhāna and equanimity of purification
Herein six factored equanimity is a name for the equanimity in one whose cankers are destroyed It is the mode of nonabandonment of the natural state of purity when desirable or undesirable objects of the six kinds come into focus in the six doors described thus Here a bhikkhu whose cankers are destroyed is neither glad nor sad on seeing a visible object with the eye he dwells in equanimity mindful and fully aware 
Equanimity as a divine abiding is a name for equanimity consisting in the mode of neutrality towards beings described thus He dwells intent upon one quarter with his heart endued with equanimity 
Equanimity as an enlightenment factor is a name for equanimity consisting in the mode of neutrality in conascent states described thus He develops the equanimity enlightenment factor depending on relinquishment 
Equanimity of energy is a name for the equanimity otherwise known as neither overstrenuous nor overlax energy described thus From time to time he brings to mind the sign of equanimity 
Equanimity about formations is a name for equanimity consisting in neutrality about apprehending reflexion and composure regarding the hindrances etc described thus How many kinds of equanimity about formations arise through concentration How many kinds of equanimity about formations arise through insight Eight kinds of equanimity about formations arise through concentration Ten kinds of equanimity about formations arise through insight 
Equanimity as a feeling is a name for the equanimity known as neither painnorpleasure described thus On the occasion on which a sensesphere profitable consciousness has arisen accompanied by equanimity 
Equanimity about insight is a name for equanimity consisting in neutrality about investigation described thus What exists what has become that he abandons and he obtains equanimity 
Equanimity as specific neutrality is a name for equanimity consisting in the equal efficiency of conascent states it is contained among the orwhatever states beginning with zeal 
Equanimity of jhāna is a name for equanimity producing impartiality towards even the highest bliss described thus He dwells in equanimity 
Purifying equanimity is a name for equanimity purified of all opposition and so consisting in uninterestedness in stilling opposition described thus The fourth jhāna which  has mindfulness purified by equanimity 
Herein sixfactored equanimity equanimity as a divine abiding equanimity as an enlightenment factor equanimity as specific neutrality equanimity of jhāna and purifying equanimity are one in meaning that is equanimity as specific neutrality
Their difference however is one of position
like the difference in a single being as a boy a youth an adult a general a king and so on
Therefore of these it should be understood that equanimity as an enlightenment factor etc are not found where there is sixfactored equanimity
or that sixfactored equanimity etc are not found where there is equanimity as an enlightenment factor
And just as these have one meaning so also equanimity about formations and equanimity about insight have one meaning too
for they are simply understanding classed in these two ways according to function
Just as when a man has seen a snake go into his house in the evening and has hunted for it with a forked stick and then when he has seen it lying in the grain store and has looked to discover whether it is actually a snake or not and then by seeing three marks has no more doubt and so there is neutrality in him about further investigating whether or not it is a snake so too when a man has begun insight and he sees with insight knowledge the three characteristics then there is neutrality in him about further investigating the impermanence etc of formations and that neutrality is called equanimity about insight
But just as when the man has caught hold of the snake securely with the forked stick and thinks How shall I get rid of the snake without hurting it or getting bitten by it then as he is seeking only the way to get rid of it there is neutrality in him about the catching hold of it
so too when a man through seeking the three characteristics sees the three kinds of becoming as if burning then there is neutrality in him about catching hold of formations and that neutrality is called equanimity about formations
So when equanimity about insight is established equanimity about formations is established too
But it is divided into two in this way according to function in other words according to neutrality about investigating and about catching hold
Equanimity of energy and equanimity as feeling are different both from each other and from the rest
So of these kinds of equanimity it is equanimity of jhāna that is intended here
That has the characteristic of neutrality Its function is to be unconcerned It is manifested as uninterestedness Its proximate cause is the fading away of happiness
Here it may be said Is this not simply equanimity as specific neutrality in the meaning And that exists in the first and second jhānas as well
so this clause He dwells in equanimity ought to be stated of those also Why is it not
It may be replied Because its function is unevident there
since it is overshadowed by applied thought and the rest
But it appears here with a quite evident function with head erect as it were because it is not overshadowed by applied thought and sustained thought and happiness That is why it is stated here
He dwells in equanimity 
the commentary on the meaning of the clause is thus completed in all its aspects
Now as to mindful and fully aware here he remembers  thus he is mindful 
He has full awareness  thus he is fully aware 
This is mindfulness and full awareness stated as personal attributes
Herein mindfulness has the characteristic of remembering Its function is not to forget It is manifested as guarding
Full awareness has the characteristic of nonconfusion Its function is to investigate  It is manifested as scrutiny
Herein although this mindfulness and this full awareness exist in the earlier jhānas as well
for one who is forgetful and not fully aware does not attain even access let alone absorption
yet because of the comparative grossness of those jhānas the minds going is easy there like that of a man on level ground and so the functions of mindfulness and full awareness are not evident in them
But it is only stated here because the subtlety of this jhāna which is due to the abandoning of the gross factors requires that the minds going always includes the functions of mindfulness and full awareness like that of a man on a razors edge
What is more just as a calf that follows a cow returns to the cow when taken away from her if not prevented so too when this third jhāna is led away from happiness it would return to happiness if not prevented by mindfulness and full awareness and would rejoin happiness
And besides beings are greedy for bliss and this kind of bliss is exceedingly sweet since there is none greater
But here there is nongreed for the bliss owing to the influence of the mindfulness and full awareness not for any other reason And so it should also be understood that it is stated only here in order to emphasize this meaning too
Now as to the clause he feels bliss with his body here although in one actually possessed of the third jhāna there is no concern about feeling bliss
nevertheless he would feel the bliss associated with his mental body
and after emerging from the jhāna he would also feel bliss since his material body would have been affected by the exceedingly superior matter originated by that bliss associated with the mental body 
It is in order to point to this meaning that the words he feels bliss with his body are said
Now as to the clause that  on account of which the Noble Ones announce He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful here it is the jhāna on account of which as cause on account of which as reason the Noble Ones that is to say the Enlightened Ones etc announce teach declare establish reveal expound explain clarify that person who possesses the third jhānathey praise is what is intended
Why
Because he dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful
He enters upon and dwells in that third jhāna is how the construction should be understood here
But why do they praise him thus
Because he is worthy of praise
For this man is worthy of praise since he has equanimity towards the third jhāna though it possesses exceedingly sweet bliss and has reached the perfection of bliss and he is not drawn towards it by a liking for the bliss
and he is mindful with the mindfulness established in order to prevent the arising of happiness and he feels with his mental body the undefiled bliss beloved of Noble Ones cultivated by Noble Ones
Because he is worthy of praise in this way it should be understood Noble Ones praise him with the words He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful thus declaring the special qualities that are worthy of praise
Third it is the third in the numerical series and it is third because it is entered upon third
Then it was said which abandons one factor possesses two factors  here the abandoning of the one factor should be understood as the abandoning of happiness
But that is abandoned only at the moment of absorption as applied thought and sustained thought are at that of the second jhāna
hence it is called its factor of abandoning
The possession of the two factors should be understood as the arising of the two namely bliss and unification
So when it is said in the Vibhaṅga Jhāna equanimity mindfulness full awareness bliss unification of mind  this is said figuratively in order to show that jhāna with its equipment
But excepting the equanimity and mindfulness and full awareness this jhāna has literally only two factors qua factors that have attained to the characteristic of lighting 
according as it is said What is the jhāna of two factors on that occasion It is bliss and unification of mind 
The rest is as in the case of the first jhāna
Once this has been obtained in this way and once he has mastery in the five ways already described then on emerging from the now familiar third jhāna he can regard the flaws in it thus This attainment is threatened by the nearness of happiness Whatever there is in it of mental concern about bliss proclaims its grossness  and its factors are weakened by the grossness of the bliss so expressed  He can bring the fourth jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the third jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the fourth
When he has emerged from the third jhāna the bliss in other words the mental joy appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness while the equanimity as feeling and the unification of mind appear peaceful Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors knowing now the fourth jhāna will arise there arises in him minddoor adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object interrupting the lifecontinuum
After that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object the last one of which is an impulsion of the finematerial sphere belonging to the fourth jhāna The rest are of the kinds already stated 
But there is this difference blissful feeling is not a condition as repetition condition for neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling and the preliminary work must be aroused in the case of the fourth jhāna with neither painfulnorpleasant feeling consequently these consciousnesses of the preliminary work are associated with neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
and here happiness vanishes simply owing to their association with equanimity
THE FOURTH JHNA  And at this point With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna which has neitherpainnorpleasure and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity 
and so he has attained the fourth jhāna which abandons one factor possesses two factors is good in three ways possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasiṇa
Herein with the abandoning of pleasure and pain with the abandoning of bodily pleasure and bodily pain
With the previous which took place before not in the moment of the fourth jhāna
Disappearance of joy and grief with the previous disappearance of the two that is mental bliss and mental pain with the abandoning is what is meant
But when does the abandoning of these take place
At the moment of access of the four jhānas
For mental joy is only abandoned at the moment of the fourthjhāna access
while bodily pain mental grief and bodily bliss are abandoned respectively at the moments of access of the first second and third jhānas
So although the order in which they are abandoned is not actually mentioned nevertheless the abandoning of the pleasure pain joy and grief is stated here according to the order in which the faculties are summarized in the Indriya Vibhaṅga 
But if these are only abandoned at the moments of access of the several jhānas why is their cessation said to take place in the jhāna itself in the following passage And where does the arisen pain faculty cease without remainder Here bhikkhus quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna which is  born of seclusion
It is here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder 
Where does the arisen grief faculty cease without remainder  in the second jhāna  Where does the arisen pleasure faculty cease without remainder  in the third jhāna  Where does the arisen joy faculty cease without remainder Here bhikkhus with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna which  has mindfulness purified by equanimity It is here that the arisen joy faculty ceases without remainder  It is said in that way there referring to reinforced cessation
For in the first jhāna etc it is their reinforced cessation not just their cessation that takes place
At the moment of access it is just their cessation not their reinforced cessation that takes place
For accordingly during the first jhāna access which has multiple adverting there could be rearising of the bodily pain faculty due to contact with gadflies flies etc or the discomfort of an uneven seat though that pain faculty had already ceased but not so during absorption
Or else though it has ceased during access it has not absolutely ceased there since it is not quite beaten out by opposition
But during absorption the whole body is showered with bliss owing to pervasion by happiness And the pain faculty has absolutely ceased in one whose body is showered with bliss since it is beaten out then by opposition
And during the secondjhāna access too which has multiple advertings there could be rearising of the mental grief faculty although it had already ceased there because it arises when there is bodily weariness and mental vexation which have applied thought and sustained thought as their condition
but it does not arise when applied and sustained thought are absent
When it arises it does so in the presence of applied and sustained thought and they are not abandoned in the secondjhāna access but this is not so in the second jhāna itself because its conditions are abandoned there
Likewise in the thirdjhāna access there could be rearising of the abandoned bodily pleasure faculty in one whose body was pervaded by the superior materiality originated by the consciousness associated with the happiness But not so in the third jhāna itself
For in the third jhāna the happiness that is a condition for the bodily bliss has ceased entirely
Likewise in the fourthjhāna access there could be rearising of the abandoned mental joy faculty because of its nearness and because it has not been properly surmounted owing to the absence of equanimity brought to absorption strength But not so in the fourth jhāna itself
And that is why in each case the words without remainder are included thus It is here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder 
Here it may be asked Then if these kinds of feeling are abandoned in the access in this way why are they brought in here
It is done so that they can be readily grasped
For the neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling described here by the words which has neitherpainnorpleasure is subtle hard to recognize and not readily grasped So just as when a cattleherd wants to catch a refractory ox that cannot be caught at all by approaching it he collects all the cattle into one pen and lets them out one by one and then he says That is it catch it and so it gets caught as well so too the Blessed One has collected all these five kinds of feeling together so that they can be grasped readily
for when they are shown collected together in this way then what is not bodily pleasure or bodily pain or mental joy or mental grief can still be grasped in this way This is neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling 
Besides this may be understood as said in order to show the condition for the neitherpainfulnorpleasant minddeliverance
For the abandoning of bodily pain etc are conditions for that
according as it is said There are four conditions friend for the attainment of the neitherpainfulnorpleasant mind deliverance
Here friend with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna  equanimity
These are the four conditions for the attainment of the neitherpainfulnorpleasant minddeliverance 
Or alternatively just as although mistaken view of individuality etc have already been abandoned in the earlier paths they are nevertheless mentioned as abandoned in the description of the third path for the purpose of recommending it  so too these kinds of feeling can be understood as mentioned here for the purpose of recommending this jhāna
Or alternatively they can be understood as mentioned for the purpose of showing that greed and hate are very far away owing to the removal of their conditions
for of these pleasure is a condition for joy and joy for greed
pain is a condition for grief and grief for hate
So with the removal of pleasure  etc greed and hate are very far away since they are removed along with their conditions
Which has neitherpainnorpleasure no pain owing to absence of pain
no pleasure owing to absence of pleasure 
By this he indicates the third kind of feeling that is in opposition both to pain and to pleasure not the mere absence of pain and pleasure
This third kind of feeling named neitherpainnorpleasure is also called equanimity
It has the characteristic of experiencing what is contrary to both the desirable and the undesirable Its function is neutral Its manifestation is unevident Its proximate cause should be understood as the cessation of pleasure 
And has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity has purity of mindfulness brought about by equanimity
For the mindfulness in this jhāna is quite purified and its purification is effected by equanimity not by anything else
That is why it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
Also it is said in the Vibhaṅga This mindfulness is cleared purified clarified by equanimity
hence it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity 
And the equanimity due to which there comes to be this purity of mindfulness should be understood as specific neutrality in meaning
And not only mindfulness is purified by it here but also all associated states However the teaching is given under the heading of mindfulness
Herein this equanimity exists in the three lower jhānas too
but just as although a crescent moon exists by day but is not purified or clear since it is outshone by the suns radiance in the daytime or since it is deprived of the night which is its ally owing to gentleness and owing to helpfulness to it so too this crescent moon of equanimity consisting in specific neutrality exists in the first jhāna etc but it is not purified since it is outshone by the glare of the opposing states consisting in applied thought etc and since it is deprived of the night of equanimityasfeeling for its ally
and because it is not purified the conascent mindfulness and other states are not purified either like the unpurified crescent moons radiance by day
That is why no one among these first three jhānas is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
But here this crescent moon consisting in specific neutrality is utterly pure because it is not outshone by the glare of the opposing states consisting in applied thought etc and because it has the night of equanimityasfeeling for its ally
And since it is purified the conascent mindfulness and other states are purified and clear also like the purified crescent moons radiance
That it should be understood is why only this jhāna is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
Fourth it is fourth in numerical series
and it is fourth because it is entered upon fourth
Then it was said which abandons one factor possesses two factors  here the abandoning of the one factor should be understood as the abandoning of joy
But that joy is actually abandoned in the first impulsions of the same cognitive series 
Hence it is called its factor of abandoning
The possession of the two factors should be understood as the arising of the two namely equanimity as feeling and unification of mind
The rest is as stated in the case of the first jhāna
This in the first place is according to the fourfold reckoning of jhāna
When however he is developing fivefold jhāna then on emerging from the now familiar first jhāna he can regard the flaws in it in this way This attainment is threatened by the nearness of the hindrances and its factors are weakened by the grossness of applied thought  He can bring the second jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the first jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the second
Now he emerges from the first jhāna mindfully and fully aware and only applied thought appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors while the sustained thought etc appear peaceful
Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors the second jhāna arises in him in the way already described
Its factor of abandoning is applied thought only
The four beginning with sustained thought are the factors that it possesses
The rest is as already stated
When this has been obtained in this way and once he has mastery in the five ways already described then on emerging from the now familiar second jhāna he can regard the flaws in it in this way This attainment is threatened by the nearness of applied thought and its factors are weakened by the grossness of sustained thought  He can bring the third jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the second jhāna and set about doing what is needed for attaining the third
Now he emerges from the second jhāna mindfully and fully aware only sustained thought appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors while happiness etc appear peaceful
Then as he brings that same sign to mind as earth earth again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors the third jhāna arises in him in the way already described
Its factor of abandoning is sustained thought only The three beginning with happiness as in the second jhāna in the fourfold reckoning are the factors that it possesses
The rest is as already stated
So that which is the second in the fourfold reckoning becomes the second and third in the fivefold reckoning by being divided into two
And those which are the third and fourth in the former reckoning become the fourth and fifth in this reckoning
The first remains the first in each case

called The Description of the Earth Kasiṇa
The fourth chapter
Now ten recollections were listed next after the ten kinds of foulness  As to these Mindfulness itself is recollection because it arises again and again or alternatively the mindfulness that is proper for a clansman gone forth out of faith since it occurs only in those instances where it should occur is recollection  The recollection arisen inspired by the Enlightened One is the recollection of the Buddha This is a term for mindfulness with the Enlightened Ones special qualities as its object
The recollection arisen inspired by the Law is the recollection of the Dhamma  This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of the Laws being well proclaimed etc as its object
The recollection arisen inspired by the Community is the recollection of the Saṅgha This is a term for mindfulness with the Communitys special qualities of being entered on the good way etc as its object
The recollection arisen inspired by virtue is the recollection of virtue This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of virtues untornness etc as its object
The recollection arisen inspired by generosity is the recollection of generosity This is a term for mindfulness with generositys special qualities of free generosity etc as its object
The recollection arisen inspired by deities is the recollection of deities This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of ones own faith etc as its object with deities standing as witnesses
The recollection arisen inspired by death is the recollection of death This is a term for mindfulness with the termination of the life faculty as its object
Mindfulness occupied with the body  it is gone to the material body that is analyzed into head hairs etc or it is gone into the body thus it is bodygone  It is bodygone and it is mindfulness  thus it is bodygone mindfulness  but instead of shortening the vowel thus in the usual way bodygone mindfulness is said This is a term for mindfulness that has as its object the sign of the bodily parts consisting of head hairs and the rest
The mindfulness arisen inspired by breathing is mindfulness of breathing This is a term for mindfulness that has as its object the sign of in breaths and outbreaths
The recollection arisen inspired by peace is the recollection of peace This is a term that has as its object the stilling of all suffering
Now a meditator with absolute confidence who wants to develop firstly the recollection of the Enlightened One among these ten should go into solitary retreat in a favourable abode and recollect the special qualities of the Enlightened One the Blessed One as follows That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished fully enlightened endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct sublime the knower of worlds the incomparable leader of men to be tamed the teacher of gods and men enlightened and blessed 
Here is the way he recollects That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished he is such since he is fully enlightened  he is such since he is blessed he is so for these several reasons is what is meant
Herein what he recollects firstly is that the Blessed One is accomplished for the following reasons because of remoteness  and because of his enemies and the spokes having been destroyed  and because of his worthiness of requisites etc and because of absence of secret evildoing 
 He stands utterly remote and far away from all defilements because he has expunged all trace of defilement by means of the pathbecause of such remoteness he is accomplished 
A man remote indeed we call From something he has not at all
The Saviour too that has no stain May well the name accomplished gain
 And these enemies  these defilements are destroyed by the pathbecause the enemies are thus destroyed he is accomplished also
The enemies that were deployed Greed and the rest have been destroyed 
By his the Helpers wisdoms sword So he is accomplished  all accord
 Now this wheel of the round of rebirths with its hub made of ignorance and of craving for becoming with its spokes consisting of formations of merit and the rest with its rim of ageing and death which is joined to the chariot of the triple becoming by piercing it with the axle made of the origins of cankers  has been revolving throughout time that has no beginning All of this wheels spokes were destroyed by him at the Place of Enlightenment as he stood firm with the feet of energy on the ground of virtue wielding with the hand of faith the axe of knowledge that destroys kamma because the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished also
Or alternatively it is the beginningless round of rebirths that is called the wheel of the round of rebirths
Ignorance is its hub because it is its root
Ageinganddeath is its rim because it terminates it
The remaining ten states of the dependent origination are its spokes because ignorance is their root and ageinganddeath their termination Herein ignorance is unknowing about suffering and the rest
And ignorance in sensual becoming is a condition for formations in sensual becoming Ignorance in finematerial becoming is a condition for formations in finematerial becoming Ignorance in immaterial becoming is a condition for formations in immaterial becoming
Formations in sensual becoming are a condition for rebirthlinking consciousness in sensual becoming And similarly with the rest
Rebirthlinking consciousness in sensual becoming is a condition for mentalitymateriality in sensual becoming Similarly in finematerial becoming
In immaterial becoming it is a condition for mentality only
Mentalitymateriality in sensual becoming is a condition for the sixfold base in sensual becoming Mentalitymateriality in finematerial becoming is a condition for three bases in finematerial becoming Mentality in immaterial becoming is a condition for one base in immaterial becoming
The sixfold base in sensual becoming is a condition for six kinds of contact in sensual becoming Three bases in finematerial becoming are conditions for three kinds of contact in finematerial becoming The mind base alone in immaterial becoming is a condition for one kind of contact in immaterial becoming
The six kinds of contact in sensual becoming are conditions for six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming Three kinds of contact in finematerial becoming are conditions for three kinds of feeling there too One kind of contact in immaterial becoming is a condition for one kind of feeling there too
The six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming are conditions for the six groups of craving in sensual becoming Three in the finematerial becoming are for three there too One kind of feeling in the immaterial becoming is a condition for one group of craving in the immaterial becoming
The craving in the several kinds of becoming is a condition for the clinging there Clinging etc are the respective conditions for becoming and the rest
In what way
Here someone thinks I shall enjoy sense desires and with sense desire clinging as condition he misconducts himself in body speech and mind Owing to the fulfilment of his misconduct he reappears in a state of loss 
The kamma that is the cause of his reappearance there is kamma process becoming the aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirthprocess becoming the generating of the aggregates is birth their maturing is ageing their dissolution is death
Another thinks I shall enjoy the delights of heaven and in the parallel manner he conducts himself well Owing to the fulfilment of his good conduct he reappears in a sensualsphere heaven
The kamma that is the cause of his reappearance there is kammaprocess becoming and the rest as before
Another thinks I shall enjoy the delights of the Brahmāworld and with sensedesire clinging as condition he develops lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity  Owing to the fulfilment of the meditative development he is reborn in the Brahmāworld
The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kammaprocess becoming and the rest is as before
Yet another thinks I shall enjoy the delights of immaterial becoming and with the same condition he develops the attainments beginning with the base consisting of boundless space Owing to the fulfilment of the development he is reborn in one of these states
The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kammaprocess becoming the aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth process becoming the generating of the aggregates is birth their maturing is ageing their dissolution is death 
The remaining kinds of clinging are construable in the same way
So Understanding of discernment of conditions thus Ignorance is a cause formations are causally arisen and both these states are causally arisen is knowledge of the causal relationship of states
Understanding of discernment of conditions thus In the past and in the future ignorance is a cause formations are causally arisen and both these states are causally arisen is knowledge of the causal relationship of states  and all the clauses should be given in detail in this way
Herein ignorance and formations are one summarization consciousness mentalitymateriality the sixfold base contact and feeling are another craving clinging and becoming are another and birth and ageinganddeath are another
Here the first summarization is past the two middle ones are present and birth and ageinganddeath are future
When ignorance and formations are mentioned then also craving clinging and becoming are included too so these five states are the round of kamma in the past The five beginning with consciousness are the round of the kammaresult in the present When craving clinging and becoming are mentioned then also ignorance and formations are included too so these five states are the round of kamma in the present And because the five beginning with consciousness are described under the heading of birth and ageinganddeath these five states are the round of kammaresult in the future
These make twenty aspects in this way
And here there is one link between formations and consciousness one between feeling and craving one between becoming and birth   Now the Blessed One knew saw understood and penetrated in all aspects this dependent origination with its four summarizations its three times its twenty aspects and its three links
Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that Hence it was said Understanding of discernment of conditions is knowledge of the causal relationship of states 
Thus when the Blessed One by correctly knowing these states with knowledge of relations of states became dispassionate towards them when his greed faded away when he was liberated then he destroyed quite destroyed abolished the spokes of this wheel of the round of rebirths of the kind just described
Because the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished also
The spokes of rebirths wheel have been Destroyed with wisdoms weapon keen
By him the Helper of the World And so accomplished he is called
 And he is worthy of the requisites of robes etc and of the distinction of being accorded homage because it is he who is most worthy of offerings
For when a Perfect One has arisen important deities and human beings pay homage to none else
for Brahmā Sahampati paid homage to the Perfect One with a jewelled garland as big as Sineru
and other deities did so according to their means as well as human beings as King Bimbisāra of Magadha and the king of Kosala
And after the Blessed One had finally attained Nibbāna King Asoka renounced wealth to the amount of ninetysix million for his sake and founded eightfour thousand monasteries throughout all Jambudīpa 
And so with all these what need to speak of others Because of worthiness of requisites he is accomplished also
So he is worthy the Helper of the World Of homage paid with requisites the word Accomplished has this meaning in the world Hence the Victor is worthy of that word
 And he does not act like those fools in the world who vaunt their cleverness and yet do evil but in secret for fear of getting a bad name Because of absence of secret evildoing he is accomplished also
No secret evil deed may claim An author so august the name
Accomplished is his deservedly By absence of such secrecy 
So in all ways
The Sage of remoteness unalloyed Vanquished defiling foes deployed
The spokes of rebirths wheel destroyed Worthy of requisites employed
Secret evil he does avoid For these five reasons he may claim This word accomplished for his name
He is fully enlightened because he has discovered all things rightly and by himself 
In fact all things were discovered by him rightly by himself in that he discovered of the things to be directly known that they must be directly known  of the things to be fully understood that they must be fully understood  of the things to be abandoned that they must be abandoned  of the things to be realized that they must be realized  and of the things to be developed that they must be developed 
Hence it is said
What must be directly known is directly known What has to be developed has been developed
What has to be abandoned has been abandoned And that brahman is why I am enlightened 
Besides he has discovered all things rightly by himself step by step thus The eye is the truth of suffering the prior craving that originates it by being its rootcause is the truth of origin the nonoccurrence of both is the truth of cessation the way that is the act of understanding cessation is the truth of the path And so too in the case of the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mind
And the following things should be construed in the same way the six bases beginning with visible objects the six groups of consciousness beginning with eyeconsciousness the six kinds of contact beginning with eyecontact the six kinds of feeling beginning with the eyecontactborn the six kinds of perception beginning with perception of visible objects the six kinds of volition beginning with volition about visible objects the six groups of craving beginning with craving for visible objects the six kinds of applied thought beginning with applied thought about visible objects the six kinds of sustained thought beginning with sustained thought about visible objects the five aggregates beginning with the aggregate of matter the ten kasiṇas the ten recollections the ten perceptions beginning with perception of the bloated the thirtytwo aspects of the body beginning with head hairs the twelve bases the eighteen elements the nine kinds of becoming beginning with sensual becoming the four jhānas beginning with the first the four measureless states beginning with the development of lovingkindness the four immaterial attainments the factors of the dependent origination in reverse order beginning with ageinganddeath and in forward order beginning with ignorance 
Herein this is the construction of a single clause of the dependent origination Ageinganddeath is the truth of suffering birth is the truth of origin the escape from both is the truth of cessation the way that is the act of understanding cessation is the truth of the path In this way he has discovered progressively discovered completely discovered all states rightly and by himself step by step
Hence it was said above He is fully enlightened because he has discovered all things rightly and by himself  
He is endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct vijjācaraṇasampanno  vijjāhi caraṇena ca sampanno 
Herein as to clear vision there are three kinds of clear vision and eight kinds of clear vision
The three kinds should be understood as stated in the Bhayabherava Sutta  and the eight kinds as stated in the Ambattha Sutta 
For there eight kinds of clear vision are stated made up of the six kinds of directknowledge together with insight and the supernormal power of the mindmade body
Virtuous conduct should be understood as fifteen things that is to say restraint by virtue guarding of the sense faculties knowledge of the right amount in eating devotion to wakefulness the seven good states and the four jhānas of the finematerial sphere
For it is precisely by means of these fifteen things that a noble disciple conducts himself that he goes towards the deathless That is why it is called virtuous conduct
according as it is said Here Mahānāma a noble disciple has virtue  etc the whole of which should be understood as given in the Middle Fifty of the Majjhima Nikāya
Now the Blessed One is endowed with these kinds of clear vision and with this conduct as well
hence he is called endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct 
Herein the Blessed Ones possession of clear vision consists in the fulfilment of omniscience 
while his possession of conduct consists in the fulfilment of the great compassion 
He knows through omniscience what is good and harmful for all beings and through compassion he warns them of harm and exhorts them to do good
That is how he is possessed of clear vision and conduct 
which is why his disciples have entered upon the good way instead of entering upon the bad way as the selfmortifying disciples of those who are not possessed of clear vision and conduct have done
He is called sublime  because of a manner of going that is good  because of being gone to an excellent place  because of having gone rightly  and because of enunciating rightly 
 A manner of going is called gone 
and that in the Blessed One is good  purified blameless
But what is that
It is the noble path
for by means of that manner of going he has gone without attachment in the direction of safetythus he is sublime because of a manner of going that is good
 And it is to the excellent place that he has gone  to the deathless Nibbānathus he is sublime also because of having gone to an excellent place
 And he has rightly gone  without going back again to the defilements abandoned by each path
For this is said He does not again turn return go back to the defilements abandoned by the stream entry path thus he is sublime  he does not again turn return go back to the defilements abandoned by the Arahant path thus he is sublime  Or alternatively he has rightly gone from the time of making his resolution at the feet of Dīpaṅkara up till the Enlightenment Session by working for the welfare and happiness of the whole world through the fulfilment of the thirty perfections and through following the right way without deviating towards either of the two extremes that is to say towards eternalism or annihilationism towards indulgence in sense pleasures or selfmortificationthus he is sublime also because of having gone rightly
 And he enunciates rightly  he speaks only fitting speech in the fitting placethus he is sublime also because of enunciating rightly
Here is a sutta that confirms this Such speech as the Perfect One knows to be untrue and incorrect conducive to harm and displeasing and unwelcome to others that he does not speak
And such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct but conducive to harm and displeasing and unwelcome to others that he does not speak
And such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct conducive to good but displeasing and unwelcome to others that speech the Perfect One knows the time to expound
Such speech as the Perfect One knows to be untrue and incorrect and conducive to harm but pleasing and welcome to others that he does not speak
And such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct but conducive to harm though pleasing and welcome to others that he does not speak
And such speech as the Perfect One knows to be true and correct conducive to good and pleasing and welcome to others that speech the Perfect One knows the time to expound 
thus he is sublime also because of enunciating rightly
He is the knower of worlds because he has known the world in all ways
For the Blessed One has experienced known and penetrated the world in all ways to its individual essence its arising its cessation and the means to its cessation
according as it is said Friend that there is a worlds end where one neither is born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor reappears which is to be known or seen or reached by travelthat I do not say Yet I do not say that there is ending of suffering without reaching the worlds end
Rather it is in this fathomlong carcass with its perceptions and its consciousness that I make known the world the arising of the world the cessation of the world and the way leading to the cessation of the world
Tis utterly impossible To reach by travel the worlds end
But there is no escape from pain Until the worlds end has been reached
It is a sage a knower of the worlds
Who gets to the worlds end and it is he Whose life divine is lived out to its term
He is at peace who the worlds end has known
And hopes for neither this world nor the next 
Moreover there are three worlds the world of formations the world of beings and the world of location
Herein in the passage One world all beings subsist by nutriment  the world of formations is to be understood
In the passage The world is eternal or The world is not eternal it is the world of beings
In the passage As far as moon and sun do circulate Shining and lighting up the four directions
Over a thousand times as great a world Your power holds unquestionable sway 
it is the world of location
The Blessed One has known that in all ways too
Likewise because of the words One world all beings subsist by nutriment
Two worlds mentality and materiality
Three worlds three kinds of feeling
Four worlds four kinds of nutriment
Five worlds five aggregates as objects of clinging
Six worlds six internal bases
Seven worlds seven stations of consciousness
Eight worlds eight worldly states
Nine worlds nine abodes of beings
Ten worlds ten bases
Twelve worlds twelve bases
Eighteen worlds eighteen elements  this world of formations was known to him in all ways
But he knows all beings habits knows their inherent tendencies knows their temperaments knows their bents knows them as with little dust on their eyes and with much dust on their eyes with keen faculties and with dull faculties with good behaviour and with bad behaviour easy to teach and hard to teach capable and incapable of achievement 
therefore this world of beings was known to him in all ways
And as the world of beings so also the world of location
For accordingly this world measures as follows One worldsphere is twelve hundred thousand leagues and thirtyfour hundred and fifty leagues in breadth and width
In circumference however
The measure of it all around Is six and thirty hundred thousand
And then ten thousand in addition Four hundred too less half a hundred 
Herein
Two times a hundred thousand leagues And then four nahutas as well 
This earth this Bearer of All Wealth Has that much thickness as they tell
And its support
Four times a hundred thousand leagues And then eight nahutas as well 
The water resting on the air Has that much thickness as they tell
And the support of that
Nine times a hundred thousand goes The air out in the firmament
And sixty thousand more besides So this much is the worlds extent
Such is its extent And these features are to be found in it
plunges down into the sea Full four and eighty thousand leagues
Sineru tallest of all mountains and towers up in like degree
Seven concentric mountain rings surround Sineru in suchwise That each of them in depth and height is half its predecessors size
Yugandhara sadhara Karavīka Sudassana
Nemindhara Vinataka Assakaṇṇa  Vast ranges called
Heavenly breezes fan their cliffs agleam with gems and here reside
The Four Kings of the Cardinal Points and other gods and sprites beside
Himālayas lofty mountain mass rises in height five hundred leagues
And in its width and in its breadth it covers quite three thousand leagues
And then it is bedecked besides with four and eighty thousand peaks 
The Jambu Tree called Nāga lends the name by its magnificence To Jambudīpas land its trunk thrice five leagues in circumference Soars fifty leagues and bears all round branches of equal amplitude So that a hundred leagues define diameter and altitude
And the size of the Jambu Tree is the same as that of the Citrapāṭaliya Tree of the Asura demons the Simbali Tree of the Garuḷa demons the Kadamba Tree in the western continent of Aparagoyana the Kappa Tree in the northern continent of the Uttarakurus the Sirīsa Tree in the eastern continent of Pubbavideha and the Pāricchattaka Tree in the heaven of the Deities of the Thirtythree 
Hence the Ancients said
The Pāṭali Simbali and Jambu the deities Pāricchattaka
The Kadamba the Kappa Tree and the Sirīsa as the seventh
The Worldsphere Mountains line of summits plunges down into the sea Just two and eighty thousand leagues and towers up in like degree Enringing one worldelement all round in its entirety
Herein the moons disk is fortynine leagues across
and the suns disk is fifty leagues
The realm of Tāvatiṃsa is ten thousand leagues
Likewise the realm of the Asura demons the great Avīci Hell and Jambudīpa 
Aparagoyāna is seven thousand leagues
Likewise Pubbavideha
Uttarakurū is eight thousand leagues
And herein each great continent is surrounded by five hundred small islands
And the whole of that constitutes a single worldsphere a single worldelement
Between this and the adjacent worldspheres are the Lokantarika hells
So the worldspheres are infinite in number the world elements are infinite and the Blessed One has experienced known and penetrated them with the infinite knowledge of the Enlightened Ones
Therefore this world of location was known to him in all ways too
So he is knower of worlds because he has seen the world in all ways
In the absence of anyone more distinguished for special qualities than himself there is no one to compare with him thus he is incomparable
For in this way he surpasses the whole world in the special quality of virtue and also in the special qualities of concentration understanding deliverance and knowledge and vision of deliverance
In the special quality of virtue he is without equal he is the equal only of those other Enlightened Ones without equal he is without like without double without counterpart  in the special quality of knowledge and vision of deliverance he is  without counterpart
according as it is said I do not see in the world with its deities its Māras and its Brahmās in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans with its princes and men anyone more perfect in virtue than myself  with the rest in detail
and likewise in the Aggappasāda Sutta  and so on and in the stanzas beginning I have no teacher and my like does not exist in all the world  all of which should be taken in detail
He guides men to be tamed  thus he is leader of men to be tamed 
he tames he disciplines is what is meant
Herein animal males and human males and nonhuman males that are not tamed but fit to be tamed are men to be tamed 
For the animal males namely the royal nāga Apalāla Cūḷodara Mahodara Aggisikha Dhūmasikha the royal nāga ravāḷa the elephant Dhanapālaka and so on were tamed by the Blessed One freed from the poison of defilement and established in the refuges and the precepts of virtue and also the human males namely Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhas son the brahman student Ambaṭṭha Pokkharasāti Soṇadaṇḍa Kūṭadanta and so on and also the nonhuman males namely the spirits ḷavaka Sūciloma and Kharaloma Sakka Ruler of Gods etc were tamed and disciplined by various disciplinary means
And the following sutta should be given in full here I discipline men to be tamed sometimes gently Kesi and I discipline them sometimes roughly and I discipline them sometimes gently and roughly 
Then the Blessed One moreover further tames those already tamed doing so by announcing the first jhāna etc respectively to those whose virtue is purified etc and also the way to the higher path to stream enterers and so on
Or alternatively the words incomparable leader of men to be tamed can be taken together as one clause
For the Blessed One so guides men to be tamed that in a single session they may go in the eight directions by the eight liberations without hesitation
Thus he is called the incomparable leader of men to be tamed
And the following sutta passage should be given in full here Guided by the elephanttamer bhikkhus the elephant to be tamed goes in one direction  
He teaches by means of the here and now of the life to come and of the ultimate goal according as befits the case thus he is the Teacher 
And furthermore this meaning should be understood according to the Niddesa thus Teacher  the Blessed One is a caravan leader since he brings home caravans 
Just as one who brings a caravan home gets caravans across a wilderness gets them across a robberinfested wilderness gets them across a wildbeastinfested wilderness gets them across a foodless wilderness gets them across a waterless wilderness gets them right across gets them quite across gets them properly across gets them to reach a land of safety so too the Blessed One is a caravan leader one who brings home the caravans he gets them across a wilderness gets them across the wilderness of birth 
Of gods and men devamanussānaṃ  devānañ ca manussānañ ca 
This is said in order to denote those who are the best and also to denote those persons capable of progress
For the Blessed One as a teacher bestowed his teaching upon animals as well
For when animals can through listening to the Blessed Ones Dhamma acquire the benefit of a suitable rebirth as support for progress and with the benefit of that same support they come in their second or third rebirth to partake of the path and its fruition
Maṇḍūka the deitys son and others illustrate this
While the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma to the inhabitants of the city of Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lake it seems a frog apprehended a sign in the Blessed Ones voice A cowherd who was standing leaning on a stick put his stick on the frogs head and crushed it
He died and was straight away reborn in a gilded divine palace twelve leagues broad in the realm of the Thirty three 
He found himself there as if waking up from sleep amidst a host of celestial nymphs and he exclaimed So I have actually been reborn here What deed did I do  When he sought for the reason he found it was none other than his apprehension of the sign in the Blessed Ones voice
He went with his divine palace at once to the Blessed One and paid homage at his feet
Though the Blessed One knew about it he asked him
Who now pays homage at my feet Shining with glory of success
Illuminating all around With beauty so outstanding 
In my last life I was a frog The waters of a pond my home
A cowherds crook ended my life While listening to your Dhamma 
The Blessed One taught him the Dhamma
Eightyfour thousand creatures gained penetration to the Dhamma
As soon as the deitys son became established in the fruition of streamentry he smiled and then vanished
He is enlightened with the knowledge that belongs to the fruit of liberation since everything that can be known has been discovered by him
Or alternatively he discovered the four truths by himself and awakened others to them thus and for other such reasons he is enlightened 
And in order to explain this meaning the whole passage in the Niddesa beginning thus He is the discoverer of the truths thus he is enlightened 
He is the awakened of the generation thus he is enlightened   or the same passage from the Paṭisambhidā  should be quoted in detail
Blessed is a term signifying the respect and veneration accorded to him as the highest of all beings and distinguished by his special qualities
Hence the Ancients said
Blessed is the best of words Blessed is the finest word
Deserving awe and veneration Blessed is the name therefore
Or alternatively names are of four kinds denoting a period of life describing a particular mark signifying a particular acquirement and fortuitously arisen
which last in the current usage of the world is called capricious
Herein names denoting a period of life are those such as yearling calf  steer to be trained  yoke ox  and the like
Names describing a particular mark are those such as staffbearer  umbrellabearer  topknotwearer  hand possessor  and the like
Names signifying a particular acquirement are those such as possessor of the threefold clear vision  possessor of the six directknowledges  and the like
Such names are Sirivaḍḍhaka  Dhanavaḍḍhaka  etc are fortuitously arisen names they have no reference to the wordmeanings
This name Blessed is one signifying a particular acquirement it is not made by MahāMāyā or by King Suddhodana or by the eighty thousand kinsmen or by distinguished deities like Sakka Santusita and others
And this is said by the General of the Law Blessed this is not a name made by a mother  This name Buddha which signifies final liberation is a realistic description of Buddhas  the Blessed Ones together with their obtainment of omniscient knowledge at the root of an Enlightenment Tree 
Now in order to explain also the special qualities signified by this name they cite the following stanza
The reverend one has blessings  is a frequenter  a partaker  a possessor of what has been analyzed 
He has caused abolishing  he is fortunate 
He has fully developed himself in many ways
He has gone to the end of becoming  thus is called Blessed 
The meaning of these words should be understood according to the method of explanation given in the Niddesa  
But there is this other way
He is fortunate  possessed of abolishment  associated with blessings  and a possessor of what has been analyzed 
He has frequented  and he has rejected going in the kinds of becoming  thus he is Blessed 
Herein by using the characteristic of language beginning with vowel augmentation of syllable elision of syllable  or by using the characteristic of insertion beginning with the example of pisodara etc  it may be known that he can also be called blessed when he can be called fortunate owing to the fortunateness to have reached the further shore of the ocean of perfection of giving virtue etc which produce mundane and supramundane bliss 
for he has abolished all the hundred thousand kinds of trouble anxiety and defilement classed as greed as hate as delusion and as misdirected attention as consciencelessness and shamelessness as anger and enmity as contempt and domineering as envy and avarice as deceit and fraud as obduracy and presumption as pride and haughtiness as vanity and negligence as craving and ignorance as the three roots of the unprofitable kinds of misconduct defilement stains fictitious perceptions applied thoughts and diversifications as the four perversenesses cankers ties floods bonds bad ways cravings and clingings as the five wildernesses in the heart shackles in the heart hindrances and kinds of delight as the six roots of discord and groups of craving as the seven inherent tendencies as the eight wrongnesses as the nine things rooted in craving as the ten courses of unprofitable action as the sixtytwo kinds of false view as the hundred and eight ways of behaviour of cravingor in brief the five Māras that is to say the Māras of defilement of the aggregates and of kammaformations Māra as a deity and Māra as death
Similarly he can also be called blessed when he can be called possessed of abolishment owing to the following menaces having been abolished
And in this context it is said
He has abolished greed and hate Delusion too he is cankerfree
Abolished every evil state Blessed his name may rightly be
And by his fortunateness is indicated the excellence of his material body which bears a hundred characteristics of merit
and by his having abolished defects is indicated the excellence of his Dhamma body
Likewise by his fortunateness is indicated the esteem of worldly people and by his having abolished defects the esteem of those who resemble him And by his fortunateness it is indicated that he is fit to be relied on by laymen and by his having abolished defects that he is fit to be relied on by those gone forth into homelessness and when both have relied on him they acquire relief from bodily and mental pain as well as help with both material and Dhamma gifts and they are rendered capable of finding both mundane and supramundane bliss
Now in the world the word blessing is used for six things namely lordship Dhamma fame glory wish and endeavour He has supreme lordship over his own mind either of the kind reckoned as mundane and consisting in minuteness lightness etc or that complete in all aspects
and likewise the supramundane Dhamma
And he has exceedingly pure fame spread through the three worlds acquired though the special quality of veracity
And he has glory of all limbs perfect in every aspect which is capable of comforting the eyes of people eager to see his material body
And he has his wish in other words the production of what is wanted since whatever is wanted and needed by him as beneficial to himself or others is then and there produced for him
And he has the endeavour in other words the right effort which is the reason why the whole world venerates him
He is also called blessed since he is associated with blessings such as those of the following kind in the sense that he has those blessings 
owing to his having analyzed and clarified all states into the three classes beginning with the profitable or profitable etc states into such classes as aggregates bases elements truths faculties dependent origination etc or the noble truth of suffering into the senses of oppressing being formed burning and changing and that of origin into the senses of accumulating source bond and impediment and that of cessation into the senses of escape seclusion being unformed and deathless and that of the path into the senses of outlet cause seeing and predominance Having analyzed having revealed having shown them is what is meant
He can also be called blessed when he can be called a possessor of what has been analyzed 
He can also be called blessed when he can be called one who has frequented owing to his having frequented  cultivated repeatedly practiced such mundane and supramundane higherthanhuman states as the heavenly the divine and the noble abidings as bodily mental and existential seclusion as the void the desireless and the signless liberations and others as well
He can also be called blessed when he can be called one who has rejected going in the kinds of becoming because in the three kinds of becoming  the going  in other words craving has been rejected by him And the syllables bha from the word bhava and ga from the word gamana and va from the word vanta with the letter a lengthened make the word bhagavā just as is done in the world of the grammarians outside the Dispensation with the word mekhalā since garland for the private parts can be said
As long as the meditator recollects the special qualities of the Buddha in this way For this and this reason the Blessed One is accomplished  for this and this reason he is blessed then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion
his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Perfect One 
So when he has thus suppressed the hindrances by preventing obsession by greed etc and his mind faces the meditation subject with rectitude then his applied thought and sustained thought occur with a tendency toward the Enlightened Ones special qualities
As he continues to exercise applied thought and sustained thought upon the Enlightened Ones special qualities happiness arises in him
With his mind happy with happiness as a proximate cause his bodily and mental disturbances are tranquilized by tranquillity
When the disturbances have been tranquilized bodily and mental bliss arise in him
When he is blissful his mind with the Enlightened Ones special qualities for its object becomes concentrated and so the jhāna factors eventually arise in a single moment
But owing to the profundity of the Enlightened Ones special qualities or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption
And that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of the Buddha too because it arises with the recollection of the Enlightened Ones special qualities as the means
When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Buddha he is respectful and deferential towards the Master He attains fullness of faith mindfulness understanding and merit He has much happiness and gladness He conquers fear and dread He is able to endure pain He comes to feel as if he were living in the Masters presence
And his body when the recollection of the Buddhas special qualities dwells in it becomes as worthy of veneration as a shrine room
His mind tends toward the plane of the Buddhas
When he encounters an opportunity for transgression he has awareness of conscience and shame as vivid as though he were face to face with the Master
And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destiny
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection of the Buddha Blessed with such mighty potency
This firstly is the section dealing with the recollection of the Enlightened One in the detailed explanation

This recollection of the Buddha Blessed with such mighty potency
This firstly is the section dealing with the recollection of the Enlightened One in the detailed explanation
One who wants to develop the recollection of the Dhamma should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of both the Dhamma of the scriptures and the ninefold supramundane Dhamma as follows The Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One visible here and now not delayed  inviting of inspection onwardleading and directly experienceable by the wise 
Well proclaimed in this clause the Dhamma of the scriptures is included as well as the other in the rest of the clauses only the supramundane Dhamma is included
Herein the Dhamma of the scriptures is well proclaimed because it is good in the beginning the middle and the end and because it announces the life of purity that is utterly perfect and pure with meaning and with detail 
Even a single stanza of the Blessed Ones teaching is good in the beginning with the first word good in the middle with the second third etc and good in the end with the last word because the Dhamma is altogether admirable
A sutta with a single sequence of meaning is good in the beginning with the introduction good in the end with the conclusion and good in the middle with what is in between
A sutta with several sequences of meaning is good in the beginning with the first sequence of meaning good in the end with the last sequence of meaning and good in the middle with the sequences of meaning in between
Furthermore it is good in the beginning with the introduction giving the place of and the origin giving the reason for its utterance It is good in the middle because it suits those susceptible of being taught since it is unequivocal in meaning and reasoned with cause and example It is good in the end with its conclusion that inspires faith in the hearers
Also the entire Dhamma of the Dispensation is good in the beginning with virtue as ones own wellbeing It is good in the middle with serenity and insight and with path and fruition It is good in the end with Nibbāna
Or alternatively it is good in the beginning with virtue and concentration It is good in the middle with insight and the path It is good in the end with fruition and Nibbāna
Or alternatively it is good in the beginning because it is the good discovery made by the Buddha It is good in the middle because it is the wellregulatedness of the Dhamma It is good in the end because it is the good way entered upon by the Saṅgha
Or alternatively it is good in the beginning as the discovery of what can be attained by one who enters upon the way of practice in conformity after hearing about it It is good in the middle as the unproclaimed enlightenment of Paccekabuddhas It is good in the end as the enlightenment of disciples
And when listened to it does good through hearing it because it suppresses the hindrances thus it is good in the beginning And when made the way of practice it does good through the way being entered upon because it brings the bliss of serenity and insight thus it is good in the middle And when it has thus been made the way of practice and the fruit of the way is ready it does good through the fruit of the way because it brings unshakable equipoise thus it is good in the end So it is well proclaimed because of being good in the beginning the middle and the end
Now the life of purity that is to say the life of purity of the Dispensation and the life of purity of the path which the Blessed One announces which he shows in various ways when he teaches the Dhamma is with meaning because of perfection of meaning and it is with detail because of perfection of detail as it is proper that it should be
It is with meaning because it conforms to the words declaring its meaning by pronouncing clarifying revealing expounding and explaining it It is with detail because it has perfection of syllables words details style language and descriptions
It is with meaning owing to profundity of meaning and profundity of penetration It is with detail owing to profundity of law and profundity of teaching
It is with meaning because it is the province of the discriminations of meaning and of perspicuity It is with detail because it is the province of the discriminations of law and of language 
It is with meaning since it inspires confidence in persons of discretion being experienceable by the wise It is with detail since it inspires confidence in worldly persons being a fit object of faith
It is with meaning because its intention is profound It is with detail because its words are clear
It is utterly perfect with the complete perfection due to absence of anything that can be added
It is pure with the immaculateness due to absence of anything to be subtracted
Furthermore it is with meaning because it provides the particular distinction of achievement through practice of the way and it is with detail because it provides the particular distinction of learning through mastery of scripture It is utterly perfect because it is connected with the five aggregates of Dhamma beginning with virtue  It is pure because it has no imperfection because it exists for the purpose of crossing over the round of rebirths flood  and because it is not concerned with worldly things So it is well proclaimed because it announces the life of purity that is utterly perfect and pure with meaning and with detail 
Or alternatively it is well proclaimed since it has been properly proclaimed with no perversion of meaning
For the meaning of other sectarians law suffers perversion since there is actually no obstruction in the things described there as obstructive and actually no outlet in the things described there as outlets
which is why their law is illproclaimed but not so the Blessed Ones Law whose meaning suffers no perversion
since the things described there as obstructions and the things described there as outlets are so in actual fact
So in the first place the Dhamma of the scriptures is well proclaimed
The supramundane Dhamma is well proclaimed since both the way that accords with Nibbāna and the Nibbāna that accords with the way have been proclaimed
according as it is said The way leading to Nibbāna has been properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One and Nibbāna and the way meet
Just as the water of the Ganges meets and joins with the water of the Yamunā so too the way leading to Nibbāna has been properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One and Nibbāna and the way meet 
And here the noble path which is the middle way since it does not approach either extreme is well proclaimed in being proclaimed to be the middle way
The fruits of asceticism where defilements are tranquilized are well proclaimed too in being proclaimed to have tranquilized defilement
Nibbāna whose individual essence is eternal deathless the refuge the shelter etc is well proclaimed too in being proclaimed to have an individual essence that is eternal and so on So the supramundane Dhamma is also well proclaimed 
Visible here and now firstly the noble path is visible here and now since it can be seen by a noble person himself when he has done away with greed etc in his own continuity
according as it is said When a man is dyed with greed brahman and is overwhelmed and his mind is obsessed by greed then he thinks for his own affliction he thinks for others affliction he thinks for the affliction of both
and he experiences mental suffering and grief
When greed has been abandoned he neither thinks for his own affliction nor thinks for others affliction nor thinks for the affliction of both and he does not experience mental suffering and grief
This brahman is how the Dhamma is visible here and now 
Furthermore the ninefold supramundane Dhamma is also visible here and now since when anyone has attained it it is visible to him through reviewing knowledge without his having to rely on faith in another
Or alternatively the view that is recommended is proper view  It conquers by means of proper view thus it has proper view 
For in this way the noble path conquers defilements by means of the proper view associated with it and the noble fruition does so by means of the proper view that is its cause and Nibbāna does so by means of the proper view that has Nibbāna as its objective field
So the ninefold supramundane Dhamma has the proper view since it conquers by means of proper view just as a charioteer is so called because he conquers by means of a chariot 
Or alternatively it is seeing that is called the seen 
then diṭṭha and sandiṭṭha are identical in meaning as seeing
It is worthy of being seen  thus it is visible here and now 
For the supramundane Dhamma arrests the fearful round of kamma etc as soon as it is seen by means of penetration consisting in development of the path and by means of penetration consisting in realization of Nibbāna
So it is visible here and now since it is worthy of being seen  just as one who is clothable  is so called because he is worthy of clothes 
It has no delay in the matter of giving its own fruit thus it is without delay 
Without delay is the same as not delayed 
What is meant is that instead of giving its fruit after creating a delay  say five days seven days it gives its fruit immediately next to its own occurrence 
Or alternatively what is delayed is what needs some distant time to be reached before it can give its fruit
What is that
It is the mundane law of profitable kamma
This however is undelayed because its fruit comes immediately next to it so it is not delayed 
This is said with reference to the path
It is worthy of an invitation to inspect given thus Come and see this Dhamma  thus it is inviting of inspection 
But why is it worthy of this invitation
Because it is found and because of its purity
For if a man has said that there is money or gold in an empty fist he cannot say Come and see it
Why not
Because it is not found
And on the other hand while dung or urine may well be found a man cannot for the purpose of cheering the mind by exhibiting beauty say Come and see this
on the contrary they have to be covered up with grass and leaves
Why
Because of their impurity
But this ninefold supramundane Dhamma is actually found as such in its individual essence and it is as pure as the full moons disk in a cloudless sky as a gem of pure water on bleached cloth
Consequently it is worthy of the invitation to inspect since it is found and pure thus it is inviting of inspection 
The word opanayika is equivalent to the gerund upanetabba 
Here is an exposition An inducing is an inducement  As the four paths and four fruitions this Dhamma is worth inducing that is arousing in ones own mind subjectively by means of development without any question of whether or not ones clothing or ones head is on fire 
thus it is onwardleading 
This applies to the abovementioned eight formed supramundane states 
But the unformed dhamma is worth inducing by ones own mind to become the minds object thus it is onward leading too
the meaning is that it is worth treating as ones shelter by realizing it
Or alternatively what induces the noble person onwards to Nibbāna is the noble path which is thus inductive 
Again what can be induced to realizability is the Dhamma consisting in fruition and Nibbāna which is thus inductive  too
The word upaneyya is the same as the word opanayika 
Is directly experienceable by the wise it can be experienced by all the kinds of wise men beginning with the acutely wise each in himself thus The path has been developed fruition attained and cessation realized by me
For it does not happen that when a preceptor has developed the path his co resident abandons his defilements nor does a coresident dwell in comfort owing to the preceptors attainment of fruition nor does he realize the Nibbāna realized by the preceptor
So this is not visible in the way that an ornament on anothers head is but rather it is visible only in ones own mind
What is meant is that it can be undergone by wise men but it is not the province of fools
Now in addition this Dhamma is well proclaimed
Why
Because it is visible here and now
It is visible here and now because it is not delayed
It is not delayed because it invites inspection
And what invites inspection is onward leading
As long as the meditator recollects the special qualities of the Dhamma in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed
or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion
his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Dhamma  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment
But owing to the profundity of the Dhammas special qualities or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption
And that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of the Dhamma too because it arises with the recollection of the Dhammas special qualities as the means
When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Dhamma he thinks I never in the past met a master who taught a law that led onward thus who possessed this talent nor do I now see any such a master other than the Blessed One  Seeing the Dhammas special qualities in this way he is respectful and deferential towards the Master
He entertains great reverence for the Dhamma and attains fullness of faith and so on He has much happiness and gladness He conquers fear and dread He is able to endure pain He comes to feel as if he were living in the Dhammas presence And his body when the recollection of the Dhammas special qualities dwells in it becomes as worthy of veneration as a shrine room His mind tends towards the realization of the peerless Dhamma When he encounters an opportunity for transgression he has vivid awareness of conscience and shame on recollecting the wellregulatedness of the Dhamma
And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destiny
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection of the Dhamma Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of the Dhamma in the detailed explanation
One who wants to develop the recollection of the Community should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of the community of Noble Ones as follows The community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the good way the community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the straight way the community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the true way the community of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the proper way that is to say the four pairs of men the eight persons this community of the Blessed Ones disciples is fit for gifts fit for hospitality fit for offerings fit for reverential salutation as an incomparable field of merit for the world 
Herein entered on the good way is thoroughly entered on the way  What is meant is that it has entered on a way that is the right way  the way that is irreversible the way that is in conformity with truth the way that has no opposition the way that is regulated by the Dhamma
They hear attentively the Blessed Ones instruction thus they are his disciples 
The community of the disciples is the community of those disciples The meaning is that the total of disciples forms a communality because it possesses in common both virtue and right view
That right way being straight unbent uncrooked unwarped is called noble and true and is known as proper owing to its becomingness
therefore the noble community that has entered on that is also said to have entered on the straight way entered on the true way and entered on the proper way
Those who stand on the path can be understood to have entered on the good way since they possess the right way
And those who stand in fruition can be understood to have entered on the good way with respect to the way that is now past since by means of the right way they have realized what should be realized
Furthermore the Community has entered on the good way because it has entered on the way according as instructed in the wellproclaimed Dhamma and Discipline  and because it has entered on the immaculate way
It has entered on the straight way because it has entered on the way avoiding the two extremes and taking the middle course and because it has entered on the way of the abandonment of the faults of bodily and verbal crookedness tortuousness and warpedness
because Nibbāna is what is called true
It has entered on the true way and it has entered on the way with that as its aim
It has entered on the proper way because it has entered on the way of those who are worthy of proper acts of veneration
The word yadidaṃ  yāni imāni
The four pairs of men taking them pairwise the one who stands on the first path and the one who stands in the first fruition as one pair in this way there are four pairs
The eight persons taking them by persons the one who stands on the first path as one and the one who stands in the first fruition as one in this way there are eight persons
And there in the compound purisapuggala the words purisa and puggala have the same meaning
but it is expressed in this way to suit differing susceptibility to teaching
This community of the Blessed Ones disciples this community of the Blessed Ones disciples taken by pairs as the four pairs of men and individually as the eight persons  As to fit for gifts etc what should be brought and given is a gift  the meaning is what is to be brought even from far away and donated to the virtuous
It is a term for the four requisites
The Community is fit to receive that gift because it makes it bear great fruit thus it is fit for gifts 
Or alternatively all kinds of property even when the bringer comes from far away can be given here thus the Community can be given to 
or it is fit to be given to by Sakka and others thus it can be given to
And the brahmans fire is called to be given to  for they believe that what is sacrificed to it brings great fruit
But if something is to be sacrificed to for the sake of the great fruit brought by what is sacrificed to it then surely the Community should be sacrificed to
for what is sacrificed to the Community has great fruit
according as it is said
Were anyone to serve the fire Out in the woods a hundred years
And pay one moments homage too To men of selfdevelopment
His homage would by far excel His hundred years of sacrifice 
And the words āhavanīya  which is used in the schools is the same in meaning as this word āhuneyya used here
There is only the mere trifling difference of syllables
So it is fit for gifts 
Fit for hospitality  hospitality is what a donation to visitors is called prepared with all honours for the sake of dear and beloved relatives and friends who have come from all quarters
But even more than to such objects of hospitality it is fitting that it should be given also to the Community
for there is no object of hospitality so fit to receive hospitality as the Community
since it is encountered after an interval between Buddhas and possesses wholly endearing and lovable qualities
So it is fit for hospitality since the hospitality is fit to be given to it and it is fit to receive it
But those who take the text to be pāhavanīya have it that the Community is worthy to be placed first and so what is to be given should first of all be brought here and given  and for that reason it is fit to be given hospitality to 
or since it is worthy to be given to in all aspects  it is thus fit to be given hospitality to 
And here this is called pāhuneyya in the same sense
Offering is what a gift is called that is to be given out of faith in the world to come
The Community is worthy of that offering or it is helpful to that offering because it purifies it by making it of great fruit thus it is fit for offerings 
It is worthy of being accorded by the whole world the reverential salutation consisting in placing both hands palms together above the head thus it is fit for reverential salutation 
As an incomparable field of merit for the world as a place without equal in the world for growing merit
just as the place for growing the kings or ministers rice or corn is the kings ricefield or the kings cornfield so the Community is the place for growing the whole worlds merit
For the worlds various kinds of merit leading to welfare and happiness grow with the Community as their support
Therefore the Community is an incomparable field of merit for the world
As long as he recollects the special qualities of the Saṅgha in this way classed as having entered on the good way etc then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed
or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion
his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Saṅgha  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious moment
But owing to the profundity of the Communitys special qualities or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption
And that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of the Saṅgha too because it arises with the recollection of the Communitys special qualities as the means
When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Community he is respectful and deferential towards the Community
He attains fullness of faith and so on He has much happiness and bliss He conquers fear and dread He is able to endure pain He comes to feel as if he were living in the Communitys presence
And his body when the recollection of the Sanghas special qualities dwells in it becomes as worthy of veneration as an Uposatha house where the Community has met His mind tends towards the attainment of the Communitys special qualities When he encounters an opportunity for transgression he has awareness of conscience and shame as vividly as if he were face to face with the Community And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destiny
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection of the Saṅgha Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of the Community in the detailed explanation
Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness of death which was listed next 
Herein death is the interruption of the life faculty included within the limits of a single becoming 
But death as termination  in other words the Arahants termination of the suffering of the round is not intended here nor is momentary death in other words the momentary dissolution of formations nor the death of conventional usage in such expressions as dead tree dead metal and so on
As intended here it is of two kinds that is to say timely death and untimely death
Herein timely death comes about with the exhaustion of merit or with the exhaustion of a life span or with both
Untimely death comes about through kamma that interrupts other lifeproducing kamma
Herein death through exhaustion of merit is a term for the kind of death that comes about owing to the result of former rebirthproducing kammas having finished ripening although favourable conditions for prolonging the continuity of a life span may be still present
Death through exhaustion of a life span is a term for the kind of death that comes about owing to the exhaustion of the normal life span of men of today which measures only a century owing to want of such excellence in destiny as deities have or in time as there is at the beginning of an aeon or in nutriment as the Uttarakurus and so on have
Untimely death is a term for the death of those whose continuity is interrupted by kamma capable of causing them to fall from their place at that very moment as in the case of DūsiMāra  Kalāburājā  etc or for the death of those whose lifes continuity is interrupted by assaults with weapons etc due to previous kamma
All these are included under the interruption of the life faculty of the kinds already stated
So mindfulness of death is the remembering of death in other words of the interruption of the life faculty
One who wants to develop this should go into solitary retreat and exercise attention wisely in this way Death will take place the life faculty will be interrupted or Death death
If he exercises his attention unwisely in recollecting the possible death of an agreeable person sorrow arises as in a mother on recollecting the death of her beloved child she bore
and gladness arises in recollecting the death of a disagreeable person as in enemies on recollecting the death of their enemies
and no sense of urgency arises on recollecting the death of neutral people as happens in a corpseburner on seeing a dead body
and anxiety arises on recollecting ones own death as happens in a timid person on seeing a murderer with a poised dagger
In all that there is neither mindfulness nor sense of urgency nor knowledge
So he should look here and there at beings that have been killed or have died and advert to the death of beings already dead but formerly seen enjoying good things doing so with mindfulness with a sense of urgency and with knowledge after which he can exercise his attention in the way beginning Death will take place
By so doing he exercises it wisely He exercises it as a right means is the meaning 
When some exercise it merely in this way their hindrances get suppressed their mindfulness becomes established with death as its object and the meditation subject reaches access
But one who finds that it does not get so far should do his recollecting of death in eight ways that is to say as having the appearance of a murderer as the ruin of success by comparison as to sharing the body with many as to the frailty of life as signless as to the limitedness of the extent as to the shortness of the moment
 Herein as having the appearance of a murderer he should do his recollecting thus
Just as a murderer appears with a sword thinking I shall cut this mans head off and applies it to his neck so death appears
Why
Because it comes with birth and it takes away life
As budding toadstools always come up lifting dust on their tops so beings are born along with aging and death
For accordingly their rebirthlinking consciousness reaches aging immediately next to its arising and then breaks up together with its associated aggregates like a stone that falls from the summit of a rock
So to begin with momentary death comes along with birth
But death is inevitable for what is born consequently the kind of death intended here also comes along with birth
Therefore just as the risen sun moves on towards its setting and never turns back even for a little while from wherever it has got to
or just as a mountain torrent sweeps by with a rapid current ever flowing and rushing on and never turning back even for a little while so too this living being travels on towards death from the time when he is born and he never turns back even for a little while
Hence it is said
Right from the very day a man Has been conceived inside a womb
He cannot but go on and on Nor going can he once turn back 
And whilst he goes on thus death is as near to him as drying up is to rivulets in the summer heat as falling is to the fruits of trees when the sap reaches their attachments in the morning as breaking is to clay pots tapped by a mallet as vanishing is to dewdrops touched by the suns rays
Hence it is said
The nights and days go slipping by As life keeps dwindling steadily
Till mortals span like water pools In failing rills is all used up 
As there is fear when fruits are ripe That in the morning they will fall
So mortals are in constant fear When they are born that they will die
And as the fate of pots of clay Once fashioned by the potters hand
Or small or big or baked or raw
Condemns them to be broken up So mortals life leads but to death 
The dewdrop on the blade of grass Vanishes when the sun comes up
Such is a human span of life So mother do not hinder me 
So this death which comes along with birth is like a murderer with poised sword And like the murderer who applies the sword to the neck it carries off life and never returns to bring it back
That is why since death appears like a murderer with poised sword owing to its coming along with birth and carrying off life it should be recollected as having the appearance of a murderer 
As the ruin of success here success shines as long as failure does not overcome it And the success does not exist that might endure out of reach of failure
Accordingly
He gave with joy a hundred millions After conquering all the earth
Till in the end his realm came down To less than half a gallnuts worth
Yet when his merit was used up His body breathing its last breath
The Sorrowless Asoka too Felt sorrow face to face with death 
Furthermore all health ends in sickness all youth ends in aging all life ends in death all worldly existence is procured by birth haunted by aging surprised by sickness and struck down by death
Hence it is said
As though huge mountains made of rock So vast they reached up to the sky
Were to advance from every side Grinding beneath them all that lives
So age and death roll over all
Warriors priests merchants and craftsmen The outcastes and the scavengers
Crushing all beings sparing none
And here no troops of elephants No charioteers no infantry
No strategy in form of spells No riches serve to beat them off 
This is how death should be recollected as the ruin of success by defining it as deaths final ruining of lifes success
By comparison by comparing oneself to others
Herein death should be recollected by comparison in seven ways that is to say with those of great fame with those of great merit with those of great strength with those of great supernormal power with those of great understanding with Paccekabuddhas with fully enlightened Buddhas
How
Although Mahāsammata Mandhātu Mahāsudassana Daḷhanemi Nimi etc were greatly famous and had a great following and though they had amassed enormous wealth yet death inevitably caught up with them at length so how shall it not at length overtake me
Great kings like Mahāsammata Whose fame did spread so mightily
All fell into deaths power too What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way firstly by comparison with those of great fame
How by comparison with those of great merit
Jotika Jaṭila Ugga And Meṇḍaka and Puṇṇaka
These the world said and others too Did live most meritoriously
Yet they came one and all to death What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great merit
How by comparison with those of great strength
Vāsudeva Baladeva Bhīmasena Yuddhiṭṭhila
And Cāṇura the wrestler Were in the Exterminators power
Throughout the world they were renowned As blessed with strength so mighty
They too went to the realm of death What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great strength
How by comparison with those of great supernormal power
Who with the point of his great toe Did rock Vejayantas Palace towers
The second of the chief disciples The foremost in miraculous powers
Like a deer in a lions jaw he too Despite miraculous potency
Fell in the dreadful jaws of death What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great supernormal power
How by comparison with those of great understanding
The first of the two chief disciples Did so excel in wisdoms art
That save the Helper of the World No being is worth his sixteenth part
But though so great was Sāriputtas Understanding faculty
He fell into deaths power too What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great understanding
How by comparison with Paccekabuddhas
Even those who by the strength of their own knowledge and energy crushed all the enemy defilements and reached enlightenment for themselves who stood alone like the horn of the rhinoceros  who were selfperfected were still not free from death So how should I be free from it
To help them in their search for truth The Sages various signs employed
Their knowledge brought them selfperfection Their cankers were at length destroyed
Like the rhinoceross horn They lived alone in constancy
But death they could no way evade What can be said of those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with Paccekabuddhas
How by comparison with fully enlightened Buddhas
Even the Blessed One whose material body was embellished with the eighty lesser details and adorned with the thirtytwo marks of a great man  whose Dhamma body brought to perfection the treasured qualities of the aggregates of virtue etc made pure in every aspect who overpassed greatness of fame greatness of merit greatness of strength greatness of supernormal power and greatness of understanding who had no equal who was the equal of those without equal without double accomplished and fully enlightenedeven he was suddenly quenched by the downpour of deaths rain as a great mass of fire is quenched by the downpour of a rain of water
And so the Greatest Sage possessed Such mighty power in every way
And it was not through fear or guilt That over him Death held his sway
No being not even one without Guilt or pusillanimity But will be smitten down
so how I Will he not conquer those like me
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with fully enlightened Buddhas
When he does his recollecting in this way by comparing himself with others possessed of such great fame etc in the light of the universality of death thinking Death will come to me even as it did to those distinguished beings then his meditation subject reaches access
This is how death should be recollected by comparison
As to the sharing of the body with many this body is shared by many
Firstly it is shared by the eighty families of worms There too creatures live in dependence on the outer skin feeding on the outer skin creatures live in dependence on the inner skin feeding on the inner skin creatures live in dependence on the flesh feeding on the flesh creatures live in dependence on the sinews feeding on the sinews creatures live in dependence on the bones feeding on the bones and creatures live in dependence on the marrow feeding on the marrow
And there they are born grow old and die evacuate and make water
and the body is their maternity home their hospital their charnelground their privy and their urinal
The body can also be brought to death with the upsetting of these worms
And just as it is shared with the eighty families of worms so too it is shared by the several hundred internal diseases as well as by such external causes of death as snakes scorpions and what not
And just as when a target is set up at a crossroads and then arrows spears pikes stones etc come from all directions and fall upon it so too all kinds of accidents befall the body
and it also comes to death through these accidents befalling it
Hence the Blessed One said Here bhikkhus when day is departing and night is drawing on a bhikkhu considers thus In many ways I can risk death A snake may bite me or a scorpion may sting me or a centipede may sting me I might die of that and that would set me back Or I might stumble and fall or the food I have eaten might disagree with me or my bile might get upset or my phlegm might get upset and sever my joints as it were like knives I might die of that and that would set me back 
That is how death should be recollected as to sharing the body with many
As to the frailty of life this life is impotent and frail
For the life of beings is bound up with breathing it is bound up with the postures it is bound up with cold and heat it is bound up with the primary elements and it is bound up with nutriment
Life occurs only when the inbreaths and outbreaths occur evenly
But when the wind in the nostrils that has gone outside does not go in again or when that which has gone inside does not come out again then a man is reckoned to be dead
And it occurs only when the four postures are found occurring evenly
But with the prevailing of anyone of them the life process is interrupted
And it occurs only when cold and heat are found occurring evenly
But it fails when a man is overcome by excessive cold or heat
And it occurs only when the four primary elements are found occurring evenly
But with the disturbance of the earth element even a strong mans life can be terminated if his body becomes rigid or with the disturbance of one of the elements beginning with water if his body becomes flaccid and petrified with a flux of the bowels etc or if he is consumed by a bad fever or if he suffers a severing of his limbjoint ligatures 
And life occurs only in one who gets physical nutriment at the proper time but if he gets none he uses his life up
This is how death should be recollected as to the frailty of life
As signless as indefinable The meaning is that it is unpredictable
For in the case of all beings
The span the sickness and the time and where The body will be laid the destiny
The living world can never know these things There is no sign foretells when they will be
Herein firstly the span has no sign because there is no definition such as Just so much must be lived no more than that
For beings die in the various stages of the embryo namely at the time of the kalala of the abbuda of the pesi of the ghana at one month gone two months gone three months gone four months gone five months gone  ten months gone
and on the occasion of coming out of the womb
And after that they die this side or the other of the century
And the sickness has no sign because there is no definition such as Beings die only of this sickness not of any other
For beings die of eye disease or of any one among those beginning with ear disease 
And the time has no sign because there is no definition such as One has to die only at this time not at any other
For beings die in the morning and at any of the other times such as noon
And where the body will be laid down has no sign because there is no definition such as When people die they must drop their bodies only here not anywhere else
For the person of those born inside a village is dropped outside the village
and that of those born outside the village is dropped inside it
Likewise that of those born in water is dropped on land and that of those born on land in water And this can be multiplied in many ways
And the destiny has no sign because there is no definition such as One who dies there must be reborn here
For there are some who die in a divine world and are reborn in the human world and there are some who die in the human world and are reborn in a divine world and so on And in this way the world goes round and round the five kinds of destinies like an ox harnessed to a machine This is how death should be recollected as signless
As to the limitedness of the extent the extent of human life is short now
One who lives long lives a hundred years more or less
Hence the Blessed One said Bhikkhus this human life span is short There is a new life to be gone to there are profitable deeds to be done there is the life of purity to be led There is no not dying for the born
He who lives long lives a hundred years more or less 
The life of humankind is short A wise man holds it in contempt
And acts as one whose head is burning Death will never fail to come 
And he said further Bhikkhus there was once a teacher called Araka   all of which sutta should be given in full adorned as it is with seven similes
And he said further Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live a night and day that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me
and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live a day that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me
and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me
these are called bhikkhus who dwell in negligence and slackly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction of cankers
And bhikkhus when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live for as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me
and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus Oh let me live as long as it takes to breathe in and breathe out or as long as it takes to breathe out and breathe in that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching surely much could be done by me
these are called bhikkhus who dwell in diligence and keenly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction of cankers 
So short in fact is the extent of life that it is not certain even for as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls
As to the shortness of the moment in the ultimate sense the lifemoment of living beings is extremely short being only as much as the occurrence of a single conscious moment
Just as a chariot wheel when it is rolling rolls that is touches the ground only on one point of the circumference of its tire and when it is at rest rests only on one point so too the life of living beings lasts only for a single conscious moment
When that consciousness has ceased the being is said to have ceased
according as it is said In a past conscious moment he did live not he does live not he will live
In a future conscious moment not he did live not he does live he will live
In the present conscious moment not he did live he does live not he will live
Life person pleasure painjust these alone
Join in one conscious moment that flicks by
Ceased aggregates of those dead or alive
Are all alike gone never to return
No world is born if consciousness is not Produced when that is present then it lives
When consciousness dissolves the world is dead The highest sense this concept will allow 
This is how death should be recollected as to the shortness of the moment
So while he does his recollecting by means of one or other of these eight ways his consciousness acquires the support of repetition owing to the reiterated attention mindfulness settles down with death as its object the hindrances are suppressed and the jhāna factors make their appearance
But since the object is stated with individual essences and since it awakens a sense of urgency the jhāna does not reach absorption and is only access
Now with special development the supramundane jhāna and the second and the fourth immaterial jhānas reach absorption even with respect to states with individual essences
For the supramundane reaches absorption by means of progressive development of the purification
and the immaterial jhānas do so by means of development consisting in the surmounting of the object 
since there in those two immaterial jhānas there is merely the surmounting of the object of jhāna that had already reached absorption
But here in mundane mindfulness of death there is neither
so the jhāna only reaches access
And that access is known as mindfulness of death too since it arises through its means
A bhikkhu devoted to mindfulness of death is constantly diligent He acquires perception of disenchantment with all kinds of becoming  He conquers attachment to life He condemns evil He avoids much storing He has no stain of avarice about requisites Perception of impermanence grows in him following upon which there appear the perceptions of pain and notself
But while beings who have not developed mindfulness of death fall victims to fear horror and confusion at the time of death as though suddenly seized by wild beasts spirits snakes robbers or murderers he dies undeluded and fearless without falling into any such state
And if he does not attain the deathless here and now he is at least headed for a happy destiny on the breakup of the body
Now when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely be
This recollection about death Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of death in the detailed explanation
Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject which is never promulgated except after an Enlightened Ones arising and is outside the province of any sectarians It has been commended by the Blessed One in various ways in different suttas thus Bhikkhus when one thing is developed and repeatedly practiced it leads to a supreme sense of urgency
to supreme benefit
to supreme surcease of bondage
to supreme mindfulness and full awareness
to acquisition of knowledge and vision
to a happy life here and now
to realization of the fruit of clear vision and deliverance
What is that one thing
It is mindfulness occupied with the body 
And thus Bhikkhus they savour the deathless who savour mindfulness occupied with the body
they do not savour the deathless who do not savour mindfulness occupied with the body
They have savoured the deathless who have savoured mindfulness occupied with the body they have not savoured  They have neglected  they have not neglected  They have missed  they have found the deathless who have found mindfulness occupied with the body  And it has been described in fourteen sections in the passage beginning And how developed bhikkhus how repeatedly practiced is mindfulness occupied with the body of great fruit of great benefit
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu gone to the forest   that is to say the sections on breathing on postures on the four kinds of full awareness on attention directed to repulsiveness on attention directed to elements and on the nine charnelground contemplations
Herein the three that is to say the sections on postures on the four kinds of full awareness  and on attention directed to elements as they are stated in that sutta deal with insight
Then the nine sections on the charnel ground contemplations as stated there deal with that particular phase of insight knowledge called contemplation of danger
And any development of concentration in the bloated etc that might be implied there has already been explained in the Description of Foulness 
So there are only the two that is the sections on breathing and on directing attention to repulsiveness that as stated there deal with concentration
Of these two the section on breathing is a separate meditation subject namely mindfulness of breathing
Text What is intended here as mindfulness occupied with the body is the thirty two aspects This meditation subject is taught as the direction of attention to repulsiveness thus Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and contained in the skin as full of many kinds of filth thus
In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidney heart liver midriff spleen lungs bowels entrails gorge dung bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urine  the brain being included in the bone marrow in this version with a total of only thirtyone aspects
Here is the description of the development introduced by a commentary on the text
Word Commentary This body this filthy body constructed out of the four primary elements
Up from the soles of the feet from the soles of the feet upwards
Down from the top of the hair from the highest part of the hair downwards
Contained in the skin terminated all round by the skin
Reviews  as full of many kinds of filth he sees that this body is packed with the filth of various kinds beginning with head hairs
How
In this body there are head hairs  urine 
Herein there are means there are found
In this in this which is expressed thus Up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and contained in the skin as full of many kinds of filth
 Body the carcass
for it is the carcass that is called body because it is a conglomeration of filth because such vile things as the head hairs etc and the hundred diseases beginning with eye disease have it as their origin 
Head hairs body hairs these things beginning with head hairs are the thirty two aspects
The construction here should be understood in this way In this body there are head hairs in this body there are body hairs
No one who searches throughout the whole of this fathomlong carcass starting upwards from the soles of the feet starting downwards from the top of the head and starting from the skin all round ever finds even the minutest atom at all beautiful in it such as a pearl or a gem or beryl or aloes or saffron or camphor or talcum powder on the contrary he finds nothing but the various very malodorous offensive drablooking sorts of filth consisting of the head hairs body hairs and the rest
Hence it is said In this body there are head hairs body hairs  urine 
This is the commentary on the wordconstruction here
Development  Now a clansman who as a beginner wants to develop this meditation subject should go to a good friend of the kind already described and learn it
And the teacher who expounds it to him should tell him the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving attention
The Sevenfold Skill in Learning Herein the sevenfold skill in learning should be told thus as verbal recitation as mental recitation as to colour as to shape as to direction as to location as to delimitation
This meditation subject consists in giving attention to repulsiveness Even if one is master of the Tipiṭaka the verbal recitation should still be done at the time of first giving it attention
For the meditation subject only becomes evident to some through recitation as it did to the two elders who learned the meditation subject from the Elder Mahā Deva of the Hill Country 
On being asked for the meditation subject it seems the elder gave the text of the thirtytwo aspects saying Do only this recitation for four months
 Although they were familiar respectively with two and three Piṭakas it was only at the end of four months of recitation of the meditation subject that they became streamenterers with right apprehension of the text
So the teacher who expounds the meditation subject should tell the pupil to do the recitation verbally first
Now when he does the recitation he should divide it up into the skin pentad etc and do it forwards and backwards
After saying Head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin he should repeat it backwards Skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
Next to that with the kidney pentad after saying Flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidney he should repeat it backwards Kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
Next with the lungs pentad after saying Heart liver midriff spleen lungs he should repeat it backwards Lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
Next with the brain pentad after saying Bowels entrails gorge dung brain he should repeat it backwards Brain dung gorge entrails bowels lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
Next with the fat sextad after saying Bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat he should repeat it backwards Fat sweat blood pus phlegm bile brain dung gorge entrails bowels lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
Next with the urine sextad after saying Tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints urine he should repeat it backwards Urine oil of the joints snot spittle grease tears fat sweat blood pus phlegm bile brain dung gorge entrails bowels lungs spleen midriff liver heart kidney bone marrow bones sinews flesh skin teeth nails body hairs head hairs 
The recitation should be done verbally in this way a hundred times a thousand times even a hundred thousand times
For it is through verbal recitation that the meditation subject becomes familiar and the mind being thus prevented from running here and there
the parts become evident and seem like the fingers of a pair of clasped hands like a row of fence posts
 The mental recitation should be done just as it is done verbally
For the verbal recitation is a condition for the mental recitation
and the mental recitation is a condition for the penetration of the characteristic of foulness 
 As to colour the colour of the head hairs etc should be defined
As to shape their shape should be defined too
As to direction in this body upwards from the navel is the upward direction and downwards from it is the downward direction So the direction should be defined thus This part is in this direction 
As to location the location of this or that part should be defined thus This part is established in this location 
As to delimitation there are two kinds of delimitation that is delimitation of the similar and delimitation of the dissimilar
Herein delimitation of the similar should be understood in this way This part is delimited above and below and around by this
 Delimitation of the dissimilar should be understood as nonintermixedness in this way Head hairs are not body hairs and body hairs are not head hairs 
When the teacher tells the skill in learning in seven ways thus he should do so knowing that in certain suttas this meditation subject is expounded from the point of view of repulsiveness and in certain suttas from the point of view of elements
For in the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta it is expounded only as repulsiveness
In the Mahā Hatthipadopama Sutta  in the Mahā Rāhulovāda Sutta  and the Dhātuvibhaṅga  it is expounded as elements
In the Kāyagatāsati Sutta  however four jhānas are expounded with reference to one to whom it has appeared as a colour kasiṇa 
Herein it is an insight meditation subject that is expounded as elements
and a serenity meditation subject that is expounded as repulsiveness
Consequently it is only the serenity meditation subject that is relevant here
The Tenfold Skill in Giving Attention Having thus told the sevenfold skill in learning he should tell the tenfold skill in giving attention as follows as to following the order not too quickly not too slowly as to warding off distraction as to surmounting the concept as to successive leaving as to absorption  as to the three suttantas
Herein as to following the order from the time of beginning the recitation attention should be given following the serial order without skipping
For just as when someone who has no skill climbs a thirtytworung ladder using every other step his body gets exhausted and he falls without completing the climb so too one who gives it attention skipping parts becomes exhausted in his mind and does not complete the development since he fails to get the satisfaction that ought to be got with successful development
Also when he gives attention to it following the serial order he should do so not too quickly
For just as when a man sets out on a threeleague journey even if he has already done the journey out and back a hundred times rapidly without taking note of turnings to be taken and avoided though he may finish his journey he still has to ask how to get there so too when the meditator gives his attention to the meditation subject too quickly though he may reach the end of the meditation subject it still does not become clear or bring about any distinction So he should not give his attention to it too quickly
And as not too quickly so also not too slowly
For just as when a man wants to do a threeleague journey in one day if he loiters on the way among trees rocks pools etc he does not finish the journey in a day and needs two or three to complete it so too if the meditator gives his attention to the meditation subject too slowly he does not get to the end and it does not become a condition for distinction
 As to warding off distraction he must ward off temptation to drop the meditation subject and to let his mind get distracted among the variety of external objects
For if not just as when a man has entered on a onefootwide cliff path if he looks about here and there without watching his step he may miss his footing and fall down the cliff which is perhaps as high as a hundred men so too when there is outward distraction the meditation subject gets neglected and deteriorates
So he should give his attention to it warding off distraction
As to surmounting the concept this name concept beginning with head hairs body hairs must be surmounted and consciousness established on the aspect repulsive
 For just as when men find a water hole in a forest in a time of drought they hang up some kind of signal there such as a palm leaf and people come to bathe and drink guided by the signal body hairs
but when the way has become plain with their continual traffic there is no further need of the signal and they go to bathe and drink there whenever they want so too when repulsiveness becomes evident to him as he is giving his attention to the meditation subject through the means of the name concept head hairs
he must surmount the concept head hairs body hairs and establish consciousness on only the actual repulsiveness
As to successive leaving in giving his attention he should eventually leave out any parts that do not appear to him
For when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs his attention then carries on till it arrives at the last part that is urine and stops there
and when he gives his attention to urine his attention then carries on till it arrives back at the first part that is head hairs and stops there
As he persists in giving his attention thus some parts appear to him and others do not
Then he should work on those that have appeared till one out of any two appears the clearer
He should arouse absorption by again and again giving attention to the one that has appeared thus
Here is a simile Suppose a hunter wanted to catch a monkey that lived in a grove of thirtytwo palms and he shot an arrow through a leaf of the palm that stood at the beginning and gave a shout then the monkey went leaping successively from palm to palm till it reached the last palm and when the hunter went there too and did as before it came back in like manner to the first palm and being followed thus again and again after leaping from each place where a shout was given it eventually jumped on to one palm and firmly seizing the palm shoots leaf spike in the middle would not leap any more even when shotso it is with this
The application of the simile is this The thirtytwo parts of the body are like the thirtytwo palms in the grove
The monkey is like the mind
The meditator is like the hunter
The range of the meditators mind in the body with its thirtytwo parts as object is like the monkeys inhabiting the palm grove of thirtytwo palms
The settling down of the meditators mind in the last part after going successively from part to part when he began by giving his attention to head hairs is like the monkeys leaping from palm to palm and going to the last palm when the hunter shot an arrow through the leaf of the palm where it was and gave a shout
Likewise in the return to the beginning
His doing the preliminary work on those parts that have appeared leaving behind those that did not appear while as he gave his attention to them again and again some appeared to him and some did not is like the monkeys being followed and leaping up from each place where a shout is given
The meditators repeated attention given to the part that in the end appears the more clearly of any two that have appeared to him and his finally reaching absorption is like the monkeys eventually stopping in one palm firmly seizing the palm shoots leaf spike in the middle and not leaping up even when shot
There is another simile too Suppose an almsfoodeater bhikkhu went to live near a village of thirtytwo families and when he got two lots of alms at the first house he left out one house beyond it
and next day when he got three lots of alms at the first house he left out two houses beyond it
and on the third day he got his bowl full at the first house and went to the sitting hall and ate
so it is with this
The thirtytwo aspects are like the village with the thirtytwo families
The meditator is like the almsfood eater
The meditators preliminary work is like the almsfood eaters going to live near the village
The meditators continuing to give attention after leaving out those parts that do not appear and doing his preliminary work on the pair of parts that do appear is like the almsfood eaters getting two lots of alms at the first house and leaving out one house beyond it and like his next day getting three lots of alms at the first house and leaving out two houses beyond it
The arousing of absorption by giving attention again and again to that which has appeared the more clearly of two is like the almsfood eaters getting his bowl full at the first house on the third day and then going to the sitting hall and eating
As to absorption as to absorption part by part The intention here is this it should be understood that absorption is brought about in each one of the parts
 As to the three suttantas the intention here is this it should be understood that the three suttantas namely those on higher consciousness on coolness and on skill in the enlightenment factors have as their purpose the linking of energy with concentration
Herein
Bhikkhus there are three signs that should be given attention from time to time by a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness
The sign of concentration should be given attention from time to time
the sign of exertion should be given attention from time to time
the sign of equanimity should be given attention from time to time
If a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention only to the sign of concentration then his consciousness may conduce to idleness
If a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention only to the sign of exertion then his consciousness may conduce to agitation
If a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention only to the sign of equanimity then his consciousness may not become rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers
But bhikkhus when a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives attention from time to time to the sign of concentration  to the sign of exertion  to the sign of equanimity then his consciousness becomes malleable wieldy and bright it is not brittle and becomes rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers
Bhikkhus just as a skilled goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice prepares his furnace and heats it up and puts crude gold into it with tongs and he blows on it from time to time sprinkles water on it from time to time and looks on at it from time to time
and if the goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice only blew on the crude gold it would burn and
if he only sprinkled water on it it would cool down
and if he only looked on at it it would not get rightly refined
but when the goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice blows on the crude gold from time to time sprinkles water on it from time to time and looks on at it from time to time then it becomes malleable wieldy and bright it is not brittle and it submits rightly to being wrought
whatever kind of ornament he wants to work it into whether a chain or a ring or a necklace or a gold fillet it serves his purpose
So too bhikkhus there are three signs that should be given attention from time to time by a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness  becomes rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers
He attains the ability to be a witness through realization by directknowledge of any state realizable by directknowledge to which he inclines his mind whenever there is occasion  
 this sutta should be understood to deal with higher consciousness
Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu possesses six things he is able to realize the supreme coolness
What six
Here bhikkhus when consciousness should be restrained he restrains it
when consciousness should be exerted he exerts it
when consciousness should be encouraged he encourages it
when consciousness should be looked on at with equanimity he looks on at it with equanimity
He is resolute on the superior state to be attained he delights in Nibbāna
Possessing these six things a bhikkhu is able to realize the supreme coolness 
 this sutta deals with coolness
Skill in the enlightenment factors has already been dealt with in the explanation of skill in absorption in the passage beginning Bhikkhus when the mind is slack that is not the time for developing the tranquillity enlightenment factor  
So the meditator should make sure that he has apprehended this sevenfold skill in learning well and has properly defined this tenfold skill in giving attention thus learning the meditation subject properly with both kinds of skill
Starting the Practice If it is convenient for him to live in the same monastery as the teacher then he need not get it explained in detail thus to begin with but as he applies himself to the meditation subject after he has made quite sure about it he can have each successive stage explained as he reaches each distinction
One who wants to live elsewhere however must get it explained to him in detail in the way already given and he must turn it over and over getting all the difficulties solved He should leave an abode of an unsuitable kind as described in the Description of the Earth Kasiṇa and go to live in a suitable one Then he should sever the minor impediments and set about the preliminary work for giving attention to repulsiveness
The Thirtytwo Aspects in Detail  When he sets about it he should first apprehend the learning sign in head hairs
How
The colour should be defined first by plucking out one or two head hairs and placing them on the palm of the hand
He can also look at them in the haircutting place
or in a bowl of water or rice gruel
If the ones he sees are black when he sees them they should be brought to mind as black
if white as white
if mixed they should be brought to mind in accordance with those most prevalent
And as in the case of head hairs so too the sign should be apprehended visually with the whole of the skin pentad 
It has been recommended by the Blessed One thus And bhikkhus this concentration through mindfulness of breathing when developed and practiced much is both peaceful and sublime it is an unadulterated blissful abiding and it banishes at once and stills evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as they arise 
It has been described by the Blessed One as having sixteen bases thus And how developed bhikkhus how practiced much is concentration through mindfulness of breathing both peaceful and sublime an unadulterated blissful abiding banishing at once and stilling evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as they arise
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect established mindfulness in front of him ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he knows I breathe in long or breathing out long he knows I breathe out long
 Breathing in short he knows I breathe in short or breathing out short he knows I breathe out short
 He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body
he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body
 He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation
he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
 He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing happiness he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing happiness  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing bliss he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing bliss  He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formation he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the mental formation  He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the mental formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the mental formation   He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the manner of consciousness  He trains thus I shall breathe in gladdening the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out gladdening the manner of consciousness  He trains thus I shall breathe in concentrating the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out concentrating the manner of consciousness  He trains thus I shall breathe in liberating the manner of consciousness he trains thus I shall breathe out liberating the manner of consciousness   He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating impermanence he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating impermanence  He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating fading away he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating fading away  He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating cessation he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating cessation
 He trains thus I shall breathe in contemplating relinquishment
he trains thus I shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment 
The description of development is complete in all respects
however only if it is given in due course after a commentary on the text
So it is given here introduced by a commentary on the first part of the text
And how developed bhikkhus how practiced much is concentration through mindfulness of breathing here in the first place how is a question showing desire to explain in detail the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing in its various forms
Developed bhikkhus  is concentration through mindfulness of breathing this shows the thing that is being asked about out of desire to explain it in its various forms
How practiced much  as soon as they arise here too the same explanation applies
Herein developed means aroused or increased
concentration through mindfulness of breathing is either concentration associated with mindfulness that discerns breathing
or it is concentration on mindfulness of breathing
Practiced much practiced again and again
Both peaceful and sublime  it is peaceful in both ways and sublime in both ways
the two words should each be understood as governed by the word both 
What is meant
Unlike foulness which as a meditation subject is peaceful and sublime only by penetration but is neither peaceful nor sublime in its object since its object in the learning stage is gross and after that its object is repulsivenessunlike that this is not unpeaceful or unsublime in any way but on the contrary it is peaceful stilled and quiet both on account of the peacefulness of its object and on account of the peacefulness of that one of its factors called penetration
And it is sublime something one cannot have enough of both on account of the sublimeness of its object and on account of the sublimeness of the aforesaid factor
Hence it is called both peaceful and sublime
It is an unadulterated blissful abiding it has no adulteration thus it is unadulterated it is unalloyed unmixed particular special
Here it is not a question of peacefulness to be reached through preliminary work as with the kasiṇas or through access as with foulness for instance
It is peaceful and sublime in its own individual essence too starting with the very first attention given to it
But some say that it is unadulterated because it is unalloyed possessed of nutritive value and sweet in its individual essence too
So it should be understood to be unadulterated and a blissful abiding since it leads to the obtaining of bodily and mental bliss with every moment of absorption
As soon as they arise whenever they are not suppressed
Evil bad
Unprofitable thoughts thoughts produced by unskilfulness 
It banishes at once it banishes suppresses at that very moment
Stills  it thoroughly calms 
or else when eventually brought to fulfilment by the noble path it cuts off because of partaking of penetration it tranquilizes is what is meant
In brief however the meaning here is this
Bhikkhus in what way in what manner by what system is concentration through mindfulness of breathing developed in what way is it practiced much that it is both peaceful  as soon as they arise
He now said Here bhikkhus etc giving the meaning of that in detail
Herein here bhikkhus a bhikkhu means bhikkhus in this dispensation a bhikkhu
For this word here signifies the Buddhas dispensation as the prerequisite for a person to produce concentration through mindfulness of breathing in all its modes and it denies that such a state exists in any other dispensation
For this is said Bhikkhus only here is there an ascetic here a second ascetic here a third ascetic here a fourth ascetic other dispensations are devoid of ascetics 
That is why it was said above in this dispensation a bhikkhu
Gone to the forest  or to an empty place this signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing
For this bhikkhus mind has long been dissipated among visible data etc as its object and it does not want to mount the object of concentration throughmindfulnessofbreathing it runs off the track like a chariot harnessed to a wild ox
Now suppose a cowherd wanted to tame a wild calf that had been reared on a wild cows milk he would take it away from the cow and tie it up apart with a rope to a stout post dug into the ground then the calf might dash to and fro but being unable to get away it would eventually sit down or lie down by the post So too when a bhikkhu wants to tame his own mind which has long been spoilt by being reared on visible data etc as object for its food and drink he should take it away from visible data etc as object and bring it into the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place and tie it up there to the post of inbreaths and outbreaths with the rope of mindfulness
And so his mind may then dash to and fro when it no longer gets the objects it was formerly used to but being unable to break the rope of mindfulness and get away it sits down lies down by that object under the influence of access and absorption
Hence the Ancients said
Just as a man who tames a calf Would tie it to a post so here
Should his own mind by mindfulness Be firmly to the object tied
This is how an abode is favourable to his development
Hence it was said above This signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing 
Or alternatively this mindfulness of breathing as a meditation subject which is foremost among the various meditation subjects of all Buddhas some Paccekabuddhas and some Buddhas disciples as a basis for attaining distinction and abiding in bliss here and nowis not easy to develop without leaving the neighbourhood of villages which resound with the noises of women men elephants horses etc noise being a thorn to jhāna 
whereas in the forest away from a village a meditator can at his ease set about discerning this meditation subject and achieve the fourth jhāna in mindfulness of breathing and then by making that same jhāna the basis for comprehension of formations with insight  he can reach Arahantship the highest fruit
That is why the Blessed One said gone to the forest etc in pointing out a favourable abode for him
For the Blessed One is like a master of the art of building sites  As the master of the art of building sites surveys the proposed site for a town thoroughly examines it and then gives his directions Build the town here and when the town is safely finished he receives great honour from the royal family so the Blessed One examines an abode as to its suitability for the meditator and he directs Devote yourself to the meditation subject here and later on when the meditator has devoted himself to the meditation subject and has reached Arahantship and says The Blessed One is indeed fully enlightened the Blessed One receives great honour
And this bhikkhu is compared to a leopard
For just as a great leopard king lurks in a grass wilderness or a jungle wilderness or a rock wilderness in the forest and seizes wild beaststhe wild buffalo wild ox boar etcso too the bhikkhu who devotes himself to his meditation subject in the forest etc should be understood to seize successively the paths of streamentry oncereturn nonreturn and Arahantship and the noble fruitions as well
Hence the Ancients said
For as the leopard by his lurking in the forest seizes beasts
So also will this Buddhas son with insight gifted strenuous
By his retreating to the forest seize the highest fruit of all 
So the Blessed One said gone to the forest etc to point out a forest abode as a place likely to hasten his advancement
Herein gone to the forest is gone to any kind of forest possessing the bliss of seclusion among the kinds of forests characterized thus Having gone out beyond the boundary post all that is forest  and A forest abode is five hundred bow lengths distant 
To the root of a tree gone to the vicinity of a tree
To an empty place gone to an empty secluded space
And here he can be said to have gone to an empty place if he has gone to any of the remaining seven kinds of abode  
Having thus indicated an abode that is suitable to the three seasons suitable to humour and temperament and favourable to the development of mindfulness of breathing he then said sits down etc indicating a posture that is peaceful and tends neither to idleness nor to agitation
Then he said having folded his legs crosswise etc to show firmness in the sitting position easy occurrence of the inbreaths and outbreaths and the means for discerning the object
Herein crosswise is the sitting position with the thighs fully locked
Folded having locked
Set his body erect having placed the upper part of the body erect
with the eighteen backbones resting end to end
For when he is seated like this his skin flesh and sinews are not twisted
and so the feelings that would arise moment by moment if they were twisted do not arise
That being so his mind becomes unified and the meditation subject instead of collapsing attains to growth and increase
Established mindfulness in front of him  having placed mindfulness facing the meditation subject 
Or alternatively the meaning can be treated here too according to the method of explanation given in the Paṭisambhidā which is this Pari has the sense of control 
mukhaṃ has the sense of outlet 
sati has the sense of establishment 
that is why parimukhaṃ satiṃ is said 
The meaning of it in brief is Having made mindfulness the outlet from opposition forgetfulness being thereby controlled
Ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out having seated himself thus having established mindfulness thus the bhikkhu does not abandon that mindfulness ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out he is a mindful worker is what is meant
 Now breathing in long etc is said in order to show the different ways in which he is a mindful worker
For in the Paṭisambhidā in the exposition of the clause Ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out this is said
He is a mindful worker in thirtytwo ways
when he knows unification of mind and nondistraction by means of a long inbreath mindfulness is established in him
owing to that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker
When he knows unification of mind and nondistraction by means of a long outbreath 
by means of breathing in contemplating relinquishment  When he knows unification of mind and nondistraction by means of breathing out contemplating relinquishment mindfulness is established in him
owing to that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker 
Herein breathing in long is producing a long inbreath
Assāsa is the wind issuing out
passāsa is the wind entering in is said in the Vinaya Commentary
But in the Suttanta Commentaries it is given in the opposite sense
Herein when any infant comes out from the mothers womb first the wind from within goes out
and subsequently the wind from without enters in with fine dust strikes the palate and is extinguished with the infants sneezing
This firstly is how assāsa and passāsa should be understood
But their length and shortness should be understood by extent 
For just as water or sand that occupies an extent of space is called a long water a long sand a short water a short sand so in the case of elephants and snakes bodies the inbreaths and outbreaths regarded as particles slowly fill the long extent in other words their persons and slowly go out again
That is why they are called long
They rapidly fill a short extent in other words the person of a dog a hare etc and rapidly go out again That is why they are called short 
And in the case of human beings some breathe in and breathe out long by extent of time as elephants snakes etc do
while others breathe in and breathe out short in that way as dogs hares etc do Of these therefore the breaths that travel over a long extent in entering in and going out are to be understood as long in time and the breaths that travel over a little extent in entering in and going out as short in time
Now this bhikkhu knows I breathe in I breathe out long while breathing in and breathing out long in nine ways
And the development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body should be understood to be perfected in one aspect in him who knows thus
according as it is said in the Paṭisambhidā
How breathing in long does he know I breathe in long
breathing out long does he know I breathe out long
He breathes in a long inbreath reckoned as an extent
He breathes out a long outbreath reckoned as an extent
He breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths reckoned as an extent
As he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths reckoned as an extent zeal arises
Through zeal he breathes in a long inbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent
Through zeal he breathes out a long outbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent Through zeal he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent
As through zeal he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent gladness arises
Through gladness he breathes in a long inbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent
Through gladness he breathes out a long outbreath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent Through gladness he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent
As through gladness he breathes in and breathes out long inbreaths and outbreaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent his mind turns away from the long in breaths and outbreaths and equanimity is established
Long inbreaths and outbreaths in these nine ways are a body
The establishment  is mindfulness
The contemplation is knowledge
The body is the establishment  but it is not the mindfulness
Mindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that body
That is why development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said 
 The same method of explanation applies also in the case of short breaths
But there is this difference While in the former case a long inbreath reckoned as an extent is said here a short inbreath reckoned as a little duration is given
So it must be construed as short as far as the phrase That is why development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said 
So it should be understood that it is when this bhikkhu knows inbreaths and outbreaths in these nine ways as a long extent and as a little duration that breathing in long he knows I breathe in long  breathing out short he knows I breathe out short is said of him
And when he knows thus
The long kind and the short as well
The inbreath and the outbreath too
Such then are the four kinds that happen
At the bhikkhus nose tip here
 He trains thus I shall breathe in  I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body he trains thus I shall breathe in making known making plain the beginning middle and end of the entire inbreath body
I shall breathe out making known making plain the beginning middle and end of the entire out breath body thus he trains
Making them known making them plain in this way he both breathes in and breathes out with consciousness associated with knowledge
That is why it is said He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out 
To one bhikkhu the beginning of the inbreath body or the outbreath body distributed in particles that is to say regarded as successive arisings  is plain but not the middle or the end
he is only able to discern the beginning and has difficulty with the middle and the end
To another the middle is plain not the beginning or the end he is only able to discern the middle and has difficulty with the beginning and the end
To another the end is plain not the beginning or the middle
he is only able to discern the end and has difficulty with the beginning and the middle
To yet another all stages are plain he is able to discern them all and has no difficulty with any of them Pointing out that one should be like the lastmentioned bhikkhu he said He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out experiencing the whole body 
Herein he trains he strives he endeavours in this way
Or else the restraint here in one such as this is training in the higher virtue
his consciousness is training in the higher consciousness
and his understanding is training in the higher understanding  So he trains in repeats develops repeatedly practices these three kinds of training on that object by means of that mindfulness by means of that attention This is how the meaning should be regarded here
Herein in the first part of the system  he should only breathe in and breathe out and not do anything else at all and it is only afterwards that he should apply himself to the arousing of knowledge and so on
Consequently the present tense is used here in the text He knows I breathe in  he knows I breathe out
But the future tense in the passage beginning I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body should be understood as used in order to show that the aspect of arousing knowledge etc has to be undertaken from then on
 He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe in shall breathe out tranquilizing completely tranquilizing stopping stilling the gross bodily formation
And here both the gross and subtle state and also progressive tranquilizing should be understood
For previously at the time when the bhikkhu has still not discerned the meditation subject his body and his mind are disturbed and so they are gross
And while the grossness of the body and the mind has still not subsided the inbreaths and outbreaths are gross They get stronger his nostrils become inadequate and he keeps breathing in and out through his mouth
But they become quiet and still when his body and mind have been discerned
When they are still then the inbreaths and outbreaths occur so subtly that he has to investigate whether they exist or not
Suppose a man stands still after running or descending from a hill or putting down a big load from his head then his inbreaths and outbreaths are gross his nostrils become inadequate and he keeps on breathing in and out through his mouth
But when he has rid himself of his fatigue and has bathed and drunk and put a wet cloth on his heart and is lying in the cool shade then his inbreaths and outbreaths eventually occur so subtly that he has to investigate whether they exist or not so too previously at the time when the bhikkhu has still not discerned  he has to investigate whether they exist or not
Why is that
Because previously at the time when he has still not discerned there is no concern in him no reaction no attention no reviewing to the effect that I am progressively tranquilizing each grosser bodily formation  But when he has discerned there is
So his bodily formation at the time when he has discerned is subtle in comparison with that at the time when he has not
Hence the Ancients said
The mind and body are disturbed And then in excess it occurs
But when the body is undisturbed Then it with subtlety occurs
In discerning the meditation subject the formation is gross and it is subtle by comparison in the firstjhāna access
also it is gross in that and subtle by comparison in the first jhāna
in the first jhāna and secondjhāna access it is gross and in the second jhāna subtle
in the second jhāna and thirdjhāna access it is gross and in the third jhāna subtle
in the third jhāna and fourthjhāna access it is gross and in the fourth jhāna it is so exceedingly subtle that it even reaches cessation
This is the opinion of the Dīgha and Saṃyutta reciters
But the Majjhima reciters have it that it is subtler in each access than in the jhāna below too in this way In the first jhāna it is gross and in the secondjhāna access it is subtle by comparison and so on
It is however the opinion of all that the bodily formation occurring before the time of discerning becomes tranquilized at the time of discerning
and the bodily formation at the time of discerning becomes tranquilized in the firstjhāna access  and the bodily formation occurring in the fourthjhāna access becomes tranquilized in the fourth jhāna
This is the method of explanation in the case of serenity
But in the case of insight the bodily formation occurring at the time of not discerning is gross and in discerning the primary elements it is by comparison subtle
that also is gross and in discerning derived materiality it is subtle
that also is gross and in discerning all materiality it is subtle
that also is gross and in discerning the immaterial it is subtle
that also is gross and in discerning the material and immaterial it is subtle
that also is gross and in discerning conditions it is subtle
that also is gross and in seeing mentalitymateriality with its conditions it is subtle
that also is gross and in insight that has the characteristics of impermanence etc as its object it is subtle
that also is gross in weak insight while in strong insight it is subtle
Herein the tranquilizing should be understood as the relative tranquillity of the subsequent compared with the previous
Thus should the gross and subtle state and the progressive tranquilizing be understood here
But the meaning of this is given in the Paṭisambhidā together with the objection and clarification thus
How is it that he trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
What are the bodily formations
Long in breaths  outbreaths experiencing the whole body belong to the body these things being bound up with the body are bodily formations
he trains in tranquilizing stopping stilling those bodily formations When there are such bodily formations whereby there is bending backwards sideways in all directions and forwards and perturbation vacillation moving and shaking of the body he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
When there are such bodily formations whereby there is no bending backwards sideways in all directions and forwards and no perturbation vacillation moving and shaking of the body quietly subtly he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
Objection So then he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation
he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
that being so there is no production of awareness of wind
and there is no production of inbreaths and outbreaths
and there is no production of mindfulness of breathing and there is no production of concentration through mindfulness of breathing and consequently the wise neither enter into nor emerge from that attainment
Clarification So then he trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation
that being so there is production of awareness of wind and there is production of inbreaths and outbreaths and there is production of mindfulness of breathing and there is production of concentration through mindfulness of breathing and consequently the wise enter into and emerge from that attainment
Like what
Just as when a gong is struck
At first gross sounds occur and consciousness occurs because the sign of the gross sounds is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the gross sounds have ceased then afterwards faint sounds occur
and consciousness occurs because the sign of the faint sounds is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the faint sounds have ceased then afterwards consciousness occurs because it has the sign of the faint sounds as its objectso too at first gross inbreaths and outbreaths occur and consciousness does not become distracted
because the sign of the gross inbreaths and outbreaths is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the gross inbreaths and outbreaths have ceased then afterwards faint inbreaths and outbreaths occur and consciousness does not become distracted
because the sign of the faint inbreaths and outbreaths is well apprehended well attended to well observed and when the faint inbreaths and outbreaths have ceased then afterwards consciousness does not become distracted because it has the sign of the faint inbreaths and outbreaths as its object
That being so there is production of awareness of wind and there is production of inbreaths and outbreaths and there is production of mindfulness of breathing and there is production of concentration through mindfulness of breathing and consequently the wise enter into and emerge from that attainment
Inbreaths and outbreaths tranquilizing the bodily formation are a body The establishment is mindfulness The contemplation is knowledge The body is the establishment  but it is not the mindfulness Mindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that body
That is why development of the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said 
This in the first place is the consecutive word commentary here on the first tetrad which deals with contemplation of the body
The first tetrad is set forth as a meditation subject for a beginner
but the other three tetrads are respectively set forth as the contemplations of feeling of the manner of consciousness and of mental objects for one who has already attained jhāna in this tetrad
So if a clansman who is a beginner wants to develop this meditation subject and through insight based on the fourth jhāna produced in breathing to reach Arahantship together with the discriminations he should first do all the work connected with the purification of virtue etc in the way already described after which he should learn the meditation subject in five stages from a teacher of the kind already described
Here are the five stages learning questioning establishing absorption characteristic
Herein learning is learning the meditation subject
Questioning is questioning about the meditation subject
Establishing is establishing the meditation subject
Absorption is the absorption of the meditation subject
Characteristic is the characteristic of the meditation subject
what is meant is that it is the ascertaining of the meditation subjects individual essence thus This meditation subject has such a characteristic 
Learning the meditation subject in the five stages in this way he neither tires himself nor worries the teacher
So in giving this meditation subject consisting in mindfulness of breathing attention he can live either with the teacher or elsewhere in an abode of the kind already described learning the meditation subject in the five stages thus getting a little expounded at a time and taking a long time over reciting it He should sever the minor impediments After finishing the work connected with the meal and getting rid of any dizziness due to the meal he should seat himself comfortably Then making sure he is not confused about even a single word of what he has learned from the teacher he should cheer his mind by recollecting the special qualities of the Three Jewels
Here are the stages in giving attention to it
counting connection touching fixing observing
turning away purification and looking back on these
Herein counting is just counting
connection is carrying on
touching is the place touched by the breaths
fixing is absorption
observing is insight
turning away is the path
purification is fruition
looking back on these is reviewing
Herein this clansman who is a beginner should first give attention to this meditation subject by counting
And when counting he should not stop short of five
or go beyond ten
or make any break in the series
By stopping short of five his thoughts get excited in the cramped space like a herd of cattle shut in a cramped pen
By going beyond ten his thoughts take the number rather than the breaths for their support
By making a break in the series he wonders if the meditation subject has reached completion or not
So he should do his counting without those faults
When counting he should at first do it slowly that is late as a grain measurer does
For a grain measurer having filled his measure says One and empties it
and then refilling it he goes on saying One one while removing any rubbish he may have noticed
And the same with Two two and so on
So taking the inbreath or the outbreath whichever appears most plainly he should begin with One one and count up to Ten ten noting each as it occurs
As he does his counting in this way the inbreaths and outbreaths become evident to him as they enter in and issue out
Then he can leave off counting slowly  like a grain measurer and he can count quickly that is early as a cowherd does
For a skilled cowherd takes pebbles in his pocket and goes to the cow pen in the morning whip in hand sitting on the bar of the gate prodding the cows in the back he counts each one as it reaches the gate saying One two dropping a pebble for each
And the cows of the herd which have been spending the three watches of the night uncomfortably in the cramped space come out quickly in parties jostling each other as they escape
So he counts quickly Three four five and so up to ten In this way the inbreaths and outbreaths which had already become evident to him while he counted them in the former way now keep moving along quickly
Then knowing that they keep moving along quickly not apprehending them either inside or outside the body but apprehending them just as they reach the nostril door
he can do his counting quickly  One two three four five one two three four five six  seven  eight  nine  ten
For as long as the meditation subject is connected with counting it is with the help of that very counting that the mind becomes unified just as a boat in a swift current is steadied with the help of a rudder
When he counts quickly the meditation subject becomes apparent to him as an uninterrupted process
Then knowing that it is proceeding uninterruptedly he can count quickly in the way just described not discerning the wind either inside or outside the body
For by bringing his consciousness inside along with the incoming breath it seems as if it were buffeted by the wind inside or filled with fat
By taking his consciousness outside along with the outgoing breath it gets distracted by the multiplicity of objects outside
However his development is successful when he fixes his mindfulness on the place touched by the breaths
That is why it was said above He can count quickly in the way just described not discerning the wind either inside or outside 
But how long is he to go on counting
Until without counting mindfulness remains settled on the inbreaths and outbreaths as its object
For counting is simply a device for setting mindfulness on the inbreaths and out breaths as object by cutting off the external dissipation of applied thoughts
Having given attention to it in this way by counting he should now do so by connection
Connection is the uninterrupted following of the inbreaths and outbreaths with mindfulness after counting has been given up
And that is not by following after the beginning the middle and the end 
The navel is the beginning of the wind issuing out the heart is its middle and the nosetip is its end
The nosetip is the beginning of the wind entering in the heart is its middle and the navel is its end
And if he follows after that his mind is distracted by disquiet and perturbation
according as it is said
When he goes in with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of the in breath his mind being distracted internally both his body and his mind are disquieted and perturbed and shaky
When he goes out with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of the outbreath his mind being distracted externally both his body and his mind are disquieted and perturbed and shaky 
 So when he gives his attention to it by connection he should do so not by the beginning middle and end
but rather by touching and by fixing
There is no attention to be given to it by touching separate from fixing as there is by counting separate from connection
But when he is counting the breaths in the place touched by each he is giving attention to them by counting and touching
When he has given up counting and is connecting them by means of mindfulness in that same place and fixing consciousness by means of absorption then he is said to be giving his attention to them by connection touching and fixing
And the meaning of this may be understood through the similes of the man who cannot walk and the gatekeeper given in the commentaries and through the simile of the saw given in the Paṭisambhidā
Here is the simile of the man who cannot walk Just as a man unable to walk who is rocking a swing for the amusement of his children and their mother sits at the foot of the swing post and sees both ends and the middle of the swing plank successively coming and going yet does not move from his place in order to see both ends and the middle so too when a bhikkhu places himself with mindfulness as it were at the foot of the post for anchoring mindfulness and rocks the swing of the inbreaths and outbreaths he sits down with mindfulness on the sign at that same place and follows with mindfulness the beginning middle and end of the inbreaths and outbreaths at the place touched by them as they come and go keeping his mind fixed there he then sees them without moving from his place in order to see them This is the simile of the man who cannot walk
This is the simile of the gatekeeper Just as a gatekeeper does not examine people inside and outside the town asking Who are you Where have you come from Where are you going What have you got in your hand
for those people are not his concernbut he does examine each man as he arrives at the gate so too the incoming breaths that have gone inside and the outgoing breaths that have gone outside are not this bhikkhus concern but they are his concern each time they arrive at the nostril gate itself
Then the simile of the saw should be understood from its beginning
For this is said
Sign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousness
By one who knows not these three things Development is not obtained
Sign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousness
By one who does know these three things Development can be obtained 
How is it that these three things are not the object of a single consciousness that they are nevertheless not unknown that the mind does not become distracted that he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect
Suppose there were a tree trunk placed on a level piece of ground and a man cut it with a saw
The mans mindfulness is established by the saws teeth where they touch the tree trunk without his giving attention to the saws teeth as they approach and recede though they are not unknown to him as they do so and he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect
As the tree trunk placed on the level piece of ground so the sign for the anchoring of mindfulness
As the saws teeth so the inbreaths and outbreaths
As the mans mindfulness established by the saws teeth where they touch the tree trunk without his giving attention to the saws teeth as they approach and recede though they are not unknown to him as they do so and so he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect so too the bhikkhu sits having established mindfulness at the nose tip or on the upper lip without giving attention to the inbreaths and outbreaths as they approach and recede though they are not unknown to him as they do so and he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect
Effort what is the effort
The body and the mind of one who is energetic become wieldythis is the effort
What is the task
Imperfections come to be abandoned in one who is energetic and his applied thoughts are stilledthis is the task
What is the effect
Fetters come to be abandoned in one who is energetic and his inherent tendencies come to be done away withthis is the effect
So these three things are not the object of a single consciousness and they are nevertheless not unknown and the mind does not become distracted and he manifests effort carries out a task and achieves an effect
Whose mindfulness of breathing in And out is perfect well developed
And gradually brought to growth According as the Buddha taught
Tis he illuminates the world Just like the full moon free from cloud
This is the simile of the saw
But here it is precisely his not giving attention to the breaths as yet to come and already gone that should be understood as the purpose
When someone gives his attention to this meditation subject sometimes it is not long before the sign arises in him and then the fixing in other words absorption adorned with the rest of the jhāna factors is achieved
After someone has given his attention to counting both body and mind become light as though the body would leap up into the air
Just as when a body that is disturbed sits down on a bed or chair the bed or chair sags down and creaks and the cover gets rumpled
but when a body that is not disturbed sits down the bed or chair neither sags down nor creaks the cover does not get rumpled and it is as though filled with cotton wool
why
because a body that is not disturbed is light
so too after he has given his attention to counting when the bodily disturbance has been stilled by the gradual cessation of gross inbreaths and outbreaths then both the body and the mind become light the physical body is as though it were ready to leap up into the air
When his gross inbreaths and out breaths have ceased his consciousness occurs with the sign of the subtle inbreaths and outbreaths as its object
And when that has ceased it goes on occurring with the successively subtler signs as its object
How
Suppose a man stuck a bronze bell with a big iron bar and at once a loud sound arose his consciousness would occur with the gross sound as its object
then when the gross sound had ceased it would occur afterwards with the sign of the subtle sound as its object and when that had ceased it would go on occurring with the sign of the successively subtler sounds as its object This is how it should be understood
And this is given in detail in the passage beginning Just as when a metal gong is struck 
For while other meditation subjects become clearer at each higher stage this one does not
in fact as he goes on developing it it becomes more subtle for him at each higher stage and it even comes to the point at which it is no longer manifest However when it becomes unmanifest in this way the bhikkhu should not get up from his seat shake out his leather mat and go away
What should be done
He should not get up with the idea Shall I ask the teacher  or Is my meditation subject lost
for by going away and so disturbing his posture the meditation subject has to be started anew
So he should go on sitting as he was and temporarily substitute the place normally touched for the actual breaths as the object of contemplation 
These are the means for doing it The bhikkhu should recognize the unmanifest state of the meditation subject and consider thus Where do these inbreaths and outbreaths exist Where do they not
In whom do they exist In whom not
Then as he considers thus he finds that they do not exist in one inside the mothers womb or in those drowned in water or likewise in unconscious beings or in the dead or in those attained to the fourth jhāna or in those born into a finematerial or immaterial existence or in those attained to cessation of perception and feeling So he should apostrophize himself thus You with all your wisdom are certainly not inside a mothers womb or drowned in water or in the unconscious existence or dead or attained to the fourth jhāna or born into the finematerial or immaterial existence or attained to cessation
Those inbreaths and outbreath are actually existent in you only you are not able to discern them because your understanding is dull
Then fixing his mind on the place normally touched by the breaths he should proceed to give his attention to that
These inbreaths and outbreaths occur striking the tip of the nose in a longnosed man
and the upper lip in a shortnosed man
So he should fix the sign thus This is the place where they strike
This was why the Blessed One said Bhikkhus I do not say of one who is forgetful who is not fully aware that he practices development of mindfulness of breathing 
Although any meditation subject no matter what is successful only in one who is mindful and fully aware
yet any meditation subject other than this one gets more evident as he goes on giving it his attention
But this mindfulness of breathing is difficult difficult to develop a field in which only the minds of Buddhas Paccekabuddhas and Buddhas sons are at home It is no trivial matter nor can it be cultivated by trivial persons
In proportion as continued attention is given to it it becomes more peaceful and more subtle
So strong mindfulness and understanding are necessary here
Just as when doing needlework on a piece of fine cloth a fine needle is needed
and a still finer instrument for boring the needles eye so too when developing this meditation subject which resembles fine cloth both the mindfulness which is the counterpart of the needle and the understanding associated with it which is the counterpart of the instrument for boring the needles eye need to be strong
A bhikkhu must have the necessary mindfulness and understanding and must look for the inbreaths and outbreaths nowhere else than the place normally touched by them
Suppose a ploughman after doing some ploughing sent his oxen free to graze and sat down to rest in the shade then his oxen would soon go into the forest
Now a skilled ploughman who wants to catch them and yoke them again does not wander through the forest following their tracks but rather he takes his rope and goad and goes straight to the drinking place where they meet and he sits or lies there Then after the oxen have wandered about for a part of the day they come to the drinking place where they meet and they bathe and drink and when he sees that they have come out and are standing about he secures them with the rope and prodding them with the goad he brings them back yokes them and goes on with his ploughing So too the bhikkhu should not look for the inbreaths and out breaths anywhere else than the place normally touched by them
And he should take the rope of mindfulness and the goad of understanding and fixing his mind on the place normally touched by them he should go on giving his attention to that
For as he gives his attention in this way they reappear after no long time as the oxen did at the drinking place where they met
So he can secure them with the rope of mindfulness and yoking them in that same place and prodding them with the goad of understanding he can keep on applying himself to the meditation subject
When he does so in this way the sign soon appears to him
But it is not the same for all
on the contrary some say that when it appears it does so to certain people producing a light touch like cotton or silkcotton or a draught
But this is the exposition given in the commentaries It appears to some like a star or a cluster of gems or a cluster of pearls to others with a rough touch like that of silkcotton seeds or a peg made of heartwood to others like a long braid string or a wreath of flowers or a puff of smoke to others like a stretchedout cobweb or a film of cloud or a lotus flower or a chariot wheel or the moons disk or the suns disk
In fact this resembles an occasion when a number of bhikkhus are sitting together reciting a suttanta When a bhikkhu asks What does this sutta appear like to you one says It appears to me like a great mountain torrent
another To me it is like a line of forest trees
another To me it is like a spreading fruit tree giving cool shade
For the one sutta appears to them differently because of the difference in their perception
Similarly this single meditation subject appears differently because of difference in perception
It is born of perception its source is perception it is produced by perception
Therefore it should be understood that when it appears differently it is because of difference in perception
And here the consciousness that has inbreath as its object is one the consciousness that has outbreath as its object is another and the consciousness that has the sign as its object is another
For the meditation subject reaches neither absorption nor even access in one who has not got these three things clear
But it reaches access and also absorption in one who has got these three things clear
For this is said
Sign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousness
By one who knows not these three things Development is not obtained
Sign inbreath outbreath are not object Of a single consciousness
By one who does know these three things Development can be obtained 
And when the sign has appeared in this way the bhikkhu should go to the teacher and tell him Venerable sir such and such has appeared to me
But say the Dīgha reciters the teacher should say neither This is the sign nor This is not the sign
after saying It happens like this friend he should tell him Go on giving it attention again and again
for if he were told It is the sign he might become complacent and stop short at that 
and if he were told It is not the sign he might get discouraged and give up
so he should encourage him to keep giving it his attention without saying either
So the Dīgha reciters say firstly
But the Majjhima reciters say that he should be told This is the sign friend Well done Keep giving attention to it again and again 
Then he should fix his mind on that same sign
and so from now on his development proceeds by way of fixing
For the Ancients said this
Fixing his mind upon the sign And putting away extraneous aspects
The clever man anchors his mind Upon the breathings in and out 
So as soon as the sign appears his hindrances are suppressed his defilements subside
his mindfulness is established
and his consciousness is concentrated in access concentration
Then he should not give attention to the sign as to its colour or review it as to its specific characteristic
He should guard it as carefully as a kings chief queen guards the child in her womb due to become a Wheelturning Monarch or as a farmer guards the ripening crops and he should avoid the seven unsuitable things beginning with the unsuitable abode and cultivate the seven suitable things
Then guarding it thus he should make it grow and improve with repeated attention and he should practice the tenfold skill in absorption and bring about evenness of energy 
As he strives thus fourfold and fivefold jhāna is achieved by him on that same sign in the same way as described under the earth kasiṇa
 However when a bhikkhu has achieved the fourfold and fivefold jhāna and wants to reach purity by developing the meditation subject through observing and through turning away he should make that jhāna familiar by attaining mastery in it in the five ways  and then embark upon insight by defining mentalitymateriality
How
On emerging from the attainment he sees that the inbreaths and outbreaths have the physical body and the mind as their origin
and that just as when a blacksmiths bellows are being blown the wind moves owing to the bag and to the mans appropriate effort so too inbreaths and outbreaths are due to the body and the mind
Next he defines the inbreaths and outbreaths and the body as materiality and the consciousness and the states associated with the consciousness as the immaterial mind
This is in brief 
but the details will be explained later in the defining of mentalitymateriality 
Having defined mentalitymateriality in this way he seeks its condition
With search he finds it and so overcomes his doubts about the way of mentality materialitys occurrence in the three divisions of time 
His doubts being overcome he attributes the three characteristics beginning with that of suffering to mentality and materiality comprehending them by groups  he abandons the ten imperfections of insight beginning with illumination which arise in the first stages of the contemplation of rise and fall  and he defines as the path the knowledge of the way that is free from these imperfections  He reaches contemplation of dissolution by abandoning attention to arising When all formations have appeared as terror owing to the contemplation of their incessant dissolution he becomes dispassionate towards them  his greed for them fades away and he is liberated from them  After he has thus reached the four noble paths in due succession and has become established in the fruition of Arahantship he at last attains to the nineteen kinds of reviewing knowledge  and he becomes fit to receive the highest gifts from the world with its deities
At this point his development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing beginning with counting and ending with looking back is completed This is the commentary on the first tetrad in all aspects
Now since there is no separate method for developing the meditation subject in the case of the other tetrads
their meaning therefore needs only to be understood according to the word commentary
 He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out experiencing happiness that is making happiness known making it plain
Herein the happiness is experienced in two ways with the object and with nonconfusion 
 How is the happiness experienced with the object
He attains the two jhānas in which happiness is present
At the time when he has actually entered upon them the happiness is experienced with the object owing to the obtaining of the jhāna because of the experiencing of the object
 How with nonconfusion
When after entering upon and emerging from one of the two jhānas accompanied by happiness he comprehends with insight that happiness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall
then at the actual time of the insight the happiness is experienced with nonconfusion owing to the penetration of its characteristics of impermanence and so on
For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā
When he knows unification of mind and nondistraction through long inbreaths mindfulness is established in him
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge that happiness is experienced
When he knows unification of mind and nondistraction through long out breaths  through short inbreaths  through short outbreaths  through in breaths  outbreaths experiencing the whole body  through inbreaths  outbreaths tranquilizing the bodily formation mindfulness is established in him
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge that happiness is experienced
It is experienced by him when he adverts when he knows sees reviews steadies his mind resolves with faith exerts energy establishes mindfulness concentrates his mind understands with understanding directly knows what is to be directly known fully understands what is to be fully understood abandons what is to be abandoned develops what is to be developed realizes what is to be realized
It is in this way that that happiness is experienced 
 The remaining three clauses should be understood in the same way as to meaning
but there is this difference here The experiencing of bliss must be understood to be through three jhānas and that of the mental formation through four
The mental formation consists of the two aggregates of feeling and perception
And in the case of the clause experiencing bliss it is said in the Paṭisambhidā in order to show the plane of insight here as well Bliss there are two kinds of bliss bodily bliss and mental bliss 
Tranquilizing the mental formation tranquilizing the gross mental formation stopping it is the meaning
And this should be understood in detail in the same way as given under the bodily formation 
Here moreover in the happiness clause feeling which is actually being contemplated in this tetrad is stated under the heading of happiness which is a formation
but in the bliss clause feeling is stated in its own form
In the two mentalformation clauses the feeling is that necessarily associated with perception because of the words Perception and feeling belong to the mind these things being bound up with the mind are mental formations  So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of feeling
 In the third tetrad the experiencing of the manner of consciousness must be understood to be through four jhānas
 Gladdening the manner of consciousness he trains thus Making the mind glad instilling gladness into it cheering it rejoicing it I shall breathe in shall breathe out
Herein there is gladdening in two ways through concentration and through insight
How through concentration
He attains the two jhānas in which happiness is present
At the time when he has actually entered upon them he inspires the mind with gladness instils gladness into it by means of the happiness associated with the jhāna
How through insight
After entering upon and emerging from one of the two jhānas accompanied by happiness he comprehends with insight that happiness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall
thus at the actual time of insight he inspires the mind with gladness instils gladness into it by making the happiness associated with the jhāna the object
It is of one progressing in this way that the words He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out gladdening the manner of consciousness are said
 Concentrating the manner of consciousness evenly placing the mind evenly putting it on its object by means of the first jhāna and so on
Or alternatively when having entered upon those jhānas and emerged from them he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall then at the actual time of insight momentary unification of the mind arises through the penetration of the characteristics of impermanence and so on
Thus the words He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out concentrating the manner of consciousness are said also of one who evenly places the mind evenly puts it on its object by means of the momentary unification of the mind arisen thus
 Liberating the manner of consciousness he both breathes in and breathes out delivering liberating the mind from the hindrances by means of the first jhāna from applied and sustained thought by means of the second from happiness by means of the third from pleasure and pain by means of the fourth
Or alternatively when having entered upon those jhānas and emerged from them he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall
then at the actual time of insight he delivers liberates the mind from the perception of permanence by means of the contemplation of impermanence from the perception of pleasure by means of the contemplation of pain from the perception of self by means of the contemplation of not self from delight by means of the contemplation of dispassion from greed by means of the contemplation of fading away from arousing by means of the contemplation of cessation from grasping by means of the contemplation of relinquishment
Hence it is said He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out liberating the manner of consciousness 
So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of mind
 But in the fourth tetrad as to contemplating impermanence here firstly the impermanent should be understood
and impermanence
and the contemplation of impermanence
and one contemplating impermanence
Herein the five aggregates are the impermanent
Why
Because their essence is rise and fall and change
Impermanence is the rise and fall and change in those same aggregates or it is their nonexistence after having been the meaning is it is the breakup of produced aggregates through their momentary dissolution since they do not remain in the same mode
Contemplation of impermanence is contemplation of materiality etc as impermanent in virtue of that impermanence
One contemplating impermanence possesses that contemplation
So it is when one such as this is breathing in and breathing out that it can be understood of him He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out contemplating impermanence 
 Contemplating fading away there are two kinds of fading away that is fading away as destruction and absolute fading away
Herein fading away as destruction is the momentary dissolution of formations
Absolute fading away is Nibbāna
Contemplation of fading away is insight and it is the path which occurs as the seeing of these two
It is when he possesses this twofold contemplation that it can be understood of him He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out contemplating fading away 
 The same method of explanation applies to the clause contemplating cessation
 Contemplating relinquishment relinquishment is of two kinds too that is to say relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into
Relinquishment itself as a way of contemplation is contemplation of relinquishment
For insight is called both relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into since firstly through substitution of opposite qualities it gives up defilements with their aggregateproducing kamma formations and secondly through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed it also enters into Nibbāna by inclining towards Nibbāna which is the opposite of the formed 
Also the path is called both relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into since it gives up defilements with their aggregateproducing kammaformations by cutting them off and it enters into Nibbāna by making it its object
Also both insight and path knowledge are called contemplation because of their reseeing successively each preceding kind of knowledge
It is when he possesses this twofold contemplation that it can be understood of him He trains thus I shall breathe in  shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment 
This tetrad deals only with pure insight
while the previous three deal with serenity and insight
This is how the development of mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases in four tetrads should be understood
This mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases thus is of great fruit of great benefit
Its great beneficialness should be understood here as peacefulness both because of the words And bhikkhus this concentration through mindfulness of breathing when developed and much practiced is both peaceful and sublime  etc and because of its ability to cut off applied thoughts
for it is because it is peaceful sublime and an unadulterated blissful abiding that it cuts off the minds running hither and thither with applied thoughts obstructive to concentration and keeps the mind only on the breaths as object
Hence it is said Mindfulness of breathing should be developed in order to cut off applied thoughts 
Also its great beneficialness should be understood as the root condition for the perfecting of clear vision and deliverance
for this has been said by the Blessed One Bhikkhus mindfulness of breathing when developed and much practiced perfects the four foundations of mindfulness The four foundations of mindfulness when developed and much practiced perfect the seven enlightenment factors The seven enlightenment factors when developed and much practiced perfect clear vision and deliverance 
Again its great beneficialness should be understood to reside in the fact that it causes the final inbreaths and outbreaths to be known
for this is said by the Blessed One Rāhula when mindfulness of breathing is thus developed thus practiced much the final inbreaths and outbreaths too are known as they cease not unknown 
Herein there are three kinds of breaths that are final because of cessation that is to say final in becoming final in jhāna and final in death
For among the various kinds of becoming  inbreaths and outbreaths occur in the sensualsphere becoming not in the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming That is why there are final ones in becoming
In the jhānas they occur in the first three but not in the fourth That is why there are final ones in jhāna
Those that arise along with the sixteenth consciousness preceding the death consciousness cease together with the death consciousness They are called final in death
It is these last that are meant here by final 
When a bhikkhu has devoted himself to this meditation subject it seems if he adverts at the moment of arising of the sixteenth consciousness before the death consciousness to their arising then their arising is evident to him 
if he adverts to their presence then their presence is evident to him
if he adverts to their dissolution then their dissolution is evident to him
When a bhikkhu has attained Arahantship by developing some other meditation subject than this one he may be able to define his life term or not
But when he has reached Arahantship by developing this mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases he can always define his life term
He knows My vital formations will continue now for so long and no more  Automatically he performs all the functions of attending to the body dressing and robing etc after which he closes his eyes like the Elder Tissa who lived at the Koṭapabbata Monastery like the Elder Mahā Tissa who lived at the Mahā Karañjiya Monastery like the Elder Tissa the almsfood eater in the kingdom of Devaputta like the elders who were brothers and lived at the Cittalapabbata monastery
Here is one story as an illustration
After reciting the Pātimokkha it seems on the Uposatha day of the full moon one of the two elders who were brothers went to his own dwelling place surrounded by the Community of Bhikkhus As he stood on the walk looking at the moonlight he calculated his own vital formations and he said to the Community of Bhikkhus In what way have you seen bhikkhus attaining Nibbāna up till now
Some answered Till now we have seen them attain Nibbāna sitting in their seats
Others answered We have seen them sitting crosslegged in the air
The elder said I shall now show you one attaining Nibbāna while walking  He then drew a line on the walk saying I shall go from this end of the walk to the other end and return when I reach this line I shall attain Nibbāna  So saying he stepped on to the walk and went to the far end On his return he attained Nibbāna in the same moment in which he stepped on the line
So let a man if he is wise Untiringly devote his days
To mindfulness of breathing which Rewards him always in these ways
This is the section dealing with mindfulness of breathing in the detailed explanation
                                                   
         
        
      
            
                       
        
           
            
       
       
                      
 
         
  
     
                               
                    
                                                
  
          
                 
                           
                      
         
                                              
        
                     
      
           
      
             
     
       
                            
                        
                 
                                
                        
                            
                                                   
     
                      
         
         
                  
                   
          
           
           
         
          
            
         
        
        
           
       
       
      
          
       
          
         
       
           
          
                         
                  
              
                                                                                       
                           
                    
        
                
                                                               
                       
     
   
   
     
     
                     
                                                     
                                      
                                                                                  
    
      
                                         
           
           
        
           
                                                                                           
         
                                      
  
     
      
    
       
                                      
              
            
            
          
       
                    
                          
                    
                                                             
  
      
          
                     
    
      
          
          
         
        
         
          
            
                                                                      
  
      
   
      
    
      
      
     
    
                
                              
                                    
    
                    
                                                                                                             
                     
                            
                       
 
                                                   
         
                 

             
                      
                          
                                 
                      
                                
                          
           
             
                  
        
                                                                       
  
  
       
        
If resentment arises in him when he applies his mind to a hostile person because he remembers wrongs done by that person he should get rid of the resentment by entering repeatedly into lovingkindness jhāna towards any of the firstmentioned persons and then after he has emerged each time directing lovingkindness towards that person
But if it does not die out in spite of his efforts then
Let him reflect upon the saw With other figures of such kind
And strive and strive repeatedly To leave resentment far behind
He should admonish himself in this way Now you who get angry has not the Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus even if bandits brutally severed limb from limb with a twohandled saw he who entertained hate in his heart on that account
would not be one who carried out my teaching  And this
To repay angry men in kind Is worse than to be angry first
Repay not angry men in kind And win a battle hard to win
The weal of both he does promote His own and then the others too
Who shall anothers anger know And mindfully maintain his peace 
And this Bhikkhus there are seven things gratifying and helpful to an enemy that happen to one who is angry whether woman or man
What seven
Here bhikkhus an enemy wishes thus for his enemy Let him be ugly
Why is that
An enemy does not delight in an enemys beauty
Now this angry person is a prey to anger ruled by anger though well bathed well anointed with hair and beard trimmed and clothed in white yet he is ugly being a prey to anger
This is the first thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is angry whether woman or man
Furthermore an enemy wishes thus for his enemy Let him lie in pain  Let him have no fortune  Let him not be wealthy  Let him not be famous  Let him have no friends  Let him not on the breakup of the body after death reappear in a happy destiny in the heavenly world
Why is that
An enemy does not delight in an enemys going to a happy destiny
Now this angry person is a prey to anger ruled by anger he misconducts himself in body speech and mind
Misconducting himself thus in body speech and mind on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a state of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell being a prey to anger 
And this As a log from a pyre burnt at both ends and fouled in the middle serves neither for timber in the village nor for timber in the forest
so is such a person as this I say 
If you are angry now you will be one who does not carry out the Blessed Ones teaching by repaying an angry man in kind you will be worse than the angry man and not win the battle hard to win you will yourself do to yourself the things that help your enemy and you will be like a pyre log  
If his resentment subsides when he strives and makes effort in this way it is good
If not then he should remove irritation by remembering some controlled and purified state in that person which inspires confidence when remembered
For one person may be controlled in his bodily behaviour
with his control in doing an extensive course of duty known to all
though his verbal and mental behaviour are not controlled
Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his bodily behaviour remembered
Another may be controlled in his verbal behaviour
and his control known to all
he may naturally be clever at welcoming kindly easy to talk with congenial opencountenanced deferential in speech and he may expound the Dhamma with a sweet voice and give explanations of Dhamma with well rounded phrases and details
though his bodily and mental behaviour are not controlled Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his verbal behaviour remembered
Another may be controlled in his mental behaviour and his control in worshiping at shrines etc evident to all
For when one who is uncontrolled in mind pays homage at a shrine or at an Enlightenment Tree or to elders he does not do it carefully and he sits in the Dhammapreaching pavilion with mind astray or nodding
while one whose mind is controlled pays homage carefully and deliberately listens to the Dhamma attentively remembering it and evincing the confidence in his mind through his body or his speech
So another may be only controlled in his mental behaviour though his bodily and verbal behaviour are not controlled Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his mental behaviour remembered
But there may be another in whom not even one of these three things is controlled Then compassion for that person should be aroused thus Though he is going about in the human world now nevertheless after a certain number of days he will find himself in one of the eight great hells or the sixteen prominent hells
For irritation subsides too through compassion
In yet another all three may be controlled Then he can remember any of the three in that person whichever he likes
for the development of lovingkindness towards such a person is easy
And in order to make the meaning of this clear Bhikkhus there are five ways of dispelling annoyance
whereby annoyance arisen in a bhikkhu can be entirely dispelled  this following sutta from the Book of Fives should be cited in full
But if irritation still arises in him in spite of his efforts then he should admonish himself thus
Suppose an enemy has hurt You now in what is his domain
Why try yourself as well to hurt Your mind That is not his domain
In tears you left your family They had been kind and helpful too
So why not leave your enemy The anger that brings harm to you
gnawing at the very roots Of all the virtues that you guard
This anger that you entertain  Who is there such a fool as you
Another does ignoble deeds So you are angryHow is this
Do you then want to copy too The sort of acts that he commits
Suppose another to annoy Provokes you with some odious act
Why suffer anger to spring up And do as he would have you do
If you get angry then maybe You make him suffer maybe not
Though with the hurt that anger brings You certainly are punished now
If angerblinded enemies Set out to tread the path of woe
Do you by getting angry too Intend to follow heel to toe
If hurt is done you by a foe Because of anger on your part
Then put your anger down for why Should you be harassed groundlessly
Since states last but a moments time Those aggregates by which was done
The odious act have ceased so now What is it you are angry with
Whom shall he hurt who seeks to hurt Another in the others absence
Your presence is the cause of hurt Why are you angry then with him
But if resentment does not subside when he admonishes himself thus then he should review the fact that he himself and the other are owners of their deeds 
Herein he should first review this in himself thus Now what is the point of your getting angry with him
Will not this kamma of yours that has anger as its source lead to your own harm
For you are the owner of your deeds heir of your deeds having deeds as your parent deeds as your kin deeds as your refuge you will become the heir of whatever deeds you do  And this is not the kind of deed to bring you to full enlightenment to undeclared enlightenment or to the disciples grade or to any such position as the status of Brahmā or Sakka or the throne of a Wheelturning Monarch or a regional king etc but rather this is the kind of deed to lead to your fall from the Dispensation even to the status of the eaters of scraps etc and to the manifold suffering in the hells and so on
By doing this you are like a man who wants to hit another and picks up a burning ember or excrement in his hand and so first burns himself or makes himself stink
Having reviewed ownership of deeds in himself in this way he should review it in the other also And what is the point of his getting angry with you
Will it not lead to his own harm
For that venerable one is owner of his deeds heir of his deeds  he will become the heir of whatever deeds he does
And this is not the kind of deed to bring him to full enlightenment to undeclared enlightenment or to the disciples grade or to any such position as the status of Brahmā or Sakka or to the throne of a Wheelturning Monarch or a regional king etc but rather this is the kind of deed to lead to his fall from the Dispensation even to the status of the eaters of scraps etc and to the manifold suffering in the hells and so on
By doing this he is like a man who wants to throw dust at another against the wind and only covers himself with it
For this is said by the Blessed One
When a fool hates a man that has no hate
Is purified and free from every blemish
Such evil he will find comes back on him
As does fine dust thrown up against the wind 
But if it still does not subside in him when he reviews ownership of deeds in this way then he should review the special qualities of the Masters former conduct
Here is the way of reviewing it Now you who have gone forth is it not a fact that when your Master was a Bodhisatta before discovering full enlightenment while he was still engaged in fulfilling the perfections during the four incalculable ages and a hundred thousand aeons he did not allow hate to corrupt his mind even when his enemies tried to murder him on various occasions
For example in the Sīlavant Birth Story when his friends rose to prevent his kingdom of three hundred leagues being seized by an enemy king who had been incited by a wicked minister in whose mind his own queen had sown hate for him he did not allow them to lift a weapon
Again when he was buried along with a thousand companions up to the neck in a hole dug in the earth in a charnel ground he had no thought of hate And when after saving his life by a heroic effort helped by jackals scraping away soil when they had come to devour the corpses he went with the aid of a spirit to his own bedroom and saw his enemy lying on his own bed he was not angry but treated him as a friend undertaking a mutual pledge and he then exclaimed
The brave aspire the wise will not lose heart
I see myself as I had wished to be 
And in the Khantivādin Birth Story he was asked by the stupid king of Kāsi  What do you preach monk  and he replied I am a preacher of patience and when the king had him flogged with scourges of thorns and had his hands and feet cut off he felt not the slightest anger 
It is perhaps not so wonderful that an adult who had actually gone forth into homelessness should have acted in that way
but also as an infant he did so For in the CūḷaDhammapāla Birth Story
Oh Dhammapālas arms are severed That had been bathed in sandalwood
He was the heir to all the earth O king my breath is choking me 
his hands and feet were ordered to be lopped off like four bamboo shoots by his father King Mahāpatāpa and his mother lamented over him thus  Then his father still not satisfied commanded that his head be cut off as well But even then he had not the least trace of hate since he had firmly resolved thus Now is the time to restrain your mind now good Dhammapāla be impartial towards these four persons that is to say towards your father who is having your head cut off the man who is beheading you your lamenting mother and yourself
And it is perhaps not so wonderful that one who had become a human being should have acted in that way
but also as an animal he did so For while the Bodhisatta was the elephant called Chaddanta he was pierced in the navel by a poisoned shaft But even then he allowed no hate towards the hunter who had wounded him to corrupt his mind
according as it is said
The elephant when struck by the stout shaft
Addressed the hunter with no hate in mind
What is your aim What is the reason why
You kill me thus What can your purpose be 
And when the elephant had spoken thus and was told Sir I have been sent by the king of Kāsis queen to get your tusks in order to fulfil her wish he cut off his own tusks whose gorgeous radiance glittered with the flashes of the six coloured rays and gave them to him
And when he was the Great Monkey the man whom he had pulled out of a rocky chasm thought
Now this is food for human kind Like other forest animals
So why then should a hungry man Not kill the ape to eat I ask
Ill travel independently Taking his meat as a provision
Thus I shall cross the waste and that Will furnish my viaticum 
Then he took up a stone and dashed it on his head But the monkey looked at him with eyes full of tears and said
Oh act not so good sir or else That you would do to me today
And with no hate in his mind and regardless of his own pain he saw to it that the man reached his journeys end in safety
And while he was the royal nāga Bhūridatta when he had undertaken the Uposatha precepts and was lying on the top of a termitemound though he was caught and sprinkled with medicinal charms resembling the fire that ushers in the end of an aeon and was put into a box and treated as a plaything throughout the whole of Jambudīpa yet he had no trace of hate for that brahman
according as it is said
While being put into the coffer And being crushed down with his hand
I had no hate for lambāna Lest I should break my precept vow 
And when he was the royal nāga Campeyya he let no hate spring up in his mind while he was being cruelly treated by a snake charmer
according as it is said
While I was living in the Law Observing the Uposatha
A snake charmer took me away To play with at the royal gate
Whatever hue he might conceive Blue and yellow and red as well
So in accordance with his thought I would become what he had wished
I would turn dry land into water And water into land likewise
Now had I given way to wrath I could have seared him into ash
Had I relaxed mindmastery I should have let my virtue lapse
And one who lets his virtue lapse Cannot attain the highest goal 
And when he was the royal nāga Saṅkhapāla while he was being carried along on a carrying pole by the sixteen village boys after they had wounded him in eight places with sharp spears and inserted thorn creepers into the wounds orifices and while after threading a strong rope through his nose they were causing him great agony by dragging him along bumping his body on the surface of the ground though he was capable of turning those village boys to cinders with a mere glance yet he did not even show the least trace of hate on opening his eyes
according as it is said
On the fourteenth and the fifteenth too ḷāra
I regularly kept the Holy Day
Until there came those sixteen village boys
Bearing a rope and a stout spear as well
The hunters cleft my nose and through the slit
They passed a rope and dragged me off like that
But though I felt such poignant agony
I let no hate disturb my Holy Day 
And he performed not only these wonders but also many others too such as those told in the Mātuposaka Birth Story 
Now it is in the highest degree improper and unbecoming to you to arouse thoughts of resentment since you are emulating as your Master that Blessed One who reached omniscience and who has in the special quality of patience no equal in the world with its deities 
But if as he reviews the special qualities of the Masters former conduct the resentment still does not subside in him since he has long been used to the slavery of defilement then he should review the suttas that deal with the beginninglessness of the round of rebirths
Here is what is said
Bhikkhus it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother  your father  your brother  your sister  your son  your daughter 
Consequently he should think about that person thus This person it seems as my mother in the past carried me in her womb for ten months and removed from me without disgust as if it were yellow sandalwood my urine excrement spittle snot etc and played with me in her lap and nourished me carrying me about on her hip And this person as my father went by goat paths and paths set on piles etc to pursue the trade of merchant and he risked his life for me by going into battle in double array by sailing on the great ocean in ships and doing other difficult things and he nourished me by bringing back wealth by one means or another thinking to feed his children
And as my brother sister son daughter this person gave me such and such help So it is unbecoming for me to harbour hate for him in my mind 
But if he is still unable to quench that thought in this way then he should review the advantages of lovingkindness thus Now you who have gone forth into homelessness has it not been said by the Blessed One as follows
Bhikkhus when the minddeliverance of lovingkindness is cultivated developed much practiced made the vehicle made the foundation established consolidated and properly undertaken eleven blessings can be expected
What are the eleven
A man sleeps in comfort wakes in comfort and dreams no evil dreams he is dear to human beings he is dear to nonhuman beings deities guard him fire and poison and weapons do not affect him his mind is easily concentrated the expression of his face is serene he dies unconfused if he penetrates no higher he will be reborn in the Brahmāworld 
If you do not stop this thought you will be denied these advantages 
But if he is still unable to stop it in this way he should try resolution into elements
How
Now you who have gone forth into homelessness when you are angry with him what is it you are angry with
Is it head hairs you are angry with Or body hairs Or nails  Or is it urine you are angry with
Or alternatively is it the earth element in the head hairs etc you are angry with Or the water element Or the fire element Or is it the air element you are angry with
Or among the five aggregates or the twelve bases or the eighteen elements with respect to which this venerable one is called by such and such a name which then is it the materiality aggregate you are angry with Or the feeling aggregate the perception aggregate the formations aggregate the consciousness aggregate you are angry with
Or is it the eye base you are angry with Or the visibleobject base you are angry with  Or the mind base you are angry with Or the mentalobject base you are angry with
Or is it the eye element you are angry with Or the visibleobject element Or the eyeconsciousness element  Or the mind element Or the mentalobject element Or the mindconsciousness element you are angry with
For when he tries the resolution into elements his anger finds no foothold like a mustard seed on the point of an awl or a painting on the air
But if he cannot effect the resolution into elements he should try the giving of a gift
It can either be given by himself to the other or accepted by himself from the other
But if the others livelihood is not purified and his requisites are not proper to be used it should be given by oneself
And in the one who does this the annoyance with that person entirely subsides
And in the other even anger that has been dogging him from a past birth subsides at the moment as happened to the senior elder who received a bowl given to him at the Cittalapabbata Monastery by an almsfoodeater elder who had been three times made to move from his lodging by him and who presented it with these words Venerable sir this bowl worth eight ducats was given me by my mother who is a lay devotee and it is rightly obtained let the good lay devotee acquire merit
So efficacious is this act of giving
And this is said
A gift for taming the untamed A gift for every kind of good
Through giving gifts they do unbend And condescend to kindly speech
Now as to the four immaterial states mentioned next to the divine abidings  one who wants firstly to develop the base consisting of boundless space sees in gross physical matter danger through the wielding of sticks etc because of the words It is in virtue of matter that wielding of sticks wielding of knives quarrels brawls and disputes takes place but that does not exist at all in the immaterial state
and in this expectation he enters upon the way to dispassion for only material things for the fading and cessation of only those  and he sees danger in it too through the thousand afflictions beginning with eye disease So in order to surmount that he enters upon the fourth jhāna in any one of the nine kasiṇas beginning with the earth kasiṇa and omitting the limitedspace kasiṇa
Now although he has already surmounted gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the finematerial sphere nevertheless he still wants also to surmount the kasiṇa materiality since it is the counterpart of the former
How does he do this
Suppose a timid man is pursued by a snake in a forest and flees from it as fast as he can then if he sees in the place he has fled to a palm leaf with a streak painted on it or a creeper or a rope or a crack in the ground he is fearful anxious and will not even look at it
Suppose again a man is living in the same village as a hostile man who illuses him and on being threatened by him with a flogging and the burning down of his house he goes away to live in another village then if he meets another man there of similar appearance voice and manner he is fearful anxious and will not even look at him
Here is the application of the similes The time when the bhikkhu has the gross physical matter as his object is like the time when the men were respectively threatened by the snake and by the enemy
The time when the bhikkhu surmounts the gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the fine material sphere is like the first mans fleeing as fast as he can and the other mans going away to another village
The bhikkhus observing that even the matter of the kasiṇa is the counterpart of that gross physical matter and his wanting to surmount that also is like the first mans seeing in the place he had fled to the palm leaf with a streak painted on it etc and the other mans seeing the man who resembled the enemy in the village he had left and their unwillingness to look owing to fear and anxiety
And here the similes of the dog attacked by a boar and that of the pisāca goblin and the timid man should be understood too
So when he has thus become disgusted with the kasiṇa materiality the object of the fourth jhāna and wants to get away from it he achieves mastery in the five ways Then on emerging from the now familiar fourth jhāna of the finematerial sphere he sees the danger in that jhāna in this way This makes its object the materiality with which I have become disgusted and It has joy as its near enemy and It is grosser than the peaceful liberations
There is however no comparative grossness of factors here as in the case of the four finematerial jhānas
for the immaterial states have the same two factors as this finematerial jhāna
When he has seen the danger in that finematerial fourth jhāna jhāna in this way and has ended his attachment to it he gives his attention to the base consisting of boundless space as peaceful Then when he has spread out the kasiṇa to the limit of the worldsphere or as far as he likes he removes the kasiṇa materiality by giving his attention to the space touched by it regarding that as space or boundless space 
When he is removing it he neither folds it up like a mat nor withdraws it like a cake from a tin It is simply that he does not advert to it or give attention to it or review it it is when he neither adverts to it nor gives attention to it nor reviews it but gives his attention exclusively to the space touched by it regarding that as space space that he is said to remove the kasiṇa 
And when the kasiṇa is being removed it does not roll up or roll away It is simply that it is called removed on account of his nonattention to it his attention being given to space space  This is conceptualized as the mere space left by the removal of the kasiṇa materiality
Whether it is called space left by the removal of the kasiṇa or space touched by the kasiṇa or space secluded from the kasiṇa it is all the same
He adverts again and again to the sign of the space left by the removal of the kasiṇa as space space and strikes at it with thought and applied thought
As he adverts to it again and again and strikes at it with thought and applied thought the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in access
He cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices it
As he again and again adverts to it and gives attention to it in this way consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space arises in absorption with the space as its object as the consciousness belonging to the finematerial sphere did in the case of the earth kasiṇa and so on
And here too in the prior stage there are either three or four sensualsphere impulsions associated with equanimous feeling
while the fourth or the fifth is of the immaterial sphere
The rest is the same as in the case of the earth kasiṇa 
There is however this difference When the immaterialsphere conscious ness has arisen in this way the bhikkhu who has been formerly looking at the kasiṇa disk with the jhāna eye finds himself looking at only space after that sign has been abruptly removed by the attention given in the preliminary work thus space space  He is like a man who has plugged an opening in a covered vehicle a sack or a pot with a piece of blue rag or with a piece of rag of some such colour as yellow red or white and is looking at that and then when the rag is removed by the force of the wind or by some other agency he finds himself looking at space
And at this point it is said With the complete surmounting of perceptions of matter with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance with nonattention to perceptions of variety aware of unbounded space he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space 
Herein complete is in all aspects or of all perceptions without exception is the meaning
Of perceptions of matter both of the finematerial jhānas mentioned here under the heading of perception and of those things that are their object
For the jhāna of the finematerial sphere is called matter in such passages as Possessed of visible matter he sees instances of matter  and it is its object too that is called matter in such passages as He sees instances of visible matter externally  fair and ugly  Consequently here the words perception of matter  in the sense of perceptions about matter are used for finematerial jhāna stated thus under the headings of perceptions
Also it has the label matter  thus it is labelled matter 
what is meant is that matter is its name
So it should be understood that this is also a term for what is classed as the earth kasiṇa etc which is the object of that jhāna
With the surmounting with the fading away and with the cessation
What is meant
With the fading away and with the cessation both because of the fading away and because of the cessation either in all aspects or without exception of these perceptions of matter reckoned as jhāna which number fifteen with the five each of the profitable resultant and functional and also of these things labelled matter reckoned as objects of those perceptions which number nine with the earth kasiṇa etc he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space
For he cannot enter upon and dwell in that without completely surmounting perceptions of matter
Herein there is no surmounting of these perceptions in one whose greed for the object of those perceptions has not faded away and when the perceptions have been surmounted their objects have been surmounted as well
That is why in the Vibhaṅga only the surmounting of the perceptions and not that of the objects is mentioned as follows Herein what are perceptions of matter
They are the perception perceiving perceivedness in one who has attained a fine materialsphere attainment or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this present life These are what are called perceptions of matter
These perceptions of matter are passed surpassed surmounted
Hence With the complete surmounting of perceptions of matter is said 
Because these attainments have to be reached by surmounting the object they are not to be reached by retaining the same object as in the first and subsequent jhānas
Threrefore But this commentary should be understood to deal also with the surmounting of the object
With the disappearance of perceptions of resistance perceptions of resistance are perceptions arisen through the impact of the physical base consisting of the eye etc and the respective objects consisting of visible objects etc
and this is a term for perception of visible objects and so on
according as it is said Here what are perceptions of resistance
Perceptions of visible objects perceptions of sounds perceptions of odours perceptions of flavours perceptions of tangible objectsthese are called perceptions of resistance 
with the complete disappearance the abandoning the nonarising of these ten kinds of perceptions of resistance that is to say of the five profitableresultant and five unprofitableresultant causing their nonoccurrence is what is meant
Of course these are not to be found in one who has entered upon the first jhāna etc either
for consciousness at that time does not occur by way of the five doors
Still the mention of them here should be understood as a recommendation of this jhāna for the purpose of arousing interest in it just as in the case of the fourth jhāna there is mention of the pleasure and pain already abandoned elsewhere and in the case of the third path there is mention of the false view of personality etc already abandoned earlier
Or alternatively though these are also not to be found in one who has attained the finematerial sphere still their not being there is not due to their having been abandoned
for development of the finematerial sphere does not lead to fading of greed for materiality and the occurrence of those finematerial jhānas is actually dependent on materiality
But this development of the immaterial does lead to the fading of greed for materiality
Therefore it is allowable to say that they are actually abandoned here
and not only to say it but to maintain it absolutely
In fact it is because they have not been abandoned already before this that it was said by the Blessed One that sound is a thorn to one who has the first jhāna 
And it is precisely because they are abandoned here that the imperturbability of the immaterial attainments and their state of peaceful liberation are mentioned 
and that ḷāra Kālāma neither saw the five hundred carts that passed close by him nor heard the sound of them while he was in an immaterial attainment 
With nonattention to perceptions of variety either to perceptions occurring with variety as their domain or to perceptions themselves various
For perceptions of variety are so called for two reasons
firstly because the kinds of perception included along with the mind element and mindconsciousness element in one who has not attainedwhich kinds are intended here as described in the Vibhaṅga thus Herein what are perceptions of variety The perception perceiving perceivedness in one who has not attained and possesses either mind element or mind consciousness element in one who has not attained and possesses either mind element or mindconsciousness element these are called perceptions of variety occur with respect to a domain that is varied in individual essence with the variety classed as visibleobject sound etc and secondly because the fortyfour kinds of perceptionthat is to say eight kinds of sensesphere profitable perception twelve kinds of unprofitable perception eleven kinds of sensesphere profitable resultant perception two kinds of unprofitableresultant perception and eleven kinds of sensesphere functional perceptionthemselves have variety have various individual essences and are dissimilar from each other
With the complete nonattention to nonadverting to nonreaction to nonreviewing of these perceptions of variety
what is meant is that because he does not advert to them give them attention or review them therefore 
And two things should be understood firstly that because the earlier perceptions of matter and perceptions of resistance do not exist even in the kind of existence produced by this jhāna on rebirth
let alone when this jhāna is entered upon and dwelt in that existence their absence is stated here in two ways as surmounting and disappearance
and secondly in the case of perceptions of variety nonattention to them is said because twentyseven kinds of perceptionthat is to say eight kinds of sensesphere profitable perception nine kinds of functional perception and ten kinds of unprofitable perceptionstill exist in the kind of existence produced by this jhāna
For when he enters upon and dwells in this jhāna there too he does so by nonattention to them also but he has not attained when he does give attention to them
And here briefly it should be understood that the abandoning of all fine materialsphere states is signified by the words with the surmounting of perceptions of matter
and the abandoning of and nonattention to all sensesphere consciousness and its concomitants is signified by the words with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance with nonattention to perceptions of variety
Unbounded space here it is called unbounded because neither its end as its arising nor its end as its fall are made known
It is the space left by the removal of the kasiṇa that is called space
And here unboundedness should be understood as referring to the attention also
which is why it is said in the Vibhaṅga He places settles his consciousness in that space he pervades unboundedly  hence unbounded space is said 
He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space it has no bound  and thus it is unbounded  What is spatially unbounded is unbounded space  Unbounded space is the same as boundless space  That boundless space is a base in the sense of habitat for the jhāna whose nature it is to be associated with it as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless space 
He enters and dwells in having reached that base consisting of boundless space having caused it to be produced he dwells with an abiding consisting in postures that are in conformity with it
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of boundless space as a meditation subject
When he wants to develop the base consisting of boundless consciousness he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment of the base consisting of boundless space Then he should see the danger in the base consisting of boundless space in this way This attainment has finematerial jhāna as its near enemy and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of boundless consciousness  So having ended his attachment to that he should give his attention to the base consisting of boundless consciousness as peaceful adverting again and again as consciousness consciousness to the consciousness that occurred pervading that space as its object He should give it attention review it and strike at it with applied and sustained thought
but he should not give attention simply in this way boundless boundless 
As he directs his mind again and again on to that sign in this way the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in access
He cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices it
As he does so consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness arises in absorption with the past consciousness that pervaded the space as its object just as that belonging to the base consisting of boundless space did with the space as its object
But the method of explaining the process of absorption should be understood in the way already described
And at this point it is said By completely surmounting the base consisting of boundless space aware of unbounded consciousness he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless consciousness 
Herein completely is as already explained
By  surmounting the base consisting of boundless space the jhāna is called the base consisting of boundless space in the way already stated  and its object is so called too
For the object too is boundless space in the way already stated  and then because it is the object of the first immaterial jhāna it is its base in the sense of habitat as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless space
Likewise it is boundless space and then because it is the cause of the jhānas being of that species it is its base in the sense of locality of the species as Kambojā is the base of horses thus it is the base consisting of boundless space in this way also
So it should be understood that the words By  surmounting the base consisting of boundless space include both the jhāna and its object together since this base consisting of boundless consciousness is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting by causing the nonoccurrence of and by not giving attention to both the jhāna and its object
Unbounded consciousness What is meant is that he gives his attention thus unbounded consciousness to that same consciousness that occurred in pervading as its object the space as unbounded space
Or unbounded refers to the attention
For when he gives attention without reserve to the consciousness that had the space as its object then the attention he gives to it is unbounded 
For it is said in the Vibhaṅga Unbounded consciousness he gives attention to that same space pervaded by consciousness he pervades boundlessly hence unbounded consciousness is said 
But in that passage the instrumental case by consciousness must be understood in the sense of accusative
for the teachers of the commentary explain its meaning in that way What is meant by He pervades boundlessly is that he gives attention to that same consciousness which had pervaded that space 
He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless consciousness it has no bound  thus it is unbounded 
What is unbounded is boundless 
and unbounded consciousness is called boundless consciousness that is viññāṇañcaṃ in the contracted form instead of viññāṇānañcaṃ which is the full number of syllables
This is an idiomatic form
That boundless consciousness is the base in the sense of foundation for the jhāna whose nature it is to be associated with it as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless consciousness 
The rest is the same as before
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of boundless consciousness as a meditation subject
When he wants to develop the base consisting of nothingness he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment in the base consisting of boundless consciousness Then he should see the danger in the base consisting of boundless consciousness in this way This attainment has the base consisting of boundless space as its near enemy and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of nothingness  So having ended his attachment to that he should give his attention to the base consisting of nothingness as peaceful He should give attention to the present nonexistence voidness secluded aspect of that same past consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space which became the object of the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness
How does he do this
Without giving further attention to that consciousness he should now advert again and again in this way there is not there is not or void void or secluded secluded and give his attention to it review it and strike at it with thought and applied thought
As he directs his mind on to that sign thus the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in access
He cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices it
As he does so consciousness belonging to the base consisting of nothingness arises in absorption making its object the void secluded nonexistent state of that same past exalted consciousness that occurred in pervading the space just as the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness did the then past exalted consciousness that had pervaded the space
And here too the method of explaining the absorption should be understood in the way already described
But there is this difference Suppose a man sees a community of bhikkhus gathered together in a meeting hall or some such place and then goes elsewhere then after the bhikkhus have risen at the conclusion of the business for which they had met and have departed the man comes back and as he stands in the doorway looking at that place again he sees it only as void he sees it only as secluded
he does not think So many bhikkhus have died so many have left the district but rather he sees only the nonexistence thus This is void secludedso too having formerly dwelt seeing with the jhāna eye belonging to the base consisting of boundless consciousness the earlier consciousness that had occurred making the space its object now when that consciousness has disappeared owing to his giving attention to the preliminary work in the way beginning There is not there is not he dwells seeing only its non existence in other words its departedness when this consciousness has arisen in absorption
And at this point it is said By completely surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness aware that There is nothing he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of nothingness 
Herein completely is as already explained
By  surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness here too the jhāna is called the base consisting of boundless consciousness in the way already stated and its object is socalled too
For the object too is boundless consciousness in the way already stated and then because it is the object of the second immaterial jhāna it is its base in the sense of habitat as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of boundless consciousness
Likewise it is boundless consciousness and then because it is the cause of the jhānas being of that species it is its base in the sense of locality of the species as Kambojā is the base of horses thus it is the base consisting of boundless consciousness in this way also
So it should be understood that the words By  surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness include both the jhāna and its object together since this base consisting of nothingness is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting by causing the non occurrence of by not giving attention to both jhāna and its object
There is nothing  what is meant is that he gives his attention thus there is not there is not or void void or secluded secluded
It is said in the Vibhaṅga There is nothing he makes that same consciousness nonexistent makes it absent makes it disappear sees that there is nothing hence there is nothing is said  which is expressed in a way that resembles comprehension by insight of liability to destruction nevertheless the meaning should be understood in the way described above
For the words He makes that same consciousness nonexistent makes it absent makes it disappear are said of one who does not advert to it or gives attention to it or review it and only gives attention to its nonexistence its voidness its secludedness they are not meant in the other way 
He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of nothingness it has no owning  this it is nonowning  what is meant is that it has not even the mere act of its dissolution remaining
The state of nonowning is nothingness  This is a term for the disappearance of the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space
That nothingness is the base in the sense of foundation for that jhāna as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of nothingness
The rest is as before
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of nothingness as a meditation subject
When however he wants to develop the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness Then he should see the danger in the base consisting of nothingness and the advantage in what is superior to it in this way This attainment has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as its near enemy and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception or in this way Perception is a boil perception is a dart  this is peaceful this is sublime that is to say neither perception nor nonperception  So having ended his attachment to the base consisting of nothingness he should give attention to the base consisting of neither perception non nonperception as peaceful He should advert again and again to that attainment of the base consisting of nothingness that has occurred making nonexistence its object adverting to it as peaceful peaceful and he should give his attention to it review it and strike at it with thought and applied thought
As he directs his mind again and again on to that sign in this way the hindrances are suppressed mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in access
He cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices it
As he does so consciousness belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception arises in absorption making its object the four mental aggregates that constitute the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness just as the consciousness belonging to the base consisting of nothingness did the disappearance of the previous consciousness
And here too the method of explaining the absorption should be understood in the way already described
And at this point it is said By completely surmounting the base consisting of nothingness he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception 
Herein completely is already explained
By  surmounting the base consisting of nothingness here too the jhāna is called the base consisting of nothingness in the way already stated and its object is so called too
For the object too is nothingness in the way already stated and then because it is the object of the third immaterial jhāna it is its base in the sense of habitat as the deities base is for deities thus it is the base consisting of nothingness
Likewise it is nothingness and then because it is the cause of the jhānas being of that species it is its base in the sense of locality of the species as Kambojā is the base of horses thus it is the base consisting of nothingness in this way also
So it should be understood that the words By  surmounting the base consisting of nothingness include both the jhāna and its object together since the base consisting of neither perception nor non perception is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting by causing the nonoccurrence of by not giving attention to both the jhāna and its object
Base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception then there is he who so practices that there is in him the perception on account of the presence of which this attainment is called the the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception
and in the Vibhaṅga in order to point out that person firstly one specified as neither percipient nor nonpercipient it is said gives attention to that same base consisting of nothingness as peaceful he develops the attainment with residual formations hence neither percipient nor non percipient is said 
Herein he gives attention  as peaceful means that he gives attention to it as peaceful because of the peacefulness of the object thus How peaceful this attainment is for it can make even nonexistence its object and still subsist
If he brings it to mind as peaceful then how does there come to be surmounting
Because there is no actual desire to attain it
For although he gives attention to it as peaceful yet there is no concern in him or reaction or attention such as I shall advert to this or I shall attain this or I shall resolve upon the duration of this
Why not
Because the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is more peaceful and better than the base consisting of nothingness
Suppose a king is proceeding along a city street with the great pomp of royalty splendidly mounted on the back of an elephant and he sees craftsmen wearing one cloth tightly as a loincloth and another tied round their heads working at the various crafts such as ivory carving etc their limbs covered with ivory dust etc now while he is pleased with their skill thinking How skilled these craftmasters are and what crafts they practice he does not however think Oh that I might abandon royalty and become a craftsman like that
Why not
Because of the great benefits in the majesty of kings
he leaves the craftsmen behind and proceeds on his way
So too though this meditator gives attention to that attainment as peaceful yet there is no concern in him or reaction or attention such as I shall advert to this attainment or I shall attain this or I shall resolve upon the duration of it or I shall emerge from it or I shall review it 
As he gives attention to it as peaceful in the way already described he reaches the ultrasubtle absorbed perception in virtue of which he is called neither percipient nor nonpercipient and it is said of him that He develops the attainment with residual formations 
The attainment with residual formations is the fourth immaterial attainment whose formations have reached a state of extreme subtlety
Now in order to show the meaning of the kind of perception that has been reached on account of which this jhāna is called the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception it is said Base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception states of consciousness or its concomitants in one who has attained the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this present life 
Of these what is intended here is the states of consciousness and its concomitants in one who has attained
The word meaning here is this that jhāna with its associated states neither has perception nor has no perception because of the absence of gross perception and the presence of subtle perception thus it is neither perception nor non perception 
It is neither perception nor nonperception and it is a base because it is included in the mindbase and the mentalobject base  thus it is the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception 
Or alternatively the perception here is neither perception since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception nor yet non perception since it is present in a subtle state as a residual formation thus it is neither perception nor nonperception
It is neither perception nor non perception and it is a base in the sense of a foundation for the other states thus it is the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception 
And here it is not only perception that is like this but feeling as well is neitherfeelingnornonfeeling consciousness is neitherconsciousnessnor nonconsciousness and contact is neithercontactnornoncontact
and the same description applies to the rest of the associated states
but it should be understood that this presentation is given in terms of perception
And the meaning should be illustrated by the similes beginning with the smearing of oil on the bowl
A novice smeared a bowl with oil it seems and laid it aside When it was time to drink gruel an elder told him to bring the bowl
He said Venerable sir there is oil in the bowl
But then when he was told Bring the oil novice I shall fill the oil tube he replied There is no oil venerable sir
Herein just as There is oil is in the sense of incompatibility with the gruel because it has been poured into the bowl
and just as There is no oil is in the sense of filling the oil tube etc
so too this perception is neither perception since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception and it is nor non perception because it is present in a subtle form as a residual formation
But in this context what is perceptions function
It is the perceiving of the object and it is the production of dispassion if that attainment and its object are made the objective field of insight
But it is not able to make the function of perceiving decisive as the heat element in tepid water is not able to make the function of burning decisive
and it is not able to produce dispassion by treatment of its objective field with insight in the way that perception is in the case of the other attainments
There is in fact no bhikkhu capable of reaching dispassion by comprehension of aggregates connected with the base consisting of neither perception nor non perception unless he has already done his interpreting with other aggregates  And furthermore when the venerable Sāriputta
or someone very wise and naturally gifted with insight as he was is able to do so
even he has to do it by means of comprehension of groups in this way So it seems these states not having been come to be having come to be they vanish  and not by means of actual direct insight into states one by one as they arise
Such is the subtlety that this attainment reaches
And this meaning should be illustrated by the simile of the water on the road as it was by the simile of the oilsmearing on the bowl
A novice was walking in front of an elder it seems who had set out on a journey He saw a little water and said There is water venerable sir remove your sandals
Then the elder said If there is water bring me the bathing cloth and let us bathe but the novice said There is none venerable sir
Herein just as There is water is in the sense of mere wetting of the sandals and There is none is in the sense of bathing
so too this perception is neither perception since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception and it is nor nonperception because it is present in a subtle form as a residual formation
And this meaning should be illustrated not only by these similes but by other appropriate ones as well
Enters upon and dwells in is already explained
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception as a meditation subject
Thus has the Peerless Helper told The fourfold immaterial state
To know these general matters too Will not be inappropriate
For these immaterial states
While reckoned by the surmounting of The object they are four the wise
Do not admit surmounting of Factors that one can recognize
Of these four the first is due to surmounting signs of materiality the second is due to surmounting space the third is due to surmounting the consciousness that occurred with that space as its object
and the fourth is due to surmounting the disappearance of the consciousness that occurred with that space as its object So they should be understood as four in number with the surmounting of the object in each case
But the wise do not admit any surmounting of jhāna factors
for there is no surmounting of factors in them as there is in the case of the finematerialsphere attainments
Each one has just the two factors namely equanimity and unification of mind
That being so
They progress in refinement each Is finer than the one before
Two figures help to make them known The cloth lengths and each palace floor
Suppose there were a fourstoried palace on its first floor the five objects of sense pleasure were provided in a very fine form as divine dancing singing and music and perfumes scents garlands food couches clothing etc
and on the second they were finer than that
and on the third finer still
and on the fourth they were finest of all
yet they are still only palace floors and there is no difference between them in the matter of their state as palace floors
it is with the progressive refinement of the five objects of sense pleasure that each one is finer than the one below
again suppose there were lengths of cloth of quadruple triple double and single thickness and made of thick thin thinner and very thin thread spun by one woman all the same measure in width and breadth
now although these lengths of cloth are four in number yet they measure the same in width and breadth there is no difference in their measurement
but in softness to the touch fineness and costliness each is finer than the one before so too although there are only the two factors in all four immaterial states that is to say equanimity and unification of mind still each one should be understood as finer than the one before with the progressive refinement of factors due to successful development
And for the fact that each one of them is finer than the last there is this figure
One hangs upon a tent that stands On filth on him another leans
Outside a third not leaning stands Against the last another leans
Between the four men and these states The correspondence then is shown
And so how each to each relates Can by a man of wit be known
This is how the meaning should be construed There was a tent in a dirty place it seems Then a man arrived and being disgusted with the dirt he rested himself on the tent with his hands and remained as if hung or hanging on to it
Then another man came and leant upon the man hanging on to the tent
Then another man came and thought The one who is hanging on to the tent and the one who is leaning upon him are both badly off
and if the tent falls they will certainly fallI think I shall stand outside
So instead of leaning upon the one leaning upon the first he remained outside
Then another arrived and taking account of the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one leaning upon him and fancying that the one standing outside was well placed he stood leaning upon him
Herein this is how it should be regarded The space from which the kasiṇa has been removed is like the tent in the dirty place The consciousness of the base consisting of boundless space which makes space its object owing to disgust with the sign of the finematerial is like the man who hangs on to the tent owing to disgust with the dirt The consciousness of the base consisting of boundless consciousness the occurrence of which is contingent upon the consciousness of the base consisting of boundless space whose object is space is like the man who leans upon the man who hangs on to the tent The consciousness of the base consisting of nothingness which instead of making the consciousness of the base consisting of boundless space its object has the nonexistence of that as its object is like the man who after considering the insecurity of those two does not lean upon the one hanging on to the tent but stands outside The consciousness of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception the occurrence of which is contingent upon the consciousness of the base consisting of nothingness which stands in a place outside in other words in the nonexistence of the past consciousness is like the man who stands leaning upon the lastnamed having considered the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one leaning upon him and fancying that the one standing outside is well placed
And while occurring in this way
It takes this for its object since There is no other one as good
As men depend upon a king Whose fault they see for livelihood
For although this consciousness of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception has seen the flaw in the base consisting of nothingness in this way This attainment has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as its near enemy notwithstanding that fact it takes it as its object in the absence of any other
Like what
As men for the sake of livelihood depend on kings whose faults they see
For just as for the sake of livelihood and because they cannot get a livelihood elsewhere people put up with some king ruler of all quarters who is unrestrained and harsh in bodily verbal and mental behaviour though they see his faults thus He is harshly behaved so too the consciousness of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception takes that base consisting of nothingness as its object in spite of seeing its faults in this way and it does so since it cannot find another better object
As one who mounts a lofty stair Leans on its railings for a prop
As one who climbs an airy peak Leans on the mountains very top
As one who stands on a crags edge Leans for support on his own knees
Each jhāna rests on that below For so it is with each of these
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the treatise on the Development of Concentration
called The Description of the Immaterial States
The tenth chapter
WORD DEFINITIONS Now comes the description of the development of the definition of the four elements which was listed as the one defining next to the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment 
Herein defining is determining by characterizing individual essences  The compound catudhātuvavatthāna is resolvable into catunnaṃ dhātūnaṃ vavatthānaṃ 
Attention given to elements the meditation subject consisting of elements and defining of the four elements all mean the same thing
This is given in two ways in brief and in detail
It is given in brief in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta 
and in detail in the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta  the Rāhulovāda Sutta  and the Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta 
TEXTS AND COMMENTARY IN BRIEF   Bhikkhus just as though a skilled butcher or butchers apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces so too bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this body however placed however disposed as consisting of elements In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element  
It is given in brief in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta for one of quick understanding whose meditation subject is elements as 
The meaning is this just as though a clever butcher or his apprentice who worked for his keep had killed a cow and divided it up and were seated at the crossroads reckoned as the intersection of the main roads going in the four directions having laid it out part by part so too a bhikkhu reviews the body however placed because it is in some one of the four postures
and however disposed because it is so placed thus In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
What is meant
Just as the butcher while feeding the cow bringing it to the shambles keeping it tied up after bringing it there slaughtering it and seeing it slaughtered and dead does not lose the perception cow so long as he has not carved it up and divided it into parts
but when he has divided it up and is sitting there he loses the perception cow and the perception meat occurs
he does not think I am selling cow or They are carrying cow away
but rather he thinks I am selling meat or They are carrying meat away so too this bhikkhu while still a foolish ordinary personboth formerly as a layman and as one gone forth into homelessnessdoes not lose the perception living being or man or person so long as he does not by resolution of the compact into elements review this body however placed however disposed as consisting of elements
But when he does review it as consisting of elements he loses the perception living being and his mind establishes itself upon elements
That is why the Blessed One said Bhikkhus just as though a skilled butcher  were seated at the crossroads  so too bhikkhus a bhikkhu  air element 
IN DETAIL  In the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta as follows And what is the internal earth element friends
Whatever there is internally in oneself that is hard harsh and clung to 
that is to say head hairs body hairs teeth nails skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidney heart liver midriff spleen lungs bowels entrails gorge dung or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is hard harsh and clung to this is called the internal earth element 
And What is the internal water element friends
Whatever there is internally in oneself that is water watery and clung to
that is to say bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urine or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is water watery and clung tothis is called the internal water element 
And What is the internal fire element friends
Whatever there is internally in oneself that is fire fiery and clung to
that is to say that whereby one is warmed ages and burns up and whereby what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted gets completely digested or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is fire fiery and clung tothis is called the internal fire element 
And What is the internal air element friends
Whatever there is internally in oneself that is air airy and clung to
that is to say upgoing winds down going winds winds in the belly winds in the bowels winds that course through all the limbs inbreath and outbreath or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is air airy and clung tothis is called the internal air element 
Here is the commentary on the words that are not clear Internally in oneself  both these words are terms for what is ones own  since what is ones own is what is produced in ones own self 
the meaning is included in ones continuity 
This is called internal because it occurs in self just as in the world speech among women is called speech belongingtowomen  And it is called in oneself because it occurs owing to self  
Hard rigid
Harsh rough
Herein the first is a word for the characteristic while the second is a word for the mode for the earth element is characterized as hard but its mode is rough which is why it is called harsh
Clung to taken firmly by kamma the meaning is firmly taken seized adhered to as I mine 
That is to say the word seyyathidaṃ is a particle
its meaning is What is that
Next showing what that is head hairs body hairs etc is said
And here the brain must be added since it has to be understood that the earth element needs to be described in twenty modes
Or whatever else the earth element included in the remaining three portions
It flows  flows on  to such and such a place as a state of streaming thus it is water 
The watery is what is gone among such various kinds of water as the kammaoriginated and so on
What is that
It is what has the water elements characteristic of cohesion
Fire is definable as heating  The fiery is what is gone  in the way already described among the kinds of fire 
What is that
It is what has the characteristic of heat
Whereby by means of which the fire element when excited this body is warmed becomes heated by the state of one day fever and so on
Ages whereby this body grows old reaches the decline of the faculties loss of strength wrinkles grayness and so on
Burns up whereby when excited it causes this body to burn
and the person cries out I am burning I am burning and longs for ghee a hundred times washed and for gosīsa sandalwood ointment etc and for the breeze of a fan
And whereby what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted gets completely digested whereby the boiled rice etc that is eaten or the beverage etc that is drunk or the hard food consisting of flour biscuits etc that is chewed the mango fruit honey molasses etc that is tasted gets completely cooked gets its juice etc extracted is the meaning
And here the first three kinds of fire element that is to say is warmed ages and burns up are of fourfold origination 
while the last is only kammaoriginated
Air is definable as blowing  The airy is what is gone  in the way already described among the kinds of air
What is that
It is what has the characteristic of distension
Upgoing winds winds mounting upwards that cause the occurrence of vomiting belching and so on
Downgoing winds winds descending downwards that expel excrement and urine
Winds in the belly winds outside the bowels
Winds in the bowels winds inside the bowels
Winds that course through all the limbs winds that produce flexing extending etc and are distributed over the limbs and the whole body by means of the network of veins 
Inbreath wind in the nostrils entering in
Outbreath wind in the nostrils issuing out
And here the first five are of fourfold origination
Inbreath and outbreath are consciousnessoriginated
In each instance the phrase or whatever else comprises respectively the water element the fire element or the air element included in the other three portions
So the four elements have been detailed in fortytwo aspects that is to say the earth element in twenty aspects the water element in twelve the fire element in four and the air element in six This firstly is the commentary on the texts here
METHOD OF DEVELOPMENT IN BRIEF As regards the method of development here however to discern the elements in detail in this way The head hairs are the earth element the body hairs are the earth element appears redundant to a bhikkhu of quick understanding
What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element
what has the characteristic of cohesion is the water element
what has the characteristic of ripening is the fire element
what has the characteristic of distending is the air element  though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in this way
But when one of not overquick understanding gives his attention to it in this way it appears obscure and unevident
and it only becomes plain to him if he gives his attention to it in the firstmentioned way
Why
Suppose two bhikkhus are reciting a text with many elided repetitions then the bhikkhu with the quicker understanding fills out the elided repetitions once or twice after which he goes on doing the recital with only the two end parts of the elisions
Here the one of less quick understanding says What is he reciting Why he does not even give one time to move ones lips If the recitation is done like this when shall we ever get familiar with the text
and so he does his recitation filling out each elision as it comes
Then the other says What is he reciting Why he never lets one get to the end of it If the recitation is done like this when shall we ever get to the end of it
So too the detailed discerning of the elements by head hairs etc appears redundant to one of quick understanding
though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in brief in this way What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element and so on
But when the other gives his attention to it in this way it appears obscure and unevident
and it only becomes plain to him if he gives his attention in detail by head hairs and so on
So firstly one of quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should go into solitary retreat Then he should advert to his own entire material body and discern the elements in brief in this way In this body what is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element
what is cohesion or fluidity is the water element
what is maturing or heat is the fire element
what is distension or movement is the air element And he should advert and give attention to it and review it again and again as earth element water element that is to say as mere elements not a living being and soulless
As he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in him which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of the elements and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual essences as its object
Or alternatively there are these four bodily parts mentioned by the General of the Dhamma the Elder Sāriputta for the purpose of showing the absence of any living being in the four great primary elements thus When a space is enclosed with bones and sinews and flesh and skin there comes to be the term material form  
And he should resolve each of these as a separate entity separating them out by the hand of knowledge and then discern them in the way already stated thus In these what is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element  And he should again and again advert to them give attention to them and review them as mere elements not a living being not a soul
As he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in him which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of the elements and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual essences as its object
This is the method of development when the definition of the elements is given in brief
METHOD OF DEVELOPMENT IN DETAIL The method given in detail should be understood in this way
A meditator of not overquick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should learn the elements in detail in the fortytwo aspects from a teacher and he should live in an abode of the kind already described Then when he has done all the duties he should go into solitary retreat and develop the meditation subject in four ways thus with constituents in brief with constituents by analysis with characteristics in brief and with characteristics by analysis
 WITH CONSTITUENTS IN BRIEF Herein how does he develop it with constituents in brief
Here a bhikkhu does his defining in this way In twenty of the parts what has the stiffened mode is the earth element
and he does his defining thus In twelve parts the liquid called water with the mode of cohesion is the water element
and he does his defining thus In four parts what matures is the fire element
and he does his defining thus In six parts what has the mode of distending is the air element
As he defines them in this way they become evident to him
As he again and again adverts to them and gives his attention to them concentration arises as access only
 WITH CONSTITUENTS BY ANALYSIS However if his meditation subject is not successful while he develops it in this way then he should develop it with constituents by analysis
How
Firstly the bhikkhu should carry out all the directions given for the thirtytwofold aspect in the description of mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject  namely the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving attention
and he should start with the verbal recitation in direct and reverse order of the skin pentad and so on without omitting any of it
The only difference is this there after giving attention to the head hairs etc as to colour shape direction location and delimitation the mind had to be fixed by means of repulsiveness  but here it is done by means of elements
Therefore at the end of each part after giving attention to head hairs etc each in the five ways beginning with colour  attention should be given as follows
These things called head hairs grow on the inner skin that envelops the skull
Herein just as when kuṇṭha grasses grow on the top of an anthill the top of the termitemound does not know Kuṇṭha grasses are growing on me nor do the kuṇṭha grasses know We are growing on the top of a termitemound so too the inner skin that covers the skull does not know Head hairs grow on me nor do the head hairs know We grow on inner skin that envelops a skull  These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what are called head hairs are a particular component of this body without thought morally indeterminate void not a living being rigid earth element
Body hairs grow on the inner skin that envelops the body
Herein just as when dabba grasses grow on the square in an empty village the square in the empty village does not know Dabba grasses grow on me nor do the dabba grasses know We grow on the square in an empty village so too the inner skin that envelops the body does not know Body hairs grow on me
nor do the body hairs know We grow on inner skin that envelops a body
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what are called body hairs are a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being rigid earth element
Nails grow on the tips of the fingers and toes
Herein just as when children play a game by piercing madhukafruit kernels with sticks the sticks do not know Madhukafruit kernels are put on us nor do the madhukafruit kernels know We are put on sticks so too the fingers and toes do not know Nails grow on our tips
nor do the nails know We grow on the tips of fingers and toes
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what are called nails are a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being rigid earth element
Teeth grow in the jaw bones
Herein just as when posts are placed by builders in stone sockets and fastened with some kind of cement the sockets do not know Posts are placed in us
nor do the posts know We are placed in sockets so too the jaw bones do not know Teeth grow in us
nor do the teeth know We grow in jaw bones
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what are called teeth are a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being rigid earth element
Skin is to be found covering the whole body
Herein just as when a big lute is covered with damp oxhide the lute does not know I am covered with damp oxhide
nor does the damp oxhide know A lute is covered by me so too the body does not know I am covered by skin
nor does the skin know A body is covered by me
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what is called skin is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being rigid earth element
Flesh is to be found plastered over the framework of bones
Herein just as when a wall is plastered with thick clay the wall does not know I am plastered with thick clay
nor does the thick clay know A wall is plastered with me so too the framework of bones does not know I am plastered with flesh consisting of nine hundred pieces of flesh
nor does the flesh know A framework of bones is plastered with me
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what is called flesh is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being rigid earth element
Sinews are to be found in the interior of the body binding the bones together
Herein just as when withies and sticks are bound together with creepers the withies and sticks do not know We are bound together with creepers
nor do the creepers know Withies and sticks are bound together by us so too the bones do not know We are bound by sinews
nor do the sinews know Bones are bound together by us
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what are called sinews are a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being rigid earth element
As to the bones the heel bone is to be found holding up the ankle bone
the ankle bone holding up the shin bone
the shin bone the thigh bone
the thigh bone the hip bone
the hip bone the backbone the backbone the neck bone
and the neck bone is to be found holding up the cranium bone
The cranium bone rests on the neck bone
the neck bone on the backbone
the backbone on the hip bone
the hip bone on the thigh bone
the thigh bone on the shin bone
the shin bone on the ankle bone
the ankle bone on the heel bone
Herein just as when bricks timber or blocks of dried cow dung are built up those below do not know We each stand holding up those above us
nor do those above know We each rest on those below us so too the heel bone does not know I stand holding up the ankle bone
nor does the ankle bone know I stand holding up the shin bone
nor does the shin bone know I stand holding up the thigh bone
nor does the thigh bone know I stand holding up the hip bone
nor does the hip bone know I stand holding up the backbone
nor does the backbone know I stand holding up the neck bone
nor does the neck bone know I stand holding up the cranium bone
nor does the cranium bone know I rest on the neck bone
nor does the neck bone know I rest on the backbone
nor does the backbone know I rest on the hip bone
nor does the hip bone know I rest on the thigh bone
nor does the thigh bone know I rest on the shin bone
nor does the shin bone know I rest on the ankle bone
nor does the ankle bone know I rest on the heel bone
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing
So what are called bones are a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being rigid earth element
Bone marrow is to be found inside the various bones
Herein just as when boiled bamboo sprouts etc are put inside bamboo joints etc the bamboo joints etc do not know Bamboo sprouts etc are put in us
nor do the bamboo sprouts etc know We are inside bamboo joints etc so too the bones do not know Marrow is inside us

When he has given his attention in this way to the body hairs etc he should then give his attention to the four fire components thus That whereby one is warmed this is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is fire element in the mode of maturing  That whereby one ages  That whereby one burns up  That whereby what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted becomes completely digested this is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is fire element in the mode of maturing 
After that having discovered the upgoing winds as upgoing the downgoing winds as downgoing the winds in the belly as in the belly the winds in the bowels as in the bowels the winds that course through all the limbs as coursing through all the limbs and inbreath and out breath as inbreath and outbreath he should give his attention to these six air components in this way What is called upgoing winds is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is air element in the mode of distending What is called downgoing winds  What is called winds in the belly  What is called winds in the bowels  What is called winds that course through all the limbs  What is called inbreath and outbreath is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is air element in the mode of distending
As he gives his attention in this way the elements become evident to him
As he adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already described
 WITH CHARACTERISTICS IN BRIEF But if his meditation subject is still not successful when he gives his attention to it in this way then he should develop it with characteristics in brief
How
In the twenty components the characteristic of stiffenedness should be defined as the earth element
and the characteristic of cohesion which is there too as the water element
and the characteristic of maturing  which is there too as the fire element
and the characteristic of distension which is there too as the air element
In the twelve components the characteristic of cohesion should be defined as the water
element the characteristic of maturing  which is there too as the fire element
the characteristic of distension which is there too as the air element
and the characteristic of stiffenedness which is there too as the earth element
In the four components the characteristic of maturing should be defined as the fire element
the characteristic of distension unresolvable from it as the air element
the characteristic of stiffenedness as the earth element
and the characteristic of cohesion as the water element
In the six components the characteristic of distension should be defined as the air element
the characteristic of stiffenedness there too as the earth element
the characteristic of cohesion as the water element
and the characteristic of maturing as the fire element
As he defines them in this way the elements become evident to him
As he adverts to them and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already stated
 WITH CHARACTERISTICS BY ANALYSIS However if he still does not succeed with his meditation subject when he gives his attention to it in this way then he should develop it with characteristics by analysis
How
After discerning head hairs etc in the way already described the characteristic of stiffenedness in head hairs should be defined as the earth element
the characteristic of cohesion there too as the water element
the characteristic of maturing as the fire element
and the characteristic of distension as the air element
The four elements should be defined in this way in the case of each component
As he defines them in this way the elements become evident to him
As he adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already described
METHOD OF DEVELOPMENT IN DETAIL The method given in detail should be understood in this way
A meditator of not overquick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should learn the elements in detail in the fortytwo aspects from a teacher and he should live in an abode of the kind already described Then when he has done all the duties he should go into solitary retreat and develop the meditation subject in four ways thus with constituents in brief with constituents by analysis with characteristics in brief and with characteristics by analysis
 WITH CONSTITUENTS IN BRIEF Herein how does he develop it with constituents in brief
Here a bhikkhu does his defining in this way In twenty of the parts what has the stiffened mode is the earth element
and he does his defining thus In twelve parts the liquid called water with the mode of cohesion is the water element
and he does his defining thus In four parts what matures is the fire element
and he does his defining thus In six parts what has the mode of distending is the air element
As he defines them in this way they become evident to him
As he again and again adverts to them and gives his attention to them concentration arises as access only

When he has given his attention in this way to the body hairs etc he should then give his attention to the four fire components thus That whereby one is warmed this is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is fire element in the mode of maturing  That whereby one ages  That whereby one burns up  That whereby what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted becomes completely digested this is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is fire element in the mode of maturing 
After that having discovered the upgoing winds as upgoing the downgoing winds as downgoing the winds in the belly as in the belly the winds in the bowels as in the bowels the winds that course through all the limbs as coursing through all the limbs and inbreath and out breath as inbreath and outbreath he should give his attention to these six air components in this way What is called upgoing winds is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is air element in the mode of distending What is called downgoing winds  What is called winds in the belly  What is called winds in the bowels  What is called winds that course through all the limbs  What is called inbreath and outbreath is a particular component of this body without thought indeterminate void not a living being it is air element in the mode of distending
As he gives his attention in this way the elements become evident to him
As he adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already described
 WITH CHARACTERISTICS IN BRIEF But if his meditation subject is still not successful when he gives his attention to it in this way then he should develop it with characteristics in brief
How
In the twenty components the characteristic of stiffenedness should be defined as the earth element
and the characteristic of cohesion which is there too as the water element
and the characteristic of maturing  which is there too as the fire element
and the characteristic of distension which is there too as the air element
In the twelve components the characteristic of cohesion should be defined as the water
element the characteristic of maturing  which is there too as the fire element
the characteristic of distension which is there too as the air element
and the characteristic of stiffenedness which is there too as the earth element
In the four components the characteristic of maturing should be defined as the fire element
the characteristic of distension unresolvable from it as the air element
the characteristic of stiffenedness as the earth element
and the characteristic of cohesion as the water element
In the six components the characteristic of distension should be defined as the air element
the characteristic of stiffenedness there too as the earth element
the characteristic of cohesion as the water element
and the characteristic of maturing as the fire element
As he defines them in this way the elements become evident to him
As he adverts to them and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already stated
 WITH CHARACTERISTICS BY ANALYSIS However if he still does not succeed with his meditation subject when he gives his attention to it in this way then he should develop it with characteristics by analysis
How
After discerning head hairs etc in the way already described the characteristic of stiffenedness in head hairs should be defined as the earth element
the characteristic of cohesion there too as the water element
the characteristic of maturing as the fire element
and the characteristic of distension as the air element
The four elements should be defined in this way in the case of each component
As he defines them in this way the elements become evident to him
As he adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises in him in the way already described
                             
                  
          
                                                   
                         
         
                         
                       
                                                                    
                             
                             
                           
   
      
              
       
         
     
                            
   
                  
         
       
    
                  
        
       
                     
  
     
                                                       
     
                  
       
                                     
                                        
     
          
     
         
                            
                   
                
                           
                       
              
               
       
     
     
    
                                      
                               
                
    
At one time it seems when the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had heard the Blessed One preaching the Dhamma he invited him thus Venerable sir take alms at our house together with five hundred bhikkhus and then he departed
The Blessed One consented When the rest of that day and part of the night had passed he surveyed the tenthousandfold world element in the early morning
Then the royal nāga called Nandopananda came within the range of his knowledge
The Blessed One considered him thus This royal nāga has come into the range of my knowledge Has he the potentiality for development  Then he saw that he had wrong view and no confidence in the Three Jewels He considered thus Who is there that can cure him of his wrong view  He saw that the Elder Mahā Moggallāna could
Then when the night had turned to dawn after he had seen to the needs of the body he addressed the venerable nanda nanda tell five hundred bhikkhus that the Perfect One is going on a visit to the gods 
It was on that day that they had got a banqueting place ready for Nandopananda
He was sitting on a divine couch with a divine white parasol held aloft surrounded by the three kinds of dancers and a retinue of nāgas and surveying the various kinds of food and drink served up in divine vessels
Then the Blessed One so acted that the royal nāga saw him as he proceeded directly above his canopy in the direction of the divine world of the Thirtythree accompanied by the five hundred bhikkhus
Then this evil view arose in Nandopananda the royal nāga There go these baldheaded monks in and out of the realm of the Thirtythree directly over my realm I will not have them scattering the dirt off their feet on our heads  He got up and he went to the foot of Sineru Changing his form he surrounded it seven times with his coils Then he spread his hood over the realm of the Thirty three and made everything there invisible
The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said to the Blessed One Venerable sir standing in this place formerly I used to see Sineru and the ramparts of Sineru and the Thirtythree and the Vejayanta Palace and the flag over the Vejayanta Palace
Venerable sir what is the cause what is the reason why I now see neither Sineru nor  the flag over the Vejayanta Palace
This royal nāga called Nandopananda is angry with us Raṭṭhapāla He has surrounded Sineru seven times with his coils and he stands there covering us with his raised hood making it dark
I will tame him venerable sir
But the Blessed One would not allow it
Then the venerable Bhaddiya and the venerable Rāhula and all the bhikkhus in turn offered to do so
but the Blessed One would not allow it
Last of all the venerable Mahā Moggallāna said I will tame him venerable sir
The Blessed One allowed it saying Tame him Moggallāna
The elder abandoned that form and assumed the form of a huge royal nāga and he surrounded Nandopananda fourteen times with his coils and raised his hood above the others hood and he squeezed him against Sineru
The royal nāga produced smoke
The elder said There is smoke not only in your body but also in mine and he produced smoke
The royal nāgas smoke did not distress the elder
but the elders smoke distressed the royal nāga
Then the royal nāga produced flames
The elder said There is fire not only in your body but also in mine and he produced flames
The royal nāgas fire did not distress the elder
but the elders fire distressed the royal nāga
The royal nāga thought He has squeezed me against Sineru and he has produced both smoke and flames  Then he asked Sir who are you
I am Moggallāna Nanda
Venerable sir resume your proper bhikkhus state
The elder abandoned that form and he went into his right ear and came out from his left ear then he went into his left ear and came out from his right ear Likewise he went into his right nostril and came out from his left nostril then he went into his left nostril and came out from his right nostril
Then the royal nāga opened his mouth
The elder went inside it and he walked up and down east and west inside his belly
The Blessed One said Moggallāna Moggallāna beware this is a mighty nāga
The elder said Venerable sir the four roads to power have been developed by me repeatedly practiced made the vehicle made the basis established consolidated and properly undertaken I can tame not only Nandopananda venerable sir but a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand royal nāgas like Nandopananda 
The royal nāga thought When he went in the first place I did not see him But now when he comes out I shall catch him between my fangs and chew him up  Then he said Venerable sir come out Do not keep troubling me by walking up and down inside my belly
The elder came out and stood outside
The royal nāga recognized him and blew a blast from his nose
The elder attained the fourth jhāna
and the blast failed to move even a single hair on his body
The other bhikkhus would it seems have been able to perform all the miracles up to now but at this point they could not have attained with so rapid a response which is why the Blessed One would not allow them to tame the royal nāga
The royal nāga thought I have been unable to move even a single hair on this monks body with the blast from my nose He is a mighty monk
The elder abandoned that form and having assumed the form of a supaṇṇa he pursued the royal nāga demonstrating the supaṇṇas blast
The royal nāga abandoned that form and having assumed the form of a young brahman he said Venerable sir I go for refuge to you and he paid homage at the elders feet
The elder said The Master has come Nanda come let us go to him  So having tamed the royal nāga and deprived him of his poison he went with him to the Blessed Ones presence
The royal nāga paid homage to the Blessed One and said Venerable sir I go for refuge to you
The Blessed One said May you be happy royal nāga  Then he went followed by the Community of Bhikkhus to Anāthapiṇḍikas house
Anāthapiṇḍika said Venerable sir why have you come so late
There was a battle between Moggallāna and Nandopananda
Who won venerable sir Who was defeated
Moggallāna won Nanda was defeated
Anāthapiṇḍika said Venerable sir let the Blessed One consent to my providing meals for seven days in a single series and to my honouring the elder for seven days  Then for seven days he accorded great honour to the five hundred bhikkhus with the Enlightened One at their head
So it was with reference to this enlarged form created during this taming of Nandopananda that it was said When he makes his body big does it not then become big as in the case of the Elder Mahā Moggallāna  
Although this was said the bhikkhus observed He enlarges only what is not clung to supported by what is clung to
And only this is correct here 
Herein all kinds of states whatsoever that have the characteristic of being molested by cold etc taken all together should be understood as the materiality aggregate
That is of one kind with the characteristic of being molested   It is also of two kinds when classed as primary entity and derived by clinging 
Herein primary materiality is of four kinds as the earth element water element fire element and air element
Their characteristic function and manifestation have been given under the definition of the four elements 
but as to the proximate cause each has the other three as its proximate cause
 Derived materiality is of twentyfour kinds as eye ear nose tongue body visible datum sound odour flavour femininity faculty masculinity faculty life faculty heartbasis bodily intimation verbal intimation space element lightness of matter malleability of matter wieldiness of matter growth of matter continuity of matter ageing of matter impermanence of matter and physical nutriment
Herein the eyes characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements that is ready for the impact of visible data or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by kamma sourcing from desire to see  Its function is to pick up an object among visible data It is manifested as the footing of eye consciousness Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from desire to see
 The ears characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements that is ready for the impact of sounds or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by kamma sourcing from desire to hear Its function is to pick up an object among sounds It is manifested as the footing of earconsciousness Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from desire to hear
 The noses characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements that is ready for the impact of odours or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by kamma sourcing from desire to smell Its function is to pick up an object among odours It is manifested as the footing of noseconsciousness Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from desire to smell
The tongues characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements that is ready for the impact of flavours or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by kamma sourcing from desire to taste Its function is to pick up an object among flavours It is manifested as the footing of tongueconsciousness Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from desire to taste
The bodys characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements that is ready for the impact of tangible data or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by kamma sourcing from desire to touch Its function is to pick up an object among tangible data It is manifested as the footing of body consciousness Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from desire to touch
Some however say that the eye is sensitivity of primary elements that have fire in excess and that the ear nose and tongue are sensitivity of primary elements that have respectively air earth and water in excess and that the body is that of all four equally
Others say that the eye is sensitivity of those that have fire in excess and that the ear nose tongue and body are sensitivity of those that have respectively aperture air water and earth in excess
They should be asked to quote a sutta
They will certainly not find one
But some give as their reason that it is because these several sensitivities are respectively aided by visible data etc as qualities of fire and so on
They should be asked But who has said that visible data etc are qualities of fire and so on
For it is not possible to say of primary elements which remain always inseparable that This is a quality of this one that is a quality of that one 
Then they may say Just as you assume from excess of some primary element in such and such material things the respective functions of upholding  etc for earth etc so from finding visibility etc respectively in a state of excess in material things that have fire in excess one may assume that visible data etc are respectively qualities of these
They should be told We might assume it if there were more odour in cotton which has earth in excess than in fermented liquor which has water in excess and if the colour of cold water were weaker than the colour of hot water which has heat in excess
But since neither of these is a fact you should therefore give up conjecturing the difference to be in the supporting primary elements Just as the natures of visible objects etc are dissimilar from each other though there is no difference in the primaries that form a single group so too are eyesensitivity etc though no other cause of their difference exists  This is how it should be taken
But what is it that is not common to them all
It is the kamma itself that is the reason for their difference
Therefore their difference is due to difference of kamma not to difference of primary elements
for if there were difference of primary elements sensitivity itself would not arise
since the Ancients have said Sensitivity is of those that are equal not of those that are unequal
Now among these sensitivities thus possessed of difference due to differ ence of kamma the eye and the ear apprehend noncontiguous objective fields since consciousness is caused even if the supporting primaries of the objective fields do not adhere to the faculties own supporting primaries
The nose tongue and body apprehend contiguous objective fields because consciousness is caused only if their objective fields primaries adhere to their own supporting primaries that is to say if the objective fields primaries adhere as support in the case of odours and flavours and themselves directly in the case of tangible data which are identical with the three primaries excluding water
There is what is called the eye in the world That looks like a blue lotus petal and is surrounded by black eyelashes and varied with dark and light circles
The eye sensitivity as meant here is to be found in the place in the middle of the black circle surrounded by the white circle in that feature of the eye with its accessories where there appears the image of the bodies of those who stand in front of it It pervades the eyes seven layers like oil sprinkled on seven layers of cotton It is assisted by the four primary elements whose respective functions are upholding cohering maturing and moving as a warrior prince is by four nurses whose functions are holding bathing dressing and fanning It is consolidated by temperature consciousness and nutriment it is maintained by life it is furnished with colour odour flavour etc  it is the size of a mere louses head and it duly serves both as physical basis and as door for eyeconsciousness and the rest of the consciousness of the cognitive series
And this is said by the General of the Dhamma
The sensitivity with which he sees a visible object
Is small and it is subtle too no bigger than a louses head 
The ear sensitivity is to be found inside the feature of the earhole with its accessories in the place that is shaped like a fingerstall and surrounded by fine brown hairs It is assisted by the elements in the way aforesaid It is consolidated by temperature consciousness and nutriment it is maintained by life it is equipped with colour etc and it duly serves both as physical basis and as door for earconsciousness and the rest
The nose sensitivity is to be found inside the feature of the nosehole with its accessories in the place shaped like a goats hoof It has assistance consolidation and maintenance in the way aforesaid and it duly serves both as physical basis and as door for noseconsciousness and the rest
 The tongue sensitivity is to be found in the middle of the feature of the tongue with its accessories in the place shaped like a lotus petal tip It has assistance consolidation and maintenance in the way aforesaid and it duly serves both as physical basis and as door for tongueconsciousness and the rest
in this physical body where there is matter that is clung to 
the body sensitivity is to be found everywhere like a liquid that soaks a layer of cotton It has assistance consolidation and maintenance in the way aforesaid too and it duly serves both as physical basis and as door for bodyconsciousness and the rest
Like snakes crocodiles birds dogs and jackals that gravitate to their own respective resorts that is to say termitemounds water space villages and charnel grounds so the eye etc should be regarded as gravitating to their own respective resorts that is to say visible data and so on 
As regards visible data etc which come next a visible datum has the characteristic of impinging on the eye Its function is to be the objective field of eyeconsciousness It is manifested as the resort of that too Its proximate cause is the four great primaries
And all the following kinds of derived materiality are the same as this
Where there is a difference we shall mention it
This visible datum is of various kinds as blue yellow and so on
Sound has the characteristic of impinging on the ear Its function is to be the object of earconsciousness It is manifested as the resort of that too
It is of various kinds as drum sound tabour sound and so on
Odour has the characteristic of impinging on the nose Its function is to be the object of noseconsciousness It is manifested as the resort of that too
It is of various kinds as root odour heartwood odour and so on
Flavour has the characteristic of impinging on the tongue Its function is to be the object of tongueconsciousness It is manifested as the resort of that too
It is of various kinds as root flavour trunk flavour and so on
The femininity faculty has the female sex as its characteristic Its function is to show that this is a female  It is manifested as the reason for the mark sign work and ways of the female 
The masculinity faculty has the male sex as its characteristic Its function is to show that this is a male  It is manifested as the reason for the mark sign work and ways of the male 
Both these last are coextensive with the whole body as bodysensitivity is But it does not follow that they have to be called either located in the space where bodysensitivity is located or located in the space where that is not located  Like the natures of visible data etc these are not confoundable one with the other 
The life faculty has the characteristic of maintaining conascent kinds of matter Its function is to make them occur It is manifested in the establishing of their presence Its proximate cause is primary elements that are to be sustained
And although it has the capacity consisting in the characteristic of maintaining etc yet it only maintains conascent kinds of matter at the moment of presence as water does lotuses and so on
Though states arise due to their own conditions it maintains them as a wetnurse does a prince
And it occurs itself only through its connection with the states that occur like a pilot
it does not cause occurrence after dissolution because of its own absence and that of what has to be made to occur
It does not prolong presence at the moment of dissolution because it is itself dissolving
like the flame of a lamp when the wick and the oil are getting used up
But it must not be regarded as destitute of power to maintain make occur and make present because it does accomplish each of these functions at the moment stated  
The heartbasis has the characteristic of being the support for the mindelement and for the mindconsciousnesselement Its function is to observe them It is manifested as the carrying of them
It is to be found in dependence on the blood of the kind described in the treatise on mindfulness of the body  inside the heart It is assisted by the primaries with their functions of upholding etc it is consolidated by temperature consciousness and nutriment it is maintained by life and it serves as physical basis for the mindelement and mindconsciousness element and for the states associated with them 
Bodily intimation is the mode and the alteration in the consciousnessoriginated air element that causes the occurrence of moving forward etc which mode and alteration are a condition for the stiffening upholding and moving of the conascent material body Its function is to display intention It is manifested as the cause of bodily excitement Its proximate cause is the consciousnessoriginated air element
But it is called bodily intimation because it is the cause of the intimating of intention by means of bodily excitement and because it is itself intimatable through the body in other words through that bodily excitement
Moving forward etc should be understood to occur owing to the movement of the kinds of matter that are temperatureborn etc which are interlocked with the consciousnessborn kinds moved by that intimation 
Verbal intimation is the mode and the alteration in the consciousnessoriginated earth element that causes that occurrence of speech utterance which mode and alteration are a condition for the knocking together of clungto matter  Its function is to display intention It is manifested as the cause of the voice in speech Its proximate cause is the consciousnessoriginated earth element
But it is called verbal intimation because it is the cause of the intimating of intention by means of the voice in speech and because it is itself intimatable through speech in other words through that voice in speech
For just as on seeing a sign for water consisting of an ox skull etc hung up in the forest it is intimated that there is water here so too on noticing either the bodily shaking or the voice in speech thus they intimate  
The space element has the characteristic of delimiting matter Its function is to display the boundaries of matter It is manifested as the confines of matter or it is manifested as untouchedness as the state of gaps and apertures  Its proximate cause is the matter delimited
And it is on account of it that one can say of material things delimited that this is above below around that 
Lightness of matter has the characteristic of nonslowness Its function is to dispel heaviness of matter It is manifested as light transformability Its proximate cause is light matter 
Malleability of matter has the characteristic of nonstiffenedness Its function is to dispel stiffness of matter It is manifested as nonopposition to any kind of action Its proximate cause is malleable matter 
Wieldiness of matter has the characteristic of wieldiness that is favourable to bodily action Its function is to dispel unwieldiness It is manifested as non weakness Its proximate cause is wieldy matter 
These three however are not found apart from each other Still their difference may be understood as follows Lightness of matter is alteration of matter such as any light state in material instances as in one who is healthy any nonslowness any manner of light transformability in them which is originated by conditions that prevent any disturbance of elements capable of creating sluggishness of matter
Malleability of matter is alteration of matter such as any malleable state in material instances as in a wellpounded hide any pliable manner consisting in amenableness to exercise of power over them in all kinds of work without distinction which is originated by conditions that prevent any disturbance of elements capable of creating stiffness of matter
Wieldiness of matter is alteration of matter such as any wieldy state in material instances as in wellrefined gold any manner in them consisting in favourableness to the work of the body which is originated by conditions that prevent any disturbance of elements capable of creating unfavourableness to the work of the body
Growth of matter has the characteristic of setting up Its function is to make material instances emerge in the first instance It is manifested as launching or it is manifested as the completed state Its proximate cause is grown matter
Continuity of matter has the characteristic of occurrence Its function is to anchor It is manifested as noninterruption Its proximate cause is matter that is to be anchored
Both of these are terms for matter at its birth but owing to difference of mode and according to different persons susceptibility to instruction the teaching in the summary in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī is given as growth and continuity 
but since there is here no difference in meaning consequently in the description of these words the setting up of the sensebases is the growth of matter and
the growth of matter is the continuity of matter is said 
And in the Commentary after saying It is genesis that is called setting up increase that is called growth occurrence that is called continuity this simile is given Genesis as setting up is like the time when water comes up in a hole dug in a river bank increase as growth is like the time when it fills the hole occurrence as continuity is like the time when it overflows
And at the end of the simile it is said So what is stated
Setting up is stated by sensebase sensebase is stated by setting up
Consequently it is the first genesis of material instances that is their setting up
the genesis also of others that are generated in addition to those is growth since it appears in the aspect of increase
the repeated genesis also of others that are generated in addition to those is continuity since it appears in the aspect of anchoring This is how it should be understood to have been declared thus
Ageing has the characteristic of maturing material instances Its function is to lead on towards their termination It is manifested as the loss of newness without the loss of individual essence like oldness in paddy Its proximate cause is matter that is maturing 
This is said with reference to the kind of ageing that is evident through seeing alteration in teeth etc as their brokenness and so on 
But that of immaterial states which has no such visible alteration is called hidden ageing And that in earth water rocks the moon the sun etc is called incessant ageing
Impermanence of matter has the characteristic of complete breaking up Its function is to make material instances subside It is manifested as destruction and fall  Its proximate cause is matter that is completely breaking up
Physical nutriment has the characteristic of nutritive essence Its function is to feed kinds of matter It is manifested as consolidating Its proximate cause is a physical basis that must be fed with physical food
It is a term for the nutritive essence by means of which living beings sustain themselves 
These firstly are the material instances that have been handed down in the texts
But in the Commentary others have been added as follows matter as power matter as procreation matter as birth matter as sickness and in the opinion of some matter as torpor  In the first place matter as torpor is rejected as nonexistent by the words Surely thou art a sage enlightened There are no hindrances in thee 
As to the rest matter as sickness is included by ageing and by impermanence matter as birth by growth and continuity matter as procreation by the water element and matter as power by the air element
So taken separately not even one of these exists this was the agreement reached
So this derived matter of twentyfour sorts and the aforesaid matter of the primary elements which is of four sorts together amount to twentyeight sorts neither more nor less
And all that matter of twentyeight sorts is of one kind as notrootcause rootcauseless dissociated from rootcause with conditions mundane subject to cankers  and so on
It is of two kinds as internal and external gross and subtle far and near produced and unproduced sensitive matter and insensitive matter faculty and nonfaculty clung to and notclung to and so on
Herein the five kinds beginning with the eye are internal because they occur as an integral part of the selfhood  the rest are external because they are external to that selfhood 
The nine beginning with the eye and the three elements excepting the water element making twelve kinds in all are to be taken as gross because of impinging the rest are subtle because they are the opposite of that
What is subtle is far because it is difficult to penetrate the other is near because it is easy to penetrate
The eighteen kinds of matter that is to say the four elements the thirteen beginning with the eye and physical nutriment are produced because they can be discerned through their own individual essences having exceeded the purely conceptual states of matter as delimitation matter as alteration and matter as characteristic  the rest being the opposite are unproduced
The five kinds beginning with the eye are sensitive matter through their being conditions for the apprehension of visible data etc because they are as it were bright like the surface of a looking glass the rest are insensitive matter because they are the opposite of that
Sensitive matter itself together with the three beginning with the femininity faculty is faculty in the sense of predominance the rest are notfaculty because they are the opposite of that
What we shall later describe as kammaborn is clung to because that is clung to that is acquired by kamma The rest are notclung to because they are the opposite of that
Again all matter is of three kinds according to the visible triad the kammaborn triad etc 
Herein as regards the gross a visible datum is visible with impact the rest are invisible with impact
all the subtle kinds are invisible without impact
So firstly it is of three kinds according to the visible triad
According to the kammaborn triad etc however that born from kamma is kammaborn that born from a condition other than that is notkammaborn that not born from anything is neitherkammabornnornotkammaborn
That born from consciousness is consciousnessborn that born from a condition other than consciousness is notconsciousnessborn that not born from anything is neitherconsciousnessbornnornotconsciousnessborn That born from nutriment is nutrimentborn that born from a condition other than that is notnutrimentborn that not born from anything is neithernutriment bornnornotnutrimentborn
That born from temperature is temperatureborn that born from a condition other than that is nottemperatureborn that not born from anything is neither temperaturebornnornottemperatureborn So it is of three kinds according to the kammaborn triad and so on
Again it is of four kinds as seen etc as concrete matter etc and as the physical basis tetrads and so on
Herein the visibledata base is seen because it is the objective field of seeing The sound base is heard because it is the objective field of hearing The three that is to say odours flavours and tangible data are sensed because they are the objective fields of faculties that take contiguous objective fields The rest are cognized because they are the objective field of consciousness only So firstly it is of four kinds according to the seen etc tetrad 
Here however produced matter is concrete matter the spaceelement is delimiting matter those from bodily intimation up to wieldiness are matter as alteration birth ageing and dissolution are matter as characteristic So it is of four kinds as concrete matter and so on
Here however what is called the materiality of the heart is physical basis not door 
the two intimations are door not physical basis
sensitive matter is both physical basis and door
the rest are neither physical basis nor door So it is four kinds according to the physical basis tetrad
Again it is of five kinds as born of one born of two born of three born of four and not born of anything
Herein what is kammaborn only or consciousnessborn only is called born of one
Of these materiality of the faculties together with the heartbasis is kamma born only
the two intimations are consciousnessborn only
But what is born now of consciousness and now of temperature is called born of two That is the sound base only
What is born of temperature consciousness and nutriment is called born of three But that is the three beginning with lightness only
What is born from the four beginning with kamma is called born of four That is all the rest except matter as characteristic 
But matter as characteristic is called not born of anything
Why
Because there is no arising of arising and the other two are the mere maturing and breakup of what has arisen
Though in the passage The visibledata base the sound base the odour base the flavour base the tangibledata base the space element the water element lightness of matter malleability of matter wieldiness of matter growth of matter continuity of matter and physical foodthese states are consciousnessoriginated and so on a state of birth that is growth being born from somewhere can be understood as allowable since the point of view here is the moment when the conditions that are giving birth to the kinds of materiality are exercising their function
This firstly is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the materiality aggregate
Among the remaining aggregates however whatever has the characteristic of being felt should be understood all taken together as the feeling aggregate and whatever has the characteristic of perceiving all taken together as the perception aggregate and whatever has the characteristic of forming all taken together as the formations aggregate and whatever has the characteristic of cognizing all taken together as the consciousness aggregate
Herein since the rest are easy to understand when the consciousness aggregate has been understood we shall therefore begin with the commentary on the consciousness aggregate
Whatever has the characteristic of cognizing should be understood all taken together as the consciousness aggregate was said above
And what has the characteristic of cognizing 
Consciousness  according as it is said It cognizes friend that is why consciousness is said 
The words viññāṇa  citta  and mano are one in meaning
THE  KINDS OF CONSCIOUSNESSSEE TABLE III That same consciousness though one in its individual essence with the characteristic of cognizing is threefold according to kind namely profitable unprofitable and indeterminate 
I Herein the profitable is fourfold according to plane namely of the sense sphere of the finematerial sphere of the immaterial sphere and supramundane 
I A Herein  that of the sense sphere is eightfold being classified according to joy equanimity knowledge and prompting
that is to say when accompaniedbyjoy it is either associatedwithknowledge and unprompted or prompted or it is dissociatedfromknowledge and likewise unprompted or prompted
and when accompaniedbyequanimity it is either associatedwithknowledge and prompted or unprompted or it is dissociatedfromknowledge and likewise unprompted or prompted
When a man is happy on encountering an excellent gift to be given or recipient etc or some such cause for joy and by placing right view foremost that occurs in the way beginning There is merit in giving  he unhesitatingly and unurged by others performs such merit as giving etc then his consciousness is accompanied by joy associated with knowledge and unprompted
But when a man is happy and content in the way aforesaid and while placing right view foremost yet he does it hesitantly through lack of free generosity etc or urged on by others then his consciousness is of the same kind as the last but prompted
for in this sense prompting is a term for a prior effort exerted by himself or others
But when young children have a natural habit due to seeing the behaviour of relatives and are joyful on seeing bhikkhus and at once give them whatever they have in their hands or pay homage then the third kind of consciousness arises
But when they behave like this on being urged by their relatives Give pay homage then the fourth kind of consciousness arises
 But when the consciousnesses are devoid of joy in these four instances through encountering no excellence in the gift to be given or in the recipient etc or through want of any such cause for joy then the remaining four which are accompanied by equanimity arise
So sensesphere profitable consciousness should be understood as of eight kinds being classed according to joy equanimity knowledge and prompting
I B The consciousness of the finematerial sphere is fivefold being classed according to association with the jhāna factors
That is to say the first is associated with applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss and concentration the second leaves out applied thought from that the third leaves out sustained thought from that the fourth makes happiness fade away from that the fifth is associated with equanimity and concentration bliss having subsided
I C That of the immaterial sphere is fourfold by association with the four immaterial states
for the first is associated with the jhāna of the base consisting of boundless space in the way aforesaid while  the second third and fourth are respectively associated with those of the base consisting of boundless consciousness and so on
I D The supramundane is fourfold  by association with the four paths So firstly profitable consciousness itself is of twentyone kinds
II The unprofitable is one kind according to plane being only of the sense sphere It is of three kinds according to root as rooted in greed rooted in hate and rooted in delusion
II Herein  that rooted in greed is of eight kinds being classed according to joy equanimity false view and prompting
that is to say when accompanied by joy it is either associatedwithfalseview and unprompted or prompted or it is dissociatedfromfalseview and likewise unprompted or prompted
and when accompaniedbyequanimity it is either associated withfalseview and unprompted or prompted or it is dissociatedfrom falseview and likewise unprompted or prompted
When a man is happy and content in placing wrong view foremost of the sort beginning There is no danger in sense desires  and either enjoys sense desires with consciousness that in its own individual essence is eager without being urged or believes auspicious sights etc have a real substantial core then the first kind of unprofitable consciousness arises 
when it is with consciousness that is sluggish and urged on then it is the second kind 
But when a man is happy and content only without placing wrong view foremost and indulges in sexual intercourse or covets others good fortune or steals others goods with consciousness that in its own individual essence is eager without being urged then it is the third kind 
When it is with consciousness that is sluggish and urged on then it is the fourth kind 
But when the consciousnesses are devoid of joy in these four instances through encountering no excellence in the sense desires or through want of any such cause for joy then the remaining four which are accompanied by equanimity arise So that rooted in greed should be understood as of eight kinds being classed according to joy equanimity false view and prompting
II That rooted in hate is of two kinds  being accompaniedbygrief and associatedwithresentment it is either prompted or unprompted It should be understood to occur at the times when consciousness is either keen if unprompted or sluggish if prompted in the killing of living things and so on
II That rooted in delusion is of two kinds  being accompaniedby equanimity it is either associatedwith uncertainty or associatedwithagitation
It should be understood to occur at the time of indecision or of distraction So unprofitable consciousness is of twelve kinds
III The indeterminate is of two kinds resultant and functional
Herein III i resultant is of four kinds according to plane namely of the sense sphere of the finematerial sphere of the immaterial sphere and supramundane
Herein III i A that of the sense sphere is of two kinds namely profitable result and unprofitable result
And III i A the profitable resultant is of two kinds namely without rootcause and with rootcause
III i A i Herein that without rootcause is that devoid of nongreed etc as the cause of result It is of eight kinds as eyeconsciousness  ear nose tongue and bodyconsciousness  mindelement with the function of receiving  the two mindconsciousnesselements with the functions of investigating and so on
Herein eyeconsciousness has the characteristic of being supported by the eye and cognizing visible data Its function is to have only visible data as its object It is manifested as occupation with visible data Its proximate cause is the departure of the functional mindelement that has visible data as its object
 Ear nose tongue and bodyconsciousness respectively have the characteristic of being supported by the ear etc and of cognizing sounds and so on Their functions are to have only sounds etc as their respective objects They are manifested as occupation with respectively sounds and so on Their proximate cause is the departure of the functional mindelement that has respectively sounds etc as its object
The resultant mindelement has the characteristic of cognizing respectively visible data etc immediately next to  eyeconsciousness and so on Its function is to receive visible data and so on It is manifested as the state of receiving corresponding to that lastmentioned function  Its proximate cause is the departure of eyeconsciousness and so on
 Also the twofold resultant mindconsciousnesselement without root cause with the function of investigating etc has as its characteristic the cognizing of the six kinds of objects Its function is that of investigating and so on It is manifested as the state of investigating corresponding to that last mentioned function Its proximate cause is the heartbasis
But it is classed according to its association with joy or with equanimity and according to its being divisible into that with two positions and that with five positions in the cognitive series
For of these one is associatedwith joy because of its presence when entirely desirable objects occur and it has two positions in the cognitive series because it occurs as investigating at the five doors and as registration at the end of impulsion
The other kind is associatedwithequanimity because of its presence when desirableneutral objects occur and it has five positions since it occurs as investigation registration rebirthlinking lifecontinuum and death
And this eightfold resultant consciousness without rootcause is of two kinds as well because of having an invariable object and a variable object
It is of three kinds as classed according to bodily pleasure mental joy and equanimity
For  the five consciousnesses have each an invariable object since they occur respectively only with respect to visible data and so on The others  have a variable object
For here the mindelement occurs with respect to the five beginning with visible data and  the two mindconsciousnesselements occur with respect to all six
Here however bodyconsciousness is associated with bodily pleasure The mindconsciousnesselement with two positions is associated with mental joy the other is associated with equanimity
So firstly the profitable resultant without rootcause should be understood as of eight kinds
IIIi A  But that with rootcause is  that associated with nongreed etc as the cause of the result It is of eight kinds because it is classed according to joy etc like the profitable of the sense sphere 
But it does not occur with respect to the six objects through giving etc as the profitable does
for it occurs only with respect to the six objects that are included among limited states as rebirthlinking lifecontinuum death and registration
But the prompted and unprompted states should be understood here as due to the source it has come from and so on
And while there is no difference in the associated states the resultant should be understood as passive like the reflection of a face in a lookingglass while the profitable is active like the face
III i A Unprofitable resultant though is without rootcause only It is of seven kinds as eyeconsciousness  ear nose tongue and bodyconsciousness mindelement with the function of receiving and mindconsciousnesselement with the function of investigating etc and having five positions
It should be understood as to characteristic etc in the same way as the profitable resultant without rootcause 
Profitable resultant though has desirable or desirableneutral objects only while these have undesirable or undesirableneutral objects only
The former are of three kinds being classed according to equanimity bodily pleasure and mental joy while these are of two kinds being classed according to bodily pain and equanimity
For here it is only bodyconsciousness that is accompanied by bodily pain the rest are accompanied by equanimity
And the equanimity in these is inferior and not very sharp as the pain is while in the former it is superior and not very sharp as the pleasure is
So with these seven kinds of unprofitable resultant and the previous sixteen kinds of profitable resultant sensesphere resultant consciousness is of twenty three kinds
III i B That of the finematerial sphere however is of five kinds  like the profitable 
But the profitable occurs in a cognitive series with the impulsions as an attainment of jhāna
while this occurs in an existence in the finematerial sphere as rebirthlinking lifecontinuum and death
IIIi C And as that of the finematerial sphere was like the profitable of that sphere so that of the immaterial sphere  is of four kinds like the profitable too 
And its occurrence is classed in the same way as that of the finematerial sphere
III i D The supramundane resultant is of four kinds  because it is respectively the fruitions of the consciousnesses associated with the four paths  It occurs in two ways that is to say as fruition in the cognitive series of the path and as fruition attainment 
So resultant consciousness in all the four planes is of thirtysix kinds
III ii The functional however is of three kinds according to plane of the sense sphere of the finematerial sphere of the immaterial sphere
Herein III ii A  that of the sense sphere is of two kinds namely without root cause and with rootcause
III ii A  Herein that without rootcause is that devoid of nongreed etc as the cause of result That is of two kinds being classed as mindelement and  mindconsciousnesselement
Herein the mindelement has the characteristics of being the forerunner of eyeconsciousness etc and of cognizing visible data and so on Its function is to advert It is manifested as confrontation of visible data and so on Its proximate cause is the interruption of the continued occurrence of consciousness as life continuum It is associated with equanimity only
But the mindconsciousnesselement is of two kinds namely shared by all and not shared by all
Herein that shared by all is the functional mind consciousnesselement accompanied by equanimity without rootcause It has the characteristic of cognizing the six kinds of objects Its function is to determine at the five doors and to advert at the mind door It is manifested as the states of determining and adverting corresponding to those lastmentioned two functions Its proximate cause is the departure either of the resultant mindconsciousnesselement without rootcause  in the first case or of one among the kinds of lifecontinuum in the second
That not shared by all is the functional mindconsciousness element accompanied by joy without rootcause It has the characteristic of cognizing the six kinds of objects Its function is to cause smiling in Arahants about things that are not sublime It is manifested as the state corresponding to that lastmentioned function Its proximate cause is always the heartbasis
So the sensesphere functional without rootcause is of three kinds
III ii A  That however with root cause is of eight kinds  like the profitable  being classed according to joy and so on
While the profitable arises in trainers and ordinary men only this arises in Arahants only This is the difference here
So firstly that of the sense sphere is of eleven kinds
III ii B  III ii C That however of the finematerial sphere  and that of the immaterial sphere  are respectively of five kinds and of four kinds like the profitable
But they should be understood to differ from the profitable in that they arise only in Arahants
So functional consciousness in the three planes is of twenty kinds in all
So the  kinds of profitable the  kinds of unprofitable the  kinds of resultant and the  kinds of functional amount in all to  kinds of consciousness
And these occur in the fourteen modes of rebirthlinking lifecontinuum adverting seeing hearing smelling tasting touching receiving investigating determining impulsion registration and death
THE  MODES OF OCCURRENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS How so
 When through the influence of the eight kinds of sensesphere profitable consciousness  beings come to be reborn among deities and human beings then the eight kinds of sensesphere resultant with rootcause  occur and also the resultant mindconsciousnesselement without rootcause associated with equanimity  which is the weak profitable result with two root causes in those who are entering upon the state of eunuchs etc among human beingsthus nine kinds of resultant consciousness in all occur as rebirthlinking and they do so making their object whichever among the kamma sign of kamma or sign of destiny has appeared at the time of dying  
When through the influence of the profitable of the finematerial sphere  and the immaterial sphere  beings are reborn respectively in the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming then the nine kinds of fine material  and immaterial  resultant occur as rebirthlinking and they do so making their object only the sign of kamma that has appeared at the time of dying 
When through the influence of the unprofitable  they are reborn in a state of loss then the one kind of unprofitable resultant mindconsciousness element without rootcause occurs as rebirthlinking and it does so making its object whichever among the kamma sign of kamma and sign of destiny has appeared at the time of dying This firstly is how the occurrence of nineteen kinds of resultant consciousness should be understood as rebirthlinking
 When the rebirthlinking consciousness has ceased then following on whatever kind of rebirthlinking it may be the same kinds being the result of that same kamma whatever it may be occur as lifecontinuum consciousness with that same object and again those same kinds  And as long as there is no other kind of arising of consciousness to interrupt the continuity they also go on occurring endlessly in periods of dreamless sleep etc like the current of a river  This is how the occurrence of those same nineteen kinds of consciousness should be understood as lifecontinuum
 With the lifecontinuum continuity occurring thus when living beings faculties have become capable of apprehending an object then when a visible datum has come into the eyes focus there is impinging upon the eyesensitivity due to the visible datum Thereupon owing to the impacts influence there comes to be a disturbance in the continuity of the lifecontinuum  Then when the lifecontinuum has ceased the functional mindelement arises making that same visible datum its object as it were cutting off the lifecontinuum and accomplishing the function of adverting
So too in the case of the ear door and so on
When an object of anyone of the six kinds has come into focus in the mind door then next to the disturbance of the lifecontinuum the functional mind consciousnesselement without rootcause arises accompanied by equanimity as it were cutting off the lifecontinuum and accomplishing the function of adverting This is how the occurrence of two kinds of functional consciousness should be understood as adverting
 Next to adverting taking the eye door first eyeconsciousness arises accomplishing the function of seeing in the eye door and having the eye sensitivity as its physical basis And likewise ear nose tongue and bodyconsciousness arise accomplishing respectively the functions of hearing etc in the ear door and so on
These comprise the profitable resultant consciousnesses  with respect to desirable and desirableneutral objective fields and the unprofitable resultant  with respect to undesirable and undesirableneutral objective fields This is how the occurrence of ten kinds of resultant consciousness should be understood as seeing hearing smelling tasting and touching
 Because of the words Eyeconsciousness having arisen and ceased next to that there arises consciousness mind mentation  which is appropriate mindelement  etc next to eyeconsciousness etc and receiving the same objective fields as they deal with mindelement arises as profitable resultant next to profitable resultant eyeconsciousness etc and as unprofitable resultant next to unprofitable resultant eyeconsciousness and so on
This is how the occurrence of two kinds of resultant consciousness should be understood as receiving
 Because of the words Mindelement having arisen and ceased also next to that there arises consciousness mind mentation  which is appropriate mindelement  then resultant mindconsciousnesselement without rootcause arises investigating the same objective field as that received by the mindelement When next to unprofitableresultant mindelement it is unprofitableresultant and when next to profitableresultant mindelement it is either accompanied by joy in the case of a desirable object or accompanied by equanimity in the case of a desirableneutral object This is how the occurrence of three kinds of resultant consciousness should be understood as investigating
 Next to investigation functional mindconsciousnesselement without rootcause arises accompanied by equanimity determining that same objective field This is how the occurrence of one kind of resultant consciousness should be understood as determining
 Next to determining if the visible datum etc as object is vivid then six or seven impulsions impel with respect to the objective fields as determined These are one among  the eight kinds of sensesphere profitable or  the twelve kinds of unprofitable or  the nine remaining sense sphere functional This firstly is the way in the case of the five doors
But in the case of the mind door those same impulsions arise next to minddoor adverting
Beyond the stage of changeoflineage any of the following  kinds of impulsion that obtains a condition impels that is any kind among  the five profitable and  the five functional of the finematerial sphere and  the four profitable and  the four functional of the immaterial sphere and also  the four path consciousnesses and  four fruition consciousnesses of the supramundane This is how the occurrence of fiftyfive kinds of profitable unprofitable functional and resultant consciousness should be understood as impulsion
 At the end of the impulsions if the object is a very vivid one in the five doors or is clear in the mind door then in sensesphere beings at the end of sensesphere impulsions resultant consciousness occurs through any condition it may have obtained such as previous kamma impulsion consciousness etc with desirable etc object  It occurs thus as one among the eight sensesphere resultant kinds with root cause  or the three resultant mind consciousness elements without rootcause    and it does so twice or once following after the impulsions that have impelled and with respect to an object other than the lifecontinuums object like some of the water that follows a little after a boat going upstream
Though ready to occur with the life continuums object after the impulsions have ended it nevertheless occurs making the impulsions object its object Because of that it is called registration 
This is how the occurrence of eleven kinds of resultant consciousness should be understood as registration
 At the end of registration the lifecontinuum resumes its occurrence When the resumed occurrence of the lifecontinuum is again interrupted adverting etc occur again and when the conditions obtain the conscious continuity repeats its occurrence as adverting and next to adverting seeing etc according to the law of consciousness again and again until the lifecontinuum of one becoming is exhausted
For the last lifecontinuum consciousness of all in one becoming is called death because of falling from that becoming
So that is of nineteen kinds too like rebirthlinking and life continuum
This is how the occurrence of nineteen kinds of resultant consciousness should be understood as death
And after death there is rebirthlinking again and after rebirthlinking lifecontinuum Thus the conscious continuity of beings who hasten through the kinds of becoming destiny station of consciousness and abode of beings occurs without break
But when a man attains Arahantship here it ceases with the cessation of his death consciousness
This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the consciousness aggregate
Now it was said above Whatever has the characteristic of being felt should be understood all taken together as the feeling aggregate  And here too what is said to have the characteristic of being felt is feeling itself
according as it is said It is felt friend that is why it is called feeling 
But though it is singlefold according to its individual essence as the characteristic of being felt it is nevertheless threefold as to kind that is to say profitable unprofitable and indeterminate
Herein it should be understood that when associated with the profitable consciousness described in the way beginning  That of the sense sphere is eightfold being classified according to joy equanimity knowledge and prompting  it is profitable that associated with unprofitable consciousness is unprofitable that associated with indeterminate consciousness is indeterminate
It is fivefold according to the analysis of its individual essence into bodily pleasure bodily pain mental joy mental grief and equanimity
Herein pleasure is associated with profitable resultant bodyconsciousness
and pain with unprofitable resultant bodyconsciousness 
Joy is associated with  kinds of consciousness namely as to sense sphere with  kinds of profitable  with  resultant with rootcause  with  resultant without rootcause  with  functional with rootcause  with  functional without rootcause  and with  unprofitable  and as to the finematerialsphere with  kinds of profitable   resultant  and  functional  leaving out that of the fifth jhāna in each case but there is no supramundane without jhāna and consequently the eight kinds of supramundane  and  multiplied by the five jhāna make forty
but leaving out the eight associated with the fifth jhāna it is associated with the remaining  kinds of profitable resultant
Grief is associated with two kinds of unprofitable 
Equanimity is associated with the remaining fiftyfive kinds of consciousness
Herein pleasure has the characteristic of experiencing a desirable tangible datum Its function is to intensify associated states It is manifested as bodily enjoyment Its proximate cause is the body faculty
Pain has the characteristic of experiencing an undesirable tangible datum Its function is to wither associated states It is manifested as bodily affliction Its proximate cause is the body faculty
Joy has the characteristic of experiencing a desirable object Its function is to exploit in one way or another the desirable aspect It is manifested as mental enjoyment Its proximate cause is tranquillity
Grief has the characteristic of experiencing an undesirable object Its function is to exploit in one way or another the undesirable aspect It is manifested as mental affliction Its proximate cause is invariably the heartbasis
Equanimity has the characteristic of being felt as neutral Its function is not to intensify or wither associated states much It is manifested as peacefulness Its proximate cause is consciousness without happiness 
This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the feeling aggregate
Now it was said above Whatever has the characteristic of perceiving should be understood all taken together as the perception aggregate  And here too what is said to have the characteristic of perceiving is perception itself
according as it is said It perceives friend that is why it is called perception 
But though it is singlefold according to its individual essence as the characteristic of perceiving it is nevertheless threefold as to kind that is to say profitable unprofitable and indeterminate
Herein that associated with profitable consciousness is profitable that associated with unprofitable consciousness is unprofitable that associated with indeterminate consciousness is indeterminate
Since there is no consciousness dissociated from perception perception therefore has the same number of divisions as consciousness that is to say eightynine
But though classed in the same way as consciousness nevertheless as to characteristic etc it all has just the characteristic of perceiving Its function is to make a sign as a condition for perceiving again that this is the same as carpenters etc do in the case of timber and so on It is manifested as the action of interpreting by means of the sign as apprehended like the blind who see an elephant  Its proximate cause is an objective field in whatever way that appears like the perception that arises in fawns that see scarecrows as men
This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the perception aggregate
Now it was said above Whatever has the characteristic of forming should be understood all taken together as the formations aggregate  And here too what is said to have the characteristic of forming is that which has the characteristic of agglomerating
What is that It is formations themselves
according as it is said They form the formed bhikkhus that is why they are called formations 
They have the characteristic of forming Their function is to accumulate They are manifested as intervening  Their proximate cause is the remaining three immaterial aggregates
So according to characteristic etc they are singlefold And according to kind they are threefold namely profitable unprofitable and indeterminate
As regards these when associated with profitable consciousness they are profitable
when associated with unprofitable consciousness they are unprofitable
when associated with indeterminate consciousness they are indeterminate
ACCORDING TO ASSOCIATION WITH CONSCIOUSNESS  I Herein firstly those associated with the first sensesphere profitable consciousness amount to thirtysix that is to say the constant ones which are the twentyseven given in the texts as such and the four orwhatever states and also the five inconstant ones 
Herein the twentyseven given as such are these contact volition applied thought sustained thought happiness  energy life concentration faith mindfulness conscience shame nongreed nonhate nondelusion tranquillity of the mental body tranquillity of consciousness lightness of the mental body lightness of consciousness malleability of the mental body malleability of consciousness wieldiness of the mental body wieldiness of consciousness proficiency of the mental body proficiency of consciousness rectitude of the mental body rectitude of consciousness
The four orwhateverstates are these zeal  resolution attention  specific neutrality
And the five inconstant are these compassion gladness abstinence from bodily misconduct abstinence from verbal misconduct abstinence from wrong livelihood
These last arise sometimes but not always and when they arise they do not do so together
Herein it touches  thus it is contact 
This has the characteristic of touching
Its function is the act of impingement It is manifested as concurrence Its proximate cause is an objective field that has come into focus
As to its characteristic although this is an immaterial state it occurs with respect to an object as the act of touching too
And as to its function although it is not adherent on anyone side as eyecumvisibleobject and earcumsound are yet it is what makes consciousness and the object impinge It is said to be manifested as concurrence because it has been described as its own action namely the concurrence of the three  that is eye visible object and eyeconsciousness
And it is said to have as its proximate cause an objective field that has come into focus because it arises automatically through the appropriate conscious reaction and with a faculty when the objective field is presented
But it should be regarded as like a hideless cow because it is the habitat of feeling
 It wills  thus it is volition 
it collects is the meaning
Its characteristic is the state of willing Its function is to accumulate It is manifested as coordinating It accomplishes its own and others functions as a senior pupil a head carpenter etc do
But it is evident when it occurs in the marshalling of associated states in connection with urgent work remembering and so on
 What should be said about applied thought sustained thought and happiness has already been said in the commentary on the first jhāna in the Description of the Earth Kasiṇa 
 Energy is the state of one who is vigorous 
Its characteristic is marshalling  Its function is to consolidate conascent states It is manifested as noncollapse
Because of the words Bestirred he strives wisely  its proximate cause is a sense of urgency or its proximate cause is grounds for the initiation of energy When rightly initiated it should be regarded as the root of all attainments
 By its means they live or it itself lives or it is just mere living thus it is life
But its characteristic etc should be understood in the way stated under material life 
for that is life of material things and this is life of immaterial things This is the only difference here
 It puts consciousness evenly on the object or it puts it rightly on it or it is just the mere collecting of the mind thus it is concentration 
Its characteristic is nonwandering or its characteristic is nondistraction Its function is to conglomerate conascent states as water does bath powder It is manifested as peace Usually its proximate cause is bliss It should be regarded as steadiness of the mind like the steadiness of a lamps flame when there is no draught
 By its means they have faith  or it itself is the having of faith or it is just the act of having faith  thus it is faith  Its characteristic is having faith or its characteristic is trusting
Its function is to clarify like a waterclearing gem or its function is to enter into like the setting out across a flood 
It is manifested as nonfogginess or it is manifested as resolution Its proximate cause is something to have faith in or its proximate cause is the things beginning with hearing the Good Dhamma that constitute the factors of streamentry  It should be regarded as a hand because it takes hold of profitable things as wealth  and as seed 
 By its means they remember  or it itself remembers or it is just mere remembering  thus it is mindfulness 
It has the characteristic of not wobbling  Its function is not to forget It is manifested as guarding or it is manifested as the state of confronting an objective field Its proximate cause is strong perception or its proximate cause is the foundations of mindfulness concerned with the body and so on 
It should be regarded however as like a pillar because it is firmly founded or as like a doorkeeper because it guards the eyedoor and so on
 It has conscientious scruples about bodily misconduct etc thus it is conscience 
This is a term for modesty
It is ashamed of those same things thus it is shame 
This is a term for anxiety about evil
Herein conscience has the characteristic of disgust at evil
while shame has the characteristic of dread of it
Conscience has the function of not doing evil and that in the mode of modesty
while shame has the function of not doing it and that in the mode of dread
They are manifested as shrinking from evil in the way already stated Their proximate causes are selfrespect and respect of others respectively
A man rejects evil through conscience out of respect for himself as the daughter of a good family does
he rejects evil through shame out of respect for another as a courtesan does
But these two states should be regarded as the guardians of the world 
 By its means they are not greedy  or it itself is not greedy or it is just the mere not being greedy  thus it is nongreed 
The same method applies to nonhate and nondelusion na dussanti adussana  adosa and na muyhanti amuyhana  amoha 
Of these nongreed has the characteristic of the minds lack of desire for an object or it has the characteristic of nonadherence like a water drop on a lotus leaf
Its function is not to lay hold like a liberated bhikkhu It is manifested as a state of not treating as a shelter like that of a man who has fallen into filth
Non hate has the characteristic of lack of savagery or the characteristic of non opposing like a gentle friend Its function is to remove annoyance or its function is to remove fever as sandalwood does It is manifested as agreeableness like the full moon
Nondelusion has the characteristic of penetrating things according to their individual essences or it has the characteristic of sure penetration like the penetration of an arrow shot by a skilful archer Its function is to illuminate the objective field like a lamp
It is manifested as nonbewilderment like a guide in a forest
The three should be regarded as the roots of all that is profitable
 The tranquillizing of the body is tranquillity of the body
The tranquillizing of consciousness is tranquillity of consciousness
And here body means the three mental aggregates feeling perception and formations 
But both tranquillity of that body and of consciousness have together the characteristic of quieting disturbance of that body and of consciousness Their function is to crush disturbance of the mental body and of consciousness They are manifested as inactivity and coolness of the mental body and of consciousness Their proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness
They should be regarded as opposed to the defilements of agitation etc which cause unpeacefulness in the mental body and in consciousness
 The light state of the mental body is lightness of the body
The light state of consciousness is lightness of consciousness
They have the characteristic of quieting heaviness in the mental body and in consciousness Their function is to crush heaviness in the mental body and in consciousness They are manifested as nonsluggishness of the mental body and of consciousness Their proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness
They should be regarded as opposed to the defilements of stiffness and torpor which cause heaviness in the mental body and in consciousness
 The malleable state of the mental body is malleability of body
The malleable state of consciousness is malleability of consciousness
They have the characteristic of quieting rigidity in the mental body and in consciousness Their function is to crush stiffening in the mental body and in consciousness They are manifested as nonresistance Their proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness
They should be regarded as opposed to the defilements of views conceit  etc which cause stiffening of the mental body and of consciousness
 The wieldy state of the mental body is wieldiness of body
The wieldy state of consciousness is wieldiness of consciousness
They have the characteristic of quieting unwieldiness in the mental body and in consciousness Their function is to crush unwieldiness in the mental body and in consciousness They are manifested as success in making something an object of the mental body and consciousness Their proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness
As bringing trust in things that should be trusted in and as bringing susceptibility of application to beneficial acts like the refining of gold they should be regarded as opposed to the remaining hindrances etc that cause unwieldiness in the mental body and in consciousness
 The proficient state of the mental body is proficiency of body
The proficient state of consciousness is proficiency of consciousness
They have the characteristic of healthiness of the mental body and of consciousness Their function is to crush unhealthiness of the mental body and of consciousness They are manifested as absence of disability Their proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness
They should be regarded as opposed to faithlessness etc which cause unhealthiness in the mental body and in consciousness
 The straight state of the mental body is rectitude of body
The straight state of consciousness is rectitude of consciousness
They have the characteristic of uprightness of the mental body and of consciousness Their function is to crush tortuousness in the mental body and in consciousness They are manifested as noncrookedness Their proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness
They should be regarded as opposed to deceit fraud etc which cause tortuousness in the mental body and in consciousness 
 Zeal is a term for desire to act
So that zeal has the characteristic of desire to act Its function is scanning for an object It is manifested as need for an object That same object is its proximate cause
It should be regarded as the extending of the mental hand in the apprehending of an object
 The act of resolving is resolution
It has the characteristic of conviction Its function is not to grope It is manifested as decisiveness Its proximate cause is a thing to be convinced about It should be regarded as like a boundarypost owing to its immovableness with respect to the object
 It is the maker of what is to be made
it is the maker in the mind  thus it is attention 
It makes the mind different from the previous lifecontinuum mind thus it is attention
It has three ways of doing this as the controller of the object as the controller of the cognitive series and as the controller of impulsions
Herein the controller of the object is the maker in the mind thus it is attention
That has the characteristic of conducting  Its function is to yoke associated states to the object It is manifested as confrontation with an object Its proximate cause is an object
It should be regarded as the conductor of associated states by controlling the object itself being included in the formations aggregate
Controller of the cognitive series is a term for fivedoor adverting 
Controller of impulsions is a term for minddoor adverting 
These last two are not included here
 Specific neutrality is neutrality in regard to those states of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants arisen in association with it
It has the characteristic of conveying consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants evenly Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess or its function is to inhibit partiality It is manifested as neutrality It should be regarded as like a conductor who looks with equanimity on thoroughbreds progressing evenly
 Compassion and gladness should be understood as given in the Description of the Divine Abodes 
except that those are of the finematerial sphere and have attained to absorption while these are of the sense sphere This is the only difference
Some however want to include among the inconstant both lovingkindness and equanimity That cannot be accepted for
as to meaning nonhate itself is lovingkindness and specific neutrality is equanimity
 Abstinence from bodily misconduct the compound kāyaduccaritavirati resolves as kāyaduccaritato virati
so also with the other two
But as regards characteristic etc these three have the characteristic of non transgression in the respective fields of bodily conduct etc they have the characteristic of not treading there is what is said
Their function is to draw back from the fields of bodily misconduct and so on They are manifested as the not doing of these things Their proximate causes are the special qualities of faith conscience shame fewness of wishes and so on They should be regarded as the minds averseness from evildoing
So these are the thirtysix formations that should be understood to come into association with the first profitable consciousness of the sense sphere 
And as with the first so with the second 
the only difference here being promptedness
 Those associated with the third should be understood as all the foregoing except nondelusion 
Likewise with the fourth 
the only difference here being promptedness
 All those stated in the first instance except happiness  come into association with the fifth 
Likewise with the sixth 
the only difference here being promptedness
 Those associated with the seventh should be understood as the last except nondelusion 
Likewise with the eighth 
the only difference here being promptedness
 All those stated in the first instance except the three abstinences  come into association with the first of the finematerial profitable kinds of consciousness 
With the second applied thought is also lacking
With the third sustained thought is also lacking
With the fourth happiness is also lacking
With the fifth compassion and gladness  among the inconstant are also lacking
 In the case of the four kinds of immaterial profitable consciousness these are the same as the lastmentioned
for it is only the immaterialness that is the difference here
 As regards the supramundane firstly in the case of the path consciousness having the first jhāna they should be understood to be as stated in the case of the first finematerialsphere consciousness  The paths classed as belonging to the second jhāna etc should be understood to be as stated in the cases respectively of the second finematerialsphere jhāna and so on  
But the difference here is absence of compassion and gladness  constancy of the abstinences  and supramundaneness
II As regards the unprofitable there are firstly seventeen associated with the first unprofitable consciousness rooted in greed  that is to say thirteen constant given in the texts as such and four orwhat everstates
Herein the thirteen given as such are these contact  volition  applied thought  sustained thought  happiness  energy  life  concentration  consciencelessness shamelessness greed delusion wrong view
The four orwhateverstates are these zeal  resolution  agitation attention 
Herein it has no conscientious scruples thus it is consciencelessness
 It is unashamed thus it is shamelessness
Of these consciencelessness has the characteristic of absence of disgust at bodily misconduct etc or it has the characteristic of immodesty
Shamelessness has the characteristic of absence of dread on their account or it has the characteristic of absence of anxiety about them
This is in brief here
The detail however is the opposite of what was said above under conscience and shame 
 By its means they are greedy or it itself is greedy or it is just the mere being greedy thus is it greed
 By its means they are deluded or it itself is deluded or it is just the mere being deluded thus it is delusion
Of these greed has the characteristic of grasping an object like birdlime  Its function is sticking like meat put in a hot pan
It is manifested as not giving up like the dye of lampblack
Its proximate cause is seeing enjoyment in things that lead to bondage
Swelling with the current of craving it should be regarded as taking beings with it to states of loss as a swiftflowing river does to the great ocean
Delusion has the characteristic of blindness or it has the characteristic of unknowing Its function is nonpenetration or its function is to conceal the individual essence of an object It is manifested as the absence of right theory  or it is manifested as darkness Its proximate cause is unwise attention It should be regarded as the root of all that is unprofitable
 By its means they see wrongly or it itself sees wrongly or it is just the mere seeing wrongly thus it is wrong view
Its characteristic is unwise interpreting Its function is to presume It is manifested as wrong interpreting Its proximate cause is unwillingness to see Noble Ones and so on It should be regarded as the most reprehensible of all
 Agitation is agitatedness
It has the characteristic of disquiet like water whipped by the wind Its function is unsteadiness like a flag or banner whipped by the wind It is manifested as turmoil like ashes flung up by pelting with stones Its proximate cause is unwise attention to mental disquiet It should be regarded as distraction of consciousness
The remaining formations here should be understood as already stated under the profitable
For it is only the unprofitableness that differentiates them as bad
So these are the seventeen formations that should be understood to come into association with the first unprofitable consciousness 
And as with the first so with the second 
but here the difference is promptedness and inconstant occurrence of stiffening and torpor
Herein stiffening is stiffness 
making torpid is torpor 
The meaning is paralysis due to lack of urgency and loss of vigour
The compound thīnamiddha should be resolved into thīnañ ca middhañ ca
Herein stiffness has the characteristic of lack of driving power Its function is to remove energy It is manifested as subsiding
Torpor has the characteristic of unwieldiness Its function is to smother It is manifested as laziness or it is manifested as nodding and sleep
The proximate cause of both is unwise attention to boredom sloth and so on
With the third unprofitable consciousness there should be understood to be associated those given for the first  excepting wrong view 
But here the difference is that there is inconstant occurrence of pride 
That pride has the characteristic of haughtiness Its function is arrogance It is manifested as vain gloriousness Its proximate cause is greed dissociated from views It should be regarded as like madness
With the fourth should be understood to be associated those given for the second  excepting wrong view 
And here pride is among the inconstant too
Those given for the first  excepting happiness  come into association with the fifth 
And as with the fifth  so with the sixth too 
but the difference here is promptedness and the inconstant occurrence of stiffnessandtorpor 
With the seventh should be understood to be associated those given for the fifth  except views 
but pride is inconstant here
With the eighth should be understood to be associated those given for the sixth  except views 
and here too pride is among the inconstant
 As regards the two kinds of unprofitable consciousness rooted in hate there are firstly eighteen associated with the first  that is eleven constant given in the texts as such  four orwhatever states and three inconstant
Herein the eleven given as such are these contact  volition  applied thought  sustained thought  energy  life  concentration  consciencelessness  shamelessness  hate delusion 
The four orwhateverstates are these zeal  resolution  agitation  attention 
The three inconstant are these envy avarice worry
Herein by its means they hate or it itself hates or it is just mere hating thus it is hate 
It has the characteristic of savageness like a provoked snake Its function is to spread like a drop of poison or its function is to burn up its own support like a forest fire
It is manifested as persecuting  like an enemy who has got his chance Its proximate cause is the grounds for annoyance  It should be regarded as like stale urine mixed with poison
 Envying is envy
It has the characteristic of being jealous of others success
Its function is to be dissatisfied with that It is manifested as averseness from that Its proximate cause is anothers success It should be regarded as a fetter
 Avariciousness is avarice
Its characteristic is the hiding of ones own success that has been or can be obtained Its function is not to bear sharing these with others It is manifested as shrinking or it is manifested as meanness Its proximate cause is ones own success It should be regarded as a mental disfigurement
 The vile that is done is villainy 
The state of that is worry 
It has subsequent regret as its characteristic Its function is to sorrow about what has and what has not been done It is manifested as remorse Its proximate cause is what has and what has not been done It should be regarded as slavery
The rest are of the kind already described
So these eighteen formations should be understood to come into association with the first unprofitable consciousness rooted in hate 
And as with the first  so with the second 
the only difference however being promptedness and the presence of stiffness and torpor among the inconstant
 As regards the two rooted in delusion firstly associated with the consciousness that is associated with uncertainty are the eleven given in the texts as such thus contact  volition  applied thought  sustained thought  energy  life  steadiness of consciousness consciencelessness  shamelessness  delusion  uncertainty The orwhateverstates are these two agitation  attention  And these together total thirteen
Herein steadiness of consciousness is weak concentration consisting in mere steadiness in occurrence
It is without wish to cure  thus it is uncertainty 
It has the characteristic of doubt Its function is to waver It is manifested as indecisiveness or it is manifested as taking various sides Its proximate cause is unwise attention It should be regarded as obstructive of theory 
The rest are as already described
The consciousness associated with agitation has the same formations as the consciousness associated with uncertainty  except for uncertainty 
But with the absence of uncertainty resolution arises here
So with that they are likewise thirteen and concentration is stronger because of the presence of resolution
Also agitation is given in the texts as such
while resolution and attention are among the orwhateverstates Thus should the unprofitable formations be understood
III As regards the indeterminate firstly the resultant indeterminate  are twofold classed as those without rootcause and those with rootcause
Those associated with resultant consciousness without rootcause   are those without rootcause
Herein firstly those associated with the profitable resultant and unprofitable resultant eyeconsciousness are the four given in the texts as such namely contact  volition  life  steadiness of consciousness  which amount to five with attention as the only orwhateverstate
These same kinds are associated with ear nose tongue and body consciousness  
Those associated with both kinds of resultant mindelement  come to eight by adding applied thought  sustained thought and resolution  Likewise those associated with the threefold mind consciousnesselement with rootcause   
But here that accompanied by joy should be understood to have happiness also in addition to that
The formations associated with resultant consciousness with rootcause  are those with rootcause
Of these firstly those associated with the sensesphere resultant consciousness with rootcause are similar to the formations associated with the eight sensesphere consciousnesses 
But of the inconstant ones compassion and gladness are not among the resultant because they have living beings as their object
For the resultant ones of the sensesphere have only limited objects
And not only compassion and gladness but also the three abstinences  are not among the resultant
for it is said that the five training precepts are profitable only 
 Those associated with the resultant consciousness of the fine material sphere  the immaterial sphere  and the supramundane  are similar to the formations associated with the profitable consciousnesses of those kinds  too
 Functional indeterminate formations are also twofold classed as those without rootcause  and those with rootcause 
Those without rootcause are associated with functional consciousness without root cause
and they are the same as those associated respectively with profitable resultant mindelement and the pair of mindconsciousnesselements without rootcause 
But in the case of the two mindconsciousness elements  energy is additional
and because of the presence of energy concentration is strong
This is the difference here
Those associated with functional consciousness with rootcause  are those with rootcause
Of these firstly those associated with the eight sensesphere functional consciousnesses  are similar to the formations associated with the eight sensesphere profitable  except for the abstinences 
Those associated with the functional consciousnesses of the finematerial sphere  and the immaterial sphere  are in all aspects similar to those associated with profitable consciousness  This is how formations should be understood as indeterminate
This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the formations aggregate
The foregoing section firstly is that of the detailed explanation of the aggregates according to the AbhidhammaBhājaniya of the Vibhaṅga
But by the Blessed One in the Suttanta Bhājaniya in this way
Any materiality whatever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all that together in the mass and in the gross is called the materiality aggregate
Any feeling whatever  Any perception whatever  Any formations whatever  Any consciousness whatever whether past future or present  all that together in the mass and in the gross is called the consciousness aggregate 
 the aggregates have been given in detail
MATERIALITY  Herein the word whatever includes without exception
Materiality prevents overgeneralization
Thus materiality is comprised without exception by the two expressions
Then he undertakes its exposition as past future and present etc
for some of it is classed as past and some as future and so on
So also in the case of feeling and so on
Herein the materiality called past is fourfold according to extent continuity period and moment
Likewise the future and the present 
Herein firstly according to extent in the case of a single becoming of one living being previous to rebirthlinking is past subsequent to death is future between these two is present
 According to continuity that materiality which has like or single origination by temperature and single origination by nutriment though it occurs successively is present That which previous to that was of unlike origination by temperature and nutriment is past That which is subsequent is future
That which is born of consciousness and has its origination in one cognitive series in one impulsion in one attainment is present Previous to that is past Subsequent to that is future
There is no special classification into past continuity etc of that which has its origination in kamma but its pastness etc should be understood according as it supports those which have their origination through temperature nutriment and consciousness
 According to period any period among those such as one minute morning evening dayandnight etc that occurs as a continuity is called present Previous to that is past Subsequent is future
 According to moment what is included in the trio of moments that is to say arising presence and dissolution beginning with arising is called present At a time previous to that it is future At a time subsequent to that it is past 
Furthermore that whose functions of cause and condition have elapsed is past That whose function of cause is finished and whose function of condition is unfinished is present That which has not attained to either function is future
Or alternatively the moment of the function is present At a time previous to that it is future At a time subsequent to that it is past
And here only the explanations beginning with the moment are absolutely literal
The rest are in a figurative or relative sense
 The division into internal and external is as already stated 
Besides it is internal in the sense of ones own that should be understood here as internal and that of another person as external
 Gross and subtle are also as already stated 
 Inferior and superior are twofold namely figuratively and absolutely 
Herein the materiality of the Sudassin deities is inferior to the materiality of the Akaniṭṭha deities
That same materiality of the Sudassin deities is superior to the materiality of the Sudassa deities
Thus firstly should inferiority and superiority be understood figuratively down as far as the denizens of hell
But absolutely it is inferior where it arises as unprofitable result
and it is superior where it arises as profitable result
 Far and near this is also as already described 
Besides relative farness and nearness should be understood here according to location
All that together in the mass and in the gross by making all that materiality separately described by the words past etc into a collection by understanding its oneness in other words its characteristic of being molested  it comes to be called the materiality aggregate This is the meaning here
By this too it is shown that the materiality aggregate is all materiality which all comes into the collection with the characteristic of being molested
for there is no materiality aggregate apart from materiality
And just as in the case of materiality so also feeling etc are respectively shown as the feeling aggregate etc since they come under the collections with the respective characteristics of being felt etc
for there is no feeling aggregate apart from feeling and so on
FEELING  In the classification  into past etc the past future and present state of feeling should be understood according to continuity and according to moment and so on
Herein according to continuity that included in a single cognitive series a single impulsion a single attainment and that occurring in association with an objective field of one kind is present Before that is past Subsequent is future
According to moment etc that feeling included in the trio of moments which is in between the past time and the future time and which is performing its own function is present Before that is past Subsequent is future
The classification into internal and external should be understood according to the internal in the sense of ones own
 The classification into gross and subtle should be understood according to kind individual essence person and the mundane and supramundane as stated in the Vibhaṅga in the way beginning Unprofitable feeling is gross profitable and indeterminate feeling is subtle profitable and unprofitable feeling is gross indeterminate feeling is subtle  and so on
 According to kind firstly unprofitable feeling is a state of disquiet because it is the cause of reprehensible actions and because it produces burning of defilement so it is gross compared with profitable feeling And because it is accompanied by interestedness and drive and result and because of the burning of the defilements and because it is reprehensible it is gross compared with resultant indeterminate Also because it is accompanied by result because of the burning of the defilements and because it is attended by affliction and is reprehensible it is gross compared with functional indeterminate
But in the opposite sense profitable and indeterminate feeling are subtle compared with unprofitable feeling
Also the two that is profitable and unprofitable feeling involve interestedness drive and result so they are respectively gross compared with the twofold indeterminate And in the opposite sense the twofold indeterminate is subtle compared with them
This firstly is how grossness and subtlety should be understood according to kind
 According to individual essence painful feeling is gross compared with the others because it is without enjoyment it involves intervention causes disturbance creates anxiety and is overpowering The other two are subtle compared with the painful because they are satisfying peaceful and superior and respectively agreeable and neutral
Both the pleasant and the painful are gross compared with the neitherpainfulnorpleasant because they involve intervention cause disturbance and are obvious The latter is subtle in the way aforesaid compared with both the former
Thus should grossness and subtlety be understood according to individual essence
 According to person feeling in one who has no attainment is gross compared with that in one who has one because it is distracted by a multiple object In the opposite sense the other is subtle
This is how grossness and subtlety should be understood according to person
 According to the mundane and supramundane feeling subject to cankers is mundane and that is gross compared with that free from cankers because it is the cause for the arising of cankers is liable to the floods liable to the bonds liable to the ties liable to the hindrances liable to the clingings defilable and shared by ordinary men
The latter in the opposite sense is subtle compared with that subject to cankers
This is how grossness and subtlety should be understood according to the mundane and supramundane
Herein one should beware of mixing up the classifications according to kind and so on
For although feeling associated with unprofitable resultant bodyconsciousness is subtle according to kind because it is indeterminate it is nevertheless gross according to individual essence and so on
And this is said Indeterminate feeling is subtle
painful feeling is gross
The feeling in one with an attainment is subtle
that in one with no attainment is gross
Feeling free from cankers is subtle
feeling accompanied by cankers is gross 
And like painful feeling so also pleasant etc is gross according to kind and subtle according to individual essence
Therefore feelings grossness and subtlety should be understood in such a way that there is no mixing up of the classifications according to kind and so on
For instance when it is said The indeterminate according to kind is subtle compared with the profitable and the unprofitable the individualessence class etc
Which kind of indeterminate
Is it the painful
Is it the pleasant
Is it that in one with an attainment
Is it that in one with no attainment
Is it that subject to cankers
Is it that free from cankers
 must not be insisted upon like this
 and so in each instance
Furthermore because of the words Or feeling should be regarded as gross or subtle in comparison with this or that feeling  among the unprofitable etc feeling accompanied by hate too is gross compared with that accompanied by greed because it burns up its own support like a fire and that accompanied by greed is subtle
Also that accompanied by hate is gross when the hate is constant and subtle when it is inconstant
And the constant is gross when giving result that lasts for the aeon while the other is subtle
And of those giving result lasting for the aeon the unprompted is gross while the other is subtle
But that accompanied by greed is gross when associated with false view while the other is subtle
That also when constant and giving result lasting for the aeon and unprompted is gross while the others are subtle
And without distinction the unprofitable with much result is gross while that with little result is subtle
But the profitable with little result is gross while that with much result is subtle
Furthermore the profitable of the sense sphere is gross
that of the fine material sphere is subtle
next to which the immaterial
and next the supramundane should be similarly compared
That of the sense sphere is gross in giving
while it is subtle in virtue
next that in development
Also that in development is gross with two rootcauses
while with three rootcauses it is subtle
Also that with three rootcauses is gross when prompted
while it is subtle when unprompted
That of the finematerial sphere is gross in the first jhāna while it is subtle in the second jhāna That also of the second jhāna is gross  of the fifth jhāna is subtle
And that of the immaterial sphere associated with the base consisting of boundless space is gross  that associated with the base consisting of neitherperceptionnornonperception is subtle only
And the supramundane associated with the streamentry path is gross  that associated with the Arahant path is subtle only
The same method applies also to resultant and functional feeling in the various planes and to feeling stated according to pain etc according to one with no attainment etc and according to that subject to cankers and so on
Then according to location painful feelings in hell are gross
while in the animal generation they are subtle  Those among the Paranimmitavasavatti Deities are subtle only
And the pleasant should be construed throughout like the painful where suitable
And according to physical basis any feeling that has an inferior physical basis is gross while one with a superior physical basis is subtle
 What is gross should be regarded as inferior in the inferiorsuperior classification
and what is subtle superior
 The word far is explained in the Vibhaṅga in the way beginning The unprofitable is far from the profitable and indeterminate 
and the word near in the way beginning Unprofitable feeling is near to unprofitable feeling 
Therefore unprofitable feeling is far from the profitable and the indeterminate because of dissimilarity unconnectedness and non resemblance The profitable and the indeterminate are likewise far from the unprofitable
And so in all instances
But unprofitable feeling is near to unprofitable feeling because of similarity and resemblance
This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the past etc classifications of the feeling aggregate
PERCEPTION FORMATIONS AND CONSCIOUSNESS  This should also be understood of the perception etc associated with any kind of feeling
The truths next to that are the Four Noble Truths that is to say the noble truth of suffering the noble truth of the origin of suffering the noble truth of the cessation of suffering the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering
Herein
As to class and derivation Division by character et cetera
As to meaning tracing out meaning And likewise neither less nor more
As to order as to expounding Birth and so on knowledges function
As to division of the content As to a simile and tetrad
As to void singlefold and so on Similar and dissimilar
Thus should be known the exposition By those who know the teachings order
Herein as to class the meanings of the truths of suffering etc are analyzed as four in each case that are real not unreal not otherwise and must be penetrated by those penetrating suffering etc
according as it is said Sufferings meaning of oppressing meaning of being formed meaning of burning meaning of changing these are sufferings four meanings of suffering which are real not unreal not otherwise
Origins meaning of accumulating meaning of source meaning of bondage meaning of impeding 
Cessations meaning of escape meaning of seclusion meaning of being unformed meaning of deathlessness 
The paths meaning of outlet meaning of cause meaning of seeing meaning of predominance
these are the paths meanings of path which are real not unreal not otherwise 
Likewise Sufferings meaning of oppressing meaning of being formed meaning of burning meaning of change are its meaning of penetration to  and so on
So suffering etc should be understood according to the four meanings analyzed in each case
As to derivation
division by character et cetera here however firstly as to derivation of the word dukkha  the word du is met with in the sense of vile 
for they call a vile child a duputta 
The word kham  however is met with in the sense of empty 
for they call empty space kham
And the first truth is vile because it is the haunt of many dangers
and it is empty because it is devoid of the lastingness beauty pleasure and self conceived by rash people
So it is called dukkhaṃ  because of vileness and emptiness
Samudaya  the word sam denotes connection as in the words samāgama  sameta  and so on
The word u denotes rising up as in the words uppanna  udita  and so on
The word aya denotes a reason 
And this second truth is the reason for the arising of suffering when combined with the remaining conditions
So it is called dukkhasamudaya because it is the reason in combination for the arising of suffering
Nirodha  the word ni denotes absence and the word rodha a prison
Now the third truth is void of all destinies by rebirth and so there is no constraint of suffering here reckoned as the prison of the round of rebirths or when that cessation has been arrived at there is no more constraint of suffering reckoned as the prison of the round of rebirths And being the opposite of that prison it is called dukkhanirodha 
Or alternatively it is called cessation of suffering because it is a condition for the cessation of suffering consisting in nonarising
Nirodhagāminī paṭipadā  because the fourth truth goes to the cessation of suffering since it confronts that cessation as its object and being the way to attain cessation of suffering
it is called dukkha nirodhagāminī paṭipadā the way leading to the cessation of suffering
They are called Noble Truths because the Noble Ones the Buddhas etc penetrate them
according as it is said Bhikkhus there are these Four Noble Truths
What four These bhikkhus are the Four Noble Truths
The Noble Ones penetrate them therefore they are called Noble Truths 
Besides the Noble Truths are the Noble Ones Truths
according as it is said Bhikkhus in the world with its deities its Māras and its Brahmās in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans with its princes and men the Perfect One is the Noble One That is why they are called Noble Truths 
Or alternatively they are called Noble Truths because of the nobleness implied by their discovery
according as it is said Bhikkhus it is owing to the correct discovery of these Four Noble Truths that the Perfect One is called accomplished fully enlightened 
Besides the Noble Truths are the Truths that are Noble
To be noble is to be not unreal the meaning is not deceptive
according as it is said Bhikkhus these Four Noble Truths are real not unreal not otherwise that is why they are called Noble Truths  This is how the exposition should be known here as to derivation
How as to division by character et cetera
The truth of suffering has the characteristic of afflicting Its function is to burn It is manifested as occurrence 
The truth of origin has the characteristic of producing Its function is to prevent interruption It is manifested as impediment
The truth of cessation has the characteristic of peace Its function is not to die It is manifested as the signless
The truth of the path has the characteristic of an outlet Its function is to abandon defilements It is manifested as emergence
They have moreover the respective characteristics of occurrence making occur nonoccurrence and making not occur
and likewise the characteristics of the formed craving the unformed and seeing This is how the exposition should be understood here as to characteristic et cetera
As to meaning  tracing out the meaning as to meaning firstly what is the meaning of truth 
It is that which for those who examine it with the eye of understanding is not misleading like an illusion deceptive like a mirage or undiscoverable like the self of the sectarians but is rather the domain of noble knowledge as the real unmisleading actual state with its aspects of affliction production quiet and outlet
It is this real unmisleading actualness that should be understood as the meaning of truth just as heat is the characteristic of fire and just as it is in the nature of the world that things are subject to birth ageing and death
according as it is said Bhikkhus this suffering is real not unreal not otherwise  and so on in detail
Furthermore
There is no pain but is affliction And naught that is not pain afflicts
This certainty that it afflicts Is what is reckoned here as truth
No other source of pain than craving Nor aught that source provides but pain
This certainty in causing pain Is why it is considered truth
There is no peace except Nibbāna Nibbāna cannot but be peace
This certainty that it is peace Is what is reckoned here as truth
No outlet other than the path Nor fails the path to be the outlet
Its status as the very outlet Has made it recognized as truth
This real infallibility Which is their true essential core
Is what the wise declare to be Truths meaning common to all four
This is how the exposition should be understood as to meaning
How as to tracing out the meaning
This word truth is met with in various meanings
In such passages as Let him speak truth and not be angry it is verbal truth
In such passages as Ascetics and brahmans base themselves on truth it is the truth of abstinence from lying
In such passages as Why do they declare diverse truths the clever talkers that hold forth  it is truth as views
And in such passages as Truth is one there is no second it is as truth in the ultimate sense both Nibbāna and the path
In such passages as Of the four truths how many are profitable  it is noble truth
And here too it is proper as noble truth This is how the exposition should be understood as to tracing out the meaning
 As to neither less nor more but why are exactly four noble truths stated neither less nor more
Because no other exists and because none can be eliminated
For there is none extra to them nor can any one of them be eliminated
according as it is said Bhikkhus that an ascetic or brahman here should come and say This is not the truth of suffering the truth of suffering is another
I shall set aside this truth of suffering and make known another truth of sufferingthat is not possible and so on
and according as it is said Bhikkhus that any ascetic or brahman should say thus This is not the first noble truth of suffering that is taught by the ascetic Gotama rejecting this first noble truth of suffering I shall make known another first noble truth of sufferingthat is not possible and so on
Furthermore when announcing occurrence that is the process of existence the Blessed One announced it with a cause and he announced nonoccurrence as having a means thereto
So they are stated as four at the most as occurrence and nonoccurrence and the cause of each
Likewise they are stated as four since they have to be respectively fully understood abandoned realized and developed and also since they are the basis for craving craving the cessation of craving and the means to the cessation of craving and also since they are the reliance depended upon the delight in the reliance removal of the reliance and the means to the removal of the reliance This is how the exposition should be understood here as to neither less nor more
 As to order this too is only order of teaching 
The truth of suffering is given first since it is easy to understand because of its grossness and because it is common to all living beings
The truth of origin is given next to show its cause
Then the truth of cessation to make it known that with the cessation of the cause there is the cessation of the fruit
The truth of the path comes last to show the means to achieve that
Or alternatively he announced the truth of suffering first to instill a sense of urgency into living beings caught up in the enjoyment of the pleasure of becoming
and next to that the truth of origin to make it known that that suffering neither comes about of itself as something not made nor is it due to creation by an Overlord etc  but that on the contrary it is due to this cause
after that cessation to instill comfort by showing the escape to those who seek the escape from suffering with a sense of urgency because overwhelmed by suffering with its cause
And after that the path that leads to cessation to enable them to attain cessation This is how the exposition should be understood here as to order
As to expounding birth and so on the exposition should be understood here in accordance with the expositions of the things beginning with birth given by the Blessed One when describing the Four Noble Truths that is to say the twelve things in the description of suffering Birth is suffering ageing is suffering death is suffering sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are suffering association with the unloved is suffering separation from the loved is suffering not to get what one wants is suffering in short the five aggregates as objects of clinging are suffering  and the threefold craving in the description of origin That craving which produces further becoming is accompanied by delight and greed delighting in this and that
that is to say craving for sense desires craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming  and Nibbāna which has one meaning only in the description of cessation That which is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving giving it up relinquishing it letting it go not relying on it  and the eight things in the description of the path What is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering It is this Noble Eightfold Path
that is to say right view right thinking right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration 
Now this word birth has many meanings
For in the passage He recollects   one birth  two births it is becoming
In the passage Visākhā there is a kind of ascetics called Nigaṇṭhas  it is a monastic order
In the passage Birth is included in two aggregates it is the characteristic of whatever is formed
In the passage His birth is due to the first consciousness arisen the first cognition manifested in the mothers womb it is rebirthlinking
In the passage As soon as he was born  nanda the Bodhisatta  it is parturition
In the passage One who is not rejected and despised on account of birth it is clan
In the passage Sister since I was born with the noble birth it is the Noble Ones virtue
Here it should be regarded as the aggregates that occur from the time of rebirthlinking up to the exit from the mothers womb in the case of the womb born
and as only the aggregates of rebirthlinking in the case of the rest
But this is only an indirect treatment
In the direct sense however it is the first manifestation of any aggregates that are manifested in living beings when they are born anywhere that is called birth 
Its characteristic is the first genesis in any sphere of becoming Its function is to consign to a sphere of becoming It is manifested as an emerging here from a past becoming or it is manifested as the variedness of suffering
But why is it suffering
Because it is the basis for many kinds of suffering
For there are many kinds of suffering
that is to say intrinsic suffering  suffering in change  and suffering due to formations  and then concealed suffering exposed suffering indirect suffering and direct suffering
Herein bodily and mental painful feeling are called intrinsic suffering because of their individual essence their name and their painfulness
Bodily and mental pleasant feeling are called suffering in change because they are a cause for the arising of pain when they change 
Equanimous feeling and the remaining formations of the three planes are called suffering due to formations because they are oppressed by rise and fall
Such bodily and mental affliction as earache toothache fever born of lust fever born of hate etc is called concealed suffering because it can only be known by questioning and because the infliction is not openly evident
it is also called unevident suffering
The affliction produced by the thirtytwo tortures etc is called exposed suffering because it can be known without questioning and because the infliction is openly evident
it is also called evident suffering
Except intrinsic suffering all given in the exposition of the truth of suffering in the Vibhaṅga beginning with birth are also called indirect suffering because they are the basis for one kind of suffering or another
But intrinsic suffering is called direct suffering
Herein this birth is suffering because it is the basis for the suffering in the states of loss as made evident by the Blessed One by means of a simile in the Bālapaṇḍita Sutta  etc and for the suffering that arises in the happy destinies in the human world and is classed as rooted in the descent into the womb and so on
Here the suffering classed as rooted in the descent into the womb and so on is this When this being is born in the mothers womb he is not born inside a blue or red or white lotus etc but on the contrary like a worm in rotting fish rotting dough cesspools etc he is born in the belly in a position that is below the receptacle for undigested food  above the receptacle for digested food  between the bellylining and the backbone which is very cramped quite dark pervaded by very fetid draughts redolent of various smells of ordure and exceptionally loathsome
And on being reborn there for ten months he undergoes excessive suffering being cooked like a pudding in a bag by the heat produced in the mothers womb and steamed like a dumpling of dough with no bending stretching and so on So this firstly is the suffering rooted in the descent into the womb
When the mother suddenly stumbles or moves or sits down or gets up or turns round the extreme suffering he undergoes by being dragged back and forth and jolted up and down like a kid fallen into the hands of a drunkard or like a snakes young fallen into the hands of a snakecharmer and also the searing pain that he undergoes as though he had reappeared in the cold hells when his mother drinks cold water and as though deluged by a rain of embers when she swallows hot rice gruel rice etc and as though undergoing the torture of the lyepickling  when she swallows anything salty or acidic etcthis is the suffering rooted in gestation
When the mother has an abortion the pain that arises in him through the cutting and rending in the place where the pain arises that is not fit to be seen even by friends and intimates and companionsthis is the suffering rooted in abortion
The pain that arises in him when the mother gives birth through his being turned upsidedown by the kammaproduced winds forces and flung into that most fearful passage from the womb like an infernal chasm and lugged out through the extremely narrow mouth of the womb like an elephant through a keyhole like a denizen of hell being pounded to pulp by colliding rocksthis is the suffering rooted in parturition
The pain that arises in him after he is born and his body which is as delicate as a tender wound is taken in the hands bathed washed rubbed with cloths etc and which pain is like being pricked with needle points and gashed with razor blades etcthis is the suffering rooted in venturing outside the mothers womb
The pain that arises afterwards during the course of existence in one who punishes himself in one who devotes himself to the practice of mortification and austerity according to the vows of the naked ascetics in one who starves through anger and in one who hangs himselfthis is the suffering rooted in selfviolence
And that arising in one who undergoes flogging imprisonment etc at the hands of others is the suffering rooted in others violence
So this birth is the basis for all this suffering
Hence this is said
Now were no being born in hell again
The pain unbearable of scorching fires
And all the rest would then no footing gain
Therefore the Sage pronounced that birth is pain
Many the sorts of pain that beasts endure
When they are flogged with whips and sticks and goads
Since birth among them does this pain procure
Birth there is pain the consequence is sure
While ghosts know pain in great variety
Through hunger thirst wind sun and what not too
None unless born there knows this misery
So birth the Sage declares this pain to be
In the worldinterspace where demons dwell
In searing cold and inspissated gloom
Is pain requiring birth there for its spell
So with the birth the pain ensues as well
The horrible torment a being feels on coming out
When he has spent long months shut up inside the mothers womb
A hellish tomb of excrementwould never come about
Without rebirth that birth is pain there is no room for doubt
But why elaborate At any time or anywhere
Can there exist a painful state if birth do not precede
Indeed this Sage so great when he expounded pain took care
First to declare rebirth as pain the condition needed there
This firstly is the exposition of birth
Ageing is suffering ageing is twofold as a characteristic of whatever is formed and in the case of a continuity as the oldness of aggregates included in a single becoming which oldness is known as brokenness and so on  The latter is intended here
But this ageing has as its characteristic the maturing of aggregates Its function is to lead on to death It is manifested as the vanishing of youth
It is suffering because of the suffering due to formations and because it is a basis for suffering
Ageing is the basis for the bodily and mental suffering that arises owing to many conditions such as leadenness in all the limbs decline and warping of the faculties vanishing of youth undermining of strength loss of memory and intelligence contempt on the part of others and so on
Hence this is said
With leadenness in every limb With every faculty declining
With vanishing of youthfulness With memory and wit grown dim
With strength now drained by undermining With growing unattractiveness
To wife and family and then With dotage coming on what pain
Alike of body and of mind A mortal must expect to find
Since ageing all of this will bring Ageing is well named suffering
This is the exposition of ageing
Death is suffering death too is twofold as a characteristic of the formed with reference to which it is said Ageing and death are included in the aggregates 
and as the severing of the connection of the life faculty included in a single becoming with reference to which it is said So mortals are in constant fear  that they will die 
The latter is intended here
Death with birth as its condition death by violence death by natural causes death from exhaustion of the life span death from exhaustion of merit are names for it
It has the characteristic of a fall Its function is to disjoin It is manifested as absence from the destiny in which there was the rebirth
It should be understood as suffering because it is a basis for suffering
Hence this is said
When wicked men their foul deeds see Or sign of new rebirth may be
As regards sorrow etc sorrow is a burning in the mind in one affected by loss of relatives and so on
Although in meaning it is the same as grief
nevertheless it has inner consuming as its characteristic its function is completely to consume the mind It is manifested as continual sorrowing
It is suffering because it is intrinsic suffering and because it is a basis for suffering
Hence this is said
Sorrow is a poisoned dart That penetrates a beings heart
Setting up a burning there Like burning with a redhot spear
This state of mind brings future pain Such as disease and then again Ageing and death so one may tell Where for it is called pain as well
Lamentation is verbal clamour on the part of one affected by loss of relatives and so on
It has crying out as its characteristic Its function is proclaiming virtues and vices It is manifested as tumult
It is suffering because it is a state of suffering due to formations and because it is a basis for suffering
Hence this is said
Now when a man is struck by sorrows dart and he laments
The pain he is already undergoing he augments
With pain born of dry throat and lips and palate hard to bear
And so lamenting too is pain the Buddha did declare
This is the exposition of lamentation
Pain is bodily pain Its characteristic is the oppression of the body Its function is to cause grief in the foolish It is manifested as bodily affliction
It is suffering because it is intrinsic suffering and because it brings mental suffering
Hence this is said
Pain distresses bodily Thereby distressing mentally again
So acting fundamentally It therefore is especially called pain
This is the exposition of pain
Grief is mental pain
Its characteristic is mental oppression Its function is to distress the mind It is manifested as mental affliction
It is suffering because it is intrinsic suffering and because it brings bodily suffering
For those who are gripped by mental pain tear their hair weep thump their breasts and twist and writhe they throw themselves upsidedown use the knife swallow poison hang themselves with ropes walk into fires and undergo many kinds of suffering
Hence this is said
Though grief itself distresses mind It makes distress of bodily kind occur
And that is why this mental grief Is pain as those that have no grief aver
This is the exposition of grief
Despair is the same as the humour produced by excessive mental suffering in one affected by loss of relatives and so on
Some say that it is one of the states included in the formations aggregate
Its characteristic is burning of the mind Its function is to bemoan It is manifested as dejection
It is suffering because it is suffering due to formations because of the burning of the mind and because of bodily dejection
Hence this is said
So great the pain despair imparts It burns the heart as with fevers flame
The bodys function it impairs And so despair borrows from pain its name
This is the exposition of despair
Sorrow is like the cooking of oil etc in a pot over a slow fire
Lamentation is like its boiling over from the pot when cooking over a quick fire
Despair is like what remains in the pot after it has boiled over and is unable to do so any more going on cooking in the pot till it dries up
Association with the unloved is meeting with disagreeable beings and formations 
Its characteristic is association with the undesirable Its function is to distress the mind It is manifested as a harmful state
It is suffering because it is a basis for suffering
Hence this is said
The mere sight of an unloved thing Brings firstly mental suffering
And suffering of body too Through touching it can then ensue
And we therefore may recognize Since meeting the unloved gives rise
To either kind of pain that He decided pain its name should be
This is the exposition of association with the unloved
Separation from the loved is to be parted from agreeable beings and formations 
Its characteristic is dissociation from desirable objects Its function is to arouse sorrow It is manifested as loss
It is suffering because it is a basis for the suffering of sorrow
Hence this is said
Of fools who from their wealth must part or kin Which roughly should be grounds enough
For counting the loved lost as suffering
This is the exposition of separation from the loved
Not to get what one wants the want itself of some unobtainable object expressed in such passages as Oh that we were not subject to birth is called suffering since one does not get what is wanted
Its characteristic is the wanting of an unobtainable object Its function is to seek that It is manifested as disappointment
It is suffering because it is a basis for suffering
Hence this is said
When beings here expect to gain Something they build their hopes upon Which fails them they are woebegone With disappointments numbing pain
Thereof the cause is hope they wed To something they cannot obtain
Not to get what one wants is pain The Conqueror has therefore said
This is the exposition of not to get what one wants
In short the five aggregates as objects of clinging
Now birth and ageing and each thing Told in describing suffering
And those not mentioned could not be Were there no aggregates for clinging
Wherefore these aggregates for clinging Are taken in totality
As pain by Him the Dhammas King Who taught the end of suffering
For birth etc thus oppress the pentad of aggregates as objects of clinging as fire does fuel as shooting does a target as gadflies flies etc do a cows body as reapers do a field as village raiders do a Village and they are generated in the aggregates as weeds creepers etc are on the ground as flowers fruits and sprouts are on trees
And the aggregates as objects of clinging have birth as their initial suffering ageing as their medial suffering and death as their final suffering The suffering due to burning in one who is the victim of the pain that threatens death is sorrow The suffering consisting in crying out by one who is unable to bear that is lamentation Next the suffering consisting in affliction of the body due to the contact of undesirable tangible data in other words disturbance of the elements is pain The suffering oppressing the mind through resistance to that in ordinary people oppressed by it is grief The suffering consisting in brooding in those dejected by the augmentation of sorrow etc is despair The suffering consisting in frustration of wants in those whose hopes are disappointed is not to get what one wants So when their various aspects are examined the aggregates as objects of clinging are themselves suffering
It is impossible to tell it all without remainder showing each kind of suffering even by going on doing so for many eons so the Blessed One said In short the five aggregates as objects of clinging are suffering in order to show in short how all that suffering is present in any of the five aggregates as objects of clinging in the same way that the taste of the water in the whole ocean is to be found in a single drop of its water
This is the exposition of the aggregates as objects of clinging
This firstly is the method for the description of suffering
In the description of the way leading to the cessation of suffering eight things are given Though they have of course already been explained as to meaning in the Description of the Aggregates still we shall deal with them here in order to remain aware of the difference between them when they occur in a single moment on the occasion of the path
Briefly  when a meditator is progressing towards the penetration of the four truths his eye of understanding with Nibbāna as its object eliminates the inherent tendency to ignorance and that is right view
It has right seeing as its characteristic Its function is to reveal elements It is manifested as the abolition of the darkness of ignorance
When he possesses such view his directing of the mind on to Nibbāna which directing is associated with that right view abolishes wrong thinking and that is right thinking
Its characteristic is right directing of the mind on to its object Its function is to bring about absorption of the path consciousness in Nibbāna as object It is manifested as the abandoning of wrong thinking
And when he sees and thinks thus his abstinence from wrong speech which abstinence is associated with that right view abolishes bad verbal conduct and that is called right speech
It has the characteristic of embracing  Its function is to abstain It is manifested as the abandoning of wrong speech
When he abstains thus his abstinence from killing living things which abstinence is associated with that right view cuts off wrong action and that is called right action
It has the characteristic of originating  Its function is to abstain It is manifested as the abandoning of wrong action
When his right speech and right action are purified his abstinence from wrong livelihood which abstinence is associated with that right view cuts off scheming etc and that is called right livelihood
It has the characteristic of cleansing  Its function is to bring about the occurrence of a proper livelihood It is manifested as the abandoning of wrong livelihood
When he is established on that plane of virtue called right speech right action and right livelihood his energy which is in conformity and associated with that right view cuts off idleness and that is called right effort
It has the characteristic of exerting Its function is the nonarousing of unprofitable things and so on It is manifested as the abandoning of wrong effort
When he exerts himself thus the nonforgetfulness in his mind which is associated with that right view shakes off wrong mindfulness and that is called right mindfulness
It has the characteristic of establishing  Its function is not to forget It is manifested as the abandoning of wrong mindfulness
When his mind is thus guarded by supreme mindfulness the unification of mind which is associated with that right view abolishes wrong concentration and that is called right concentration
It has the characteristic of nondistraction Its function is to concentrate It is manifested as the abandoning of wrong concentration
This is the method in the description of the way leading to the cessation of suffering
This is how the exposition should be understood here as to defining birth and so on
In the description of the cessation of suffering it is the cessation of the origin that is stated by the words that which is  of that same craving and so on Why is that
Because the cessation of suffering comes about with the cessation of its origin
For it is with the cessation of its origin that suffering ceases not otherwise
Hence it is said
While yet its root remains unharmed and sound
Just as a tree cut down grows up again
So with the tendency to crave intact
This suffering is ever reproduced 
So it is because suffering ceases only through the cessation of its origin that when teaching the cessation of suffering the Blessed One therefore taught the cessation of the origin
For the Perfect Ones behave like lions
When they make suffering cease and when they teach the cessation of suffering they deal with the cause not the fruit
But the sectarians behave like dogs
When they make suffering cease and when they teach the cessation of suffering by teaching devotion to selfmortification etc they deal with the fruit not the cause
This in the first place is how the motive for teaching the cessation of suffering by means of the cessation of its origin should be understood
This is the meaning Of that same craving of that craving which it was said produces further becoming and which was classed as craving for sense desires and so on
It is the path that is called fading away
for With the fading away of greed he is liberated is said
Fading away and cessation is cessation through fading away
Remainderless fading away and cessation is cessation through fading away that is remainderless because of eradication of inherent tendencies
Or alternatively it is abandoning that is called fading away and so the construction here can be regarded as remainderless fading away remainderless cessation 
But as to meaning all of them are synonyms for Nibbāna
For in the ultimate sense it is Nibbāna that is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering 
But because craving fades away and ceases on coming to that it is therefore called fading away and cessation
And because there comes to be the giving up etc of that craving on coming to that Nibbāna and since there is not even one kind of reliance here to be depended upon from among the reliances consisting in the cords of sense desires etc it is therefore called giving it up relinquishing it letting it go not relying on it
It has peace as its characteristic Its function is not to die or its function is to comfort It is manifested as the signless or it is manifested as non diversification
Question  Is Nibbāna nonexistent because it is unapprehendable like the hares horn
Answer That is not so because it is apprehendable by the right means
For it is apprehendable by some namely the nobles ones by the right means in other words by the way that is appropriate to it the way of virtue concentration and understanding it is like the supramundane consciousness of others which is apprehendable only by certain of the Noble Ones by means of knowledge of penetration of others minds Therefore it should not be said that it is nonexistent because unapprehendable
for it should not be said that what the foolish ordinary man does not apprehend is unapprehendable
Again it should not be said that Nibbāna does not exist Why not
Because it then follows that the way would be futile
For if Nibbāna were non existent then it would follow that the right way which includes the three aggregates beginning with virtue and is headed by right understanding would be futile
And it is not futile because it does reach Nibbāna
Q  But futility of the way does not follow because what is reached is absence that is absence of the five aggregates consequent upon the cutting off of the defilements
A That is not so Because though there is absence of past and future aggregates there is nevertheless no reaching of Nibbāna simply because of that
Q  Then is the absence of present aggregates as well Nibbāna
A That is not so Because their absence is an impossibility since if they are absent their nonpresence follows Besides if Nibbāna were absence of present aggregates too that would entail the fault of excluding the arising of the Nibbāna element with result of past clinging left at the path moment which has present aggregates as its support
Q  Then will there be no fault if it is nonpresence of defilements that is Nibbāna
A That is not so Because it would then follow that the noble path was meaningless
For if it were so then since defilements can be nonexistent also before the moment of the noble path it follows that the noble path would be meaningless
Consequently that is no reason it is unreasonable to say that Nibbāna is unapprehendable that it is nonexistence and so on
Q  But is not Nibbāna destruction because of the passage beginning That friend which is the destruction of greed  of hate  of delusion  is Nibbāna  
A That is not so because it would follow that Arahantship also was mere destruction
For that too is described in the same way beginning That friend which is the destruction of greed  of hate  of delusion  is Arahantship 
And what is more the fallacy then follows that Nibbāna would be temporary etc
for if it were so it would follow that Nibbāna would be temporary have the characteristic of being formed and be obtainable regardless of right effort
and precisely because of its having formed characteristics it would be included in the formed and it would be burning with the fires of greed etc and because of its burning it would follow that it was suffering
Q  Is there no fallacy if Nibbāna is that kind of destruction subsequent to which there is no more occurrence
A That is not so Because there is no such kind of destruction
And even if there were the aforesaid fallacies would not be avoided Also because it would follow that the noble path was Nibbāna
For the noble path causes the destruction of defects and that is why it is called destruction
and subsequent to that there is no more occurrence of the defects
But it is because the kind of destruction called cessation consisting in nonarising that is Nibbāna serves figuratively speaking as decisivesupport for the path that Nibbāna is called destruction as a metaphor for it
Q  Why is it not stated in its own form
A Because of its extreme subtlety
And its extreme subtlety is established because it inclined the Blessed One to inaction that is to not teaching the Dhamma  and because a Noble Ones eye is needed to see it 
It is not shared by all because it can only be reached by one who is possessed of the path And it is uncreated because it has no first beginning
Q  Since it is when the path is then it is not uncreated
A That is not so because it is not arousable by the path
it is only reachable not arousable by the path
that is why it is uncreated
It is because it is uncreated that it is free from ageing and death
It is because of the absence of its creation and of its ageing and death that it is permanent
Q  Then it follows that Nibbāna too has the kind of permanence claimed of the atom and so on
A That is not so Because of the absence of any cause that brings about its arising
Q  Because Nibbāna has permanence then these that is the atom etc are permanent as well
A That is not so Because in that proposition the characteristic of logical cause does not arise In other words to say that Nibbāna is permanent is not to assert a reason why the atom etc should be permanent
Q  Then they are permanent because of the absence of their arising as Nibbāna is
A That is not so Because the atom and so on have not been established as facts
The aforesaid logical reasoning proves that only this that is Nibbāna is permanent precisely because it is uncreated and it is immaterial because it transcends the individual essence of matter
The Buddhas goal is one and has no plurality
But this single goal Nibbāna is firstly called with result of past clinging left since it is made known together with the aggregates resulting from past clinging still remaining during the Arahants life being thus made known in terms of the stilling of defilement and the remaining result of past clinging that are present in one who has reached it by means of development
But secondly it is called without result of past clinging left since after the last consciousness of the Arahant who has abandoned arousing future aggregates and so prevented kamma from giving result in a future existence there is no further arising of aggregates of existence and those already arisen have disappeared So the result of past clinging that remained is nonexistent and it is in terms of this nonexistence in the sense that there is no result of past clinging here that that same goal is called without result of past clinging left 
Because it can be arrived at by distinction of knowledge that succeeds through untiring perseverance and because it is the word of the Omniscient One Nibbāna is not nonexistent as regards individual essence in the ultimate sense
for this is said Bhikkhus there is an unborn an unbecome an unmade an unformed 
This is the section of the definition dealing with the description of the cessation of suffering
As to knowledges function  the exposition should be understood according to knowledge of the truths
For knowledge of the truths is twofold namely knowledge as idea and knowledge as penetration 
Herein knowledge as idea is mundane and occurs through hearsay etc about cessation and the path
Knowledge consisting in penetration which is supramundane penetrates the four truths as its function by making cessation its object
according as it is said Bhikkhus he who sees suffering sees also the origin of suffering sees also the cessation of suffering sees also the way leading to the cessation of suffering  and it should be repeated thus of all four truths
But its function will be made clear in the purification by knowledge and vision 
When this knowledge is mundane then occurring as the overcoming of obsessions the knowledge of suffering therein forestalls the false view of individuality
the knowledge of origin forestalls the annihilation view
the knowledge of cessation forestalls the eternity view
the knowledge of the path forestalls the moralinefficacyofaction view
Or alternatively the knowledge of suffering forestalls wrong theories of fruit in other words seeing lastingness beauty pleasure and self in the aggregates which are devoid of lastingness beauty pleasure and self
and knowledge of origin forestalls wrong theories of cause that occur as finding a reason where there is none such as The world occurs owing to an Overlord a Basic Principle Time Nature  etc
the knowledge of cessation forestalls such wrong theories of cessation as taking final release to be in the immaterial world in a World Apex  etc
and the path knowledge forestalls wrong theories of means that occur by taking to be the way of purification what is not the way of purification and consists in devotion to indulgence in the pleasures of sense desire and in selfmortification
Hence this is said
About its origin about its ceasing About the means that lead to its cessation
As long as a man is vague about the worldSo long he cannot recognize the truths
This is how the exposition should be understood here as to knowledges function
As to division of content all states excepting craving and states free from cankers are included in the truth of suffering
The thirtysix modes of behaviour of craving are included in the truth of origin
The truth of cessation is unmixed
As regards the truth of the path the heading of right view includes the fourth road to power consisting in inquiry the understanding faculty the understanding power and the investigationofstates enlightenment factor
The term right thinking includes the three kinds of applied thought beginning with that of renunciation 
The term right speech includes the four kinds of good verbal conduct 
The term right action includes the three kinds of good bodily conduct 
The heading right livelihood includes fewness of wishes and contentment
Or all these three constitute the virtue loved by Noble Ones and the virtue loved by Noble Ones has to be embraced by the hand of faith consequently the faith faculty the faith power and the road to power consisting in zeal are included because of the presence of these three
The term right effort includes fourfold right endeavour the energy faculty energy power and energy enlightenment factor
The term right mindfulness includes the fourfold foundation of mindfulness the mindfulness faculty the mindfulness power and the mindfulness enlightenment factor
The term right concentration includes the three kinds of concentration beginning with that accompanied by applied and sustained thought  consciousness concentration the concentration faculty the concentration power and the enlightenment factors of happiness tranquillity concentration and equanimity This is how the exposition should be understood as to division of content
As to simile The truth of suffering should be regarded as a burden the truth of origin as the taking up of the burden the truth of cessation as the putting down of the burden the truth of the path as the means to putting down the burden 
The truth of suffering is like a disease the truth of origin is like the cause of the disease the truth of cessation is like the cure of the disease and the truth of the path is like the medicine
Or the truth of suffering is like a famine the truth of origin is like a drought the truth of cessation is like plenty and the truth of the path is like timely rain
Furthermore these truths can be understood in this way by applying these similes enmity the cause of the enmity the removal of the enmity and the means to remove the enmity a poison tree the trees root the cutting of the root and the means to cut the root fear the cause of fear freedom from fear and the means to attain it the hither shore the great flood the further shore and the effort to reach it This is how the exposition should be understood as to simile
As to tetrad there is suffering that is not noble truth there is noble truth that is not suffering there is what is both suffering and noble truth and there is what is neither suffering nor noble truth
So also with origin and the rest
Herein though states associated with the path and the fruits of asceticism are suffering since they are suffering due to formations because of the words What is impermanent is painful  still they are not the noble truth of suffering
 Cessation is a noble truth but it is not suffering
 The other two noble truths can be suffering because they are impermanent but they are not so in the real sense of that for the fullunderstanding of which the life of purity is lived under the Blessed One
The five aggregates as objects of clinging except craving are in all aspects both suffering and noble truth
 The states associated with the path and the fruits of asceticism are neither suffering in the real sense of that for the fullunderstanding of which the life of purity is lived under the Blessed One nor are they noble truth
Origin etc should also be construed in the corresponding way This is how the exposition should be understood here as to tetrad
As to void singlefold and so on firstly as to void in the ultimate sense all the truths should be understood as void because of the absence of any experiencer any doer anyone who is extinguished and any goer
Hence this is said
For there is suffering but none who suffers
Doing exists although there is no dor
Extinction is but no extinguished person
Although there is a path there is no goer
Or alternatively
So void of lastingness and beauty pleasure self Is the first pair and void of self the deathless state
And void of lastingness of pleasure and of self Is the path too for such is voidness in these four
Or three are void of cessation and cessation is void of the other three
Or the cause is void of the result because of the absence of suffering in the origin and of cessation in the path the cause is not gravid with its fruit like the Primordial Essence of those who assert the existence of Primordial Essence
And the result is void of the cause owing to the absence of inherence of the origin in suffering and of the path in cessation the fruit of a cause does not have its cause inherent in it like the two atoms etc of those who assert inherence
Hence this is said
Here three are of cessation void Cessation void too of these three
The cause of its effect is void Void also of its cause the effect must be
This in the first place is how the exposition should be understood as to void
As to singlefold and so on and here all suffering is of one kind as the state of occurrence
It is of two kinds as mentalitymateriality
It is of three kinds as divided into rebirthprocess becoming in the sense sphere finematerial sphere and immaterial sphere
It is of four kinds classed according to the four nutriments
It is of five kinds classed according to the five aggregates as objects of clinging
Also origin is of one kind as making occur
It is of two kinds as associated and not associated with false view
It is of three kinds as craving for sense desires craving for becoming and craving for nonbecoming
It is of four kinds as abandonable by the four paths
It is of five kinds classed as delight in materiality and so on
It is of six kinds classed as the six groups of craving
Also cessation is of one kind being the unformed element
But indirectly it is of two kinds as with result of past clinging left and as without result of past clinging left
and of three kinds as the stilling of the three kinds of becoming
and of four kinds as approachable by the four paths
and of five kinds as the subsiding of the five kinds of delight
and of six kinds classed according to the destruction of the six groups of craving
Also the path is of one kind as what should be developed
It is of two kinds classed according to serenity and insight or classed according to seeing and developing
It is of three kinds classed according to the three aggregates
for the path being selective is included by the three aggregates which are comprehensive as a city is by a kingdom
according as it is said
The three aggregates are not included in the Noble Eightfold Path friend Visākha but the Noble Eightfold Path is included by the three aggregates
Any right speech any right action any right livelihood these are included in the virtue aggregate
Any right effort any right mindfulness any right concentration these are included in the concentration aggregate
Any right view any right thinking these are included in the understanding aggregate 
For here the three beginning with right speech are virtue and so they are included in the virtue aggregate being of the same kind
For although in the text the description is given in the locative case as in the virtue aggregate still the meaning should be understood according to the instrumental case that is by the virtue aggregate
As to the three beginning with right effort concentration cannot of its own nature cause absorption through unification on the object but with energy accomplishing its function of exerting and mindfulness accomplishing its function of preventing wobbling it can do so
Here is a simile three friends thinking We will celebrate the festival entered a park Then one saw a champak tree in full blossom but he could not reach the flowers by raising his hand
The second bent down for the first to climb on his back But although standing on the others back he still could not pick them because of his unsteadiness
Then the third offered his shoulder as support
So standing on the back of the one and supporting himself on the others shoulder he picked as many flowers as he wanted and after adorning himself he went and enjoyed the festival
And so it is with this
For the three states beginning with right effort which are born together are like the three friends who enter the park together
The object is like the champak tree in full blossom
Concentration which cannot of its own nature bring about absorption by unification on the object is like the man who could not pick the flower by raising his arm
Effort is like the companion who bent down giving his back to mount upon
Mindfulness is like the friend who stood by giving his shoulder for support
Just as standing on the back of the one and supporting himself on the others shoulder he could pick as many flowers as he wanted so too when energy accomplishes its function of exerting and when mindfulness accomplishes its function of preventing wobbling with the help so obtained concentration can bring about absorption by unification on the object
So here in the concentration aggregate it is only concentration that is included as of the same kind But effort and mindfulness are included because of their action in assisting
Also as regards right view and right thinking understanding cannot of its own nature define an object as impermanent painful notself
But with applied thought giving assistance by repeatedly hitting the object it can
How
Just as a money changer having a coin placed in his hand and being desirous of looking at it on all sides equally cannot turn it over with the power of his eye only
but by turning it over with his fingers he is able to look at it on all sides similarly understanding cannot of its own nature define an object as impermanent and so on
But assisted by applied thought with its characteristic of directing the mind on to the object and its function of striking and threshing as it were hitting and turning over it can take anything given and define it
So here in the understanding aggregate it is only right view that is included as of the same kind But right thinking is included because of its action in assisting
So the path is included by the three aggregates
Hence it was said that it is of three kinds classed according to the three aggregates
And it is of four kinds as the path of streamentry and so on
In addition all the truths are of one kind because they are not unreal or because they must be directly known
They are of two kinds as mundane and supramundane or formed and unformed
They are of three kind as to be abandoned by seeing and development not to be abandoned and neither to be abandoned nor not to be abandoned
They are of four kinds classed according to what has to be fully understood and so on  This is how the exposition should be understood as to singlefold and so on
As to similar and dissimilar all the truths are similar to each other because they are not unreal are void of self and are difficult to penetrate
according as it is said
What do you think nanda which is more difficult to do more difficult to perform that a man should shoot an arrow through a small keyhole from a distance time after time without missing or that he should penetrate the tip of a hair split a hundred times with the tip of a similar hair
 This is more difficult to do venerable sir more difficult to perform that a man should penetrate the tip of a hair split a hundred times with the tip of a similar hair
They penetrate something more difficult to penetrate than that nanda
who penetrate correctly thus This is suffering  who penetrate correctly thus This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering 
They are dissimilar when defined according to their individual characteristics
And the first two are similar since they are profound because hard to grasp since they are mundane and since they are subject to cankers
They are dissimilar in being divided into fruit and cause and being respectively to be fully understood and to be abandoned
And the last two are similar since they are hard to grasp because profound since they are supramundane and since they are free from cankers
They are dissimilar in being divided into object and what has an object and in being respectively to be realized and to be developed
And the first and third are similar since they come under the heading of result
They are dissimilar in being formed and unformed
Also the second and fourth are similar since they come under the heading of cause
They are dissimilar in being respectively entirely unprofitable and entirely profitable
And the first and fourth are similar in being formed
They are dissimilar in being mundane and supramundane
Also the second and the third are similar since they are the state of neithertrainernornontrainer 
They are dissimilar in being respectively with object and without object
A man of vision can apply By suchlike means his talent so
That he among the truths may know The similar and contrary
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the Treatise on the Development of Understanding
called The Description of the Faculties and Truths
The sixteenth chapter
The turn has now come for the exposition of the dependent origination itself and the dependentlyoriginated states comprised by the word etc since these still remain out of the states called the soil  of which it was said above The states classed as aggregates bases elements faculties truths and dependent origination etc are the soil 
Herein firstly it is the states beginning with ignorance that should be understood as dependent origination
For this is said by the Blessed One
And what is the dependent origination bhikkhus
With ignorance as condition there are volitional formations with formations as condition consciousness with consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality with mentality materiality as condition the sixfold base with the sixfold base as condition contact with contact as condition feeling with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging with clinging as condition becoming with becoming as condition birth with birth as condition there is ageingand death and sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
thus there is the arising of this whole mass of suffering
This is called the dependent origination bhikkhus 
Secondly it is the states beginning with ageinganddeath that should be understood as dependentlyoriginated states
For this is said by the Blessed One
And what are the dependentlyoriginated states bhikkhus
Ageinganddeath is impermanent bhikkhus formed dependently originated subject to destruction subject to fall subject to fading away subject to cessation
Birth is impermanent bhikkhus  Becoming  Clinging  Craving  Feeling  Contact  The sixfold base  Mentalitymateriality  Consciousness  Formations  Ignorance is impermanent bhikkhus formed dependently originated subject to destruction subject to fall subject to fading away subject to cessation
These are called the dependentlyoriginated states bhikkhus 
Here is a brief explanation
The states that are conditions should be understood as the dependent origination
The states generated by such and such conditions are dependentlyoriginated states
How is that to be known
By the Blessed Ones word
For it is precisely those states which are conditions that with the synonyms beginning with reality have been called dependent origination by the Blessed One when teaching the dependent origination in the sutta on the Teaching of the Dependent Origination and Dependentlyoriginated States thus
And what is dependent origination bhikkhus
With birth as condition bhikkhus there is ageing and death Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise there yet remains that element relatedness of states regularity of states specific conditionally
The Perfect One discovers it penetrates to it Having discovered it penetrated to it he announces it teaches it makes it known establishes exposes expounds and explains it See he says
With birth as condition there is ageing and death
With becoming as condition bhikkhus there is birth  With ignorance as condition bhikkhus there are formations Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise there yet remains that element relatedness of states regularity of states specific conditionally The Perfect One discovers it penetrates to it Having discovered it penetrated to it he announces it teaches it makes it known establishes exposes expounds and explains it See he says
With ignorance as condition there are formations 
So bhikkhus that herein which is reality not unreality not otherness specific conditionality
that is called dependent origination 
Consequently it should be understood that dependent origination has the characteristic of being the conditions for the states beginning with ageingand death Its function is to continue the process of suffering It is manifested as the wrong path
Because particular states are produced by particular conditions neither less nor more it is called reality  Because once the conditions have met in combination there is no nonproducing even for an instant of the states they generate it is called not unreality  Because there is no arising of one state with another states conditions it is called not otherness Because there is a condition or because there is a total of conditions for these states beginning with ageinganddeath as already stated it is called specific conditionality
Here is the word meaning idappaccayā  imesaṃ paccayā 
idappaccayā  idappaccayatā 
Or alternatively idappaccayatā  idappaccayānaṃ samūho 
The characteristic must be sought from grammar
Some in fact say that the expression paṭicca samuppāda is characterized thus having depended  a right arising  depending on causes rightly by disregarding such causes conjectured by sectarians as the Primordial Essence  World Soul  and so on  So what they call dependent origination is a simple arising for they equate the prefix saṃ only with sammā and ignore saṃ  That is untenable
Why
There is no such sutta it contradicts suttas it admits of no profound treatment and it is ungrammatical
No sutta describes the dependent origination as simple arising
Anyone who asserts that dependent origination is of that kind involves himself in conflict with the Padesavihāra Sutta
How
The Newly Enlightened Ones abiding is the bringing of the dependent origination to mind because of these words of the Blessed Ones Then in the first watch of the night the Blessed One brought to mind the dependent origination in direct and reverse order as origination and cessation  Now padesavihāra is the abiding in one part of that
according as it is said Bhikkhus I abode in a part of the abiding in which I abode when I was newly enlightened 
And there he abode in the vision of structure of conditions not in the vision of simple arising
according as it is said So I understood feeling with wrong view as its condition and feeling with right view as its condition and feeling with wrong thinking as its condition   all of which should be quoted in full
So anyone who asserts that dependent origination is simple arising involves himself in conflict with the Padesavihāra Sutta
There is likewise contradiction of the Kaccāna Sutta
For in the Kaccāna Sutta it is said When a man sees correctly with right understanding the origination of the world Kaccāna he does not say of the world that it is not  And there it is the dependent origination in forward order not simple arising that as the origination of the world from its conditions is set forth in order to eliminate the annihilation view
For the annihilation view is not eliminated by seeing simple arising
but it is eliminated by seeing the chain of conditions
as a chain of fruits following on a chain of conditions
So anyone who asserts that the dependent origination is simple arising involves himself in contradiction of the Kaccāna Sutta
It admits of no profound treatment this has been said by the Blessed One This dependent origination is profound nanda and profound it appears 
And the profundity is fourfold as we shall explain below 
but there is none of that in simple arising
And this dependent origination is explained by the teachers as adorned with the fourfold method  but there is no need of any such tetrad of methods in simple arising So dependent origination is not simple arising since that admits of no profound treatment
It is ungrammatical this word paṭicca  being a gerund of the verb paṭi  eti to go back to establishes a meaning in a formula of establishment by verb when it is construed as past with the same subject as that of the principal verb
as in the sentence Having depended on the eye and visible objects eye consciousness arises  
But if it is construed here with the word uppāda  which is a noun in a formula of establishment by noun there is a breach of grammar because there is no shared subject as there is in abovequoted sentence and so it does not establish any meaning al all So the dependent origination is not simple arising because that is ungrammatical
Here it might be argued We shall add the words comes to be thus Having depended arising comes to be   That will not do
Why not
Because there is no instance in which it has been added and because the fallacy of the arising of an arising follows
For in such passages as Paṭiccasamuppādaṃ vo bhikkhave desessāmi I shall teach you the dependent origination bhikkhus
Katamo ca bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo  Ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo  This is called the dependent origination bhikkhus 
the words comes to be are not added in any single instance And there is no such expression as arising comes to be
if there were it would be tantamount to saying that arising itself had an arising too
And those are wrong who imagine that specific conditionality is the specific conditions abstract essencewhat is called abstract essence being a particular mode in ignorance etc that acts as cause in the manifestation of formations etc
and that the term dependent origination is used for an alteration in formations when there is that particular mode in the way of occurrence of ignorance
Why are they wrong
Because it is ignorance etc themselves that are called causes
For in the following passage it is ignorance etc themselves not their alteration that are called the causes of these states Therefore nanda just this is the cause this is the source this is the origin this is the condition for ageinganddeath that is to say birth  for formations that is to say  
Therefore it is the actual states themselves as conditions that should be understood as dependent origination  So what was said above can be understood as rightly said
If any notion arises in the guise of a literal interpretation of the term dependent origination to the effect that it is only arising that is stated it should be got rid of by apprehending the meaning of this expression in the following way
For In double form this term relates to a totality of state Produced from a conditionality Hence the conditions for that sum Through metaphors device have come To bear their fruits name figuratively In the Blessed Ones exposition
This term dependent origination when applied to the total of states produced from the total conditionality must be taken in two ways
For that total ought to be arrived at  since when it is arrived at  it leads to supramundane welfare and bliss and so the wise regard it as worthy to be arrived at 
and then when it arises  it does so together with and rightly  not singly or causelessly thus it is a coarising 
Consequently it is to be arrived at and it is a coarising  thus it is dependent origination 
Again it arises as a togetherness  thus it is a co arising  but it does so having depended in combination with conditions not regardless of them Consequently it having depended  is a coarising  thus in this way also it is dependent origination 
And the total of causes is a condition for that total of states produced from the conditionality so because it is a condition for that this total of causes is called dependent origination using for it the term ordinarily used for its fruit just as in the world molasses which is a condition for phlegm is spoken of thus Molasses is phlegm or just as in the Dispensation the arising of Buddhas which is a condition for bliss is spoken of thus The arising of Buddhas is bliss 
Or alternatively
The sum of causes too they call Facing its counterpart so all Is in that sense dependent as they tell This sum of causes too as stated
Gives fruits that rise associated So coarising it is called as well
This total of causesindicated severally under the heading of each cause beginning with ignorancefor the manifestation of formations etc is called dependent  taking it as facing gone to its counterpart owing to the mutual interdependence of the factors in the combination in the sense both that they produce common fruit and that none can be dispensed with
And it is called a coarising since it causes the states that occur in unresolved mutual interdependence to arise associatedly
Consequently it is dependent and a coarising  thus in this way also it is dependent origination 
Another method
This total conditionally acting interdependently Arouses states together equally
So this too is a reason here wherefore the Greatest Sage the Seer Gave to this term its form thus succinctly
Among the conditions described under the headings of ignorance etc the respective conditions that make the conditionallyarisen states beginning with formations arise are incapable of making them arise when not mutually dependent and when deficient
Therefore this conditionality by depending makes states arise equally and together  not piecemeal and successivelyso it has been termed here thus by the Sage who is skilled in phraseology that conforms to its meaning it has been accurately termed dependent origination  is the meaning
And while so termed
The first component will deny the false view of eternity And so on and the second will prevent
The nihilistic type of view and others like it while the two Together show the true way that is meant
The first the word dependent indicates the combination of the conditions since states in the process of occurring exist in dependence on the combining of their conditions and it shows that they are not eternal etc thus denying the various doctrines of eternalism nocause fictitiouscause and powerwielder 
What purpose indeed would the combining of conditions serve if things were eternal or if they occurred without cause and so on
The second the word origination indicates the arising of the states since these occur when their conditions combine and it shows how to prevent annihilationism etc thus preventing the various doctrines of annihilation of a soul nihilism there is no use in giving etc and moralinefficacyof action there is no other world etc
for when states are seen to arise again and again each conditioned by its predecessor how can the doctrines of annihilationism nihilism and moralinefficacyofaction be maintained
The two together since any given states are produced without interrupting the causefruit continuity of any given combination of conditions the whole expression dependent origination represents the middle way which rejects the doctrines He who acts is he who reaps and One acts while another reaps  and which is the proper way described thus Not insisting on local language and not overriding normal usage  
Now in teaching this dependent origination the Blessed One has set forth the text in the way beginning With ignorance as condition there are formations  Its meaning should be commented on by one who keeps within the circle of the Vibhajjavādins who does not misrepresent the teachers who does not advertise his own standpoint who does not quarrel with the standpoint of others who does not distort suttas who is in agreement with the Vinaya who looks to the principal authorities  who illustrates the law  who takes up the meaning  repeatedly reverting to that same meaning describing it in various different ways  And it is inherently difficult to comment on the dependent origination
as the Ancients said
The truth a being rebirthlinking And the structure of conditions
Are four things very hard to see And likewise difficult to teach
Therefore considering that to comment on the dependent origination is impossible except for those who are expert in the texts
Whilst I would now begin the comment On the structure of conditions
I find no footing for support And seem to founder in a sea
However many modes of teaching Grace the Dispensation here
And still the former teachers way Is handed down unbrokenly
Therefore on both of these relying For my support I now begin
Its meaning to elucidate Listen therefore attentively
For this has been said by the former teachers
Whoever learns alertly this discourse
Will go from excellence to excellence
And when perfected he will then escape
Beyond the vision of the King of Death
So as regards the passages that begin With ignorance as condition there are formations  to start with
As different ways of teaching meaning Character singlefold and so on
As to defining of the factors The exposition should be known
Herein as different ways of teaching the Blessed Ones teaching of the dependent origination is fourfold namely from the beginning or from the middle up to the end and from the end or from the middle down to the beginning It is like four creepergatherers ways of seizing a creeper
 For just as one of four men gathering creepers sees only the root of the creeper first and after cutting it at the root he pulls it all out and takes it away and uses it so the Blessed One teaches the dependent origination from the beginning up to the end thus So bhikkhus with ignorance as condition there are formations  with birth as condition ageinganddeath 
 Just as another of the four men sees the middle of the creeper first and after cutting it in the middle he pulls out only the upper part and takes it away and uses it When he is delighted with welcomes remains committed to that feeling then delight arises in him
Delight in feelings is clinging
With his clinging as condition there is becoming with becoming as condition birth   so the Blessed One teaches it from the middle up to the end thus
 Just as another of the four men sees the tip of the creeper first and seizing the tip he follows it down to the root and takes all of it away and uses it With birth as condition ageinganddeath so it was said But is there ageingand death with birth as condition or not or how is it here
There is ageingand death with birth as condition
so we think venerable sir
With becoming as condition birth so it was said  With ignorance as condition there are formations so it was said But are there formations with ignorance as condition or not or how is it here There are formations with ignorance as condition so we think venerable sir   so the Blessed One teaches it from the end down to the beginning thus
 Just as one of the four men sees only the middle of the creeper first and after cutting it in the middle and tracing it down as far as the root he takes it away and uses it And these four nutriments bhikkhus what is their source What is their origin From what are they born By what are they produced
These four nutriments have craving as their source craving as their origin they are born from craving produced by craving
Craving what is its source  Feeling  Contact  The sixfold base  Mentalitymateriality  Consciousness  Formations what is their source  By what are they produced Formations have ignorance as their source  they are  produced by ignorance  so the Blessed One teaches it from the middle down to the beginning thus
Why does he teach it thus
Because the dependent origination is wholly beneficial and because he has himself acquired elegance in instructing
For the dependent origination is entirely beneficial starting from any one of the four starting points it leads only to the penetration of the proper way
And the Blessed One has acquired elegance in instructing it is because he has done so through possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence and the four discriminations and by achieving the fourfold profundity 
that he teaches the Dhamma by various methods
But it should be recognized in particular that when he sees that people susceptible of teaching are confused about the analysis of the causes of the process of becoming he employs his teaching of it forwards starting from the beginning in order to show that the process carries on according to its own peculiar laws and for the purpose of showing the order of arising
 And it should be recognized that when he surveys the world as fallen upon trouble in the way stated thus This world has fallen upon trouble it is born ages dies passes away and reappears  he employs his teaching of it backwards starting from the end in order to show the laws governing the various kinds of suffering beginning with ageing and death which he discovered himself in the early stage of his penetration
And it should be recognized that he employs his teaching of it backwards from the middle down to the beginning in order to show how the succession of cause and fruit extends back into the past existence and again forwards from the past in accordance with his definition of nutriment as the source of ignorance 
And it should be recognized that he employs his teaching of it forwards from the middle up to the end in order to show how the future existence follows on through rebirth from arousing in the present causes for rebirth in the future
Of these methods of presentation that cited here should be understood to be that stated in forward order starting from the beginning in order to show to people susceptible of teaching who are confused about the laws of the process of becoming that the process carries on according to its own peculiar laws and for the purpose of showing the order of arising
But why is ignorance stated as the beginning here How then is ignorance the causeless rootcause of the world like the Primordial Essence of those who assert the existence of a Primordial Essence
It is not causeless
For a cause of ignorance is stated thus With the arising of cankers there is the arising of ignorance 
But there is a figurative way in which it can be treated as the root cause What way is that
When it is made to serve as a starting point in an exposition of the round of becoming
For the Blessed One gives the exposition of the round with one of two things as the starting point either ignorance
according as it is said No first beginning of ignorance is made known bhikkhus before which there was no ignorance and after which there came to be ignorance And while it is said thus bhikkhus nevertheless it is made known that ignorance has its specific condition 
or craving for becoming
according as it is said No first beginning of craving for becoming is made known bhikkhus before which there was no craving for becoming and after which there came to be craving for becoming And while it is said thus bhikkhus nevertheless it is made known that craving for becoming has its specific condition 
But why does the Blessed One give the exposition of the round with those two things as starting points
Because they are the outstanding causes of kamma that leads to happy and unhappy destinies
Ignorance is an outstanding cause of kamma that leads to unhappy destinies
Why
Because just as when a cow to be slaughtered is in the grip of the torment of burning with fire and belabouring with cudgels and being crazed with torment she drinks the hot water although it gives no satisfaction and does her harm so the ordinary man who is in the grip of ignorance performs kamma of the various kinds beginning with killing living things that leads to unhappy destinies although it gives no satisfaction because of the burning of defilements and does him harm because it casts him into an unhappy destiny
But craving for becoming is an outstanding cause of kamma that leads to happy destinies
Why
Because just as that same cow through her craving for cold water starts drinking cold water which gives satisfaction and allays her torment so the ordinary man in the grip of craving for becoming performs kamma of the various kinds beginning with abstention from killing living things that leads to happy destinies and gives satisfaction because it is free from the burning of defilements and by bringing him to a happy destiny allays the torment of suffering experienced in the unhappy destinies
Now as regards these two states that are starting points in expositions of the process of becoming in some instances the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma based on a single one of these states
for instance Accordingly bhikkhus formations have ignorance as their cause consciousness has formations as its cause  etc
likewise Bhikkhus craving increases in one who dwells seeing enjoyment in things productive of clinging with craving as condition there is clinging  and so on
In some instances he does so based on both
for instance So bhikkhus for the fool who is hindered by ignorance and tethered by craving there arises this body
Now this body with its six internal bases and externally the six bases due to mentalitymateriality make a duality
Due to this duality there is contact as well as the six pairs of bases touched through which the fool feels pleasure and pain  and so on
Of these ways of presentation that cited here in the form With ignorance as condition there are formations should be understood as one based on a single state
This firstly is how the exposition should be known as to different ways of teaching 
As to meaning as to the meaning of the words ignorance and so on
Bodily misconduct etc for example ought not to be found  in the sense of being unfit to be carried out the meaning is that it should not be permitted
It finds what ought not to be found  thus it is ignorance 
Conversely good bodily conduct etc ought to be found 
It does not find what ought to be found  thus it is ignorance  Also it prevents knowing the meaning of collection in the aggregates the meaning of actuating in the bases the meaning of voidness in the elements the meaning of predominance in the faculties the meaning of reality in the truths thus it is ignorance 
Also it prevents knowing the meaning of suffering etc described in four ways as oppression etc  thus it is ignorance
Through all the kinds of generations destinies becoming stations of consciousness and abodes of beings in the endless round of rebirths it drives beings on  thus it is ignorance 
Amongst women men etc which are in the ultimate sense nonexistent it hurries on  and amongst the aggregates etc which are existent it does not hurry on  thus it is ignorance 
Furthermore it is ignorance because it conceals the physical bases and objects of eyeconsciousness etc and the dependent origination and dependentlyoriginated states
That due to which fruit comes is a condition 
Due to  not without that the meaning is not dispensing with it
Comes means both arises and occurs
Furthermore the meaning of condition is the meaning of help
It is ignorance and that is a condition thus it is ignorance as condition
whence the phrase with ignorance as condition
They form the formed  thus they are formations
Furthermore formations are twofold namely formations with ignorance as condition and formations given in the texts with the word formations 
Herein the three namely formations of merit of demerit and of the imperturbable and the three namely the bodily the verbal and the mental formations which make six are formations with ignorance as condition
And all these are simply mundane profitable and unprofitable volition
But these four namely the formation consisting of the formed  the formation consisting of the kammaformed  the formation consisting in the act of kammaforming  and the formation consisting in momentum  are the kinds of formations that have come in the texts with the word formations 
Herein all states with conditions given in such passages as Formations are impermanent  are formations consisting of the formed
 In the Commentaries material and immaterial states of the three planes generated by kamma are called formations consisting of the kammaformed These are also included in the passage Formations are impermanent
But there is no instance in the texts where they are found separately
 Profitable and unprofitable volition of the three planes is called the formation consisting in the act of kammaforming It is found in the texts in such passages as Bhikkhus this man in his ignorance forms the formation of merit 
 But it is bodily and mental energy that is called the formation consisting in momentum This is given in the texts in such passages as The wheel having gone as far as the impetus carried it stood as though it were fixed 
And not only these but many other kinds of formations are given in the texts with the word formation  in the way beginning When a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling friend Visākha first his verbal formation ceases then his bodily formation then his mental formation 
But there is no formation among them not included by formations consisting of the formed What is said next after this in the rest of the exposition beginning With formations as condition consciousness should be understood in the way already stated
But as to those words not yet dealt with It cognizes  thus it is consciousness 
It bends towards an object  thus it is mentality 
It is molested  thus it is materiality 
It provides a range for the origins and it leads on what is actuated  thus it is a base 
It touches  thus it is contact 
It is felt  thus it is feeling 
It frets  thus it is craving 
It clings  thus it is clinging 
It becomes and it makes become  thus it is becoming 
The act of being born is birth
The act of growing old is ageing
By means of it they die thus it is death
The act of sorrowing is sorrow
The act of lamenting is lamentation
It makes beings suffer  thus it is pain 
or it consumes in two ways by means of the two moments  arising and presence thus it is pain 
The state of a sad mind is grief 
Great misery is despair 
There is means is generated 
And the words There is should be construed with all the terms not only with those beginning with sorrow
for otherwise when With ignorance as condition formations was said it would not be evident what they did but by construing it with the words There is  since ignorance as condition stands for it is ignorance and that is a condition
consequently the defining of the condition and the conditionallyarisen state is effected by the words with ignorance as condition there are formations
And so in each instance
Thus signifies the process described
By that he shows that it is with ignorance etc as the causes and not with creation by an Overlord and so on
Of that of that aforesaid
Whole unmixed entire
Mass of suffering totality of suffering not a living being not pleasure beauty and so on
Arising generating
There is is brought about
This is how the exposition should be known here as to meaning 
As to character etc as to the characteristics of ignorance etc
that is to say ignorance has the characteristic of unknowing Its function is to confuse It is manifested as concealing Its proximate cause is cankers
Formations have the characteristic of forming Their function is to accumulate  They are manifested as volition Their proximate cause is ignorance
Consciousness has the characteristic of cognizing Its function is to go before  It manifests itself as rebirthlinking Its proximate cause is formations or its proximate cause is the physicalbasiscumobject
Mentality has the characteristic of bending  Its function is to associate It is manifested as inseparability of its components that is the three aggregates Its proximate cause is consciousness
Materiality has the characteristic of being molested  Its function is to be dispersed It is manifested as morally indeterminate Its proximate cause is consciousness
The sixfold base has the characteristic of actuating  Its function is to see and so on It is manifested as the state of physical basis and door Its proximate cause is mentalitymateriality
Contact has the characteristic of touching Its function is impingement It manifests itself as coincidence of internal and external base and consciousness Its proximate cause is the sixfold base
Feeling has the characteristic of experiencing Its function is to exploit the stimulus of the objective field It is manifested as pleasure and pain Its proximate cause is contact
Craving has the characteristic of being a cause that is of suffering Its function is to delight It is manifested as insatiability Its proximate cause is feeling
Clinging has the characteristic of seizing Its function is not to release It is manifested as a strong form of craving and as false view Its proximate cause is craving
Becoming has the characteristic of being kamma and kammaresult Its function is to make become and to become It is manifested as profitable unprofitable and indeterminate Its proximate cause is clinging
The characteristic of birth etc should be understood as stated in the Description of the Truths 
This is how the exposition should be known here as to character etc
As to singlefold and so on here ignorance is singlefold as unknowing unseeing delusion and so on
It is twofold as no theory and wrong theory 
likewise as prompted and unprompted
It is threefold as associated with the three kinds of feeling
It is fourfold as nonpenetration of the four truths
It is fivefold as concealing the danger in the five kinds of destinies
It should however be understood that all the immaterial factors of the dependent origination have a sixfold nature with respect to the six doors and objects
Formations are singlefold as states subject to cankers  states with the nature of result  and so on 
They are twofold as profitable and unprofitable
likewise as limited and exalted inferior and medium with certainty of wrongness and without certainty
They are threefold as the formation of merit and the rest
They are fourfold as leading to the four kinds of generation
They are fivefold as leading to the five kinds of destiny
Consciousness is singlefold as mundane  resultant  and so on
It is twofold as with rootcause and without rootcause and so on
It is threefold as included in the three kinds of becoming as associated with the three kinds of feeling and as having no rootcause having two rootcauses and having three rootcauses
It is fourfold and fivefold respectively according to generation and destiny
Mentalitymateriality is singlefold as dependent on consciousness and as having kamma as its condition
It is twofold as having an object in the case of mentality and having no object in the case of materiality
It is threefold as past and so on
It is fourfold and fivefold respectively according to generation and destiny
The sixfold base is singlefold as the place of origin and meeting
It is twofold as sensitivity of primary elements and as consciousness of the sixth base and so on
It is threefold as having for its domain objective fields that are contiguous noncontiguous and neither 
It is fourfold and fivefold respectively as included in the kinds of generation and destiny The singlefoldness etc of contact etc should be understood in this way too This is how the exposition should be known here as to singlefold and so on 
As to defining of the factors sorrow etc are stated here for the purpose of showing that the Wheel of Becoming never halts
for they are produced in the fool who is afflicted by ageing and death
according as it is said The untaught ordinary man bhikkhus on being touched by painful bodily feeling sorrows grieves and laments beating his breast he weeps and becomes distraught 
And as long as these go on occurring so long does ignorance and so the Wheel of Becoming renews its revolution With ignorance as condition there are formations and so on
That is why the factors of the dependent origination should be understood as twelve by taking those that is sorrow etc along with ageinganddeath as one summarization
This is how the exposition should be known here as to defining of the factors
This firstly is the brief treatment
The following method however is in detail According to the Suttanta method ignorance is unknowing about the four instances beginning with suffering According to the Abhidhamma method it is unknowing about the eight instances that is to say the abovementioned four together with the four beginning with the past
for this is said Herein what is ignorance It is unknowing about suffering unknowing about the origin of suffering unknowing about the cessation of suffering unknowing about the way leading to the cessation of suffering unknowing about the past unknowing about the future unknowing about the past and future unknowing about specific conditionality and conditionallyarisen states 
Herein while ignorance about any instance that is not the two supramundane truths can also arise as object  nevertheless here it is only intended subjectively as concealment
For when thus arisen it keeps the truth of suffering concealed preventing penetration of the true individual function and characteristic of that truth Likewise origin cessation and the path bygone five aggregates called the past coming five aggregates called the future both of these together called the past and future and both specific conditionality and conditionallyarisen states together called specific conditionality and conditionally arisen statesall of which it keeps concealed
preventing their true individual functions and characteristics being penetrated thus This is ignorance these are formations
That is why it is said It is unknowing about suffering  unknowing about specific conditionality and conditionallyarisen states 
Formations are the six mentioned in brief above thus the three namely formations of merit etc and the three namely the bodily formation etc  but in detail here the first three formations are twentynine volitions that is to say the formation of merit consisting of thirteen volitions counting the eight sensesphere profitable volitions that occur in giving in virtue etc and the five finematerial profitable volitions that occur in development of meditation
then the formation of demerit consisting of the twelve unprofitable volitions that occur in killing living things etc
then the formation of the imperturbable consisting in the four profitable volitions associated with the immaterial sphere which occur in development of those meditations
As regards the other three the bodily formation is bodily volition the verbal formation is verbal volition and the mental formation is mental volition
This triad is mentioned in order to show that at the moment of the accumulation of the kamma the formations of merit etc occur in these three kamma doors
For the eight sensesphere profitable and twelve unprofitable volitions making twenty are the bodily formation when they occur in the body door and produce bodily intimation
Those same volitions are called the verbal formation when they occur in the speech door and produce verbal intimation
But volition connected with directknowledge is not included here in these two cases because it is not a condition for resultant rebirthlinking consciousness later
And like direct knowledge volition so also volition connected with agitation is not included
therefore that too should not be included as a condition for rebirthlinking consciousness However all these have ignorance as their condition
And all the twentynine volitions are the mental formation when they arise in the mind door without originating either kind of intimation
So this triad comes within the first triad and accordingly as far as the meaning is concerned ignorance can be understood as condition simply for formations of merit and so on
Herein it might be asked How can it be known that these formations have ignorance as their condition
By the fact that they exist when ignorance exists
For when unknowingin other words ignoranceof suffering etc is unabandoned in a man owing firstly to his unknowing about suffering and about the past etc then he believes the suffering of the round of rebirths to be pleasant and he embarks upon the three kinds of formations which are the cause of that very suffering
Owing to his unknowing about sufferings origin he embarks upon formations that being subordinated to craving are actually the cause of suffering imagining them to be the cause of pleasure
And owing to his unknowing about cessation and the path he misperceives the cessation of suffering to be in some particular destiny such as the Brahmāworld that is not in fact cessation he misperceives the path to cessation believing it to consist in sacrifices mortification for immortality etc which are not in fact the path to cessation and so while aspiring to the cessation of suffering he embarks upon the three kinds of formations in the form of sacrifices mortification for immortality and so on
Furthermore his nonabandonment of that ignorance about the four truths in particular prevents him from recognizing as suffering the kind of suffering called the fruit of merit which is fraught with the many dangers beginning with birth ageing disease and death and so he embarks upon the formation of merit classed as bodily verbal and mental formations in order to attain that kind of suffering like one desiring celestial nymphs who jumps over a cliff
Also not seeing how that fruit of merit reckoned as pleasure eventually breeds great distress owing to the suffering in its change and that it gives little satisfaction he embarks upon the formation of merit of the kinds already stated which is the condition for that very suffering in change like a moth that falls into a lamps flame and like the man who wants the drop of honey and licks the honeysmeared knifeedge
Also not seeing the danger in the indulgence of sense desires etc with its results wrongly perceiving pleasure and overcome by defilements he embarks upon the formation of demerit that occurs in the three doors of kamma like a child who plays with filth and like a man who wants to die and eats poison
Also unaware of the suffering due to formations and the sufferinginchange inherent in kammaresults in the immaterial sphere owing to the perversion of wrongly perceiving them as eternal etc he embarks upon the formation of the imperturbable which is a mental formation like one who has lost his way and takes the road to a goblin city
So formations exist only when ignorance exists not when it does not
and that is how it can be known that these formations have ignorance as their condition
This is said too Not knowing bhikkhus in ignorance he forms the formation of merit forms the formation of demerit forms the formation of the imperturbable
As soon as a bhikkhus ignorance is abandoned and clear vision arisen bhikkhus with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of clear vision he does not form even formations of merit 
Here it might be said Let us then firstly agree that ignorance is a condition for formations But it must now be stated for which formations and in which way it is a condition 
Here is the reply Twentyfour conditions have been stated by the Blessed One as follows   Rootcause condition object condition predominance condition proximity condition contiguity condition conascence condition mutuality condition support condition decisivesupport condition prenascence condition postnascence condition repetition condition kamma condition kammaresult condition nutriment condition faculty condition jhāna condition path condition association condition dissociation condition presence condition absence condition disappearance condition nondisappearance condition 
Herein it is a rootcause and a condition thus it is rootcause condition It is by its being a rootcause that it is a condition what is meant is that it is a condition owing to its status as rootcause
The same method applies in the case of object condition and the rest
Herein cause is a term for a part of a syllogism for a reason and for a root
For with the words proposition  cause  etc in the world it is a member of a syllogism that is called a cause
But in the Dispensation in such passages as Those states that are produced from a cause  it is a reason 
and in such passages as Three profitable root causes three unprofitable rootcauses  it is a root that is called a cause The last is intended here
As to condition  the wordmeaning here is this It the fruit comes from that depending thereon  thus that is a condition 
the meaning is a state occurs by not dispensing with that
What is meant is when a state is indispensable to another states presence or arising the former is a condition for the latter
But as to characteristic a condition has the characteristic of assisting
for any given state that assists the presence or arising of a given state is called the latters condition
The words condition cause reason source originator producer etc are one in meaning though different in the letter
So since it is a cause in the sense of a root and a condition in the sense of assistance briefly a state that is assistantial in the sense of a root is a rootcause condition
The intention of some teachers is that it establishes the profitable etc state in what is profitable etc as paddy seeds etc do for paddy etc and as the colour of gems etc do for the lustre of gems and so on
But if that is so then it follows that the state of rootcause condition does not apply to the kinds of materiality originated by it for it does not establish any profitableness etc in them
Nevertheless it is a condition for them
for this is said Rootcauses are a condition as rootcause condition for the states associated with a rootcause and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby 
Again the indeterminateness of rootcauseless consciousness is established without it And the profitableness etc of those with rootcause is bound up with wise attention etc not with the associated rootcauses
And if the profitableness etc resided in the associated rootcauses as an individual essence then either the nongreed bound up with the rootcause in the associated states would be only profitable or it would be only indeterminate
but since it can be both profitableness etc in the rootcauses must still be sought for just as in the associated states such as wise attention and so on
But when the rootcauses sense of root is taken as establishing stableness rather than as establishing profitableness etc there is no contradiction
For states that have obtained a rootcause condition are firm like trees and stable but those without rootcause are like moss with roots no bigger than sesame seeds etc unstable
So an assistantial state may be understood as a rootcause condition since it establishes stableness through being of assistance in the sense of a root
As to the others that follow a state that assists by being an object is an object condition
Now there are no states that are not object conditions for the passage beginning The visibledata base is a condition as object condition for the eyeconsciousness element concludes thus When any states as states of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants arise contingent upon any states these latter states are conditions as object condition for those former states 
For just as a weak man both gets up and stands by hanging on to a stick or rope so states of consciousness and consciousness concomitants always arise and are present contingent upon visible data etc as their object 
Therefore all states that are objects of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants should be understood as object condition
A state that assists in the sense of being foremost is a predominance condition It is of two kinds as conascent and as object
Herein because of the passage beginning Predominance of zeal is a condition as predominance condition for states associated with zeal and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby  it is the four states called zeal purity of consciousness energy and inquiry that should be understood as predominance condition but not simultaneously
for when consciousness occurs with emphasis on zeal and putting zeal foremost then it is zeal and not the others that is predominant
So with the rest
But the state by giving importance to which immaterial states occur is their objectpredominance
Hence it is said When any states as states of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants arise by giving importance to any states these latter states are a condition as predominance condition for those former states 
 A state that assists by being proximate is a proximity condition
A state that assists by being contiguous is a contiguity condition
The explanation of this pair of conditions is very diffuse
but substantially it is this the regular order of consciousness begins thus mind element is proximate after eye consciousness mindconsciousness element is proximate after mind element and this is established only by each preceding consciousness not otherwise consequently a state that is capable of arousing an appropriate kind of consciousness proximate to itself is a proximity condition
Hence it is said Proximity condition eyeconsciousness and the states associated therewith are a condition as proximity condition for mind element and for the states associated therewith 
Proximity condition is the same as contiguity condition
The difference here is only in the letter just as in the case of the words growth and continuity  etc and as in the case of the terminology dyad language dyad and so on
there is none in the meaning
The opinion of certain teachers is that proximity condition refers to proximity of aim and contiguity condition refers to proximity of time But that is contradicted by such statements as The profitable consciousness belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception in one who emerges from cessation is a condition as contiguity condition for fruition attainment consciousness 
Now they say in this context that the ability of states to produce their fruit is not diminished but the influence of meditative development prevents states from arising in proximity But that only establishes that there is no proximity of time
and we also say the same namely that there is no proximity of time there owing to the influence of development
But since there is no proximity of time the state of contiguity condition is therefore impossible according to them
since their belief is that the contiguity condition depends on proximity of time 
Instead of adopting any such misinterpretation the difference should be treated as residing in the letter only not in the meaning
How
There is no interval between them thus they are proximate 
they are quite without interval because even the distinction of co presence is lacking thus they are contiguous  
A state that while arising assists another state by making it arise together with itself is a conascence condition as a lamp is for illumination
With the immaterial aggregates etc it is sixfold
according as it is said  The four immaterial aggregates are a condition as conascence condition for each other the four great primaries are  for each other at the moment of descent into the womb mentality and materiality are  for each other states of consciousness and its concomitants are  for the kinds of materiality originated by consciousness
 the great primaries are  for derived materiality material states are sometimes as at rebirthlinking a condition as conascence condition and sometimes as in the course of an existence not a condition as conascence condition for immaterial states 
This refers only to the heartbasis
A state that assists by means of mutual arousing and consolidating is a mutuality condition as the three sticks of a tripod give each other consolidating support
With the immaterial aggregates etc it is threefold
according as it is said The four immaterial aggregates are a condition as mutuality condition for each other
the four great primaries are a condition as mutuality condition for each other at the moment of descent into the womb mentality and materiality are a condition as mutuality condition for each other 
A state that assists in the mode of foundation and in the mode of support is a support condition as the earth is for trees as canvas is for paintings and so on
It should be understood in the way stated for conascence thus The four immaterial aggregates are a condition as support condition for each other 
but the sixth instance has been set forth in this way here The eye base is a condition as support condition for the eyeconsciousness element and for the states associated therewith the ear base  the nose base  the tongue base  the body base is a condition as support condition for the body consciousness element and for the states associated therewith
the materiality with which as their support the mind element and the mindconsciousness element occur is a condition as support condition for the mind element for the mind consciousness element and for the states associated therewith 
Decisivesupport condition firstly here is the wordmeaning it is treated as support not dispensed with by its own fruit because its own fruits existence is dependent on it thus it is the support
But just as great misery is despair so great support is decisive support This is a term for a cogent reason
Consequently a state that assists by being a cogent reason should be understood as a decisivesupport condition
It is threefold namely objectdecisivesupport proximatedecisive support and naturaldecisivesupport condition
 Herein firstly Having given a gift having undertaken the precepts of virtue having done the duties of the Uposatha a man gives that importance and reviews it he gives importance to former things well done and reviews them Having emerged from jhāna he gives jhāna importance and reviews it
Trainers give importance to changeof lineage and review it They give importance to cleansing and review it Trainers having emerged from a path give importance to the path and review it   objectdecisivesupport condition is set forth without differentiating it from objectpredominance in this way
Herein the object in giving importance to which consciousness and consciousness concomitants arise is necessarily a cogent one among these objects
So their difference may be understood in this way objectpredominance is in the sense of what is to be given importance to and objectdecisivesupport is in the sense of a cogent reason
 Also proximatedecisivesupport condition is set forth without differentiating it from the proximity condition in the way beginning Any preceding profitable aggregates are a condition as decisivesupport condition for any succeeding aggregates 
But in the exposition there is a distinction because in the exposition of the schedule they are given as proximity in the way beginning Eyeconsciousness element and the states associated therewith are a condition as proximity condition for mind element and for the states associated therewith and as decisive support in the way beginning Any preceding profitable states are a condition as decisivesupport condition for any succeeding profitable states 
though it comes to the same thing as regards the meaning
Nevertheless proximity may be understood as the ability to cause the occurrence of an appropriate conscious arising proximate to itself and decisive support as the preceding consciousnesss cogency in the arousing of the succeeding consciousnesses
For while in the cases of rootcause and other such conditions consciousness can arise actually without any of those conditions there is no arising of consciousness without a proximate consciousness to precede it
so this is a cogent condition
Their difference then may be understood in this way proximity condition arouses an appropriate consciousness proximate to itself while proximitydecisivesupport condition is a cogent reason
 As to naturaldecisivesupport the decisivesupport is natural thus it is a naturaldecisivesupport
Faith virtue etc produced in or climate food etc habitual to ones own continuity are called natural
Or else it is a decisive support by nature thus it is a naturaldecisivesupport The meaning is that it is unmixed with object and proximity
It should be understood as variously divided up in the way beginning Naturaldecisivesupport with faith as decisivesupport a man gives a gift undertakes the precepts of virtue does the duties of the Uposatha arouses jhāna arouses insight arouses the path arouses directknowledge arouses an attainment
With virtue  With learning  With generosity  With understanding as decisivesupport a man gives a gift  arouses an attainment
Faith virtue learning generosity understanding are conditions as decisivesupport condition for the repeated arising of faith virtue learning generosity understanding 
So these things beginning with faith are naturaldecisivesupport since they are both natural and decisivesupports in the sense of a cogent reason
A state that assists by being present having arisen previously is a prenascence condition
It is elevenfold as physical basis and object in the five doors and as the heartbasis
according as it is said The eye base is a condition as prenascence condition for the eyeconsciousness element and for the states associated therewith
The ear base  The nose base  The tongue base  The body base  The visibledata base  The sound base  The odour base  The flavour base  The tangibledata base is a condition as prenascence condition for the bodyconsciousness element and for the states associated therewith
The visibledata base  The sound base  The odour base  The flavour base  the tangible data base is a condition as prenascence condition for the mind element
The materiality with which as their support the mind element and mind consciousness element occur is a condition as prenascence condition
for the mindelement and for the states associated therewith and it is sometimes as in the course of an existence a condition as prenascence condition for the mind consciousness element and for the states associated therewith 
sometimes as at rebirthlinking not a condition as prenascence condition
An immaterial state that while present assists prenascent material states also present by consolidating them is a postnascence condition like the volition of appetite for food which assists the bodies of vultures young
Hence it is said Postnascent states of consciousness and its concomitants are a condition as postnascence condition for the prenascent copresent body 
A state that assists the efficiency and power of the proximate in the sense of repetition is a repetition condition like repeated application to books and so on
It is threefold as profitable unprofitable and functional impulsion
for it is said Preceding profitable states are a condition as repetition condition for succeeding profitable states  Preceding unprofitable 
Preceding functional indeterminate states are a condition as repetition condition for succeeding functional indeterminate states 
A state that assists by means of the action called intervening of consciousness is a kamma condition
It is twofold as profitable and unprofitable volition acting from a different time and as all conascent volition 
according as it is said Profitable and unprofitable kamma is a condition as kamma condition for resultant aggregates and for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed
Conascent volition is a condition as kamma condition for associated states and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby 
A resultant state that by effortless quiet assists effortless quiet in other states is a kammaresult condition
In the course of an existence it is a condition for states originated by it and at rebirthlinking for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed and in both cases for the associated states
according as it is said One resultant indeterminate aggregate is a condition as kammaresult condition for three aggregates and for the kinds of materiality originated by consciousness  At the moment of rebirthlinking one resultant indeterminate aggregate is a condition  for three aggregates 
Three aggregates are a condition  for one aggregate 
Two aggregates are a condition as kammaresult condition for two aggregates and for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed
Aggregates are a condition as kamma result condition for the physical basis 
The four kinds of nutriment which assist material and immaterial states by consolidating them are nutriment conditions
according as it is said Physical nutriment is a condition as nutriment condition for this body
Immaterial nutriments are conditions as nutriment condition for associated states and for the kinds of materiality originated by them 
But in the Question Section it is said At the moment of rebirthlinking resultant indeterminate nutriments are conditions as nutriment condition for aggregates associated therewith and for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed 
Leaving out the femininity and masculinity faculties the twenty remaining faculties  which assist in the sense of predominance are faculty conditions
Herein the five namely the eye faculty etc are conditions only for immaterial states the rest are conditions for material and immaterial states
according as it is said The eye faculty is a condition as faculty condition for eyeconsciousness element and for the states associated therewith The ear faculty  The nose faculty  The tongue faculty  The body faculty is a condition as faculty condition for the bodyconsciousness element and for the states associated therewith
The material life faculty is a condition as faculty condition for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed
The immaterial faculties are a condition as faculty condition for the states associated therewith and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby 
But in the Question Section it is said At the moment of rebirthlinking resultant indeterminate faculties are a condition as faculty condition for associated aggregates and for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed 
All the seven jhāna factors classed as profitable etcleaving out the pair pleasant and painful feeling in the case of the two sets of five consciousnesseswhich factors assist in the sense of constituting a state of jhāna are jhāna conditions
according as it is said The jhāna factors are a condition as jhāna condition for the states associated with jhāna and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby 
But in the Question Section it is said At the moment of rebirthlinking resultant indeterminate jhāna factors are a condition as jhāna condition for associated aggregates and for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed 
The twelve path factors classed as profitable etc which assist in the sense of an outlet from whatever it may be are path conditions
according as it is said The path factors are a condition as path condition for states associated therewith and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby 
But in the Question Section it is said At the moment of rebirthlinking resultant indeterminate path factors are a condition as path condition for aggregates associated therewith and for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed 
But these two namely jhāna and path conditions should be understood as inapplicable to the two sets of five consciousnesses and to the consciousnesses without rootcause 
Immaterial states that assist by the kind of association consisting in having the same physical basis same object same arising same cessation are association conditions
according as it is said The four immaterial aggregates are a condition as association condition for each other 
Material states that assist immaterial states and immaterial states that assist material states by not having sameness of physical basis etc are dissociation conditions
This is threefold as conascent postnascent and prenascent
for this is said Conascent profitable aggregates are a condition as dissociation condition for the kinds of materiality originated by consciousness
Postnascent profitable mental aggregates are a condition as dissociation condition for this prenascent body 
But in the analysis of the conascent in the indeterminate clause it is said At the moment of rebirthlinking resultant indeterminate aggregates are a condition as dissociation condition for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed
The aggregates are a condition
as dissociation condition for the physical basis and the physical basis for the aggregates 
But the prenascent should be understood as the eye faculty etc and the physical basis
according as it is said The prenascent eye base is a condition as dissociation condition for eyeconsciousness  The body base is a condition as dissociation condition for bodyconsciousness
The physical basis is a condition as dissociation condition for resultant indeterminate and functionalindeterminate aggregates  The physical basis is a condition as dissociation condition for profitable aggregates  The physical basis is a condition as dissociation condition for unprofitable aggregates 
A state that by means of existingness characterized by presence assists a like state by consolidating it is a presence condition
A sevenfold summary is laid down for it according to immaterial aggregates great primaries mentality materiality consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants great primaries bases and physical heart basis
according as it is said The four immaterial aggregates are a condition as presence condition for each other The four great primaries  are  for each other At the time of descent into the womb mentality and materiality are a condition as presence condition for each other
States of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants are  for the kinds of materiality originated by consciousness
The four great primaries are  for derived materiality
The eye base is  for the eyeconsciousness element and for the states associated therewith The ear base  nose base  tongue base  body base is  for the bodyconsciousness element  The visibledata base is  for the eyeconsciousness element  The sound base  odour base  flavour base  tangibledata base is a condition as presence condition for the body consciousness element and for the states associated therewith
The visibledata base  The sound base  odour base  flavour base  tangibledata base is a condition as presence condition for the mind element and for the states associated therewith
The materiality with which as their support the mind element and mindconsciousness element occur is a condition as presence condition for the mind element for the mindconsciousness element and for the states associated therewith 
But in the Question Section after setting forth conascence prenascence postnascence nutriment and faculty the description is given first under conascence in the way beginning One aggregate is a condition as presence condition for three aggregates and for materiality originated thereby  Under prenascence the description is given according to the prenascent eye and so on
Under postnascence the description is given according to postnascent consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants as conditions for this body
Under nutriments and faculties respectively the description is given thus Physical nutriment is a condition as presence condition for this body
and The material life faculty is a condition as presence condition for materiality due to kamma performed 
Immaterial states that by their ceasing in contiguity before assist by giving opportunity to immaterial states that arise proximately after them are absence conditions
according as it is said States of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants that have ceased in contiguity are a condition as absence condition for present states of consciousness and consciousness concomitants 
Those same states because they assist by their disappearance are a disappearance condition
according as it is said States of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants that have disappeared in contiguity are a condition as disappearance condition for present states of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants 
The same states that are presence condition because they assist by their nondisappearance should be understood as a nondisappearance condition
Or this dyad is stated as an embellishment of teaching to suit the needs of those who are teachable just as in the Mātikā of the Dhammasaṅgaṇī the dissociated fromcause dyad is given after the causeless dyad
Now as regards these twentyfour conditions ignorance
For those of merit Is a condition in two ways
And for the next in many ways But for the last kind only once
Herein for those of merit ignorance is a condition in two ways it is a condition in two ways namely as object condition and as decisivesupport condition
For ignorance is a condition as object condition for formations of merit of the sense sphere at the time of comprehending by means of insight ignorance as liable to destruction and fall
and it is likewise for those of the finematerial sphere at the time of knowing a confused mind by means of directknowledge consciousness through penetrating others minds and so on
But it is a condition as decisive support condition in two cases that is to say for the sensesphere formation in one who for the purpose of surmounting ignorance fulfils the various instances of sensesphere meritmaking consisting in giving etc and for the finematerial sphere formation in one who arouses the finematerial jhānas for the same purpose
Likewise in one who effects that merit while aspiring to the delight of sensesphere becoming and finematerial becoming because he is confused by ignorance
And for the next in many ways it is a condition for formations of demerit in many ways
How
As object condition at the time of the arising of greed etc contingent upon ignorance as objectpredominance and objectdecisivesupport respectively at the times of giving importance to ignorance and enjoying it as decisivesupport in one who being confused by ignorance and unaware of danger kills living things etc as proximity contiguity proximitydecisive support repetition absence and disappearance for the second impulsion and those that follow as rootcause conascence mutuality support association presence and nondisappearance in one doing anything unprofitable It is thus a condition in many ways
But for the last kind only once it is reckoned as a condition in one way namely as decisivesupport condition only for formations of the imperturbable
But its relation as decisivesupport condition should be understood as stated under formations of merit
Here it may be asked But how is this Is ignorance the only condition for formations or are there other conditions
What is the position here For firstly if it is the only one there follows the assertion of a single cause
but then if there are others the description of it as a single cause namely With ignorance as condition there are formations is incorrect
It is not incorrect
Why not
Here is the reason
Nor from a single cause arise One fruit or many nor one fruit from many
Tis helpful though to utilize One cause and fruit as representative
Here there is no single or multiple fruit of any kind from a single cause
nor a single fruit from multiple causes
but only multiple fruit from multiple causes
So from multiple causes in other words from temperature earth seed and moisture is seen to arise a multiple fruit in other words the shoot which has visible form odour taste and so on
But one representative cause and fruit given in this way With ignorance as condition there are formations with formations as condition consciousness have a meaning and a use
For the Blessed One employs one representative cause and fruit when it is suitable for the sake of elegance in instruction and to suit the idiosyncrasies of those susceptible of being taught And he does so in some instances because it is a basic factor and in some instances because it is the most obvious and in some instances because it is not common to all
In the passage With contact as condition feeling he mentions a single cause and fruit because they are basic factors
For contact is the basic cause of feeling since the kinds of feeling are defined according to the kinds of contact as eyecontactborn feeling and so on
and feeling is contacts basic fruit since contact is defined according to the kinds of feeling that it produces
He mentions a single cause in the passage Disease due to phlegm because that is the most obvious
For here what is obvious is the phlegm not the kamma etc mentioned later in the same sutta
He mentions a single cause in the passage Bhikkhus any states whatever that are unprofitable are all rooted in unwise attention because it is not common to all
For unwise attention to unprofitable things is not common to all states in the way that say physical basis and object are common to all
Consequently although other causes of formations such as physical basis and object conascent states etc are actually existent still ignorance may be understood as the representative cause of formations firstly because it is the basic factor as the cause of other causes of formations such as craving etc as it is said Craving increases in one who dwells seeing enjoyment  and With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of cankers  and again because it is the most obvious Not knowing bhikkhus in ignorance he forms the formation of merit  and lastly because it is not common to all
So the use of one representative cause and fruit should in each instance be understood according to this explanation of it 
Here it may be said We admit that But ignorance is reprehensible and has entirely undesirable fruit How then can it rightly be a condition for formations of merit and of the imperturbable
Sugarcane does not grow from bitter nimba seeds
Why should it not be right
For in the world that is even among thinkers outside the Dispensation it is recognized that
Both as opposed and unopposed A states conditions may be found
And both as like and unlike too That does not make it their result
It is established in the world that when states have a condition it may be opposed or unopposed to them as to presence individual essence function and so on
For a preceding consciousness is a condition opposed as to presence for the succeeding consciousness and the preceding training is a condition likewise for the plying of crafts etc which take place subsequently
Kamma is a condition opposed as to individual essence for materiality and so are milk etc for curds and so on
Light is a condition opposed as to function for eyeconsciousness and so are molasses etc for intoxicants and so on
But eyecumvisibledata etc are respectively a condition unopposed as to presence for eyeconsciousness and so on
And the first impulsion and those that follow are a condition unopposed as to individual essence and function for the impulsions that follow them
And just as conditions operate as opposed and unopposed so also they operate as like and unlike
Materialityfor example temperature and nutrimentis a condition for materiality the like for the like And so are paddy seeds etc for paddy crops and so on
The material is a condition for the immaterial and so is the immaterial for the material the unlike for the like And so are ox hair and rams hair horns curd and sesame flour etc respectively for dabba grass reeds bhūtanaka grass and so on 
And those states for which these are the opposed and unopposed like and unlike conditions are not the results of these states as well
So although this ignorance has entirely undesirable fruit for its result and is reprehensible in its individual essence yet it should be understood as a condition opposed or unopposed and like or unlike as the case may be as to presence function and individual essence for all these formations of merit etc
And its state as a condition has already been given in the way beginning For when unknowingin other words ignoranceof suffering etc is unaban doned in a man owing firstly to his unknowing about suffering and about the past etc then be believes the suffering of the round of rebirths to be pleasant and he embarks upon the three kinds of formations which are the cause of that very suffering 
Moreover there is this way of explanation as well
Now when a man is ignorant Of death and rebirth and the round
The characteristics of the formed Dependentlyarisen states
And in his ignorance he forms Formations of this triple kind
Then ignorance itself will be Condition for each of the three
But how does a man who is confused about these things perform these three kinds of formations
Firstly when he is confused about death instead of taking death thus Death in every case is breakup of aggregates he figures that it is a lasting being that dies that it is a lasting beings transmigration to another incarnation and so on
When he is confused about reappearance instead of taking rebirth thus Birth in every case is manifestation of aggregates he figures that it is a lasting beings manifestation in a new body
when he is confused about the round of rebirths
The endless chain of aggregates Of elements of bases too
That carries on unbrokenly Is what is called the round of births
instead of taking the round of rebirths as pictured thus he figures that it is a lasting being that goes from this world to another world that comes from another world to this world
When he is confused about the characteristics of formations instead of apprehending their specific and general characteristics he figures that formations are self belong to a self are lasting pleasant beautiful
When he is confused about dependentlyarisen states instead of taking the occurrence of formations to be due to ignorance etc he figures that it is a self that knows or does not know that acts and causes action
that appears in rebirth linking and he figures that atoms an Overlord etc shape its body in the various states of the embryo and endow it with faculties
and that when it has been endowed with faculties it touches feels craves clings and endeavours
and that it becomes anew in the next becoming or he figures thus All beings  are moulded by fate coincidence and nature 
Thus he figures blinded by ignorance He is like a blind man who wanders about the earth encountering now right and now wrong paths now heights and now hollows now even and now uneven ground and so he forms formations now of merit now of demerit now imperturbable
Hence this is said
As one born blind who gropes along Without assistance from a guide
Chooses a road that may be right At one time at another wrong
So while the foolish man pursues The round of births without a guide
Now to do merit he may choose And now demerit in such plight
But when the Dhamma he comes to know And penetrates the truths besides
Then ignorance is put to flight At last and he in peace may go
This is the detailed explanation of the clause With ignorance as condition there are formations
In the clause with formations as condition consciousness consciousness is sixfold as eyeconsciousness and so on
Herein eyeconsciousness is twofold namely profitable kammaresultant and unprofitable kammaresultant 
Likewise ear nose tongue and bodyconsciousness 
But mindconsciousness is twenty twofold namely the two profitable and unprofitable resultant mind elements  the three rootcauseless mindconsciousness elements  the eight sensesphere resultant consciousnesses with rootcause  the five of the finematerial sphere  and the four of the immaterial sphere 
So all the thirtytwo mundane resultant consciousnesses are included by these six kinds of consciousness
But the supramundane kinds do not belong to the exposition of the round of becoming and so they are not included
Here it may be asked But how is it to be known that this consciousness of the kind stated actually has formations as its condition
Because there is no kammaresult when there is no storedup kamma
For this consciousness is kammaresult and kammaresult does not arise in the absence of storedup kamma
If it did then all kinds of kammaresultant consciousnesses would arise in all kinds of beings and they do not do so This is how it should be known that such consciousness has formations as its condition
But which kind of consciousness has which kind of formations as its condition
Firstly the following sixteen kinds arise with the sensesphere formation of merit as condition the five profitable resultants beginning with eye consciousness  and in the case of mindconsciousness one kind of mind element and two kinds of mindconsciousness element  and the eight kinds of sensesphere resultant 
according as it is said
Owing to profitable kamma of the sense sphere having been performed stored up resultant eyeconsciousness  ear nose tongue body consciousness  resultant mind element arises 
mind consciousness element accompanied by joy arises 
mind consciousness element accompanied by equanimity arises 
accompanied by joy and associated with knowledge 
accompanied by joy associated with knowledge and prompted 
accompanied by joy and dissociated from knowledge 
accompanied by joy dissociated from knowledge and prompted 
accompanied by equanimity and associated with knowledge 
accompanied by equanimity associated with knowledge and prompted 
accompanied by equanimity and dissociated from knowledge 
accompanied by equanimity dissociated from knowledge and prompted 
There are five kinds of resultant finematerialsphere consciousness with the finematerialsphere formation of merit as condition
according as it is said
Owing to that same profitable kamma of the finematerial sphere having been performed stored up by the development of that same profitable jhāna secluded from sense desires  he enters upon and dwells in the resultant first jhāna  fifth jhāna 
There are seven kinds of consciousness with the formation of demerit as condition
the five unprofitable resultants beginning with eyeconsciousness  one mind element  and one mindconsciousness element 
according as it is said
Because of unprofitable kamma having been performed and stored up resultant eyeconsciousness has arisen  ear  nose  tongue  bodyconsciousness has arisen  resultant mind element  resultant mindconsciousness element has arisen 
There are four kinds of immaterial resultant consciousness with the formation of the imperturbable as condition
according as it is said
Owing to that same profitable kamma of the immaterial sphere having been performed stored up by the development of that same profitable immaterial jhāna with the abandoning of bodily pleasure and pain  he enters upon and dwells in the resultant fourth jhāna which with the complete surmounting of perceptions of material form  is accompanied by the base consisting of boundless space  accompanied by the base consisting of boundless consciousness  accompanied by the base consisting of nothingness  accompanied by the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception 
After knowing what kind of consciousness has what formations as its condition one should now understand how it occurs as follows Now this resultant consciousness all occurs in two ways namely in the course of an individual existence  and at the rebirthlinking moment
Herein there are the two fivefold consciousnesses  two mind elements  and rootcauseless mindconsciousness element accompanied by joy  that is thirteen which occur only in the course of an existence in the fiveconstituent kind of becoming
The remaining nineteen occur in the three kinds of becoming either in the course of an existence or at rebirthlinking as appropriate
How
Firstly in one who has been reborn by means of either profitableresult or unprofitable result according as his faculties mature so the five profitable resultant eye etc consciousnesses occur accomplishing the respective functions of seeing hearing smelling tasting and touching  contingent respectively upon a desirable or desirableneutral visible datum etc as object that has come into the focus of the eye etc and having the sensitivity of the eye etc as material support
And likewise the five unprofitableresultant consciousnesses
that the visible data etc as object for these are undesirable or undesirableneutral
 the only difference being this
And these ten are invariable as to their door object physical basis and position in the cognitive series and invariable as to their functions
After that next to the profitableresultant eye etc consciousness the profitableresultant mind element occurs accomplishing the function of receiving  contingent upon the same object as that of the former and having the heartbasis as support And next after the unprofitableresultant eye etc consciousness
the unprofitableresultant mind element occurs likewise
But these two while variable as to door and object are invariable as to physical basis and position and invariable as to function
Then next to the profitableresultant mind element the rootcauseless mindconsciousness element accompanied by joy occurs accomplishing the function of investigation  contingent upon the same object as that of the mind element and having the heartbasis as support And when the object is a vivid one in any of the six doors belonging to sensesphere beings usually at the end of impulsions associated with greed it holds up the renewal of the course of the lifecontinuum by occurring either once or twice as registration  having the same object as that apprehended by the impulsionsso it is said in the Majjhima Commentary
But in the Abhidhamma Commentary two turns of consciousness have been handed down with respect to registration
This consciousness has two names registration and aftermath lifecontinuum 
It is variable as to door and object it is invariable as to physical basis and it is variable as to position and function
This in the first place it should be understood is how thirteen kinds of consciousness occur only in the course of an individual existence in the five constituent kind of becoming
As to the remaining nineteen  there is none that does not occur as a rebirthlinking appropriate to it 
But in the course of an individual existence firstly two namely profitableresultant and unprofitableresultant rootcauseless mindconsciousness elements occur accomplishing four functions that is to say the function of investigating in the five doors next after profitableresultant and unprofitableresultant mind element the function of registration in the six doors in the way already stated the function of lifecontinuum that continues after rebirthlinking given by themselves as long as there is no thoughtarising to interrupt the life continuum and lastly the function of death at the end of the course of an existence And so these two are invariable as to possession of heart basis and variable as to door object position and function
The eight sensesphere consciousnesses with rootcause occur accomplishing three functions namely the function of registration in the six doors in the way already stated the function of lifecontinuum after rebirth linking given by themselves as long as there is no thoughtarising to interrupt the lifecontinuum and lastly the function of death at the end And they are invariable as to possession of heart basis and variable as to door position and function
The five finematerial consciousnesses and the four immaterial consciousnesses occur accomplishing two functions namely the function of lifecontinuum that continues after rebirthlinking given by themselves as long as there is no thoughtarising to interrupt the lifecontinuum and the function of death at the end
As regards these those of the fine material sphere are invariable as to possession of heartbasis and as to their object and they are variable as to position and function while the others occur invariably without heart basis and they are invariable as to object and variable as to position and function This in the first place is how the thirtytwofold resultant consciousness occurs in the course of an individual existence with formations as condition
And there in the course of an existence these several formations are conditions as kamma condition and decisivesupport condition for this thirtytwofold resultant consciousness
But what was said above namely as to the remaining nineteen there is none that does not occur as a rebirthlinking appropriate to it  is hard to understand since it is too brief
Hence in order to show the details it may be asked How many kinds of rebirthlinking are there How many kinds of rebirth linking consciousness Where and by what means does rebirthlinking come about What does rebirthlinking consciousness have as its object
 Including the rebirthlinking of nonpercipient beings there are twenty kinds of rebirthlinking
 There are nineteen kinds of rebirthlinking consciousnesses as already described
 Herein rebirthlinking by means of the unprofitableresultant root causeless mindconsciousness element comes about in the states of loss
Rebirthlinking by means of the profitableresultant comes about in the human world among those blind from birth born deaf born mad born drivelling  the sexless and so on
Rebirthlinking by means of the eight principal resultant consciousnesses with rootcause comes about among deities of the sense sphere and the meritorious among men
That by means of the five finematerial resultant kinds comes about in the finematerial Brahmāworld
That by means of the four immaterialsphere resultant kinds comes about in the immaterial world
So rebirthlinking consciousness conforms to the means by which and the place in which it comes about
 Briefly rebirthlinking consciousness has three kinds of objects namely past present and notsoclassifiable 
Nonpercipient rebirth linking consciousness has no object
Herein in the base consisting of boundless consciousness and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception the object of rebirthlinking is past
That of the ten kinds of sensesphere rebirthlinking is past or present
That of the rest is notsoclassifiable
But while the rebirthlinking consciousness occurs thus with three kinds of objects the death consciousness next to which it occurs has only a past or a notsoclassifiable object
there being no death consciousness with a present object
Consequently it should be understood how it occurs in the happy destinies and the unhappy destinies as follows that is to say how rebirthlinking consciousness with one of three kinds of objects occurs next to death consciousness with one of two kinds of objects
From happy to unhappy destiny For example firstly in the case of a person in the happy destinies of the sensesphere who is an evildoer when he is lying on his deathbed his evil kamma according as it has been stored up or its sign comes into focus in the mind door For it is said Then the evil deeds that he did in the past  cover him and overspread him and envelop him  and so on
Then next to the cognitive series of impulsions ending in registration that arose contingent upon that kamma or its sign death consciousness arises making the lifecontinuums objective field its object
When it has ceased rebirth linking consciousness arises contingent upon that same kamma or kamma sign that had come into focus and it does so located in the unhappy destiny being driven there by the force of defilements that have not been cut off
This is the kind of rebirthlinking that has a past object and comes next to death consciousness with a past object
In anothers case owing to kamma of the kind already described there comes into focus at the mind door at the time of death the sign of the unhappy destinies with the appearance of fire and flames etc in the hells and so on  So when the lifecontinuum has twice arisen and ceased three sorts of cognitive series consciousness arise contingent upon that object namely the one adverting impulsions numbering five because of the slowing down due to the nearness of death and two registrations
After that one death consciousness arises making the lifecontinuums objective field its object
At this point eleven consciousnesses have elapsed
Then having that same object which has a life span of the remaining five conscious moments his rebirthlinking consciousness arises
This is the kind of rebirthlinking that has a present object and comes next to death with a past object
In anothers case at the time of death there comes into focus in one of the five doors an inferior object that is a cause of greed and so on
When a series of consciousnesses up to determining have arisen in due succession there arise impulsions numbering five because of slowing down due to the nearness of death and two registrations
After that one death consciousness arises making the lifecontinuums objective field its object
At this point fifteen consciousnesses have elapsed namely two lifecontinuums one each adverting seeing receiving investigating and determining five impulsions two registrations and one death consciousness
Then having that same object which has a life span of the remaining one conscious moment his rebirthlinking consciousness arises
This also is the kind of rebirthlinking that has a present object and comes next to a death consciousness with a past object
This firstly is how rebirthlinking in an unhappy destiny with past and present objects occurs next to death consciousness in a happy destiny with a past object
From unhappy to happy destiny In the case of one in an unhappy destiny who has stored up blameless kamma all should be understood in the same way substituting the bright for the dark side thus His good kamma according as it has been stored up or its sign comes into focus in the mind door and continuing in the way already stated
This is how rebirthlinking occurs in a happy destiny with past and present objects next to death consciousness in an unhappy destiny with a past object
From happy to happy destiny In the case of one in a happy destiny who has stored up blameless kamma when he is lying on his deathbed his blameless kamma according as it has been stored up or its sign comes into focus in the mind door For it is said Then the good deeds he did in the past  cover him and overspread him and envelop him  and so on
And that applies only in the case of one who has stored up blameless sensesphere kamma
But in the case of one who has stored up kamma of the exalted spheres only the sign of the kamma comes into focus
Then next to the cognitive series of impulsions ending in registration or of simple impulsions that arose contingent upon that kamma or its sign death consciousness arises making the life continuums objective field its object
When it has ceased rebirthlinking consciousness arises contingent upon that same kamma or sign of kamma that had come into focus and it does so located in the happy destiny being driven there by the force of defilements that have not been cut off
This is the kind of rebirthlinking that has a past or a notsoclassifiable object and comes next to death consciousness with a past object
In anothers case owing to blameless sensesphere kamma there comes into focus in the mind door at the time of death the sign of a happy destiny in other words the appearance of the mothers womb in the case of the human world or the appearance of pleasure groves divine palaces wishing trees etc in the case of the divine world His rebirthlinking consciousness arises next to the death consciousness in the order shown for the sign of an unhappy destiny
This is the kind of rebirthlinking that has a present object and comes next to death consciousness with a past object
In anothers case relatives present objects to him at the five sense doors such as a visible datum as object perhaps flowers garlands flags banners etc saying This is being offered to the Blessed One for your sake dear set your mind at rest or a sound as object perhaps preaching of the Dhamma offerings of music etc or an odour as object perhaps incense scents perfumes etc or a taste as object perhaps honey molasses etc saying Taste this dear it is a gift to be given for your sake or a tangible datum as object perhaps Chinese silk silk of Somāra saying Touch this dear it is a gift to be given for your sake  Now when that visible datum or whatever it may be as object has come into focus for him and the consciousnesses ending in determining have arisen in due succession there arise in him impulsions numbering five because of slowing down due to the nearness of death and two registrations
after that one death consciousness making the lifecontinuums objective field its object At the end of that having that same object which lasts only a single conscious moment rebirthlinking consciousness arises
This also is the kind of rebirthlinking with a present object and comes next to a death consciousness with a past object
But in the case of another who is in a happy destiny and has obtained exalted consciousness through earthkasiṇa jhāna etc at the time of his death there comes into focus at the mind door the sensesphere profitable kamma or the sign of the kamma or the sign of the destiny or else the sign of the earth kasiṇa etc or else the exalted consciousness or else there comes into focus a superior object of the eye or ear that is a cause for profitable rebirth When the consciousnesses ending in determining have arisen in due succession there arise in him impulsions numbering five because of slowing down due to the nearness of death
But in those who belong to an exalted destiny there is no registration So the one death consciousness arises next to the impulsion and making the lifecontinuums objective field its object
At the end of that rebirth linking consciousness arises located in one of the happy destinies of the sense sphere or exalted sphere and having as its object whichever one among the aforesaid objects has appeared
This is the kind of rebirthlinking with a past present or notsoclassifiable object next to death consciousness in a happy destiny with a notsoclassifiable object
Rebirthlinking next to immaterialsphere death should be understood in this way too
This is how rebirthlinking occurs with a past present or notso classifiable object next to death consciousness in a happy destiny with a past or notsoclassifiable object
From unhappy to unhappy destiny In the case of one in an unhappy destiny who is an evildoer that kamma or its sign or the sign of the destiny comes into focus in the mind door
or in the five doors as the object that is the cause for the unprofitable rebirth Then his rebirthlinking consciousness arises in due succession at the end of the death consciousness and located in the unhappy destiny and with one of those objects as its object
This is how rebirthlinking occurs with a past or present object next to death in an unhappy destiny with a past object
Up to this point there has been shown the occurrence of the nineteenfold consciousness as rebirthlinking
Also all this is further classified for
While it occurs in linking thus It has a double class beside
Through kamma and as mixed and not And is still further classified
When this nineteenfold kammaresultant consciousness occurs thus in rebirthlinking it does so by means of kamma in two ways
for according to the way in which the kamma that generates it occurs the kamma can be its condition both as kamma condition acting from a different time and as decisivesupport condition
since this is said Profitable  and unprofitable kamma is a condition as decisivesupport condition for its result 
It should be understood that when it occurs thus its double class etc is mixed and not and it is still further classified
For example though this type of consciousness occurs in one way only as rebirthlinking still it is twofold as divided into mixed and unmixed with materiality
it is threefold as divided according to sensedesire finematerial and immaterial becoming 
it is fourfold as eggborn wombborn putrescence born and of apparitional generation 
it is fivefold according to destiny 
it is sevenfold according to the stations of consciousness 
and it is eightfold according to the abodes of beings excluding nonpercipient beings 
Herein
The mixed is double sexed and not And that with sex is double too
The least decads the first has got Respectively are three and two
The mixed is double sexed and not that rebirthlinking consciousness which leaving aside the immaterial becoming arises here mixed with materiality is twofold as with sex and without sex
because it arises in the finematerial sphere without the sex called femininity faculty and masculinity faculty and becauseleaving aside the rebirthlinking of one born as a eunuchit arises in the sensesphere becoming together with that twofold sex
And that with sex is double too there also that with sex is twofold because it arises in association with either the female or the male sex
The least decads the first has got respectively are three or two together with the rebirthlinking consciousness that is mixed with materiality and comes first in the pair mixed and unmixed there arise at the least the two decads of physical basis and body or else the three decads of physical basis body and sex There is no reducing the materiality below that
But when that minimal amount arises in the two kinds of generation termed eggborn and wombborn it amounts to no more than a drop of cream of ghee on a single fibre of newborn kids wool and it is known as the embryo in the first stage 
Herein how the different kinds of generation come about may be understood according to the kind of destiny
For as regards these
No first three generations are In hell or with the deities
Save those of earth all four are found In the three other destinies
Herein by the words with deities it should be understood that as in hell and among deitiesexcepting earth deitiesso also among the ghosts consumed with thirst the first three kinds of generation are not found
for they are apparitional only
But in the remaining three kinds of destiny in other words among animals ghosts and human beings and among the earth deities excepted above there are all four kinds of generation
Now
The fine material gods have thirtynine The apparitional and moistureborn
Have seventy material instances At most and they have thirty at the least
Firstly among the finematerial Brahmās of apparitional generation there arise together with rebirthlinking consciousness thirty and also nine material instances with the four groups namely the decads of the eye ear and physical basis and the ennead of life
But leaving the finematerial Brahmās aside among the others of apparitional generation and those of the moistureborn generation there are seventy instances of materiality at the most with the decads of the eye ear nose tongue body physical basis and sex And these are invariably to be found among deities of the sense sphere
Now the group of material states comprising the ten material instances namely colour odour flavour nutritive essence and the four primary elements with eye sensitivity and life are called the eye decad
The remaining groups of material states should be understood in the same way
At the least thirty material instances arise with the decads of the tongue body and physical basis in those who are blind from birth deaf noseless and sexless
Between the most and the least the allotment should be understood according as appropriate
After knowing this again
One ought to consider the pair death and birth Under aggregates object cause destiny feeling Happiness and then thinking applied and sustained Distinguishing them by unlikeness and likeness
The meaning is this there is rebirthlinking that is twofold as mixed and unmixed with materiality and there is the death consciousness next before it and their unlikeness and likeness according to these aggregates etc must be known
How
Sometimes next to a fouraggregate immaterial death there is a four aggregate rebirthlinking having a like object
sometimes there is an exalted rebirthlinking with an internal object next to an unexalted death with an external object
This firstly is the method in the case of the immaterial planes
Sometimes there is a fiveaggregate sensesphere rebirthlinking next to a four aggregate immaterial death
Sometimes there is a fouraggregate immaterial rebirth linking next to a fiveaggregate sensesphere death or finematerialsphere death
Thus there is rebirthlinking with a present object next to a death with a past object
there is rebirthlinking in a certain unhappy destiny next to death in a certain happy destiny
there is rebirthlinking with rootcause next to root causeless death
there is triplerootcause rebirthlinking next to doubleroot cause death
there is rebirthlinking accompanied by joy next to death accompanied by equanimity
there is rebirthlinking with happiness next to death without happiness
there is rebirthlinking with applied thought next to death without applied thought
there is rebirthlinking with sustained thought next to death without sustained thought
there is rebirthlinking with applied and sustained thought next to death without applied and sustained thought In this way they can be coupled together by opposites as appropriate
A mere state that has got its conditions Ushers in the ensuing existence
While it does not migrate from the past With no cause in the past it is not
So it is a mere material and immaterial state arising when it has obtained its conditions that is spoken of saying that it comes into the next becoming it is not a lasting being not a soul
And it has neither transmigrated from the past becoming
nor yet is it manifested here without cause from that
We shall explain this by the normal process of human death and rebirth linking
When in the past becoming a man near to a natural or violent death is unable to bear the onset of the unbearable daggers of the painful feelings that end in death as they sever the ligatures of the joints in all the limbs his body gradually withers like a green palm leaf lying in the glare of the sun and when the faculties of the eye etc have ceased and the body faculty mind faculty and life faculty remain on in the heartbasis alone then consciousness which has as its support the heartbasis still remaining at that moment either occurs contingent upon some kamma classed as weighty repeated performed near to death or previously in other words the formation that has obtained the remaining conditions or contingent upon the objective field made to appear by that kamma in other words the sign of the kamma or sign of the destiny
And while it is occurring thus because craving and ignorance have not been abandoned craving pushes it and the conascent formations fling it forward on to that objective field the dangers in which are concealed by ignorance
And while as a continuous process it is being pushed by craving and flung forward by formations it abandons its former support like a man who crosses a river by hanging on to a rope tied to a tree on the near bank and whether or not it gets a further support originated by kamma it occurs by means of the conditions consisting only in object condition and so on
The former of these two states of consciousness is called death because of falling 
and the latter is called rebirthlinking because of linking across the gap separating the beginning of the next becoming
But it should be understood that it has neither come here from the previous becoming nor has it become manifest without the kamma the formations the pushing the objective field etc as cause
An echo or its like supplies The figures here connectedness
By continuity denies Identity and otherness
And here let the illustration of this consciousness be such things as an echo a light a seal impression a lookingglass image for the fact of its not coming here from the previous becoming and for the fact that it arises owing to causes that are included in past becomings
For just as an echo a light a seal impression and a shadow have respectively sound etc as their cause and come into being without going elsewhere so also this consciousness
And with a stream of continuity there is neither identity nor otherness
For if there were absolute identity in a stream of continuity there would be no forming of curd from milk
And yet if there were absolute otherness the curd would not be derived from the milk
And so too with all causally arisen things
And if that were so there would be an end to all worldly usage which is hardly desirable
So neither absolute identity nor absolute otherness should be assumed here
Here it might be asked If no transmigration is manifested then after the cessation of the aggregates in this human person that fruit could be another persons or due to other kamma since the kamma that is the condition for the fruit does not pass on there to where the fruit is And whose is the fruit since there is no experiencer Therefore this formulation seems to be unsatisfactory 
Here is the reply
In continuity the fruit Is neither of nor from another
Seeds forming processes will suit To show the purport of this matter
When a fruit arises in a single continuity it is neither anothers nor from other kamma because absolute identity and absolute otherness are excluded there
The formative processes of seeds establish the meaning of this
For once the formative processes of a mango seed etc have been set afoot when the particular fruit arises in the continuity of the seeds growth later on owing to the obtaining of conditions it does so neither as the fruit of other seeds nor from other formative processes as condition and those seeds or formative processes do not themselves pass on to the place where the fruit is This is the analogy here
And the meaning can also be understood from the fact that the arts crafts medicine etc learnt in youth give their fruit later on in maturity
Now it was also asked Whose is the fruit since there is no experiencer  Herein
Experiencer is a convention For mere arising of the fruit
They say It fruits as a convention When on a tree appears its fruit
Just as it is simply owing to the arising of tree fruits which are one part of the phenomena called a tree that it is said The tree fruits or The tree has fruited so it is simply owing to the arising of the fruit consisting of the pleasure and pain called experience which is one part of the aggregates called deities and human beings that it is said A deity or a human being experiences or feels pleasure or pain
There is therefore no need at all here for a superfluous experiencer
But it may be said That may be so but then these formations must be the conditions for the fruit either when they are present or when they are not present and if it is when they are present their result must come about only at the moment of their occurrence but if it is when they are not present they must bear fruit constantly both before and after their occurrence  It can be replied
They are conditions when performed They bear fruit once but not again
The agent and such similes Will serve to make the meaning plain
Formations are conditions for their own fruit because they have been performed not because of presence or nonpresence
according as it is said Due to profitable kamma of the sense sphere having been performed stored up in the past resultant eyeconsciousness arises in the present  and so on
Having become conditions for their own fruit according to their capacity they do not again bear fruit since the result has already ripened
And in explaining the meaning of this the analogy of the agent etc should be understood
For just as in the world when someone becomes an agent with the aim of completing some business or other and he buys goods say or obtains a loan it is simply the fact of his performing the transaction that is the condition for completing that business not the transactions actual presence or non presence and after the completion of the business he has no further liability
Why not
Because the business has been completed
So it is because they have been performed that formations are conditions for their own fruit and they do not bear fruit after they have already given fruit according to their capacity
Up to this point the occurrence with formations as condition of rebirth linking consciousness that occurs in the two ways as mixed and unmixed with materiality has been illustrated
Now in order to eliminate confusion about all these thirtytwo kinds of resultant consciousness
One should of these formations see For which and how they are conditions
In birth and life in all the three Kinds of becoming and the rest
Herein the three kinds of becoming the four kinds of generation the five kinds of destiny the seven stations of consciousness and the nine abodes of beings are what are called The kinds of becoming and the rest
The meaning is that it should be recognized for what kinds of resultant consciousness these formations are conditions in rebirthlinking and in the course of an individual existence and in what way they are conditions in the various kinds of becoming and so on
Herein firstly as regard the formation of merit the formation of merit comprising the eight volitions of the sense sphere is a condition in two ways as kamma condition acting from a different time and as decisivesupport condition equally for all the nine kinds of resultant consciousness in rebirthlinking in a happy destiny in the sensesphere becoming
That formation comprising the five profitable volitions of the finematerial sphere is a condition in like manner for the five kinds of rebirthlinking in the finematerial becoming 
That of the sense sphere divided up as aforesaid is a condition in two ways as aforesaid for seven kinds of limited sphere resultant consciousness excluding the rootcauseless mindconsciousness element accompanied by equanimity in the course of an existence but not in rebirth linking in the happy destinies in the sensesphere becoming
And that same formation is a condition likewise for five kinds of resultant consciousness in the course of an existence not in rebirthlinking in the fine material becoming
It is a condition likewise for eight kinds of limited sphere resultant consciousness in the course of existence not in rebirth linking in the unhappy destinies in the sensesphere becoming
For then it is a condition for such profitableresultant consciousness occurring in hell encountering a desirable object on such occasions as the Elder Mahā Moggallānas visits to hell and so on But among animals and powerful ghosts too a desirable object is obtained through the same condition
This eightfold formation of merit is also a condition likewise for sixteen kinds of profitableresultant consciousness in the course of an existence and in rebirthlinking in the happy destinies in the sense sphere becoming
It is also a condition equally for all ten kinds of resultant consciousness in the course of an existence and in rebirth linking in the finematerial becoming
The formation of demerit comprising the twelve unprofitable volitions  is a condition likewise in the unhappy destinies in the sensesphere becoming for one kind of consciousness in rebirthlinking  not in the course of an existence
also for six kinds in the course of an existence  not in rebirthlinking
and for all the seven kinds partly in the course of an existence and partly in rebirthlinking
And in the happy destinies in the sensesphere becoming it is a condition likewise for those same seven kinds in the course of an existence not in rebirthlinking
In the finematerial becoming it is a condition likewise for four kinds of resultant consciousness in the course of an existence not in rebirthlinking
Then it is a condition for Brahmās seeing undesirable visible data and hearing undesirable sounds that are in the sense sphere there are no undesirable visible data etc in the Brahmāworld itself
and likewise in the divine world of the sense sphere
The formation of the imperturbable is a condition likewise for four kinds of resultant consciousness in the course of an existence and in rebirth linking in the immaterial becoming
This firstly is how it should be understood what kinds of resultant consciousness these formations are conditions for in rebirthlinking and in the three kinds of becoming and in what way they are conditions
And it should also be understood in the same way of the kinds of generation and so on
Here is a statement of the bare headings starting from the beginning Of these three kinds of formations firstly the formation of merit when giving rebirthlinking produces the whole of its result in two of the kinds of becoming
likewise in the four kinds of generation beginning with the eggborn in two of the kinds of destiny in other words the divine and the human in four of the stations of consciousness the human and the planes of the first second and third jhānas described thus Different in body and different in perception  different in body and same in perception  same in body and different in perception  same in body and same in perception  
and in only four of the abodes of beings because in the abode of nonpercipient beings it only forms materiality
Therefore it is a condition in the way already stated for twentyone kinds of resultant consciousness in these two kinds of becoming four kinds of generation two kinds of destiny four stations of consciousness and four abodes of beings according as they are produced in rebirthlinking and the course of an existence  as appropriate
The formation of demerit as rebirthlinking ripens in the sense sphere becoming only in the four kinds of generation in the remaining three destinies in the one station of consciousness described thus different in body and same in perception  and in the one corresponding abode of beings Therefore it is a condition in the way already stated for seven kinds of resultant consciousness in one kind of becoming in four kinds of generation in three kinds of destiny in one station of consciousness and in one abode of beings both in rebirthlinking and in the course of an existence 
The formation of the imperturbable as rebirthlinking ripens in the immaterial becoming in the apparitional kind of generation only in the divine destiny only in the three stations of consciousness beginning with the base consisting of boundless space and in the four abodes of beings beginning with the base consisting of boundless space  Therefore it is a condition in the way already stated for the four kinds of consciousness in one kind of becoming in one kind of generation in one kind of destiny in three stations of consciousness and in four abodes of beings both in rebirthlinking and in the course of becoming 
This is how
One should of these formations see For which and how they are conditions
In birth and life and the three Kinds of becoming and the rest
This is the detailed explanation of the clause With formations as condition consciousness 
For the clause With consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality
By analysis of mind and matter Occurrence in becoming etc
Inclusion and manner of condition The exposition should be known
By analysis of mind and matter here mind is the three aggregates that is feeling perception and formations because of their bending on to the object Matter is the four great primary elements and the materiality derived by clinging from the four great primaries
Their analysis is given in the Description of the Aggregates 
This in the first place is how the exposition of mentalitymateriality should be known by analysis 
By occurrence in becoming et cetera excepting one abode of beings that is the nonpercipient mentality occurs in all the kinds of becoming generation destiny and station of consciousness and in the remaining abodes of beings Materiality occurs in two kinds of becoming four kinds of generation five destinies the first four stations of consciousness and the first five abodes of beings
Now when this mentalitymateriality occurs thus then in the case of sexless embryos and the eggborn at the moment of their rebirthlinking there are manifested as materiality two organic continuities that is the two decads of physical basis and body and also the three immaterial aggregates So in their case there are in detail these twentythree states namely twenty states as concrete matter and three immaterial aggregates which should be understood as mentalitymateriality with consciousness as condition
But omitting repetitions and so cancelling nine material instances from one of the organic continuities fourteen states remain
By adding the sex decad for those possessed of sex before making the above cancellation there are thirtythree And omitting repetitions and so cancelling eighteen material instances nine each from two of the organic continuities in this case fifteen states remain
At the moment of rebirthlinking of those of Brahmās Retinue among apparitionally born beings four organic continuities are manifested as materiality that is the decads of eye ear and physical basis and the ennead of the life faculty and three immaterial aggregates So in their case in detail these fortytwo states namely thirtynine states as concrete materiality and three immaterial aggregates should be understood as mentalitymateriality with consciousness as condition
But omitting repetitions and so cancelling twenty seven instances of materiality nine each from three of the organic continuities fifteen states remain
In the sensesphere becoming seven organic continuities are manifested as materiality and also three immaterial aggregates at the moment of rebirth linking of the remaining kinds of apparitionally born or of the moistureborn possessing sex and matured sense bases So in their case in detail these seventy three states namely seventy instances of concrete materiality and three immaterial aggregates should be understood as mentalitymateriality with formations as condition
But omitting repetitions and so cancelling fiftyfour material instances nine each from six of the organic continuities nineteen states remain
This is the maximum
But at minimum the computation of mentality materiality with consciousness as condition in the rebirthlinking of those who lack such and such an organic continuity can be understood in brief and detail by reducing it appropriately The blind for instance lack the eye decad
For mentalitymateriality immaterial beings have only the three mental aggregates
while nonpercipient beings have only the lifefaculty ennead and that represents materiality
In the course of an existence in all places where materiality occurs there is manifested the temperatureoriginated bare material octad which is due initially to the temperature that occurred together with the rebirthlinking consciousness at the moment of its presence
Rebirthlinking consciousness does not originate materiality
For just as a man who is falling into a chasm cannot support another so it too is unable to originate materiality because of its weakness which is due to the weakness of the physical basis
But from the first lifecontinuum after the rebirthlinking consciousness onwards the bare octad originated by consciousness appears And at the time when sound becomes manifest there is the sound ennead due both to temperature occurring after the moment of rebirthlinking and to consciousness  The bare octad originated by nutriment appears in beings in the womb who live on matter consisting of physical nutriment as soon as their body is suffused by nutriment swallowed by the mother for it is said
And so it is that when his mother Eats consuming food and drink
One hidden in his mothers womb Thereby obtains his nourishment 
And it appears in apparitionally born beings as soon as they first swallow the spittle that has come into their own mouths So with the twentysix material instances consisting of the bare octad originated by nutriment and of the at most two sound enneads originated respectively by temperature and consciousness and also with the already mentioned seventy kammaoriginated instances that arise three times in each conscious moment at the instants of arising presence and dissolution there are thus ninetysix material instances and with the three immaterial aggregates there is thus a total of ninetynine states
Or because sound is not regularly present since it is only sometimes manifested subtracting it therefore as twofold being temperatureoriginated and consciousnessoriginated there are these ninetyseven states to be understood as mentalitymateriality with consciousness as condition in all beings according as it happens to be produced
For whether these beings are sleeping or idling or eating or drinking these states keep on occurring in them day and night with consciousness as condition
And we shall explain later how they have consciousness as their condition 
Now although this kammaborn materiality is the first to find a footing in the several kinds of becoming generation destiny station of consciousness and abode of beings it is nevertheless unable to carry on without being consolidated by materiality of triple origination by consciousness temperature and nutriment nor can that of triple origination do so without being consolidated by the former
But when they thus give consolidating support to each other they can stand up without falling like sheaves of reeds propped together on all four sides even though battered by the wind and like boats with broken floats that have found a support even though battered by waves somewhere in midocean and they can last one year two years  a hundred years until those beings life span or their merit is exhausted
This is how the exposition should be understood here by occurrence in becoming etc
By inclusion now there is the simple mentality with consciousness as condition in both the course of an existence and rebirthlinking in the immaterial sphere and in the course of an existence in the fiveconstituent becoming and the simple materiality with consciousness as condition in both cases among the nonpercipient and in the course of an existence in the fiveconstituent becoming and the combined mentalitymateriality with consciousness as condition in both cases in the fiveconstituent becoming All that mentality and materiality and mentalitymateriality should be understood as mentalitymateriality with consciousness as condition including them under mentalitymateriality according to the method that allows any one part to represent any remaining one of its kind 
Is this correct in view of the absence of consciousness in nonpercipient beings It is not incorrect
For
This consciousness as cause of mind And matter is twice reckoned
Result and also notresult Wherefore this is correctly said
The consciousness that is the cause of mentalitymateriality is reckoned to be twofold classed as resultant and not resultant
And since in the case of nonpercipient beings materiality is originated by kamma it has as its condition kammaformation consciousness that occurred in the fiveconstituent becoming
This applies also to the kammaoriginated materiality arising in the course of an existence in the fiveconstituent becoming at the moment of profitable or any other consciousness So this is correct
This is how the exposition can also be known here by inclusion 
By manner of condition here
Resultantconsciousness conditions Mentality first in nine ways
Then basis matter in nine ways And other matter in eight ways
Formationconsciousness conditions This matter in a single way
The rest of consciousness conditions This matter as the case may be
Rebirthlinking or some other kind of resultant consciousness is a condition in nine ways as conascence mutuality support association kamma result nutriment faculty presence and nondisappearance conditions either at rebirthlinking or in the course of an existence for that mentality called resultant whether mixed with materiality or not
At rebirthlinking it is a condition in nine ways as conascence mutuality support kammaresult nutriment faculty dissociation presence and nondisappearance conditions for the materiality of the physical heart basis
It is a condition in eight ways namely as the above conditions omitting the mutuality condition for materiality other than the materiality of the physical basis
Kammaformation consciousness is a condition in one way only as decisive support condition for the materiality of nonpercipient beings or for the kamma born materiality in the fiveconstituent becoming according to the Suttanta method
All the remaining kinds of consciousness from the time of the first life continuum consciousness following rebirthlinking onwards should be understood as a condition for some kind of mentalitymateriality as appropriate
But since the whole contents of the Paṭṭhāna must be cited in order to show how it acts in detail we do not undertake that
Here it may be asked But how is it to be known that the mentality materiality of rebirthlinking has consciousness as its condition
From the suttas and from logic
For in the suttas it is established in many places that feeling etc have consciousness as condition in the way beginning States with parallel occurrence through consciousness 
But as to logic
From matter seen here to be born Of consciousness a man can tell
That consciousness is a condition For matter when unseen as well
Whether consciousness likes it or not certain material instances are seen to arise in conformity with it
And the unseen is inferred from the seen So it can be known by means of the consciousnessborn materiality that is seen that consciousness is also a condition for the unseen materiality of rebirthlinking
For it is said in the Paṭṭhāna that like the consciousnessoriginated also the kammaoriginated has consciousness as its condition 
This is how the exposition should be known by manner of condition 
This is the detailed explanation of the clause With consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality 
As to the clause With mentalitymateriality as condition the sixfold base
Three aggregates are mind the basis Primaries and the rest are matter
And while all that conditions this A part can represent the rest
In the case of the mentalitymateriality that is here a condition for the sixfold base mentality is the three aggregates beginning with feeling while materiality should be understood as that included in ones own continuity stated thus primaries and the rest are matter that is to say the four primaries six physical bases and life faculty since they are conditioning factors invariably
But this mentality and this materiality and this mentalitymateriality each one representing the rest as mentalitymateriality should be understood as a condition for the sixfold base consisting of the sixth base and the sixfold base each one representing the rest as the sixfold base
Why
Because in the immaterial becoming there is only mentality as a condition and that is a condition only for the sixth base namely the mind base not for any other
For it is said in the Vibhaṅga With mentality as condition the sixth base 
Here it may be asked But how is it to be known that mentalitymateriality is a condition for the sixfold base
Because the latter exists when mentality materiality exists
For a given base exists when a given kind of mentality and materiality exists not otherwise
But the way in which the one comes to exist when the other does will be explained below in the section dealing with how it is a condition
Therefore
A wise man should contrive to tell Which one conditions which and how At rebirth and in life as well
Herein what follows illustrates the meaning
In immaterial rebirth And life the mind alone will come
In seven ways and six to be Condition at the minimum
How
In rebirthlinking firstly mentality is a condition in seven ways at the minimum as conascence mutuality support association kammaresult presence and nondisappearance conditions for the sixth base
Some mentality however is a condition as rootcause condition that is greed etc and some as nutriment condition that is contact and mental volition So it is also a condition in other ways It is by the two latter that the maximum and minimum should be understood
In the course of an existence too resultant mentality is a condition as already stated But the other nonresultant kind is a condition in six ways at minimum as the aforesaid conditions except for kammaresult condition
Some however are a condition as rootcause condition and some as nutriment condition So it is also a condition in other ways It is by these that the maximum and minimum should be understood
In fiveconstituent becoming At rebirth mind in the same ways
Acts as condition for the sixth And for the others in six ways
Besides the immaterial states also in the fiveconstituent becoming that resultant mentality in association with the heartbasis is a condition in seven ways at the minimum for the sixth the mind base in the same way as was said with respect to the immaterial states
But in association with the four primary elements it is a condition in six ways as conascence support kammaresult dissociation presence and nondisappearance conditions for the other five beginning with the eye base
Some however are a condition as rootcause condition and some as nutriment condition It is by these that the maximum and minimum should be understood
Result is for result condition During a life in the same ways
While nonresult the nonresultant Sixth conditions in six ways
For as in rebirthlinking so also in the course of an existence in the five constituent becoming resultant mentality is a condition in the seven ways at minimum for the resultant sixth base
But nonresultant mentality is a condition in six ways at minimum for the nonresultant sixth base leaving out kamma result condition
The maximum and minimum should be understood in the way already stated
And during life result conditions The other five in fourfold way
The nonresultant kind can be Explained in the aforesaid way
Again in the course of an existence the other resultant mentality which has as its physical basis the eye sensitivity etc is a condition in four ways as postnascence dissociation presence and nondisappearance conditions for the rest of the five beginning with the eye base
And as the resultant so also the nonresultant is explained
therefore the mentality classed as profitable etc should be understood as their condition in four ways
This firstly is how it should be understood what bases mentality alone is a condition for in rebirthlinking and in the course of an existence and how it is a condition
Not even for a single base In immaterial becoming
Is matter a condition here But in fiveaggregate becoming
Basis as matter is condition At rebirth in a sixfold way
For the sixth base the primaries Are for the five in fourfold way
As to matter the materiality of the physical heart basis is a condition in rebirthlinking in six ways as conascence mutuality support dissociation presence and nondisappearance conditions for the sixth the mind base
But the four primaries are in general that is to say in rebirthlinking and in the course of an existence conditions in four ways as conascence support presence and nondisappearance conditions for any of the five bases beginning with the eye whenever they arise
Life and in lifetime food as well Conditions five in threefold way
These five the sixth in sixfold way Basis the sixth in fivefold way
But in rebirthlinking and in the course of an existence the material life faculty is a condition in three ways as presence nondisappearance and faculty conditions for these five beginning with the eye
Nutriment too is a condition in three ways as presence nondisappearance and nutriment conditions and that is so in the course of an existence not in rebirthlinking and applies when the bodies of beings subsisting on nutriment are suffused with the nutriment
In the course of an existence not in rebirthlinking those five bases beginning with the eye are conditions in six ways as support prenascence faculty dissociation presence and nondisappearance conditions for that part of the sixth the mind base comprising eye ear nose tongue and bodyconsciousness
But in the course of an existence not at rebirthlinking the materiality of the heart  basis is a condition in five ways as support prenascence dissociation presence and nondisappearance conditions for the remaining mind base apart from the five consciousnesses
This is how it should be understood what bases materiality alone is a condition for in rebirthlinking and in the course of an existence and how it is a condition
Which mindcummatter combination Is a condition for which kind
And how it is so in each case A wise man should now seek to find
For example
firstly in rebirthlinking in the fiveconstituent becoming the mentalitymateriality in other words the trio of aggregates with the materiality of the heart basis is a condition as conascence mutuality support kamma result association dissociation presence and nondisappearance conditions etc for the sixth the mind base
This is merely the heading
but since it can all be construed in the way already stated the detail is not given here
This is the detailed explanation of the clause With mentalitymateriality as condition the sixfold base
As to the clause With the sixfold base as condition contact
Contact is briefly of six kinds With eyecontact and others too
According to each consciousness It is in detail thirtytwo
Briefly with the clause With the sixfold base as condition contact there are only the six kinds beginning with eyecontact that is to say eyecontact earcontact nosecontact tonguecontact bodycontact and mindcontact
But in detail the five profitable resultant and the five unprofitable resultant beginning with eyecontact make ten the rest which are associated with the twentytwo kinds of mundane resultant consciousness make twentytwo So all these come to thirtytwo  like the consciousness with formations as condition given above
But as to the sixfold base that is a condition for this thirtytwofold contact Herein
Some wise men take the sixfold base To be the five internal bases
With the sixth but others count These plus the six external bases
Herein firstly there are those who take this to be an exposition of the occurrence of what is clung to that is kammicallyacquired aggregates and they maintain that the conditioning bases and the conditionallyarisen contact are only what is included in ones own continuity They take any one part to represent any remaining one of its kind since the condition for contact in the immaterial states is the sixth base only according to the text With the sixth base as condition contact  and elsewhere it is the sixfold base inclusively So they have it that sixfold base means the internal five beginning with the eye plus the sixth base
For that sixth base and that sixfold base are styled sixfold base 
But there are those who maintain that it is only the conditionallyarisen contact that is contained in a single continuity while the conditioning bases are contained in separate that is past continuities as well They maintain that all and any such bases are a condition for contact and they include also the six external ones So they have it that sixfold base means the same internal five plus the sixth plus the external ones beginning with visible data
For that sixth base and that partial sixfold base and the sixfold base along with these external ones each representing the rest are styled sixfold base too
Here it may be asked One kind of contact does not derive from all the bases nor all the kinds of contact from one base And yet With the sixfold base as condition contact is said in the singular Why is that 
Here is the answer It is true that neither is one derived from all nor all from one However one is derived from many
For eyecontact is derived from the eye base from the visibledata base from the mind base reckoned as eye consciousness and from the mentaldatum base consisting of the remaining associated states And each case should be construed as appropriate in this way
Therefore
Though stated in the singular He shows therewith in all such cases
That this contact though only one Is yet derived from several bases
Though stated in the singular the meaning is by this statement in the singular that With the sixfold base as condition contact it is pointed out by the Blessed One that contact which is of one kind comes into being from many bases
But as regards these bases
Five in six ways and after that One in nine ways the external six
As contacts conditionality According to each case we fix
Here is the explanation firstly the five consisting of the eye base etc are conditions in six ways as support prenascence faculty dissociation presence and nondisappearance conditions for contact classed in five ways as eye contact and so on
After that the single resultant mind base is a condition in nine ways as conascence mutuality support result nutriment faculty association presence and nondisappearance conditions for the variously classed resultant mind contact
But in the case of the external bases the visible data base is a condition in four ways as object prenascence presence and non disappearance conditions for eyecontact
Likewise the sound base etc respectively for earcontact and so on
But these and mental data as object are conditions likewise and as object condition too for mindcontact so the external six as contacts conditionality according to each case we fix 
This is the detailed explanation of the clause With the sixfold base as condition contact
As to the clause With contact as condition feeling
Feelings when named by way of door Eyecontactborn and all the rest
Are only six but then they are At nine and eighty sorts assessed
In the analysis of this clause in the Vibhaṅga only six kinds of feeling according to door are given thus Eyecontactborn feeling
ear nose tongue body mindcontactborn feeling  Still when classed according to association with the eightynine kinds of consciousness they are at nine and eighty sorts assessed 
But from the nine and eighty feelings Thirtytwo no more appear
Associated with result And only those are mentioned here
Herein contact in the five doors Conditions five in eightfold way
And single way the rest it acts In the mind door in the same way
Herein in the five doors contact beginning with eyecontact is a condition in eight ways as conascence mutuality support result nutriment association presence and nondisappearance conditions for the five kinds of feeling that have respectively eye sensitivity etc as their physical basis
But that contact beginning with eyecontact is a condition in one way only as decisivesupport condition for the rest of resultant feeling in the sense sphere occurring in each door as receiving investigation and registration
In the mind door in the same way the contact called conascent mindcontact is also a condition in the same eight ways for sensesphere resultant feeling occurring as registration in the mind door and so also for the kinds of resultant feeling in the three planes occurring with rebirthlinking lifecontinuum and death
But the mindcontact associated with minddoor adverting is a condition in one way only as decisivesupport condition for the kinds of feeling that occur in the mind door as registration in the sense sphere
This is the detailed explanation of the clause With contact as condition feeling
As regards the clause With feeling as condition craving
Six cravings for things visible and all the rest are treated here
And each of these when it occurs Can in one of three modes appear
called after their objects as a son is called after his father bankers son brahmans son as visibledata craving
sound odour flavour tangibledata and mentaldata craving  Six kinds of craving are shown in the analysis of this clause in the Vibhaṅga
 Each of these six kinds of craving is reckoned threefold according to its mode of occurrence as craving for sense desires craving for becoming or craving for nonbecoming
When visibledata craving occurs enjoying with sensedesire enjoyment a visible datum as object that has come into the focus of the eye it is called craving for sense desires
But when that same visibledata craving occurs along with the eternity view that assumes that same object to be lasting and eternal it is called craving for becoming
for it is the greed accompanying the eternity view that is called craving for becoming
When it occurs along with the annihilation view that assumes that same object to break up and be destroyed it is called craving for nonbecoming
for it is the greed accompanying the annihilation view that is called craving for nonbecoming
So also in the case of craving for sounds and so on
These amount to eighteen kinds of craving
The eighteen with respect to ones own visible data  etc and eighteen with respect to external visible data  etc together make thirtysix kinds
Thirtysix in the past thirtysix in the future and thirtysix in the present make onehundredandeight kinds of craving
When these are reduced again they should be understood to amount to the six kinds only with visible data etc as object and these to three only as craving for sense desires and so on
Out of selfish affection for feeling after taking pleasure in it when it arises through a visible datum as object etc these beings accord much honour to painters musicians perfumers cooks weavers distillers of elixirs physicians etc who furnish respectively visible data as object etc just as out of affection for a child they reward the childs nurse after taking pleasure in the child
That is why it should be understood that these three kinds of craving have feeling as their condition
What is intended here is but Resultant pleasant feeling hence
Tis a condition in one way For all this cravings occurrence
In one way it is a condition as decisivesupport condition only
Or alternatively
A man in pain for pleasure longs And finding pleasure longs for more
The peace of equanimity Is counted pleasure too therefore
Since all three feelings thus can be Conditions for all kinds of craving
The Greatest Sage announced the law With feeling as condition craving
Though feeling is condition still Without inherent tendency
No craving can arise and so From this the perfect saint is free 
This is the detailed explanation of the clause With feeling as condition craving
As regards the clause With craving as condition clinging
Four clingings need to be explained As to analysis of meaning
As to the brief and full account Of states and also as to order
Herein this is the explanation firstly there are these four kinds of clinging here namely sensedesire clinging false view clinging rulesandvows clinging and selfdoctrine clinging
The analysis of meaning is this it clings to the kind of sensedesire called sensedesires physical object  thus it is sensedesire clinging Also it is sensedesire and it is clinging thus it is sensedesire clinging
Clinging is firm grasping
for here the prefix upa has the sense of firmness as in upāyāsa and upakuṭṭha  and so on
Likewise it is false view and it is clinging thus it is false view clinging
or it clings to false view thus it is false view clinging
for in the case of the false view The world and self are eternal  etc it is the latter kind of view that clings to the former
Likewise it clings to rite and ritual thus it is rulesand vows clinging
also it is rite and ritual and it is clinging thus it is rulesand vows clinging
for ox asceticism ox vows etc  are themselves kinds of clinging too because of the misinterpretation that purification comes about in this way
Likewise they indoctrinate by means of that thus that is doctrine
they cling by means of that thus that is clinging
What do they indoctrinate with What do they cling to
Self
The clinging to doctrines of self is selfdoctrine clinging
Or by means of that they cling to a self that is a mere doctrine of self thus that is selfdoctrine clinging
This firstly is the analysis of meaning 
But as regards the brief and full account of states firstly Herein what is sensedesire clinging
That which in the case of sense desires is lust for sense desires greed for sense desires delight in sense desires craving for sense desires fever of sense desires infatuation with sense desires committal to sense desires that is called sensedesire clinging   in brief sense desire clinging is called firmness of craving
Firmness of craving is a name for the subsequent craving itself which has become firm by the influence of previous craving which acts as its decisivesupport condition
But some have said Craving is the aspiring to an object that one has not yet reached like a thiefs stretching out his hand in the dark clinging is the grasping of an object that one has reached like the thiefs grasping his objective
These states oppose fewness of wishes and contentment
and so they are the roots of the suffering due to seeking and guarding 
The remaining three kinds of clinging are in brief simply false view
In detail however sensedesire clinging is the firm state of the craving described above as of onehundredandeight kinds with respect to visible data and so on
False view clinging is the tenbased wrong view
according as it is said Herein what is false view clinging
There is no giving no offering  no good and virtuous ascetics and brahmans who have themselves realized by directknowledge and declare this world and the other world such view as this  such perverse assumption
is called falseview clinging 
Rulesandvows clinging is the adherence to the view that purification comes through rules and vows
according as it is said Herein what is rules andvows clinging
That purification comes through a rite that purification comes through a ritual that purification comes through a rite and ritual such view as this  such perverse assumption is
called rulesandvows clinging 
Selfdoctrine clinging is the twentybased false view of individuality
according as it is said Herein what is selfdoctrine clinging
Here the untaught ordinary man  untrained in good mens Dhamma sees materiality as self  such perverse assumption is called selfdoctrine clinging 
This is the brief and full account of states
As to order here order is threefold  that is to say order of arising order of abandoning and order of teaching
Herein order of arising of defilements is not meant literally because there is no first arising of defilements in the beginningless round of rebirths
But in a relative sense it is this usually in a single becoming the misinterpretation of eternity and annihilation are preceded by the assumption of a self After that when a man assumes that this self is eternal rulesandvows clinging arises in him for the purpose of purifying the self And when a man assumes that it breaks up thus disregarding the next world sensedesire clinging arises in him So selfdoctrine clinging arises first and after that false view clinging and rulesandvows clinging or sensedesire clinging This then is their order of arising in one becoming
And here false view clinging etc are abandoned first because they are eliminated by the path of streamentry
Sensedesire clinging is abandoned later because it is eliminated by the path of Arahantship This is the order of their abandoning
Sensedesire clinging however is taught first among them because of the breadth of its objective field and because of its obviousness
For it has a broad objective field because it is associated with eight kinds of consciousness  The others have a narrow objective field because they are associated with four kinds of consciousness  And usually it is sensedesire clinging that is obvious because of this generations love of attachment  not so the other kinds
One possessed of sensedesire clinging is much given to display and ceremony for the purpose of attaining sense desires False view clinging comes next to the sensedesire clinging since that display and ceremony is a false view of his
And that is then divided in two as rulesandvows clinging and selfdoctrine clinging And of these two rulesandvows clinging is taught first being gross because it can be recognized on seeing it in the forms of ox practice and dog practice
And selfdoctrine clinging is taught last because of its subtlety This is the order of teaching 
For the first in a single way
But for the three remaining kinds In sevenfold or eightfold way
As regards the four kinds of clinging taught in this way craving for sense desires is a condition in one way as decisivesupport for the first kind namely sensedesire clinging because it arises in relation to the objective field in which craving delights
But it is a condition in seven ways as conascence mutuality support association presence nondisappearance and rootcause or in eight ways as those and decisivesupport as well for the remaining three kinds
And when it is a condition as decisivesupport then it is never conascent
This is the detailed explanation of the clause With craving as conditionclinging
As to the clause With clinging as condition becoming
As to meaning as to state Purpose analysis synthesis
And which for which becomes condition The exposition should be known
As to meaning Herein it becomes  thus it is becoming 
That is twofold as kammaprocess becoming and rebirthprocess becoming
according as it is said Becoming in two ways there is kammaprocess becoming and there is rebirthprocess becoming 
Herein the kamma process itself as becoming is kammaprocess becoming likewise the rebirth process itself as becoming is rebirthprocess becoming
And here rebirth is becoming since it becomes
but just as The arising of Buddhas is bliss is said because it causes bliss so too kamma should be understood as becoming using for it the ordinary term for its fruit since it causes becoming
This firstly is how the exposition should be known here as to meaning
As to state firstly kammaprocess becoming in brief is both volition and the states of covetousness etc associated with the volition and reckoned as kamma too
according as it is said Herein what is kammaprocess becoming
The formation of merit the formation of demerit the formation of the imperturbable either with a small plane or with a large plane that is called kammaprocess becoming
Also all kamma that leads to becoming is called kammaprocess becoming 
Here the formation of merit is in terms of states the thirteen kinds of volition 
the formation of demerit is the twelve kinds 
and the formation of the imperturbable is the four kinds 
So with the words either with a small plane or with a large plane the insignificance or magnitude of these same volitions result is expressed here
But with the words also all kamma that leads to becoming the covetousness etc associated with volition are expressed
Rebirthprocess becoming briefly is aggregates generated by kamma It is of nine kinds
according as it is said Herein what is rebirthprocess becoming
Sensedesire becoming finematerial becoming immaterial becoming percipient becoming nonpercipient becoming neitherpercipientnornonpercipient becoming oneconstituent becoming fourconstituent becoming five constituent becoming this is called rebirthprocess becoming 
Herein the kind of becoming called having sense desires is sensedesire becoming
Similarly with the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming
It is the becoming of those possessed of perception or there is perception here in becoming thus it is percipient becoming
The opposite kind is nonpercipient becoming
Owing to the absence of gross perception and to the presence of subtle perception there is neither perception nor nonperception in that kind of becoming thus it is neitherpercipientnornonpercipient becoming
It is becoming constituted out of the materiality aggregate only thus it is oneconstituent becoming
or that kind of becoming has only one constituent the materiality aggregate or dimension thus it is oneconstituent becoming
And similarly the fourconstituent has the four mental aggregates or dimensions and the fiveconstituent has the material and the four mental aggregates or dimensions
Herein sensedesire becoming is five aggregates acquired through kamma 
Likewise the finematerial becoming
Immaterial becoming is four Percipient becoming is four and five
Nonpercipient becoming is one aggregate that is acquired through kamma 
Neitherpercipientnornonpercipient becoming is four
Oneconstituent becoming etc are respectively one four and five aggregates as aggregates that are acquired through kamma 
This is how the exposition should be known here as to state    As to purpose although formations of merit etc are of course dealt with in the same way in the description of becoming and in the description of formations  nevertheless the repetition has a purpose For in the former case it was because it was a condition as past kamma for rebirth linking here in this becoming while in the latter case it is because it is a condition as present kamma for rebirthlinking in the future becoming Or alternatively in the former instance in the passage beginning Herein what is the formation of merit
It is profitable volition of the sense sphere  it was only volitions that were called formations
but here with the words All kamma that leads to becoming  the states associated with the volition are also included
And in the former instance it was only such kamma as is a condition for consciousness that was called formations
but now also that which generates nonpercipient becoming is included
But why so many words In the clause With ignorance as condition there are formations only profitable and unprofitable states are expressed as the formation of merit etc
but in the clause With clinging as condition becoming profitable and unprofitable and also functional states are expressed because of the inclusion of rebirthprocess becoming
So this repetition has a purpose in each case This is how the exposition should be known as to purpose here 
As to analysis synthesis means as to both the analysis and the synthesis of becoming that has clinging as its condition
The kamma with sensedesire clinging as its condition that is performed and generates sensedesire becoming is kammaprocess becoming
The aggregates generated by that are rebirth process becoming
similarly in the case of finematerial and immaterial becoming
So there are two kinds of sensedesire becoming with sense desire clinging as condition included in which are percipient becoming and fiveconstituent becoming And there are two kinds of finematerial becoming included in which are percipient nonpercipient oneconstituent and five constituent becoming And there are two kinds of immaterial becoming included in which are percipient becoming neitherpercipientnornonpercipient becoming and fourconstituent becoming
So together with what is included by them there are six kinds of becoming with sensedesire clinging as condition
Similarly too with the three remaining kinds of clinging as condition So as to analysis there are together with what is included by them twentyfour kinds of becoming with clinging as condition
 As to synthesis however by uniting kammaprocess becoming and rebirth process becoming there is together with what is included by it one kind of sensedesire becoming with sensedesire clinging as its condition
Similarly with finematerial and immaterial becoming So there are three kinds of becoming
And similarly with the remaining three kinds of clinging as condition
So by synthesis there are together with what is included by them twelve kinds of becoming with clinging as condition
Furthermore without distinction the kamma with clinging as its condition that attains sensedesire becoming is kammaprocess becoming
The aggregates generated by that are rebirthprocess becoming
Similarly in the finematerial and immaterial becoming
So together with what is included by them there are two kinds of sensedesire becoming two kinds of finematerial becoming and two kinds of immaterial becoming So by synthesis there are six kinds of becoming by this other method
Or again without making the division into kammaprocess becoming and rebirthprocess becoming there are together with what is included by them three kinds of becoming as sensedesire becoming and so on
Or again without making the division into sensedesire becoming etc there are together with what is included by them two kinds of becoming as kammaprocess becoming and rebirthprocess becoming
And also without making the division into kamma process and rebirth process there is according to the words With clinging as condition becoming only one kind of becoming This is how the exposition of becoming with clinging as condition should be known here as to analysis and synthesis 
Which for which becomes condition means that here the exposition should be known according to what kind of clinging is a condition for what kind of becoming
But what is condition for what here
Any kind is a condition for any kind
For the ordinary man is like a madman
and without considering Is this right or not and aspiring by means of any of the kinds of clinging to any of the kinds of becoming he performs any of the kinds of kamma
Therefore when some say that the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming do not come about through rulesandvows clinging that should not be accepted
what should be accepted is that all kinds come about through all kinds
For example someone thinks in accordance with hearsay or false view that sense desires come to be fulfilled in the human world among the great warrior families etc and in the six divine worlds of the sense sphere Misled by listening to wrong doctrine etc and imagining that by this kamma sense desires will come to be fulfilled he performs for the purpose of attaining them acts of bodily misconduct etc through sensedesire clinging By fulfilling such misconduct he is reborn in the states of loss
Or he performs acts of bodily misconduct etc aspiring to sense desires visible here and now and protecting those he has already acquired By fulfilling such misconduct he is reborn in the states of loss
The kamma that is the cause of rebirth there is kammaprocess becoming
The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth process becoming
But percipient becoming and fiveconstituent becoming are included in that too
Another however whose knowledge has been intensified by listening to good Dhamma and so on imagines that by this kind of kamma sense desires will come to be fulfilled  He performs acts of bodily good conduct etc through sensedesire clinging
By fulfilling such bodily good conduct he is reborn among deities or human beings
The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kammaprocess becoming
The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth process becoming
But percipient becoming and fiveconstituent becoming are included in that too
So sensedesire clinging is a condition for sensedesire becoming with its analysis and its synthesis
Another hears or conjectures that sense desires come to still greater perfection in the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming and through sensedesire clinging he produces the finematerial and immaterial attainments and in virtue of his attainments he is reborn in the finematerial or immaterial Brahmāworld
The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kammaprocess becoming
The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirthprocess becoming
But percipient nonpercipient neitherpercipientnornonpercipient one constituent fourconstituent and fiveconstituent kinds of becoming are included in that too
Thus sensedesire clinging is a condition for finematerial and immaterial becoming with its analysis and its synthesis
Another clings to the annihilation view thus This self comes to be entirely cut off when it is cut off in the fortunate states of the sense sphere or in the fine material or immaterial kinds of becoming and he performs kamma to achieve that His kamma is kammaprocess becoming
The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirthprocess becoming
But the percipient etc kinds of becoming are included in that too
So falseview clinging is a condition for all three namely for the sensedesire finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming with their analysis and their synthesis
Another through selftheory clinging thinks This self comes to be blissful or comes to be free from fever in the becoming in the fortunate states in the sense sphere or in one or other of the finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming and he performs kamma to achieve that That kamma of his is kamma process becoming
The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth process becoming
But the percipient etc kinds of becoming are included in that too
Thus this selftheory clinging is a condition for all the three namely becoming with their analysis and their synthesis
Another thinks through rulesandvows clinging This rite and ritual leads him who perfects it to perfect bliss in becoming in the fortunate states of the sense sphere or in the finematerial or immaterial kinds of becoming and he performs kamma to achieve that That kamma of his is kammaprocess becoming
The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirthprocess becoming
But the percipient etc kinds of becoming are included in that too
So rulesand vows clinging is a condition for all three namely the sensedesire finematerial and immaterial kinds of becoming with their analysis and their synthesis
This is how the exposition should be known here according to which is condition for which 
But which is condition for which kind of becoming in what way here
Now clinging as condition for becoming Both finematerial and immaterial Is decisivesupport
and then conascence And so on for the sensedesire kind
This clinging though fourfold is a condition in only one way as decisive support condition for becoming both finematerial and immaterial that is for the profitable kamma in the kammaprocess becoming that takes place in sensedesire becoming and for the rebirthprocess becoming
It is a condition as conascence and so on that is as conascence mutuality support association presence non disappearance and rootcause conditions for the unprofitable kammaprocess becoming associated with the fourfold clinging itself in the sensedesire becoming
But it is a condition as decisivesupport only for that which is dissociated
This is the detailed explanation of the clause With clinging as condition becoming
As regards the clause With becoming as condition birth etc the definition of birth should be understood in the way given in the Description of the Truths 
Only kammaprocess becoming is intended here as becoming
for it is that not rebirthprocess becoming which is a condition for birth
But it is a condition in two ways as kamma condition and as decisivesupport condition
Here it may be asked But how is it to be known that becoming is a condition for birth
Because of the observable difference of inferiority and superiority
For in spite of equality of external circumstances such as father mother seed blood nutriment etc the difference of inferiority and superiority of beings is observable even in the case of twins
And that fact is not causeless since it is not present always and in all nor has it any cause other than kammaprocess becoming since there is no other reason in the internal continuity of beings generated by it Consequently it has only kammaprocess becoming for its cause
And because kamma is the cause of the difference of inferiority and superiority among beings
the Blessed One said It is kamma that separates beings according to inferiority and superiority 
From that it can be known that becoming is a condition for birth
And when there is no birth neither ageing and death nor the states beginning with sorrow come about
but when there is birth then ageing and death come about and also the states beginning with sorrow which are either bound up with ageing and death in a fool who is affected by the painful states called ageing and death or which are not so bound up in one who is affected by some painful state or other
therefore this birth is a condition for ageing and death and also for sorrow and so on
But it is a condition in one way as decisivesupport type
This is the detailed explanation of the clause With becoming as condition birth
Now here at the end sorrow etc are stated Consequently the ignorance stated at the beginning of the Wheel of Becoming thus With ignorance as condition there are formations
is established by the sorrow and so on Becomings Wheel reveals no known beginning
No maker no experiencer there Void with a twelvefold voidness
and nowhere It ever halts forever it is spinning so it should accordingly be understood
But how is ignorance established by sorrow etc How has this Wheel of Becoming no known beginning How is there no maker or experiencer there How is it void with twelvefold voidness
Sorrow grief and despair are inseparable from ignorance and lamentation is found in one who is deluded So firstly when these are established ignorance is established
Furthermore With the arising of cankers there is the arising of ignorance is said
and with the arising of cankers these things beginning with sorrow come into being
How
Firstly sorrow about separation from sense desires as object has its arising in the canker of sense desire
according as it is said
If desiring and lusting
his desires elude him He suffers as though an arrow had pierced him 
and according as it is said Sorrow springs from sense desires 
And all these come about with the arising of the canker of views
according as it is said
In one who possesses the view I am materiality my materiality with the change and transformation of materiality there arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair 
And as with the arising of the canker of views so also with the arising of the canker of becoming
according as it is said
Then whatever deities there are longlived beautiful blissful longresident in grand palaces when they hear the Perfect Ones teaching of the Dhamma they feel fear anxiety and a sense of urgency 
as in the case of deities harassed by the fear of death on seeing the five signs 
And as with the arising of the canker of becoming so also with the canker of ignorance
according as it is said
The fool bhikkhus experiences pain and grief here and now in three ways 
Now these states come about with the arising of cankers and so when they are established they establish the cankers which are the cause of ignorance
And when the cankers are established ignorance is also established because it is present when its condition is present
This in the first place is how ignorance etc should be understood to be established by sorrow and so on
But when ignorance is established since it is present when its condition is present and when with ignorance as condition there are formations with formations as condition consciousness there is no end to the succession of cause with fruit in this way
Consequently the Wheel of Becoming with its twelve factors revolving with the linking of cause and effect is established as having no known beginning
This being so are not the words With ignorance as condition there are formations as an exposition of a simple beginning contradicted
This is not an exposition of a simple beginning
It is an exposition of a basic state 
For ignorance is the basic state for the three rounds 
It is owing to his seizing ignorance that the fool gets caught in the round of the remaining defilements in the rounds of kamma etc
just as it is owing to seizing a snakes head that the arm gets caught in the coils of the rest of the snakes body
But when the cutting off of ignorance is effected he is liberated from them
just as the arm caught in the coils is liberated when the snakes head is cut off
according as it is said With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance  and so on
So this is an exposition of the basic state whereby there is bondage for him who grasps it and liberation for him who lets it go it is not an exposition of a simple beginning
This is how the Wheel of Becoming should be understood to have no known beginning
This Wheel of Becoming consists in the occurrence of formations etc with ignorance etc as the respective reasons Therefore it is devoid of a maker supplementary to that such as a Brahmā conjectured thus Brahmā the Great the Highest the Creator  to perform the function of maker of the round of rebirths and it is devoid of any self as an experiencer of pleasure and pain conceived thus This self of mine that speaks and feels 
This is how it should be understood to be without any maker or experiencer
However ignorance is void of lastingness since its nature is to rise and fall and it is void of beauty since it is defiled and causes defilement and it is void of pleasure since it is oppressed by rise and fall and it is void of any selfhood susceptible to the wielding of power since it exists in dependence on conditions
and likewise the factors consisting of formations etc
Or ignorance is neither self nor selfs nor in self nor possessed of self
And likewise the factors consisting of formations etc
That is why this Wheel of Becoming should be understood thus Void with a twelvefold voidness
After knowing this again
Its roots are ignorance and craving Its times are three as past and so on
To which there properly belong Two eight and two from its twelve factors
The two things ignorance and craving should be understood as the root of this Wheel of Becoming
Of the derivation from the past ignorance is the root and feeling the end And of the continuation into the future craving is the root and ageinganddeath the end It is twofold in this way
Herein the first applies to one whose temperament is false view and the second to one whose temperament is craving
For in the round of rebirths ignorance leads those whose temperament favours false view and craving those whose temperament favours craving
Or the first has the purpose of eliminating the annihilation view because by the evidence of the fruit it proves that there is no annihilation of the causes and the second has the purpose of eliminating the eternity view because it proves the ageing and death of whatever has arisen
Or the first deals with the child in the womb because it illustrates successive occurrence of the faculties and the second deals with one apparitionally born because of their simultaneous appearance
The past the present and the future are its three times
Of these it should be understood that according to what is given as such in the texts the two factors ignorance and formations belong to the past time
the eight beginning with consciousness belong to the present time
and the two birth and ageing anddeath belong to the future time
Again
It has three links with cause fruit cause As first parts and four different sections
Its spokes are twenty qualities With triple round it spins forever
 it should be understood thus
Herein between formations and rebirthlinking consciousness there is one link consisting of causefruit
Between feeling and craving there is one link consisting of fruitcause
And between becoming and birth there is one link consisting of causefruit This is how it should be understood that it has three links with cause fruit cause as first parts
But there are four sections which are determined by the beginnings and ends of the links
that is to say ignorance formations is one section
consciousnessmentalitymateriality sixfold basecontactfeeling is the second
cravingclinging becoming is the third
and birthageinganddeath is the fourth
This is how it should be understood to have four different sections
Then There were five causes in the past And now there is a fivefold fruit
 There are five causes now as well And in the future fivefold fruit
It is according to these twenty spokes called qualities that the words its spokes are twenty qualities should be understood
 Herein as regards the words There were five causes in the past firstly only these two namely ignorance and formations are mentioned
But one who is ignorant hankers and hankering clings and with his clinging as condition there is becoming
therefore craving clinging and becoming are included as well
Hence it is said In the previous kammaprocess becoming there is delusion which is ignorance there is accumulation which is formations there is attachment which is craving there is embracing which is clinging there is volition which is becoming thus these five things in the previous kammaprocess becoming are conditions for rebirthlinking here in the present becoming 
Herein In the previous kammaprocess becoming means in kammaprocess becoming done in the previous birth
There is delusion which is ignorance means that the delusion that there then was about suffering etc deluded whereby the man did the kamma was ignorance
There is accumulation which is formations means the prior volitions arisen in one who prepares the things necessary for a gift during a month perhaps or a year after he has had the thought I shall give a gift
But it is the volitions of one who is actually placing the offerings in the recipients hands that are called becoming
Or alternatively it is the volition that is accumulation in six of the impulsions of a single adverting that is called formations
and the seventh volition is called becoming
Or any kind of volition is called becoming
and the accumulations associated therewith are called formations
There is attachment which is craving means that in one performing kamma whatever attachment and aspiration there is for its fruit as rebirthprocessbecoming is called craving
There is embracing which is clinging means that the embracing the grasping the adherence which is a condition for kammaprocess becoming and occurs thus By doing this I shall preserve or I shall cut off sense desire in such and such a place is called clinging
There is volition which is becoming means the kind of volition stated already at the end of the sentence dealing with accumulation is becoming This is how the meaning should be understood
 And now there is a fivefold fruit means what is given in the text beginning with consciousness and ending with feeling
according as it is said Here in the present becoming there is rebirthlinking which is consciousness there is descent into the womb which is mentalitymateriality there is sensitivity which is sense base there is what is touched which is contact there is what is felt which is feeling thus these five things here in the present rebirthprocess becoming have their conditions in kamma done in the past 
Herein there is rebirthlinking which is consciousness means that it is what is called rebirthlinking because it arises linking the next becoming that is consciousness
There is descent into the womb which is mentalitymateriality means that it is what consists in the descent of the material and immaterial states into a womb their arrival and entry as it were that is mentalitymateriality
There is sensitivity which is sense base this is said of the five bases beginning with the eye
There is what is touched which is contact means that it is what is arisen when an object is touched or in the touching of it that is contact
There is what is felt which is feeling means that it is what is felt as results of kamma that is arisen together with rebirthlinking consciousness or with the contact that has the sixfold base as its condition that is feeling Thus should the meaning be understood
 There are five causes now as well means craving and so on Craving clinging and becoming are given in the text
But when becoming is included the formations that precede it or that are associated with it are included too
And by including craving and clinging the ignorance associated with them deluded by which a man performs kamma is included too
So they are five
Hence it is said Here in the present becoming with the maturing of the bases there is delusion which is ignorance there is accumulation which is formations there is attachment which is craving there is embracing which is clinging there is volition which is becoming thus these five things here in the present kammaprocess becoming are conditions for rebirthlinking in the future 
Herein the words Here in the present becoming with the maturing of the bases point out the delusion existing at the time of the performance of the kamma in one whose bases have matured
The rest is clear
 And in the future fivefold fruit the five beginning with consciousness
These are expressed by the term birth
But ageinganddeath is the ageing and the death of these five themselves
Hence it is said In the future there is rebirthlinking which is consciousness there is descent into the womb which is mentalitymateriality there is sensitivity which is sense base there is what is touched which is contact there is what is felt which is feeling thus these five things in the future rebirthprocess becoming have their condition in kamma done here in the present becoming 
So this Wheel of Becoming has twenty spokes with these qualities
 With triple round it spins forever  here formations and becoming are the round of kamma Ignorance craving and clinging are the round of defilements Consciousness mentalitymateriality the sixfold base contact and feeling are the round of result So this Wheel of Becoming having a triple round with these three rounds should be understood to spin revolving again and again forever for the conditions are not cut off as long as the round of defilements is not cut off
As it spins thus
As to the source in the four truths As to function prevention similes
Kinds of profundity and methods It should be known accordingly
Herein as to source in the truths profitable and unprofitable kamma are stated in the Saccavibhaṅga without distinction as the origin of suffering and so formations due to ignorance stated thus With ignorance as condition there are formations are the second truth with the second truth as source
Consciousness due to formations is the first truth with the second truth as source
The states beginning with mentalitymateriality and ending with resultant feeling due respectively to consciousness etc are the first truth with the first truth as source
Craving due to feeling is the second truth with the first truth as source
Clinging due to craving is the second truth with the second truth as source
Becoming due to clinging is the first and second truths with the second truth as source
Birth due to becoming is the first truth with the second truth as source
Ageinganddeath due to birth is the first truth with the first truth as source This in the first place is how the Wheel of Becoming should be known as to  source in the four truths in whichever way is appropriate
As to function ignorance confuses beings about physical objects of sense desire and is a condition for the manifestation of formations
likewise kamma formations form the formed and are a condition for consciousness
consciousness recognizes an object and is a condition for mentalitymateriality
mentalitymateriality is mutually consolidating and is a condition for the sixfold base
the sixfold base occurs with respect to its own separate objective fields and is a condition for contact
contact touches an object and is a condition for feeling
feeling experiences the stimulus of the object and is a condition for craving
craving lusts after lustarousing things and is a condition for clinging
clinging clings to clingingarousing things and is a condition for becoming
becoming flings beings into the various kinds of destiny and is a condition for birth
birth gives birth to the aggregates owing to its occurring as their generation and is a condition for ageinganddeath
and ageinganddeath ensures the decay and dissolution of the aggregates and is a condition for the manifestation of the next becoming because it ensures sorrow etc
So this Wheel of Becoming should be known accordingly as occurring in two ways as to function in whichever way is appropriate to each of its parts
As to prevention the clause With ignorance as condition there are formations prevents seeing a maker
the clause With formations as condition consciousness prevents seeing the transmigration of a self
the clause With consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality prevents perception of compactness because it shows the analysis of the basis conjectured to be self
and the clauses beginning With mentalitymateriality as condition the sixfold base prevent seeing any self that sees etc cognizes touches feels craves clings becomes is born ages and dies
So this Wheel of Becoming should be known as to prevention of wrong seeing appropriately in each instance
As to similes ignorance is like a blind man because there is no seeing states according to their specific and general characteristics
formations with ignorance as condition are like the blind mans stumbling
consciousness with formations as condition is like the stumblers falling
mentalitymateriality with consciousness as condition is like the appearance of a tumour on the fallen man
the sixfold base with mentalitymateriality as condition is like a gathering that makes the tumour burst
contact with the sixfold base as condition is like hitting the gathering in the tumour
feeling with contact as condition is like the pain due to the blow craving with feeling as condition is like longing for a remedy
clinging with craving as condition is like seizing what is unsuitable through longing for a remedy
becoming with clinging as condition is like applying the unsuitable remedy seized
birth with becoming as condition is like the appearance of a change for the worse in the tumour owing to the application of the unsuitable remedy
and ageinganddeath with birth as condition is like the bursting of the tumour after the change
Or again ignorance here as no theory and wrong theory befogs beings as a cataract does the eyes
the fool befogged by it involves himself in formations that produce further becoming as a cocoonspinning caterpillar does with the strands of the cocoon
consciousness guided by formations establishes itself in the destinies as a prince guided by a minister establishes himself on a throne
death consciousness conjecturing about the sign of rebirth generates mentalitymateriality in its various aspects in rebirthlinking as a magician does an illusion
the sixfold base planted in mentalitymateriality reaches growth increase and fulfilment as a forest thicket does planted in good soil
contact is born from the impingement of the bases as fire is born from the rubbing together of fire sticks
feeling is manifested in one touched by contact as burning is in one touched by fire
craving increases in one who feels as thirst does in one who drinks salt water
one who is parched with craving conceives longing for the kinds of becoming as a thirsty man does for drinks
that is his clinging by clinging he clings to becoming as a fish does to the hook through greed for the bait
when there is becoming there is birth as when there is a seed there is a shoot
and death is certain for one who is born as falling down is for a tree that has grown up
So this Wheel of Becoming should be known thus as to similes too in whichever way is appropriate
Kinds of profundity Now the Blessed Ones words This dependent origination is profound nanda and profound it appears  refer to profundity of meaning of law of teaching and of penetration So this Wheel of Becoming should be known as to the kinds of profundity in whichever way is appropriate
 Herein the meaning of ageinganddeath produced and originated with birth as condition is profound owing to difficulty in understanding its origin with birth as condition thus Neither does ageingand death not come about from birth nor failing birth does it come about from something else it arises only from birth with precisely that nature of ageinganddeath
And the meaning of birth with becoming as condition  and the meaning of formations produced and originated with ignorance as condition are treatable in like manner
That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in meaning This firstly is the profundity of meaning here
For it is the fruit of a cause that is called meaning
according as it is said Knowledge about the fruit of a cause is the discrimination of meaning 
 The meaning of ignorance as condition for formations is profound since it is difficult to understand in what mode and on what occasion ignorance is a condition for the several formations 
The meaning of birth as a condition for ageinganddeath is similarly profound That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in law This is the profundity of law here
For law is a name for cause
according as it is said Knowledge about cause is discrimination of law 
 Then the teaching of this dependent origination is profound since it needs to be given in various ways for various reasons and none but omniscient knowledge gets fully established in it
for in some places in the suttas it is taught in forward order in some in backward order in some in forward and backward order in some in forward or in backward order starting from the middle in some in four sections and three links in some in three sections and two links and in some in two sections and one link That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in teaching This is the profundity of teaching
 Then the individual essences of ignorance etc owing to the penetration of which ignorance etc are rightly penetrated as to their specific characteristic are profound since they are difficult to fathom That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in penetration
For here the meaning of ignorance as unknowing and unseeing and nonpenetration of the truth is profound so is the meaning of formations as forming and accumulating with and without greed so is the meaning of consciousness as void uninterested and manifestation of rebirthlinking without transmigration so is the meaning of mentalitymateriality as simultaneous arising as resolved into components or not and as bending on to an object and being molested  so is the meaning of the sixfold base as predominance world door field and possession of objective field so is the meaning of contact as touching impingement coincidence and concurrence so is the meaning of feeling as the experiencing of the stimulus of an object as pleasure or pain or neutrality as soulless and as what is felt
so is the meaning of craving as a delighting in as a committal to as a current as a bindweed as a river as the ocean of craving and as impossible to fill so is the meaning of clinging as grasping seizing misinterpreting adhering and hard to get by so is the meaning of becoming as accumulating forming and flinging into the various kinds of generation destiny station and abode so is the meaning of birth as birth coming to birth descent into the womb rebirth and manifestation and so is the meaning of ageing andbirth as destruction fall breakup and change This is profundity of penetration
 As to methods Then there are four methods of treating the meaning here They are the method of identity the method of diversity the method of uninterest and the method of ineluctable regularity So this Wheel of Becoming should also be known accordingly as to the kinds of method 
 Herein the noninterruption of the continuity in this way With ignorance as condition there are formations with formations as condition consciousness just like a seeds reaching the state of a tree through the state of the shoot etc is called the method of identity
One who sees this rightly abandons the annihilation view by understanding the unbrokenness of the continuity that occurs through the linking of cause and fruit
And one who sees it wrongly clings to the eternity view by apprehending identity in the non interruption of the continuity that occurs through the linking of cause and fruit
 The defining of the individual characteristic of ignorance etc is called the method of diversity
One who sees this rightly abandons the eternity view by seeing the arising of each new state
And one who sees it wrongly clings to the annihilation view by apprehending individual diversity in the events in a single continuity as though it were a broken continuity
 The absence of interestedness on the part of ignorance such as Formations must be made to occur by me or on the part of formations such as Consciousness must be made to occur by us and so on is called the method of uninterestedness
One who sees this rightly abandons the self view by understanding the absence of a maker
One who sees it wrongly clings to the moralinefficacyofaction view because he does not perceive that the causative function of ignorance etc is established as a law by their respective individual essences
 The production of only formations etc respectively and no others with ignorance etc as the respective reasons like that of curd etc with milk etc as the respective reasons is called the method of ineluctable regularity
One who sees this rightly abandons the nocause view and the moralinefficacy ofaction view by understanding how the fruit accords with its condition
One who sees it wrongly by apprehending it as nonproduction of anything from anything instead of apprehending the occurrence of the fruit in accordance with its conditions clings to the nocause view and to the doctrine of fatalism So this Wheel of Becoming
As to source in the four truths As to function prevention similes
Kinds of profundity and methods Should be known accordingly
There is no one even in a dream who has got out of the fearful round of rebirths which is ever destroying like a thunderbolt unless he has severed with the knife of knowledge well whetted on the stone of sublime concentration this Wheel of Becoming which offers no footing owing to its great profundity and is hard to get by owing to the maze of many methods
And this has been said by the Blessed One This dependent origination is profound nanda and profound it appears
And nanda it is through not knowing through not penetrating it that this generation has become a tangled skein a knotted ball of thread rootmatted as a reed bed and finds no way out of the round of rebirths with its states of loss unhappy destinies  perdition 
Therefore practicing for his own and others benefit and welfare and abandoning other duties
To find a footing in the deeps Of the dependent origin
Having purified his knowledge in this way by abandoning the perceptions of permanence etc which oppose the contemplations of impermanence etc he passes on from comprehension knowledge and begins the task of attaining that of contemplation of rise and fall which is expressed thus Understanding of contemplating present states change is knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall  and which comes next after comprehension knowledge
When he does so he does it first in brief
Here is the text
How is it that understanding of contemplating present states change is knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall
Present materiality is born materiality the characteristic of its generation is rise the characteristic of its change is fall the contemplation is knowledge
Present feeling  perception  formations  consciousness  eye   Present becoming is born becoming the characteristic of its generation is rise the characteristic of its change is fall the contemplation is knowledge 
In accordance with the method of this text he sees the characteristic of generation the birth the arising the aspect of renewal of born materiality as rise and he sees its characteristic of change its destruction its dissolution as fall 
He understands thus There is no heap or store of unarisen mentality materiality existing prior to its arising When it arises it does not come from any heap or store and when it ceases it does not go in any direction There is nowhere any depository in the way of a heap or store or hoard of what has ceased
But just as there is no store prior to its arising of the sound that arises when a lute is played nor does it come from any store when it arises nor does it go in any direction when it ceases nor does it persist as a store when it has ceased  but on the contrary not having been it is brought into being owing to the lute the lutes neck and the mans appropriate effort and having been it vanishes
so too all material and immaterial states not having been are brought into being and having been they vanish
Having given attention to rise and fall in brief thus he again does so in detail according to condition and instant by seeing those characteristics as given in the exposition of that same knowledge of rise and fall thus
 He sees the rise of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of materiality
 with the arising of craving   with the arising of kamma  he sees the rise of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus With the arising of nutriment there is the arising of materiality
one who sees the characteristic of generation sees the rise of the materiality aggregate
One who sees the rise of the materiality aggregate sees these five characteristics
 He sees the fall of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of materiality
 with the cessation of craving   with the cessation of kamma  he sees the fall of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus With the cessation of nutriment there is the cessation of materiality
one who sees the characteristic of change sees the fall of the materiality aggregate
One who sees the fall of the materiality aggregate sees these five characteristics 
Likewise  He sees the rise of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of feeling
 with the arising of craving   with the arising of kamma  he sees the rise of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus With the arising of contact there is the arising of feeling
one who sees the characteristic of generation sees the rise of the feeling aggregate
One who sees the rise of the feeling aggregate sees those five characteristics
 He sees the fall of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of feeling  with the cessation of craving   with the cessation of kamma  he sees the fall of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus With the cessation of contact there is the cessation of feeling
one who sees the characteristic of change sees the fall of the feeling aggregate
One who sees the fall of the feeling aggregate sees these five characteristics 
And as in the case of the feeling aggregate that is substituting contact for the nutriment in the case of materiality so for the perception and formations aggregates
So also for the consciousness aggregate with this difference that for the phrases containing contact there are substituted with the arising of mentalitymateriality and with the cessation of mentalitymateriality 
So there are fifty characteristics stated with the ten in the case of each aggregate by seeing rise and fall
by means of which he gives attention in detail according to condition and according to instant in this way The rise of materiality is thus its fall is thus so it rises so it falls
As he does so his knowledge becomes clearer thus So it seems these states not having been are brought into being having been they vanish 
When he thus sees rise and fall in the two ways according to condition and according to instant the several truths aspects of the dependent origination methods and characteristics become evident to him
When he sees the arising of aggregates with the arising of ignorance and the cessation of aggregates with the cessation of ignorance this is his seeing of rise and fall according to condition
When he sees the rise and fall of aggregates by seeing the characteristic of generation and the characteristic of change this is his seeing of rise and fall according to instant For it is only at the instant of arising that there is the characteristic of generation
and only at the instant of dissolution that there is the characteristic of change
So when he sees rise and fall in the two ways according to condition and according to instant thus the truth of origination becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of the progenitor
The truth of suffering becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to instant owing to his discovery of the suffering due to birth
The truth of cessation becomes evident to him through seeing fall according to condition owing to his discovery of the nonarising of things produced by conditions when their conditions do not arise
The truth of suffering becomes evident to him too through seeing fall according to instant owing to his discovery of the suffering due to death
And his seeing of rise and fall becomes evident to him as the truth of the path thus This is the mundane path owing to abolition of confusion about it
The dependent origination in forward order becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery that When this exists that comes to be 
The dependent origination in reverse order becomes evident to him through seeing fall according to condition owing to his discovery that When this does not exist that does not come to be 
Dependently arisen states become evident to him through seeing rise and fall according to instant owing to his discovery of the characteristic of the formed
for the things possessed of rise and fall are formed and conditionally arisen
The method of identity becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of unbroken continuity in the connection of cause with fruit
Then he more thoroughly abandons the annihilation view
The method of diversity becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to instant owing to his discovery that each state is new as it arises
Then he more thoroughly abandons the eternity view
The method of uninterestedness becomes evident to him through seeing rise and fall according to condition owing to his discovery of the inability of states to have mastery exercised over them
Then he more thoroughly abandons the self view
The method of ineluctable regularity becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of the arising of the fruit when the suitable conditions are there
Then he more thoroughly abandons the moralinefficacyofaction view
The characteristic of notself becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery that states have no curiosity and that their existence depends upon conditions
The characteristic of impermanence becomes evident to him through seeing rise and fall according to instant owing to his discovery of nonexistence after having been and owing to his discovery that they are secluded from past and future
The characteristic of pain becomes evident to him through that too owing to his discovery of oppression by rise and fall
And the characteristic of individual essence becomes evident to him through that too owing to his discovery of delimitation of states by rise and fall
And in the characteristic of individual essence the temporariness of the characteristic of what is formed becomes evident to him through that too owing to his discovery of the nonexistence of fall at the instant of rise and the non existence of rise at the instant of fall 
When the several truths aspects of the dependent origination methods and characteristics have become evident to him thus then formations appear to him as perpetually renewed So these states it seems being previously unarisen critic and being arisen they cease
And they are not only perpetually renewed but they are also shortlived like dewdrops at sunrise  like a bubble on water  like a line drawn on water  like a mustard seed on an awls point  like a lightning flash 
And they appear without core like a conjuring trick  like a mirage  like a dream  like the circle of a whirling firebrand  like a goblin city  like froth  like a plantain trunk  and so on
At this point he has attained tender insightknowledge called contemplation of rise and fall which has become established by penetrating the fifty characteristics in this manner Only what is subject to fall arises and to be arisen necessitates fall  With the attainment of this he is known as a beginner of insight 
When the dispensation of Kassapa Buddha was being promulgated a large number of monks were staying in a monastery near the river Ganges One morning while sweeping the compound of the monastery
an ordained monk asked a novice to throw away a heap of rubbish The novice went about attending to his own business as if he had not heard the order The ordained monk repeated the order for a second and a third time but the novice still ignored it
The ordained monk then struck the novice with the broom handle
The monk who had struck the novice also went to the Ganges for a wash He heard the novices aspiration and thinking If he who was merely instigated by me can have such hopes what may I not attain to  he made the following aspiration May I wherever I am successively reborn until I attain Nibbāna be prompt in answering questions and carry all before me like this surge of waves and may I be able to unravel promptly and explain all the answers to questions put to me constantly by this young man
It is said that Gotama Buddha saw these two and predicted Five hundred years after I have attained complete Nibbāna these two will reappear and unravelling the matter by questions and by similes they will make clear the Dhamma and Discipline taught by me
He had a searching mind and would seek leaders of various schools of thought and ask probing questions pertaining to metaphysics
At that time there were many arahats living on the Guarded Plateau on a Himalayan slope
One of them the Venerable Assagutta heard with his psychic powers the kings utterance He summoned the Order of monks and asked Your reverences is there any monk capable of conversing with King Milinda to dispel his doubts
The monks remained silent
The Venerable Assagutta said Your reverences in the Realm of the Thirtythree Deities there is a mansion named Ketumatī to the east of Vejayanta A young deva named Mahāsena is living there He is capable of conversing with this king to dispel his doubts
Sakka chief of the deities saw those monks coming from a distance He approached the Venerable Assagutta greeted him stood at one side and said Revered sir great is the Order of monks that has arrived I am at your service what can I do for you
 Venerable Assagutta said Sire this King Milinda in the town of Sāgala in India is a disputant hard to equal hard to overcome He approaches the Order of monks and worries that Order by asking questions by means of professing a wrong view
Then Sakka said Revered sir this King Milinda deceasing from here has arisen among men There is a young deva named Mahāsena who lives in the Ketumatī mansion He is capable of conversing with King Milinda to dispel his doubts We will entreat this young deva to arise in the world of men
Then Sakka vanished from the Order of monks entered the Ketumatī mansion embraced Mahāsena and told him The Order of monks is entreating you my dear to arise in the world of men
Mahāsena replied Revered sir I have no desire for the world of men that is given over to kamma The world of men is dark It is here in a deva world that I will attain ever higher and higher and attain final Nibbāna
Then Venerable Assagutta spoke to Mahāsena My dear we have surveyed the world including the devas but see none except you who refuting what King Milinda says is capable of supporting the Dispensation The Order of monks is entreating you to be reborn in the world of men and to support and teach the Dispensation of the Buddha Master of the Ten Powers
When Mahāsena heard that by refuting King Milinda he would be able to support the Dispensation he felt pleased and elated and gave his consent saying It is good revered sir I will arise in the world of men
The monks having concluded their business in the deva world vanished from there and reappeared on the Guarded Plateau
When the monks were assembled on the Guarded Plateau Venerable Assagutta said Your reverences there is some monk who has not come to this convention
Then one of the monks spoke There is revered sir Venerable Rohaṇa who left a week ago for a Himalayan mountainslope He has attained cessation
Venerable Assagutta told him Now revered Rohaṇa when the Buddhas Dispensation is dissolving do you not see what should be done for the Order 
I was lacking in attention revered sir replied Venerable Rohaṇa
Well then you undergo a punishment
What shall I do revered sir 
Reverend Rohaṇa there is a brahmin village called Kajaṅ gala where a brahmin named Soṇuttara lives He will have a son named Nāgasena Visit that family for alms food for seven years and ten months then draw that boy Nāgasena away and let him go forth When he has gone forth you will be free of your punishment
Mahāsena passed away from the Realm of the Thirtythree Deities and was reborn in the womb of Soṇuttaras wife
Although Venerable Rohaṇa visited the home of Soṇuttara for seven years and ten months he did not receive any alms food nor even the polite refusal Pass on revered sir One day after that period of seven years and ten months
Did you receive anything
Yes brahmin I received said Venerable Rohaṇa
Soṇuttara was not pleased He went to his house and enquired whether anything had been given to the mendicant
He was told We gave him nothing
When Venerable Rohaṇa arrived at his house
Soṇuttara said You received nothing at our house yesterday but you said you received something Are you allowed to lie
Venerable Rohaṇa replied For seven years and ten months I visited your house and did not receive even a polite refusal Pass on but yesterday I was addressed with the words Pass on and it was in reference to those friendly words that I spoke thus
Soṇuttara thought to himself Having received only so little as those friendly words these monks say that they received something So what will they not say when they get some food  He then gave the monk the food that had been prepared for himself and told him that from then on he would obtain alms food every day
The next day Venerable Rohaṇa was invited into the house because Soṇuttara was impressed with his demeanour and from then on Venerable Rohaṇa had his meals in the house
Each day before he left the house after the meal he spoke a few words of the Buddha
Ten months after conception Soṇuttaras wife gave birth to a son who was named Nāgasena When he was seven years old
his father told him Dear Nāgasena you should train yourself in the trainings of a brahmin family
The three Vedas replied Soṇuttara
Well then father I will learn them said Nāgasena
A brahmin teacher was employed
He then asked his father Father is there anything more to be trained in in this brahmin family
Dear Nāgasena there is nothing more to be trained in this is the full extent
At this time Venerable Rohaṇa was living in the Vattaniya Hermitage Knowing with his psychic powers the reasoning in the mind of young Nāgasena Venerable Rohaṇa vanished from the hermitage and appeared in the Kajangala village
Nāgasena saw him approaching from a distance and was pleased and uplifted He thought Perhaps this one who has gone forth might know what is the pith He approached Venerable Rohaṇa and asked Who are you dear sir that you are shaven and wear saffron robes
Boy I am called one who has gone forth
One who has gone forth has to banish evil stains therefore I am called one who has gone forth
When one who has gone forth cuts off the hair and the beard
then there are no impediments such as having to comb and shampoo the hair and having to use perfumes unguents and dyes Furthermore when the hair falls off people are upset and grieved
Beautiful clothes connected with sense pleasures are marks of householders Whatever perils that spring from clothes do not exist for one who wears saffron robes
Yes boy I know the crafts and even the supreme mantra in the world
Yes boy I can
This is not the right time boy We have entered among the houses for alms
Then Nāgasena took Venerable Rohaṇas bowl led him into the house and with his own hands served him sumptuous food After Venerable Rohaṇa had eaten Nāgasena said Good sir teach me the mantra now
Nāgasena then approached his parents for their consent to go forth saying This one who has gone forth will not teach me the supreme mantra in the world unless I go forth in his presence I will learn that mantra after I have gone forth
The parents thinking that their son would return to them after learning the mantra gave him their consent to go forth
Then Venerable Rohaṇa took Nāgasena to the Guarded Plateau and let him go forth in the presence of the arahats
After he received the going forth Venerable Nāgasena told Venerable Rohaṇa I have taken your dress upon myself revered one Now teach me the mantra
Venerable Rohaṇa then wondered what he should teach first the Discourses or the Abhidhamma He decided to teach the Abhidhamma as he thought Venerable Nāgasena was clever and would master it easily
Venerable Nāgasena mastered the whole of the Abhidhamma after only one exposition
He then approached the arahats on the Guarded Plateau and told them he would propound the whole of the Abhidhamma in detail
The arahats asked him to do that
and for seven months Venerable Nāgasena propounded the seven compositions of the Abhidhamma in detail
When Venerable Nāgasena was twenty years of age he was ordained by the arahats on the Guarded Plateau
Early one morning Venerable Nāgasena took his bowl and robe and entered the village together with his preceptor on the alms round On entering the village he thought Empty indeed is my preceptor foolish indeed is my preceptor in that having set aside the rest of the Buddhas word he taught me the Abhidhamma first
Venerable Rohaṇa reading Venerable Nāgasenas mind told him You thought unsuitably Nāgasena That was not suitable for you
Venerable Nāgasena amazed that Venerable Rohaṇa was able to read his mind apologized to him
saying Forgive me revered sir I will not think such thoughts again
Venerable Rohaṇa said I do not forgive you Nāgasena on that promise But there is a town called Sāgala where King Milinda is reigning He is worrying the Order of monks by asking questions and by professing a wrong view If you go there and tame that king and make him gain confidence in our teaching then I will forgive you
Venerable Nāgasena replied Let this one King Milinda be Let all the kings in the whole of India come and ask me questions revered sir and in replying I will mow them all down with my replies if only you will forgive me Venerable Rohaṇa said I do not forgive you Venerable Nāgasena asked Well then revered sir in whose presence shall I spend the three months of the rains
Venerable Nāgasena was assigned to spend the three months of the rains with Venerable Assagutta in the Vattaniya Hermitage Venerable Rohaṇa told him Go Nāgasena approach Venerable Assagutta and in my name salute his feet with your head and say to him My preceptor revered sir salutes your feet with his head and asks if you are free from disease without illness buoyant strong and living in comfort he sent me to stay with you for these three months If he says What is your preceptors name  you should say He is called the Elder Rohaṇa revered sir If he says What is my name  you should say My preceptor knows your name revered sir
Then Venerable Nāgasena said Very well revered sir and respectfully left the presence of Venerable Rohaṇa Venerable Nāgasena then approached the Vattaniya Hermitage went up to Venerable Assagutta paid his respects to him stood on one side and said exactly what he had been instructed to say
Venerable Assagutta questioned him just as Venerable Rohaṇa said he would
Venerable Assagutta then said It is good Nāgasena put away your bowl and robe
Saying Very good revered sir Venerable Nāgasena put away his bowl and robe The next day Venerable Nāgasena swept his teachers cell and set out the water for washing and the tooth cleaners
Venerable Assagutta swept the cell again threw out the water and tooth cleaners and fetched another supply of water and tooth cleaners without making any conversation This went on for seven days On the seventh day he asked Venerable Nāgasena the same questions he had asked on the first day and on receiving the same replies he allowed Venerable Nāgasena to spend the rainy season there
At that time an important woman lay follower had supported Venerable Assagutta for thirty years
At the end of the three months of the rains she approached Venerable Assagutta and asked him whether there was another monk staying with him
When he told her that there was a monk named Nāgasena staying with him
When they went to her house the next day
After the meal Venerable Assagutta asked Venerable Nāgasena to give thanks to the lady and went away
She then told Venerable Nāgasena Dear Nāgasena I am old thank me with a profound talk on the Dhamma
As she was listening and reflecting the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in her thus All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation
With his psychic powers Venerable Assagutta knew what happened and said in approval It is good it is good Nāgasena that by one arrow shot two great persons are pierced
Venerable Nāgasena then went to Venerable Assagutta worshipped him and sat on one side Venerable Assagutta told him Go Nāgasena to Pāṭaliputta Venerable Dhammarakkhita is living in the Asoka Monastery there Master the Buddhas word in his presence
A hundred yojanas Nāgasena
That is a long way revered sir
and it will be hard to get food on the way
Go Nāgasena you will get good alms on the way
Very well revered sir said Venerable Nāgasena He then paid his respects to Venerable Assagutta took his bowl and robe and set out to Pāṭaliputta
When he saw Venerable Nāgasena he greeted him and asked Where are you going my dear 
Because the merchant was impressed with the way Venerable Nāgasena conducted himself he served him a sumptuous meal with his own hands After the meal the merchant took a low seat sat on a side and asked What is your name my dear
I am called Nāgasena householder
My dear do you know the Buddhas word
That is a gain for me my dear for I too am a student of the Abhidhamma Recite some passages from it
Venerable Nāgasena taught the Abhidhamma to the merchant While the merchant was listening to the talk the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him
He then sent the wagons ahead and walked after them When he reached a forked path he told Venerable Nāgasena This dear Nāgasena is the road to the Asoka Monastery Out of compassion please accept this lovely woollen blanket
Pleased and elated the merchant paid his respects to Venerable Nāgasena and went on his way
Venerable Nāgasena went to the Asoka Monastery approached Venerable Dhammarakkhita and told him the reason for his arrival In three months after only one recitation he memorized under the tutelage of Venerable Dhammarakkhita the three divisions of the Buddhas word He spent the next three months reflecting on the meaning of what he had memorized
Venerable Dhammarakkhita then told him As a herdsman tends the cows Nāgasena but others enjoy the products even so are you
Though remembering the word of the Buddha you are not one who partakes of the fruit of recluseship
They told him This King Milinda worries the Order of monks Nāgasena with his talk and countertalk and with the questions he asks
It would be good Nāgasena if you would go to him and tame him
Venerable Nāgasena replied Let this one King Milinda be If all the kings in the whole of India were to come and ask me questions I would mow them all down with my replies Go revered sirs without fear to Sāgala
 His ministers replied There is an Elder named yupāla living at the Sankheyya Hermitage He is skilled in the three divisions of the Buddhas word and in traditional lore Go sire to him and ask your questions
Venerable yupāla said Well then let him come
Accompanied by the Bactrian Greeks King Milinda set out for the Sankheyya Hermitage in a splendid chariot On arrival at the hermitage he exchanged pleasant greetings with Venerable yupāla sat on one side and asked him Of what use to you revered yupāla is the going forth and what is the higher goal for you
 Venerable yupāla replied Going forth is for the sake of faring in the Dhamma faring in spiritual calm
Yes sire there are householders who are farers in the Dhamma farers in spiritual calm When the Blessed One set rolling the Dhamma Wheel in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Benares there was an understanding of the Dhamma by eighteen myriads of Brahmā deities and innumerable other deities All these were householders not those who had gone forth
Well then revered yupāla your going forth is useless It must be because of some evil kamma done in the past that sons of the Sakyans go forth as ascetics and observe the ascetic practices
Revered yupāla those monks who eat but one meal a day are perhaps thieves who formerly robbed others of their food and as a result of that kamma they eat only one meal a day and have no chance to enjoy food constantly That is no virtue on their part no brilliance no holy life
Those monks who live in the open air are perhaps thieves who formerly plundered whole villages and destroyed the homes of others and as a result of that kamma live in the open air and have no chance to enjoy lodgings That is no virtue on their part no brilliance no holy life
Those monks who remain in a sitting position are perhaps thieves who formerly were highwaymen who seized people on the high road bound them and left them sitting there and as a result of that kamma they remain in a sitting position and have no chance of lying on a bed That is no virtue on their part no brilliance no holy life
When the king had spoken Venerable yupāla remained silent and said nothing in reply
Seeing that Venerable yupāla had become silent the king clapped his hands and shouted India is indeed empty India is void indeed There is no ascetic or Brahmin capable of conversing with me to dispel my doubts
As he looked around his company of Bactrian Greeks and saw how fearless and selfpossessed they were he thought to himself Surely there must be some other learned monk who is capable of conversing with me or these Greek Bactrians would not be so confident
He spoke again to the Bactrians Is there my good men some other learned monk who is capable of conversing with me to dispel my doubts
Now at that time Venerable Nāgasena was surrounded by a group of ascetics He was the leader of an Order leader of a group and teacher of a group He was well known famous and highly esteemed by the people He was wise disciplined and confident He was well versed in the Three Collections and was an expert in the nine divisions of the scriptures and he had attained to the perfections He was skilled in the teaching of the Dhamma in answering questions promptly and in getting rid of conflict His enunciation was lovely He was venerated and esteemed by monks and nuns male and female lay devotees kings and kings ministers He was the recipient of the four requisites of robe material alms food lodgings and medicine This Venerable Nāgasena walking on tour among the villages towns and cities arrived in due course at the town of Sāgala
and stayed in the Sankheyya Hermitage with a very large number of monks
A Bactrian officer named Devamantiya told King Milinda There is an Elder named Nāgasena staying in the Sankheyya Hermitage He is wise experienced clever disciplined and confident Go sire and ask Venerable Nāgasena your questions He is capable of conversing with you and can dispel your doubts
He asked Devamantiya Is the bhikkhu Nāgasena really able to converse with me
Devamantiya said Venerable Nāgasena is capable of conversing with the gods even with Great Brahmā so why not with a human being
Then King Milinda told Devamantiya Send a messenger to Venerable Nāgasena to inform him that I wish to call on him
When the message was conveyed
Accompanied by many Bactrians King Milinda went to the Sankheyya Hermitage in a splendid carriage
It is the company of Venerable Nāgasena sire
Thinking Do not let these despise me he told Devamantiya Do not Devamantiya indicate Venerable Nāgasena to me I will recognize him without his being pointed out
At that time Venerable Nāgasena was sitting in the midst of the Order of monks some in front of him and some behind
The king saw Venerable Nāgasena sitting there like a maned lion devoid of fear and dread devoid of terror devoid of trepidation It was by this that he recognized Venerable Nāgasena
and told Devamantiya That one is Nāgasena
Therefore it is said
Milinda uttered these words
King Milinda then approached Venerable Nāgasena exchanged pleasant greetings with him and sat on one side
Venerable Nāgasena greeted the king in return and gladdened his heart
King Milinda asked Venerable Nāgasena How is the revered one known What is your name revered sir
Sire I am known as Nāgasena My companions in the holy life address me as Nāgasena Though parents give such names as Nāgasena or Sūrasena or Vīrasena or Sīhasena this Nāga sena is only a designation a label a concept an expression a mere name because there is no person as such that is found
Then King Milinda spoke thus Good sirs let the Bactrian Greeks and the party of monks hear me This Nāgasena says that no person as such is found
He then spoke thus to Venerable Nāgasena If revered Nāgasena there is no person as such who gives you robes alms food lodgings and medicinal requisites and who makes use of them Who guards morality who meditates who realizes the paths and fruits and attains Nibbāna Who kills living beings who takes what is not given who indulges in sexual misconduct who utters lies and who imbibes intoxi cating drinks Who commits the five evil acts that bear fruit without delay  Therefore there is nothing wholesome or unwholesome there is no one that does or makes another do wholesome or unwholesome acts and there is neither fruit nor result of good or bad deeds Also revered Nāgasena if some one were to kill you there would be no murder You have no teacher no preceptor no ordination
No sire
Are the hairs of the body Nāgasena 
No sire
No sire
Is material form revered sir Nāgasena 
No sire
Or feeling
perception
mental formations
or consciousness  are any of them Nāgasena 
No sire
Then revered sir are material form feeling perception mental formations and consciousness all together Nāgasena 
No sire
I revered sir did not come on foot I came in a chariot
If sire you came in a chariot show me the chariot Is the pole the chariot sire
No revered sir
No revered sir
No revered sir
the flagstaff
No revered sir
No sire
Chariot is only a sound
What then is the chariot you say you came in You sire have spoken a falsehood an untruth There is no chariot You are king over all India a mighty monarch Of whom are you afraid that you speak a lie Let the Bactrian Greeks and all the monks listen to me This King Milinda says I have come by chariot but on being asked to show the chariot he does not show it Is it proper to approve of that
When Venerable Nāgasena had spoken thus all the Bac trian Greeks applauded him and told King Milinda Now sire speak if you can
King Milinda then addressed Venerable Nāgasena I am not revered sir speaking a lie It is because of the pole because of the axle the wheels the body the flagstaff the yoke the reins and because of the goad that chariot exists as a mere designation
It is good sire that you understand a chariot Even so is it for me sire because of the hairs of the head  because of the urine because of material form  because of consciousness that Nāgasena exists as a mere designation However in the ultimate sense there is no person as such that is found
It is wonderful revered Nāgasena it is marvellous Your explanations are brilliant If the Buddha were still here he would applaud It is good it is good Nāgasena
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena will you converse with me
I will converse if you sire will converse in the speech of the learned but if you converse in the speech of kings I will not converse
When the learned are conversing sire there is a turning over and an unravelling of the subject then there is a refuta tion and an acknowledgement of a mistake distinctions and contradistinctions are drawn yet thereby they are not angered It is thus sire that the learned converse
When kings are conversing sire they approve of some mat ter and order punishment for anyone who disagrees with that matter saying Inflict a punishment on him It is thus sire that kings converse
I revered sir will converse in the speech of the learned not in the speech of kings Let the revered one converse unreservedly as he converses with a monk or a novice or a lay follower or with a monastery attendant Let the revered one converse thus let him not be afraid
But what was asked by you sire
After he had thrown away the rubbish he went to the Ganges to wash and seeing the surge of the waves he made his second aspiration May I wherever I am successively reborn until I attain Nibbāna be prompt in saying the right thing instantly and carry all before me like this surge of waves
For the whole period between Kassapa Buddha and his chronological successor Gotama Buddha the monk and the novice wandered from existence to existence among gods and humans
The novice became King Milinda and the monk became Venerable Nāgasena In addition to being successful in the battlefield King Milinda was a scholar who mastered the arts and sciences prevailing during his period
even after the question was asked for the second and third time
Then those arahats vanished from the Himalayas and appeared in the Realm of the Thirtythree Deities
Sakka pleaded with Mahāsena for the second and third time and got the same answer
At that very moment Venerable Rohaṇa emerging from cessation thought The Order is waiting for me Vanishing from the Himalayan mountainslope he appeared before the arahats on the Guarded Plateau
It is good replied Venerable Rohaṇa
Yes brahmin I came was the reply
Next day Soṇuttara sat at the door of his house with the intention of rebuking Venerable Rohaṇa for telling a lie
What father are those trainings asked Nāgasena
and young Nāgasena memorized the three Vedas after a single repetition
Then after serious contemplation Nāgasena concluded Empty indeed are these Vedas void indeed are these Vedas pithless without pith And he was remorseful and displeased
Why are you dear sir called one who has gone forth
Why is your hair dear sir not like that of other men
Why are your clothes dear sir not like those of others
Do you dear sir know the crafts
Will you be able to teach me that dear sir
Well then teach me
Venerable Rohaṇa replied Boy when you are without impediments and have got your parents consent to go forth when you wear the robes as I do then I will teach you
she invited him and Venerable Nāgasena for a meal on the following day
she served the two monks a sumptuous meal with her own hands
Venerable Nāgasena gave his thanks with a profound talk on the Abhidhamma connected with supramundane matters dealing with emptiness
After he had given his thanks and was reflecting on the Dhamma he himself had taught her Venerable Nāgasena aroused insight and was established in the fruit of streamentry as he was sitting on that very seat
How far from here revered sir is Pāṭaliputta
At that time a merchant of Pāṭaliputta was travelling to Pāṭaliputta with many wagons
To Pāṭaliputta householder
That is good my dear we too are going to Pāṭaliputta
It will be convenient for you to go with us
Householder I know the Abhidhamma
Venerable Nāgasena accepted the blanket
Venerable Nāgasena replied Let that be revered sir say no more
That very night Venerable Nāgasena attained arahatship and with it the four analytic knowledges
The arahats who had assembled on the Guarded Plateau sent a message to Venerable Nāgasena Let Nāgasena come we are anxious to see Nāgasena
Venerable Nāgasena vanished from the Asoka Monastery and appeared before the arahats
One lovely moonlit night King Milinda asked his ministers What ascetic or brahmin will be able to converse with me and dispel my doubts
The king then sent a messenger to Venerable yupāla to inform him that he was going to visit him
But is there revered sir any householder at all who is a farer in the Dhamma a farer in spiritual calm
The Bactrians told the king The Elder sire is learned but he is diffident and says nothing in reply
When the king heard the name Nāgasena he suddenly became afraid greatly agitated and his hair stood on end
Venerable Nāgasena said Well then let him come
Venerable Nāgasena was sitting in a pavilion with a large number of monks
When the king saw Venerable Nāgasenas company from a distance he asked Devamantiya Whose is this large company
The king became afraid greatly agitated and his hair stood on end
Very well sire find him yourself said Devamantiya
Devamantiya replied Yes sire that is Nāgasena It is good that you recognized him
The king was glad that he had been able to recognize Venerable Nāgasena without his being pointed out
but once again he became afraid greatly agitated and his hair stood on end
At the sight of Nāgasena wise and pure Tamed in the supreme training
Many are the speakers I have seen Many the discussions I have held
But there was no fear like unto this No terror as is mine today
Surely defeat must be my lot today
And victory for Nāgasena Since my mind is not composed
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling at Rjagaha in Jvaka Komrabhaccas Mango Grove together with a large company of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus
At the time on the fifteenthday Uposatha the fullmoon night of Komud in the fourth month King Ajtasattu of Magadha the son of Queen Videha was sitting on the upper terrace of his palace surrounded by his ministers
There the king uttered the following joyful exclamation How delightful friends is this moonlit night How beautiful is this moonlit night How lovely is this moonlit night How tranquil is this moonlit night How auspicious is this moonlit night
Is there any recluse or brahmin that we could visit tonight who might be able to bring peace to my mind
  Thereupon one of his ministers said Your majesty there is Praa Kassapa the leader of an order the leader of a group the teacher of a group wellknown and famous a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy He is aged long gone forth advanced in years in the last phase of life
Your majesty should visit him
Perhaps he might bring peace to your mind
 Other ministers said Your majesty there is Makkhali Gosla 
But when this was said King Ajtasattu remained silent
All this time Jvaka Komrabhacca sat silently not far from King Ajtasattu
The king then said to him Friend Jvaka why do you keep silent
 Jvaka said Your majesty the Exalted One the Worthy One the perfectly enlightened Buddha together with a large company of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus is now dwelling in our Mango Grove
A favourable report concerning him is circulating thus This Exalted One is a worthy one perfectly enlightened endowed with clear knowledge and conduct accomplished a knower of the world unsurpassed trainer of men to be tamed teacher of gods and men enlightened and exalted
Perhaps if you visit him he might bring peace to your mind
Yes your majesty Jvaka replied He then had five hundred female elephants prepared as well as the kings personal bull elephant and announced to the king Your majesty your elephant vehicles are readyDo as you think fit
King Ajtasattu then had five hundred of his women mounted on the female elephants one on each while he himself mounted his personal bullelephant With his attendants carrying torches he went forth from Rjagaha in full royal splendour setting out in the direction of Jvakas Mango Grove
When King Ajtasattu was not far from the Mango Grove he was suddenly gripped by fear trepidation and terror
Frightened agitated and terrorstricken he said to Jvaka You arent deceiving me are you friend Jvaka
You arent betraying me
You arent about to turn me over to my enemies
How could there be such a large company of bhikkhus twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus without any sound of sneezing or coughing or any noise at all
Do not be afraid great king Do not be afraid
I am not deceiving you your majesty or betraying you or turning you over to your enemies
Go forward great king Go straight forward Those are lamps burning in the pavilion hall
Your majesty should visit the Exalted One
Then get the elephant vehicles prepared friend Jvaka
Then King Ajtasattu having gone by elephant as far as he could dismounted and approached the door of the pavilion hall on foot Having approached he asked Jvaka But where Jvaka is the Exalted One
That is the Exalted One great kingHe is the one sitting against the middle pillar facing east in front of the company of bhikkhus
King Ajtasattu then approached the Exalted One and stood to one side
As he stood there surveying the company of bhikkhus which sat in complete silence as serene as a calm lake he uttered the following joyful exclamation May my son the Prince Udyibhadda enjoy such peace as the company of bhikkhus now enjoys
 Do your thoughts great king follow the call of your affection
Venerable sir I love my son the Prince Udyibhadda
May he enjoy such peace as the company of bhikkhus now enjoys
Do you remember great king ever asking other recluses and brahmins this question
I do remember asking them venerable sir
King Ajtasattu then paid homage to the Exalted One reverently saluted the company of bhikkhus sat down to one side
and said to the Exalted One Venerable sir I would like to ask the Exalted One about a certain point if he would take the time to answer my question
Ask whatever you wish to great king
There are venerable sir various crafts such as elephant trainers horse trainers charioteers archers standard bearers camp marshals commandos high royal officers frontline soldiers bullwarriors military heroes mailclad warriors domestic slaves confectioners barbers bath attendants cooks garlandmakers laundrymen weavers basketmakers potters statisticians accountants and various other crafts of a similar nature All those enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their crafts They obtain happiness and joy themselves and they give happiness and joy to their parents wives and childrenand their friends and colleagues They establish an excellent presentation of gifts to recluses and brahminsleading to heaven ripening in happiness conducing to a heavenly rebirth
Is it possible venerable sir to point out any fruit of recluseship that is similarly visible here and now
If it isnt troublesome for you please tell us how they answered
It is not troublesome for me venerable sir when the Exalted One or anyone like him is present
Then speak great king
One time I approached Prana Kassapa
I then asked him 
When I had finished speaking Praa Kassapa said to me Great king if one acts or induces others to act mutilates or induces others to mutilate tortures or induces others to torture inflicts sorrow or induces others to inflict sorrow oppresses or induces others to oppress intimidates or induces others to intimidate if one destroys life takes what is not given breaks into houses plunders wealth commits burglary ambushes highways commits adultery speaks falsehoodone does no evil
If with a razoredged disk one were to reduce all the living beings on this earth to a single heap and pile of flesh by doing so there would be no evil or outcome of evil
If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing and inducing others to kill mutilating and inducing others to mutilate torturing and inducing others to torture by doing so there would be no evil or outcome of evil
If one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving gifts and inducing others to give gifts making offerings and inducing others to make offerings by doing so there would be no merit or outcome of merit
Thus venerable sir when I asked Prana Kassapa about a visible fruit of recluseship he explained to me the inefficacy of action
Venerable sir just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango in the same way when I asked Prana Kassapa about a visible fruit of recluseship he explained to me the inefficacy of action
Then venerable sir I thought to myself One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or brahmin living in his realm
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Prana Kassapa nor did I reject it
But though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it I still felt dissatisfied yet did not utter a word of dissatisfaction Without accepting his doctrine without embracing it I got up from my seat and left
exchanged greetings and courtesies with him and sat down to one side
By giving selfcontrol restraint and truthful speech there is no merit or outcome of merit
Another time venerable sir I approached Makkhali Gosla
I then asked him if he could point out a fruit of recluseship visible here and now
When I had finished speaking Makkhali Gosla said to me Great king there is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings beings are defiled without any cause or condition
There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings beings are purified without cause or condition
There is no selfdetermination no determination by others no personal determination There is no power no energy no personal strength no personal fortitude
All sentient beings all living beings all creatures all souls are helpless powerless devoid of energy Undergoing transformation by destiny circumstance and nature they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of men
There are fourteen hundred thousand principal modes of origin and six thousand and six hundred  There are five hundred kinds of kamma and five kinds of kamma and three kinds of kamma and full kamma and halfkamma There are sixtytwo pathways sixtytwo subaeons six classes of men eight stages in the life of man fortynine hundred modes of livelihood fortynine hundred kinds of wanderers fortynine hundred abodes of Ngas two thousand faculties three thousand hells thirtysix realms of dust seven spheres of percipient beings seven spheres of nonpercipient beings seven kinds of jointed plants seven kinds of gods seven kinds of human beings seven kinds of demons seven great lakes seven major kinds of knots seven hundred minor kinds of knots seven major precipices seven hundred minor precipices seven major kinds of dreams seven hundred minor kinds of dreams eightyfour hundred thousand great aeons The foolish and the wise having roamed and wandered through these will alike make an end to suffering
Though one might think By this moral discipline or observance or austerity or holy life I will ripen unripened kamma and eliminate ripened kamma whenever it comes upthat cannot be
For pleasure and pain are measured out Samsras limits are fixed and they can neither be shortened nor extended There is no advancing forward and no falling back
Thus venerable sir when I asked Makkhali Gosla about a visible fruit of recluseship he explained to me purification through wandering in samsra
Venerable sir just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango in the same way when I asked Makkhali Gosla about a visible fruit of recluseship he explained to me purification through wandering in sasra
Then venerable sir I thought to myself One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or brahmin living in his realm So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Makkhali Gosla nor did I reject it
But though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it I still felt dissatisfied yet did not utter a word of dissatisfaction
Without accepting his doctrine without embracing it I got up from my seat and left
exchanged greetings and courtesies with him and sat down to one side
Just as when a ball of string is thrown it rolls along unwinding until it comes to its end in the same way the foolish and the wise roam and wander  after which they make an end to suffering
Another time venerable sir I approached Ajita Kesakambala
I then asked him if he could point out a fruit of recluseship visible here and now
When I had finished speaking Ajita Kesakambala said to me Great king there is no giving no offering no liberality There is no fruit or result of good and bad actionsThere is no present world no world beyond no mother no father no beings who have taken rebirth In the world there are no recluses and brahmins of right attainment and right practice who explain this world and the world beyond on the basis of their own direct knowledge and realization
A person is composed of the four primary elements When he dies the earth returns to and merges with the body of earth the water returns to and merges with the body of water the fire returns to and merges with the body of fire the air returns to and merges with the body of air His sense faculties pass over into space
Four men carry the corpse along on a bier
His eulogies are sounded until they reach the charnel ground
His bones turn pigeoncolored His meritorious offerings end in ashes
The practice of giving is a doctrine of fools
Those who declare that there is speak only false empty prattle
With the breaking up of the body the foolish and the wise alike are annihilated and utterly perishThey do not exist after death
Thus venerable sir when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about a visible fruit of recluseship he explained to me annihilation
Venerable sir just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango in the same way when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about a visible fruit of recluseship he explained to me annihilation
Then venerable sir I thought to myself One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or brahmin living in his realm
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Ajita Kesakambala nor did I reject it
But though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it I still felt dissatisfied yet did not utter a word of dissatisfactionWithout accepting his doctrine without embracing it I got up from my seat and left
exchanged greetings and courtesies with him and sat down to one side
Another time venerable sir I approached Pakudha Kaccyana
I then asked him if he could point out a fruit of recluseship visible here and now
When I had finished speaking Pakudha Kaccyana said to me Great king there are seven bodies that are unmade unfashioned uncreated without a creator barren stable as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
They do not alter do not change do not obstruct one another they are incapable of causing one another either pleasure or pain or both pleasure and pain
What are the seven
The body of earth the body of water the body of fire the body of air pleasure pain and the soul as the seventh
Among these there is no killer nor one who causes killing no hearer nor one who causes hearing no cognizer nor one who causes cognition
If someone were to cut off head with a sharp sword he would not be taking lifeThe sword merely passes through the space between the seven bodies
Thus venerable sir when I asked Pakudha Kaccyana about a visible fruit of recluseship he answered me in a completely irrelevant way
Venerable sir just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango in the same way when I asked Pakudha Kaccyana about a visible fruit of recluseship he answered me in a completely irrelevant way
Then venerable sir I thought to myself One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or brahmin living in his realm
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Pakudha Kaccyana nor did I reject it But though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it I still felt dissatisfied yet did not utter a word of dissatisfaction Without accepting his doctrine without embracing it I got up from my seat and left
exchanged greetings and courtesies with him and sat down to one side
Another time venerable sir I approached Nigantha Ntaputta
I then asked him if he could point out a fruit of recluseship visible here and now
When I had finished speaking Nigantha Ntaputta said to me Great king a Nigantha a knotless one is restrained with a fourfold restraint
How so
Herein great king a Nigantha is restrained with regard to all water he is endowed with the avoidance of all evil he is cleansed by the avoidance of all evil he is suffused with the avoidance of all evil
Venerable sir just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango in the same way when I asked Nigantha Ntaputta about a visible fruit of recluseship he explained to me the fourfold restraint
Then venerable sir I thought to myself One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or brahmin living in his realm
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Nigantha Ntaputta nor did I reject it
But though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it I still felt dissatisfied yet did not utter a word of dissatisfactionWithout accepting his doctrine without embracing it I got up from my seat and left
exchanged greetings and courtesies with him and sat down to one side
Great king when a Nigantha is restrained with this fourfold restraint he is called a knotless one who is selfperfected selfcontrolled and selfestablished
Thus venerable sir when I asked Nigantha Ntaputta about a visible fruit of recluseship he explained to me the fourfold restraint
Another time venerable sir I approached Sañjaya Belatthaputta
I then asked him if he could point out any fruit of recluseship visible here and now
When I had finished speaking Sañjaya Belatthaputta said to me If you ask me A  Is there a world beyond  If I thought that there is a world beyond I would declare to you There is a world beyond
But I do not say It is this way nor It is that way nor It is otherwise I do not say It is not so nor do I say It is not not so
Similarly you might ask me the following questions A  Is there no world beyond   Is it that there both is and is not a world beyond   Is it that there neither is nor is not a world beyond  B  Are there beings who have taken rebirth   Are there no beings who have taken rebirth   Is it that there both are and are not beings who have taken rebirth   Is it that there neither are nor are not beings who have taken rebirth  C  Is there fruit and result of good and bad actions   Is there no fruit and result of good and bad actions   Is it that there both are and are not fruit and result of good and bad actions   Is it that there neither are nor are not fruit and result of good and bad actions  D  Does the Tathgata exist after death   Does the Tathgata not exist after death   Does the Tathgata both exist and not exist after death   Does the Tathgata neither exist nor not exist after death  If I thought that it was so I would declare to you It is so
But do I not say It is this way nor It is that way nor It is otherwise I do not say It is not so nor do I say It is not not so
Thus venerable sir when I asked Sañjaya Belatthaputta about a visible fruit of recluseship he answered me evasively
Venerable sir just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango in the same way when I asked Sañjaya Belatthaputta about a visible fruit of recluseship he answered me evasively
But though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it I still felt dissatisfied yet did not utter a word of dissatisfaction Without accepting his doctrine without embracing it I got up from my seat and left
exchanged greetings and courtesies with him and sat down to one side
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Sañjaya Belatthaputta nor did I reject it
So venerable sir I ask the Exalted One There are venerable sir various crafts such as elephant trainers horse trainers charioteers archers standard bearers camp marshals commandos high royal officers frontline soldiers bullwarriors military heroes mailclad warriors domestic slaves confectioners barbers bath attendants cooks garlandmakers laundrymen weavers basketmakers potters statisticians accountants and various other crafts of a similar nature All those enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their craft They obtain happiness and joy themselves and they give happiness and joy to their parents their wives and children their friends and colleagues They establish an excellent presentation of gifts to recluses and brahminsleading to heaven ripening in happiness conducing to a heavenly rebirth
Is it possible venerable sir to point out any fruit of recluseship that is similarly visible here and now
It is great king
But let me question you about this matter
Answer as you think fit
What do you think great king Suppose you have a slave a workman who rises up before you retires after you does whatever you want acts always for your pleasure speaks politely to you and is ever on the lookout to see that you are satisfied
The thought might occur to him It is wonderful and marvellous the destiny and result of meritorious deeds
For this King Ajtasattu is a human being and I too am a human being
I could be like him if I were to do meritorious deeds
Let me then shave off my hair and beard put on saffron robes and go forth from home to homelessness
Having gone forth he dwells restrained in body speech and mind content with the simplest food and shelter delighting in solitude
Suppose your men were to report all this to you
Would you say Bring that man back to me men Let him again become my slave my workman rising before me retiring after me doing whatever I want acting always for my pleasure speaking politely to me ever on the lookout to see that I am satisfied
Certainly not venerable sir
Rather we would pay homage to him rise up out of respect for him invite him to a seat and invite him to accept from us robes almsfood dwelling and medicinal requirementsAnd we would provide him righteous protection defense and security
What do you think great king If such is the case is there or is there not a visible fruit of recluseship
There certainly is venerable sir
yet King Ajtasattu enjoys himself fully endowed and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasure as if he were a god
while I am his slave his workman rising before him retiring after him doing whatever he wantsacting always for his pleasure speaking politely to him ever on the lookout to see that he is satisfied
After some time he shaves off his hair and beard puts on saffron robes and goes forth from home to homelessness
This great king is the first fruit of recluseship visible here and now that I point out to you
Is it possible venerable sir to point out some other fruit of recluseship visible here and now
It is great king
But let me question you about this matter
Answer as you think fit
What do you think great king Suppose there is a farmer a householder who pays taxes to maintain the royal revenue
The thought might occur to him It is wonderful and marvellous the destiny and result of meritorious deeds
For this King Ajtasattu is a human being and I too am a human being
Yet King Ajtasattu enjoys himself fully endowed and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasure as if he were a god
I could be like him if I were to do meritorious deeds
Let me then shave off my hair and beard put on saffron robes and go forth from home to homelessness
Having gone forth he dwells restrained in body speech and mind content with the simplest food and shelter delighting in solitude
Suppose your men were to report all this to you
Would you say Bring that man back to me men Let him again become a farmer a householder who pays taxes to maintain the royal revenue
Certainly not venerable sir
Rather we would pay homage to him rise up out of respect for him invite him to a seat and invite him to accept from us robes almsfood dwelling and medicinal requirementsAnd we would provide him with righteous protection defense and security
What do you think great king
If such is the case is there or is there not a visible fruit of recluseship
There certainly is venerable sir
while I am a farmer a householder who pays taxes to maintain the royal revenue
After some time he abandons his accumulation of wealth be it large or small abandons his circle of relatives be it large or small he shaves off his hair and beard puts on saffron robes and goes forth from home to homelessness
This great king is the second fruit of recluseship visible here and now that I point out to you
Is it possible venerable sir to point out any other fruit of recluseship visible here and now more excellent and sublime than these two fruits
It is possible
Listen great king and attend carefully I will speak
The Exalted One spoke Herein great king a Tathgata arises in the world a worthy one perfectly enlightened endowed with clear knowledge and conduct accomplished a knower of the world unsurpassed trainer of men to be tamed teacher of gods and men enlightened and exalted
Having realized by his own direct knowledge this world with its gods its Mras and its Brahms this generation with its recluses and brahmins its rulers and people he makes it known to others
He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end possessing meaning and phrasing he reveals the holy life that is fully complete and purified
A householder or a householders son or one born into some other family hears the Dhamma
Endowed with such faith he reflects The household life is crowded a path of dust Going forth is like the open air
It is not easy for one dwelling at home to lead the perfectly complete perfectly purified holy life bright as a polished conch
Let me then shave off my hair and beard put on saffron robes and go forth from home to homelessness
When he has thus gone forth he lives restrained by the restraint of the Ptimokkha possessed of proper behavior and resort Having taken up the rules of training he trains himself in them seeing danger in the slightest faults He comes to be endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action his livelihood is purified and he is possessed of moral discipline He guards the doors of his sense faculties is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension and is content
Yes venerable sir King Ajtasattu replied to the Exalted One
Having heard the Dhamma he gains faith in the Tathgata
After some time he abandons his accumulation of wealth be it large or small he abandons his circle of relatives be it large or small he shaves off his hair and beard puts on saffron robes and goes forth from home to homelessness

When the Exalted One had finished speaking King Ajtasattu said to him Excellent venerable sir Excellent venerable sir
Just as if one were to turn upright what had been turned upside down or to reveal what was hidden or to point out the right path to one who was lost or to bring a lamp into a dark place so that those with keen sight could see forms in the same way venerable sir the Exalted One has revealed the Dhamma in numerous ways
I go for refuge to the Exalted One to the Dhamma and to the Bhikkhu Sangha
Let the Exalted One accept me as a lay follower gone for refuge from this day onwards as long as I live
Venerable sir a transgression overcame me I was so foolish so deluded so unskillful that for the sake of rulership I took the life of my own father a righteous man and a righteous king
Let the Exalted One acknowledge my transgression as a transgression for the sake of my restraint in the future
But since you have seen your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it according to the Dhamma we acknowledge it
For great king this is growth in the discipline of the Noble One that a person sees his transgression as a transgression makes amends for it according to the Dhamma and achieves restraint in the future
Do whatever seems fit great king
Soon after King Ajtasattu had left the Exalted One addressed the bhikkhus This king bhikkhus has ruined himself
Bhikkhus if this king had not taken the life of his father a righteous man and a righteous king then in this very seat there would have arisen in him the dustfree stainless eye of Dhamma
Elated in mind the bhikkhus rejoiced in the Exalted Ones word
Indeed great king a transgression overcame you You were so foolish so deluded so unskillful that for the sake of rulership you took the life of your father a righteous man and a righteous king
When this was said King Ajtasattu said to the Exalted One Now venerable sir we must goWe have many tasks and duties
Then King Ajtasattu rejoiced in the word of the Exalted One and thanked him for it Rising from his seat he paid homage to the Exalted One circumambulated him and departed
he has injured himself
Thus spoke the Exalted One
The novice became afraid and crying he threw away the rubbish while making his first aspiration Through this meritorious deed of throwing away the rubbish may I wherever I am successively reborn until I attain Nibbāna be of great might and glory like the midday sun
He never got complete satisfaction from any of the ascetics or brahmins he approached and in despair he said India is indeed empty India is void indeed There is no ascetic or brahmin able to converse with me to dispel my doubts
when Soṇuttara was returning home after some business he saw Venerable Rohaṇa on the opposite side of the road and asked him Did you mendicant come to our house
But when this was said King Ajtasattu remained silent
Perhaps he might bring peace to your mind
Your majesty should visit him
Ajita Kesakambala 
Pakudha Kaccyana 
Sañjaya Belahaputta 
Nigaha Ntaputta the leader of an order the leader of a group the teacher of a group wellknown and famous a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy He is aged long gone forth advanced in years in the last phase of life
if he could point out any fruit of recluseship visible here and now
Then venerable sir I thought to myself One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or brahmin living in his realm
He would reflect on this
He would reflect on this
After some time he would be released from prison safe and secure with no loss of his possessions
He would reflect on this
He would reflect on this
After some time he would cross over the desert and arrive safely at a village which is safe and free from danger
Again great king suppose a man with wealth and possessions were travelling along a desert road where food was scarce and dangers were many
and as a result he would become glad and experience joy
He would reflect on this
With the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he understands how beings fare according to their kamma
In the same way great king when his mind is thus concentrated pure and bright  the bhikkhu directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings

For wherever noble individuals live even at a distance they are unified through the common harmony of their excellent qualities
In order to gain proficiency with regard to going for refuge the following method of exposition should be understood the refuge the going for refuge the one who goes for refuge the analysis of going for refuge the fruit of going for refuge the defilement and the breach
As to the refuge  it slays  thus it is a refuge
The meaning is that for those who have gone for refuge it kills and destroys their fear terror and suffering and the affliction of a bad destination Refuge is a designation for the Triple Gem
the Dhamma does so by enabling them to cross the desert of existence and by giving them comfort and the Sagha by making even small religious acts yield the gain of abundant fruit
Therefore in this way too the Triple Gem is a refuge
The going for refuge is an act of consciousness which through confidence in and reverence for the Triple Gem is devoid of defilements and occurs in the mode of regarding the Triple Gem as the supreme resort
The one who goes for refuge is a being endowed with that 
The meaning is one who approaches with the aforesaid act of consciousness thus This Triple Gem is my refuge this is my supreme resort
The supramundane going for refuge is achieved at the moment of the path by those who have seen the truths  through the eradication of the defilements of the going for refuge by way of its object it takes Nibbna as its objects and by way of its task it succeeds in regard to the entire Triple Gem
The mundane going for refuge is achieved by worldlings through the suppression of the defilements of the going for refuge by way of its object it takes as its object the excellent qualities of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sagha
In denotation it is the gaining of faith in the objects of faiththe Buddha etcand right view rooted in faith referred to as the straightening of view among the ten bases of meritorious activity
This mundane going for refuge occurs in four ways by selfsurrender by taking the Triple Gem as ones supreme resort by the acceptance of pupilship and by homage by prostration
Therein selfsurrender is the relinquishing of oneself to the Triple Gem expressed thus From today onward I surrender myself to the Buddha to the Dhamma and to the Sagha
Thus may you know me
 The acceptance of pupilship is expressed thus From today onward I am a pupil of the Buddha a pupil of the Dhamma a pupil of the Sagha Thus may you know me
 Homage by prostration is the quality of deepest humility towards the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sagha expressed thus From today onward I do homage rise up in respect show reverential salutation and perform the proper duties only towards the three objects of refuge the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sagha Thus may you know me
 Refuge is taken by acting in any of these four ways
Further selfsurrender may be understood through such expressions as the following I relinquish myself to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sagha I relinquish my life to them My self has been relinquished to them my life has been relinquished to them Until the end of my life I go for refuge to the Buddha The Buddha is my refuge my shelter my protection
I would see the Teacher the Exalted One I would see the Accomplished One the Exalted One I would see the Perfectly Enlightened One the Exalted One  
From village to village And town to town Ill wander
Homage by prostration may be illustrated thus Then the brahmin Brahmyu rose up from his seat arranged his upper robe over one shoulder bowed down with his head at the Exalted Ones feet and kissed the Exalted Ones feet with his mouth stroked them with his hands and declared his name I am the brahmin Brahmyu honorable Gotama I am the brahmin Brahmyu honorable Gotama  
Homage by prostration may be of four kinds that shown towards a relative that motivated by fear that shown towards a teacher and that based on esteem for spiritual worthiness
Of these homage by prostration based on esteem for spiritual worthiness constitutes the going for refuge not the others
For one takes refuge only by way of the highest and breaks it only by way of the highest
Therefore if a member of the Skya or Koliya clan venerates the Buddha thinking He is our relative he has not thereby taken refuge
Or if one venerates the Buddha out of fear thinking The recluse Gotama is worshipped by kings and has great power if I do not venerate him he may harm me one has not taken refuge
Or upon remembering something one learned from the Exalted One during the time he was a bodhisatta or some mundane instruction one received from him after he became a Buddha
But if one venerates the Buddha thinking He is the most worthy being in the world one has taken refuge
Conversely if a man or woman lay follower who has taken refuge venerates a renunciant belonging to another sect thinking He is my relative his going for refuge is not broken much less then is it broken in venerating one who is not a renunciant
So too the refuge is not broken if one venerates a king out of fear
The fruit of going for refuge should be understood as follows In the case of the supramundane going for refuge that is the noble path the four fruits of recluseship are the resultantfruit  the destruction of all suffering is the benefitfruit
One who has gone for refuge to The Buddha Dhamma and Sagha
For this is said It is impossible it cannot come to pass that an individual who has attained to right view might approach any formation as permanent any formation as pleasurable any phenomenon as self It is impossible it cannot come to pass that he might deprive his mother of life that he might deprive his father of life that he might deprive an arahat of life that with a mind of hatred he might shed a Tathgatas blood that he might create a schism in the Sagha that he might point to someone other as his teacher This is impossible 
The fruit of the mundane going for refuge is the attainment of a existence and the attainment of wealth
For this is said
Having abandoned the human body They fill up the order of the gods 
It is also said Then Sakka the king of the gods together with eightythousand deities approached venerable Mahmoggallna  who told him It is good O lord of the gods to go for refuge to the Buddha
Because of going for refuge to the Buddha some beings here with the breakup of the body reappear after death in a good destination in a heavenly world They surpass the other gods in ten respects in divine life span in divine beauty in divine pleasure in divine fame in divine sovereignty and in divine forms sounds smells tastes and tangibles 
The same method applies in going for refuge to the Dhamma and the Sagha
Further the distinctive fruit of going for refuge should be understood by way of the Velma Sutta etc where the Buddha says that going for refuge is more fruitful than the most lavish acts of generosity 
In regard to defilement the mundane going for refuge is defiled by ignorance doubt misunderstanding etc concerning the three objects of faith thus it does not become very luminous and pervasive
But there is no defilement of the supramundane going for refuge
The breach of the mundane going for refuge is of two kinds blameworthy and blameless
The blameworthy comes about when one surrenders oneself etc to another teacher etc this has undesirable fruits
The blameless occurs when one dies because this does not produce kammic results it is without fruit
But there is no breach of the supramundane going for refuge
Thus the defilement and the breach of the going for refuge should be understood
Let the Exalted One accept me as a lay follower The meaning is Let the Exalted One accept me thus He is a lay follower let him know me thus
Why is he called lay follower
What is his moral discipline
What is his livelihood
What is his failure
What is his success
Therein who is a lay follower
Any householder who has gone for refuge
Thus it is said Mahnma when one has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sagha
Why is he called lay follower Because he has drawn near to the Triple Gem
For he draws near to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saghathus he is a lay follower 
What is his moral discipline The five abstinences
As it is said Mahnma when a lay follower abstains from the destruction of life from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from false speech and from fermented and distilled intoxicants which are the basis for heedlessness to this extent a lay follower is morally disciplined 
What is his livelihood Having abandoned five kind of wrong trade he earns his living righteously in accordance with the Dhamma
For this is said Bhikkhus these five trades should not be engaged in by a lay follower
What five
Trading in weapons trading in beings trading in meat trading in intoxicants and trading in poisons
These are the five trades which should not be engaged in by a lay follower 
What is his failure Failure in his moral discipline and in his livelihood this is his failure
This refers to the five qualities such as lack of faith etc
What five
He lacks faith he is immoral he believes in superstitious omens he relies on omens not on kamma he seeks spiritually worthy persons outside of here that is outside the Buddhas dispensation and he shows honor there first 
What is his success Success in his moral discipline and success in his livelihood this is his success So too are the five qualities such as faith etc which make him a gem etc
As it is said Bhikkhus possessed of five qualities a lay follower is a gemlike lay follower a red lotuslike lay follower a white lotus like lay follower
What five
He has faith he is morally disciplined he does not believe in superstitious omens he relies on kamma not on omens he does not seek spiritually worthy persons outside of here and he shows honor here first 
As long as my life continues for so long let the Exalted One accept me and know me as a steward as a lay follower who has gone for refuge through the threefold going for refuge and does not recognize anyone else as the Teacher
If someone were to cut off my head with a sharp sword even then I would not deny the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sagha
This great king is called growth in the discipline of the Noble One in the dispensation of the Exalted Buddha
Seeing ones transgression as a transgression making amends for it according to the Dhamma and achieving restraint in the future
Having circumambulated the Exalted One three times he joined his hands in reverential salutation and placed them on his head and retreated facing the Exalted One as long as he was in his range of sight When he faded from sight the king paid homage with all his limbs on the ground and departed
This is meant This king bhikkhus has ruined himself injured himself and has destroyed his support He has ruined himself by himself alone in such a way that he has no support
It is dustfree because it is devoid of the dust of lust etc
but here only for the path of stream entry
This is meant  If he had not murdered his father while sitting here now in this very seat he would have attained the path of streamentry But because of associating with evil friends Devadatta and his followers an obstacle has arisen for him
Though such is the case he has approached the Tathgata and gone for refuge to the Triple Gem Therefore just as someone who has killed a man might be freed by paying a fine so through the greatness of my dispensation this king having been born in the Hell of Copper Cauldrons after falling downwards for thirty thousand years until he reaches the bottom and rising upwards for thirty thousand years until he again reaches the top will be freed This it is said was spoken by the Exalted One though it has not been included in the text
Having heard this sutta did the king gain any benefit
He gained great benefit
For from the time he killed his father he did not get any sleep either by night or by day But from the time he approached the Teacher and heard this sweet nutritious teaching of the Dhamma he was able to sleep
He showed great honor to the Triple Gem
There was no one equal to this king in possessing the faith of a worldling
And in the future he will become a paccekabuddha named Vijita and attain final Nibbna
Thus spoke the Exalted One
Elated in mind the bhikkhus rejoiced in the Exalted Ones words
Or alternatively the Buddha slays the fear of beings by promoting their welfare and by preventing their harm
In the analysis of the going for refuge the going for refuge is twofold the supramundane and the mundane
Taking the Triple Gem as ones supreme resort is expressed thus From today onward the Buddha is my supreme resort the Dhamma is my supreme resort the Sagha is my supreme resort
The acceptance of pupilship may be understood through the example of Mahkassapas going for refuge 
Taking the Triple Gem as ones supreme resort may be understood through the example of the going for refuge of lavaka etc 
Venerating the Enlightened One And his welltaught Dhamma 
if one venerates him thinking He is my teacher one has not taken refuge
thinking He is worshipped by all the country if I do not venerate him he may harm me
Nor if one venerates a sectarian teacher from whom one has learned a craft thinking He is my teacher Thus the analysis of the going for refuge should be understood
For this is said
Sees with perfect wisdom The Four Noble Truths
Suffering the rise of suffering The transcending of suffering
This is the secure refuge This is the supreme refuge
By relying on this refuge One is released from all suffering 
And the Noble Eightfold Path That leads to the end of suffering
Further the benefitfruit of the going for refuge may be understood by way of not approaching any formations as permanent etc
Those who have gone for refuge to the Buddha Do not go to the plane of misery
Here in order to gain proficiency with regard to the subject of the lay follower  the following miscellany should be understood Who is a lay follower
to this extent one is a lay follower 
Further that which makes him an outcast stained and repulsive that too is his failure
As it is said Bhikkhus possessed of five qualities a lay follower is an outcast lay follower a stained lay follower a repulsive lay follower
Having thus gone for refuge by selfsurrender the king spoke this revealing the crime he had committed
What
and stainless because of the absence of the stain of lust etc
It is the eye of Dhamma in the sense that it is the eye seeing into phenomena  or the eye made by Dhamma  In other places this is a designation for the three lower paths
It has confidence in the Triple Gem thus The Exalted One is perfectly enlightened the Dhamma is wellexpounded the Sagha is practicing well And it has reverence for the Triple Gem as well
Through that confidence and reverence it is devoid of defilements that is it has shaken off such evil states as doubt delusion and lack of faith etc
It regards the Triple Gem as the supreme resort the Triple Gem is its supreme resort supreme goal protection and shelter
Here by mentioning confidence the commentator indicates the mundane going for refuge
for that is dominated by faith not by knowledge
by mentioning reverence he indicates the supra mundane going for refuge
for noble ones regard the Triple Gem with reverence through direct knowledge of its excellent qualities
Therefore through such confidence the defilements are removed by way of abandonment by factor substitution through such reverence they are removed by way of abandonment by eradicating the causes of irreverence
Regarding the Triple Gem as the supreme resort refers to all four kinds of going for refuge to be explained below
Or else without distinction either term confidence or reverencecan signify both the mundane and supramundane going for refuge For the mention of confidence can imply both the unwavering confidence of the supramundane and the confidence still subject to wavering of the mundane Similarly the mention of reverence can imply both mundane and supramundane reverence
 An act of consciousness  the going for refuge is a consciousness conjoined with its associated phenomena such as faith and wisdom etc occurring in such a mode
It takes Nibbna as its object when this is said it is indicated that in denotation the achievement of the four truths or the knowledge of the path is itself the supramundane going for refuge
For therein with the achievement of the four truths the defilements of the going for refuge are eradicated by way of the breakthrough of abandonment The Dhamma as Nibbna accomplishes the going for refuge when it is penetrated by way of the breakthrough of realization and the Dhamma as the path does so when it is penetrated by way of the breakthrough of development
The excellent qualities of the Buddha which come into range of disciples accomplish the going for refuge when they are penetrated by way of the breakthrough of full understanding so too the excellent qualities of the noble Sagha Thus he says it succeeds in regard to the entire Triple Gem
Right view rooted in faith right view preceded by the aforesaid faith by seeing methodically with mundane understanding that the Buddha is well enlightened that the Dhamma is well taught and that the Sagha is practicing well
By this phrase the commentator shows that the mundane going for refuge is wisdom having the aforesaid characteristic and with faith as its decisive support
By the phrase the gaining of faith he shows the going for refuge dissociated from knowledge as in the case of children who are prompted by their parents etc by the phrase right view he shows the going for refuge associated with knowledge
The king has ruined himself by ruining the wholesome roots he achieved for himself in the past which might have brought their results in this present existence itself He has injured himself by injuring those wholesome roots By these two terms which are synonymous the Buddha shows his criminal action
Since his own support his wholesome root does not remain the king has ruined himself by himself alone
it is called support because it supports the descent into fixity of rightness  Through his criminal action he has broken and destroyed his achievement of wholesome supporting conditions thus he has destroyed his support
Support is one in meaning with root
To show the ruin and injury through the destruction of his supportthat is of his wholesome rootsit is said  has destroyed his support
The eye seeing into phenomena the eye is the path of streamentry so called because it has the meaning of seeing
phenomena are the phenomena of the Four Noble Truths or the phenomena of the three lower paths
The eye made by Dhamma the eye produced by Dhamma that is by the Dhamma of serenity and insight
Further as the word made is used with the meaning of consisting of the Pali phrase can mean the eye made of Dhamma that is consisting of the three aggregates of Dhammamoral discipline concentration and wisdom
The Hell of Copper Cauldrons for the beings who are to experience this realm a large cauldron made of copper is produced by the power of their kamma
To go downwards to the bottom and upwards to the top takes altogether sixty thousand years
Other beings fall downwards and rise upwards again and again and are tortured there for many hundred thousands of years But not so this king He will fall downwards and rise upwards only one time in the way described and having been tortured for only sixty thousand years he will be freed
Again when the Blessed One delivered the Mahāsamaya Discourse the Discourse on the Great Blessings the Discourse on Even Mind the Exhortation to Rāhula and the Parābhava Discourse there was an understanding of the Dhamma by innumerable deities All these were householders not those who had gone forth
Now at that time Yameḷu and Tekula were the names of two monks who were brothers brahmins by birth with lovely voices with lovely enunciation
They approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distance
As they were sitting down at a respectful distance these monks spoke thus to the Lord At present Lord monks of various names various clans various social strata have gone forth from various families
these corrupt the speech of the Awakened One in his own dialect
Now we Lord give the speech of the Awakened One in metrical form
The Awakened One the Lord rebuked them saying How can you foolish men speak thus Now we Lord give the speech of the Awakened One in metrical form
It is not foolish men for pleasing those who are not pleased  And having rebuked them having given reasoned talk he addressed the monks saying  Monks the speech of the Awakened One should not be given in metrical form
Whoever should give it there is an offence of wrongdoing
I allow you monks to learn the speech of the Awakened One according to his own dialect
Is it revered sir the hairs of the head that are Nāgasena
If you say Cofarers in the holy life address me as Nāgasena what is this Nāgasena
Are the nails  The teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver membranes spleen lungs intestines mesentery stomach faeces brain bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears lymph saliva mucus joint fluid or urine  are any of them Nāgasena 
Well then revered sir is Nāgasena apart from material form feeling perception mental formations and consciousness 
No sire
Revered sir though I have been asking you repeatedly I do not see this Nāgasena
Nāgasena is only a sound
For who here is Nāgasena You revered sir have spoken a falsehood an untruth There is no Nāgasena
Venerable Nāgasena then spoke thus You sire have been delicately nurtured as fits your noble birth If sire you walk at noontime on the hot scorching ground trampling on sharp grit pebbles and sand your feet will hurt you your body will be tired your mind will be disturbed and you will suffer bodily pain Now did you come on foot or in a vehicle 
Is the axle the chariot
Are the wheels the chariot
Is the body of the chariot 
the yoke
the reins
the goad  are any of them the chariot
No revered sir
Then sire are the pole the axle the wheels the body the flagstaff the yoke the reins the goad all together the chariot
Well then sire is the chariot apart from the pole the axle the wheels the body the flagstaff the yoke the reins and the goad
Sire though I have been asking you repeatedly I do not see this chariot
This sire was spoken by the nun Vajirā in the presence of the Blessed One 
Just as when the parts are rightly set The word chariot is spoken
So when there are the aggregates It is the convention to say a being
How revered Nāgasena do the learned converse
And how revered sir do kings converse
It is well sire
I have a question to ask you revered Nāgasena
Ask it sire
I have asked it revered sir
That has been answered sire
What have you answered revered sir
On the following day Venerable Nāgasena went to the palace with a large number of monks
King Milinda with his own hands served the monks a sumptuous meal and presented each monk with a pair of woven cloths and Venerable Nāgasena with a set of three robes Then he said Revered Nāgasena sit down here with ten monks and let the rest go away
The king took a low seat sat at a respectable distance and spoke thus Revered Nāgasena what shall we discuss
Of what use to you revered Nāgasena is the going forth and what is the highest goal for you
No sire Some go forth for such a goal but others go forth from fear of kings or from fear of thieves or because they have debts and others go forth for the sake of a livelihood But those who go forth rightly go forth for such a goal
I was a boy sire when I went forth so I did not know that I was going forth for this goal but it occurred to me thus These recluses sons of the Sakyans are learned and will make me train myself Now that I have been trained by them I know and see that going forth is for this goal
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena is there anyone who when dead does not take rebirth
Some take rebirth some do not
One who has defilements takes rebirth sire one who is without defilements does not take rebirth
If I should have clinging sire I will take rebirth but if I am without clinging I will not take rebirth
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena does he who does not take rebirth not take rebirth because of proper attention
Sire it is because of proper attention and it is because of wisdom and it is because of other wholesome mental states
No sire attention is one thing wisdom is another Goats sheep cows buffaloes camels and donkeys have attention but they do not have wisdom
King Milinda said What is the distinguishing mark of attention and what is the distinguishing mark of wisdom
Examination is the distinguishing mark of attention and cutting off is the distinguishing mark of wisdom
How is this so Make a simile
Do you know about barleyreapers sire
Revered sir grasping a handful of barley in the left hand and a sickle in the right they cut it off with the sickle
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena when you said And because of other wholesome mental stateswhich are these wholesome mental states
Sire they are morality faith energy mindfulness and concentration
The distinguishing mark of morality sire is that it is the basis of all wholesome mental states namely the spiritual faculties the powers the factors of enlightenment the path the foundations of mindfulness the right efforts the bases of psychic power the jhānas the deliverances and concentration In one who has morality sire none of these wholesome mental states decreases
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of faith
Faith sire has tranquillizing as a distinguishing mark and also leaping forward as a distinguishing mark
When faith is arising sire it extirpates the hindrances when the mind is without the hindrances it is clear pure and serene
Thus it is sire that tranquillizing is a distinguishing mark of faith
Yet the king would ask his men to bring him some drinking water
The king might have a waterclearing gem So the men cast that waterclearing gem in the water Immediately the various water plants disappear the mud subsides and the water becomes clear pure and serene
Then the men offer the drinking water to the king
Sire like the water is the mind like those people is the earnest student of mental training like the water plants and the mud are the hindrances like the waterclearing gem is faith
Just as the water plants disappear and the mud subsides as soon as the waterclearing gem is thrown in the water and the water becomes clear pure and serene even so sire faith as it is uprising extirpates the hindrances and the mind that is free from the hindrances is pure clean and serene It is thus sire that tranquillizing is a distinguishing mark of faith
How revered sir is leaping forward a distinguishing mark of faith
As sire one who is devoted to mental training on seeing that the minds of others are freed leaps forward after the fruit of streamentry or the fruit of oncereturning or the fruit of nonreturning or after arahatship and performs mental training for the attainment of the unattained for mastery of the unmastered and for realization of the unrealized
Suppose sire as a result of heavy rain a river would swell overflowing both banks Then a great crowd of people were to come but not knowing either the width or depth of that river might stand terrified and hesitant on the bank Then a strong man comes along He knows his own power and strength He ties on his loincloth tightly and leaping into the water crosses over On seeing that he had crossed over the great crowd of people too would cross over
Even so sire one who is devoted to mental training on seeing that the minds of others are freed leaps forward after the fruit of streamentry or the fruit of oncereturning or the fruit of nonreturning or after arahatship and performs mental training for the attainment of the unattained for mastery of the unmastered and for realization of the unrealized
It is thus sire that leaping forward is a distinguishing mark of faith
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of energy
Rendering of support sire is the distinguishing mark of energy No wholesome mental state that is supported by energy decreases
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of mindfulness
Notdrifting sire is a distinguishing mark of mindfulness and also taking up is a distinguishing mark of mindfulness
When mindfulness is uprising sire one does not drift in regard to mental states that are wholesome and unwholesome blamable and blameless low and lofty dark and bright or evenly mixed but thinking These are the four foundations of mindfulness these the four right efforts these the four bases of psychic power these the five spiritual faculties these the five powers these the seven factors of enlightenment this the Noble Eightfold Path this is calm this is insight this is knowledge this is emancipation
It is thus sire that notdrifting is a distinguishing mark of mindfulness
Even so sire when mindfulness is uprising one does not drift in regard to mental states that are wholesome and unwholesome blamable and blameless 
It is thus sire that notdrifting is a distinguishing mark of mindfulness
Sire when mindfulness is uprising one examines the qualities of mental states that are beneficial and detrimental and thinking These mental states are beneficial these mental states are detrimental
It is thus sire that takingup is a distinguishing mark of mindfulness
It is thus sire that taking up is a distinguishing mark of mindfulness
And this sire was said by the Blessed One And I monks say that mindfulness is of value in everything
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of concentration
The distinguishing mark of concentration sire is being the chief All those mental states that are wholesome have concentration as the chief they lean tend and incline towards concentration
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of wisdom
Earlier I said sire that cutting off is a distinguishing mark of wisdom But illuminating is also a distinguishing mark of wisdom
Sire when wisdom is uprising it dispels the darkness of ignorance produces the effulgence of clear knowledge makes the light of knowing appear and makes plain the Four Noble Truths
In consequence one who is devoted to mental training sees what is impermanent or what is suffering or what is notself by means of right wisdom
In consequence one who is devoted to mental training sees what is impermanent or what is suffering or what is notself by means of right wisdom
It is thus sire that illuminating is a distinguishing mark of wisdom
We sire are in need of a goal let the discussion be about the goal
King Milinda then thought This monk is learned he is competent to converse with me I have so many questions to ask him but before I ask them all the sun will set Suppose I were to converse with him in the palace tomorrow
Having asked Devamantiya to tell Venerable Nāgasena that the dis cussion should continue in the palace on the following day
the king rose from his seat took leave of Venerable Nāgasena mounted his horse and departed muttering Nāgasena Nāgasena
And have you yourself revered sir gone forth for such a goal
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Who takes rebirth who does not take rebirth
Will you yourself take rebirth
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Revered sir is proper attention the same as wisdom
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Yes revered sir I do
How sire do barleyreapers reap barley
Even so sire does one who is devoted to mental training take hold of the mind with attention and cut off the defilements with wisdom
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Revered sir what is the distinguishing mark of morality
Make a simile
As sire whatever vegetable life and animal life come to growth increase and maturity all do so by being dependent on the earth
even so do all these wholesome mental states develop by being dependent on morality
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Revered Nāgasena how is tranquillizing a distinguishing mark of faith
even so sire is leaping forward a distinguishing mark of faith
Make a simile
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Make a simile
Sire suppose a house were falling down and a man supported it with more wood so that supported thus that house did not fall down
even so sire is rendering support the distinguishing mark of energy no wholesome mental state that is supported by energy decreases
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Revered sir how is notdrifting a distinguishing mark of mindfulness
the one who is devoted to mental training then follows the things that should be followed and does not follow the things that should not be followed
he associates with that which should be associated with and does not associate with that which should not be associated with
Make a simile
As sire the storekeeper of a Wheelturning King reminds him of his glory every morning and evening saying You have so many elephants your majesty so many horses so many chariots so many footsoldiers so much unwrought gold so much wrought gold so much wealth let his majesty remember it and does not drift in regard to the kings wealth
the one who is devoted to mental training then follows the things that should be followed and does not follow the things that should not be followed
he associates with that which should be associated with and does not associate with that which should not be associated with
Revered sir how is takingup a distinguishing mark of mindfulness
these mental states are helpful these mental states are not helpful
the one who is devoted to mental training removes the detrimental mental states and takes up the beneficial mental states
he removes the unhelpful mental states and takes up the helpful mental states
Make a simile
As sire the advisertreasurer of a Wheelturning King knows what is beneficial and what is detrimental for the king and thinks These are beneficial for the king these are detrimental these are helpful these are unhelpful and then removes what is detrimental and takes up what is beneficial
even so sire when mindfulness is uprising one examines the qualities of mental states that are beneficial and detrimental 
and takes up helpful mental states
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
removes what is unhelpful and takes up what is helpful
Make a simile
As sire in a house with a ridgepole all the rafters go to the ridgepole lean towards it and join it and the ridgepole is pointed to as their chief
even so sire all those mental states that are wholesome have concentration as the chief they lean tend and incline towards concentration
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
How revered sir is illuminating a distinguishing mark of wisdom
Make a simile
As sire a man might bring a lamp into a dark house and when he has put it down the lamp dispels the darkness produces effulgence makes light appear and makes plain the forms of things
even so sire when wisdom is uprising it dispels the darkness of ignorance produces the effulgence of clear knowledge makes the light of knowing appear and makes plain the Four Noble Truths
Make a simile
As sire a Wheelturning King going along a high road with his four limbedarmy of elephants horses chariots and infantry might cross a small stretch of water and as a result that water will become foul turbid and muddy
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena is he who uprises the same or is he another
Neither the same nor another
What do you think about this sire Now that you are grown up are you the same as you were when you were a boy young tender lying on your back
No revered sir That boy young tender lying on his back was one thing I who am now fullgrown am another
Can it be sire that the mother of the embryo at the first stage in prenatal development is different from the mother at the second stage and she different from the mother at the third stage and she different from the mother at the fourth stage That the mother of the small is one thing and the mother of the fullgrown another That one trains in a craft and another becomes trained That one does an evil deed and they cut off the hands and feet of another
No revered sir
But what would you say revered sir when it is spoken thus
It is one I that was the boy young tender lying on his back and it is the same I that am now fullgrown and all these are held together as a unity in dependence on this body itself
It is as if sire some person might light a lamp Would it burn all night long
Yes revered sir it might burn all night long
No revered sir
Is the flame of the middle watch the same as the flame of the third watch
No revered sir it was burning all through the night in dependence on itself
Even so sire a continuity of phenomena is linked together It uprises as one and ceases as another linked together as though there were no before and no after Hence it is neither the same nor another but the subsequent consciousness is reckoned the preceding consciousness
No sire they come into being because of it
Even so sire a continuity of phenomena is linked together It uprises as one and ceases as another linked together as though there were no before and no after Hence it is neither the same nor another but the subsequent consciousness is reckoned the preceding consciousness
King Milinda said Does he who does not take rebirth know I will not take rebirth
Yes sire He who does not take rebirth knows that he will not take rebirth
It is from the termination of whatever is the cause whatever is the condition of rebirth that he knows he will not take rebirth
Yes revered sir he would know
It is from the termination of whatever is the cause whatever is the condition of filling the granary that he would know My granary will not be filled
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena has wisdom arisen in him in whom knowledge has arisen
Yes sire wisdom has arisen in him in whom knowledge has arisen
Yes sire knowledge is the same as wisdom
He would be bewildered at some things sire at some he would not be bewildered
He would be bewildered sire in regard to those parts of the crafts that he did not already know or in regard to those districts he had not already visited or in regard to those names and designations he had not already heard
In regard to that done through this wisdom sire namely impermanence or suffering or notself here he would not be bewildered
Delusion sire ceases the very moment knowledge arises
In consequence the darkness would cease and light appear Even so sire delusion ceases the very moment knowledge arises
Although wisdom sire ceases then and there when it has done its task yet that which is done by means of this wisdom namely impermanence or suffering or notself that does not cease
Sire it is like a man who wants to send a letter during the night After he has summoned a scribe and brought a lamp he makes him write the letter But if he has the lamp put out after the letter has been written the letter would not be lost because the lamp was put out
Even so sire though wisdom ceases as soon as it has done its task yet that which is done by means of this wisdom namely impermanence or suffering or notself that does not cease
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena does he who does not take rebirth feel any painful feeling
He feels some some he does not feel
He feels bodily feelings sire he does not feel mental feelings
It is from the nontermination of the cause and condition for the uprising of a painful bodily feeling that he feels a painful bodily feeling but it is from the termination of the cause and condition for the uprising of a painful mental feeling that he feels no painful mental feeling
And this sire was said by the Blessed One He feels one feeling the bodily not the mental
Sire arahats have neither approval nor repugnance nor do arahats destroy what is unripe wise men wait for full maturing
And this sire was spoken by the Elder Sāriputta the General of the Dhamma
I delight not in dying I delight not in living
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena are pleasant feelings wholesome or unwholesome or indeterminate
They may be wholesome sire they may be unwholesome they may be indeterminate
What do you think about this sire If one should place a redhot ball of iron in a mans hand and in his other hand should place an icecold lump of snow would these both hurt him sire
Yes revered sir both would hurt him
No revered sir
No revered sir
Acknowledge your refutation If what is redhot hurts but if both of them are not hot the pain does not arise from that
So how is it sire that both of them hurt since both of them are not hot and both of them are not cold
And how is it that though the one is hot and the other is cold one says Both of them hurt yet the pain does not arise from that
I am not competent to converse on this assertion with you It were good revered sir if you explained the meaning
Sire there are six types of happiness connected with the world six types of happiness connected with renunciation six types of sorrow connected with the world six types of sorrow connected with renunciation six types of equanimity connected with the world and six types of equanimity connected with renunciation There are these six sets of six So there is a thirtysixfold feeling that is past a thirtysixfold feeling that is future and a thirtysixfold feeling that is present so assembling them and bringing them together there are one hundred and eight modes of feeling
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena who takes rebirth
Mindandmatter sire takes rebirth
This same mindandmatter does not itself take rebirth sire but sire by means of this mindandmatter one does a good or bad deed and because of this deed another mindand matter takes rebirth
If sire it did not take rebirth one would be freed from evil deeds
But because sire it takes rebirth one is not freed from evil deeds
Yes revered sir he would deserve punishment
 Whatever he may say the mangoes he stole resulted from the mangoes which he admits the other man planted
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena regarding mindandmatter which is mind and which is matter
That which is gross sire is matter and those subtle mental states form mind
These things sire are dependent the one upon the other they simply arise together
Thus is produced this long time
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena as to this long time you mentioned what is this time
The past time sire the future time and the present time
Some time exists sire some does not
Those formations sire that are past departed stopped or changedthat time does not exist Those mental states that are results and those mental states that are liable to have results and those giving rebirth elsewherethat time exists
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the root of past time future time and present time
The root of past time future time and present time sire is ignorance
Conditioned by ignorance are kammic formations conditioned by kammic formations is consciousness conditioned by consciousness is mindandmatter conditioned by mindandmatter are the six sense bases conditioned by the six sense bases is contact conditioned by contact is feeling conditioned by feeling is craving conditioned by craving is clinging conditioned by clinging is becoming conditioned by becoming is birth conditioned by birth there come into existence old age and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena as to that which you mentionedthe earliest point cannot be shownmake a simile for that
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena is there such a thing as an experiencer
What does this experiencer mean sire
A soul within that sees a visible form with the eye hears a sound with the ear smells a smell with the nose tastes a taste with the tongue feels a touch with the body and discriminates mental states with the mind Just as we who are sitting here in the palace can look out of any window we want to look out of
I will talk to you sire about the five doors Listen and attend carefully If the soul within sees a visible form through the eye just as we who are sitting here in the palace can look out of any window we want to look out of can it not then see a visible form not only through the eye but also through the ear nose tongue body and mind Likewise can it not hear a sound smell a smell taste a taste feel a touch and discriminate mental states through each of the other five doors besides the one you have specified in each case
No revered sir
Again sire we who are sitting here in the palace will see visible forms out there before us more clearly in the great space if these network windows are removed Thus too would this soul within see visible forms more clearly when the doors of the eyes are removed And if the ears were removed the nose removed the tongue removed the body removed would it hear a sound smell a smell taste a taste and feel a touch more clearly on account of the great space
No revered sir
Again sire suppose this Dinna had gone out and were standing out on the porch outside the gateway Would you know sire that he had done so
Yes I would know revered sir
Suppose sire Dinna were to come in again and stand in front of you Would you know that he had done so
Yes I would know revered sir
Yes revered sir it would know
I am not competent to discuss this with you Please explain
Because sire of the eye and visible form eyeconsciousness arises Conascent with that are contact feeling perception volition onepointedness psychic life and attention  Thus these things are produced from a condition and there is no experiencer found here The same applies to the ear and sound nose and smell tongue and taste body and touch and mind and mental states These are things produced from a condition and there is no experiencer found here
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena where eyeconsciousness arises does mindconsciousness also arise there
Yes sire mindconsciousness also arises there
Eyeconsciousness arises first sire mindconsciousness later
No sire there is no conversation between them
It is because of tendency sire because of door because of habit and because of practice
It might run away by means of some slope
It would take the same course as the earlier water
No revered sir there is no conversation between them they run away because there is a slope
Make a simile
A kings bordertown has strong ramparts and only one gateway If a man wanted to leave that town how would he do so
Through that gateway revered sir
In the same way as the first man revered sir
No revered sir there is no conversation between them They go out because there is the door
How is it revered sir that because of habit mindconsciousness also arises where eyeconsciousness arises Make a simile
By the same way as the first cart revered sir
No revered sir there is no conversation between them They go because of habit
Even so sire it is because of habit that where eyeconsciousness arises mindconsciousness arises there too
As sire a beginner is clumsy in the crafts of reckoning on the fingers calculation reckoning and writing but after a time by practice in careful working he becomes deft
even so sire it is through practice that where eyeconsciousness arises there too mindconsciousness arises There is no conversation between them They arise because of practice
Revered Nāgasena does mindconsciousness arise likewise where earconsciousness arises  Does mindconsciousness arise where noseconsciousness  tongueconsciousness  bodyconsciousness arises
Yes sire Where bodyconsciousness arises mindconsciousness also arises
Now revered sir does bodyconsciousness arise first and mindconsciousness later or does mindconsciousness arise first and bodyconsciousness later
Bodyconsciousness arises first sire mindconsciousness later
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena does feeling arise where mindconsciousness arises
Yes sire where mindconsciousness arises there contact arises feeling arises perception arises volition arises applied thought arises and sustained thought arises and all mental states that arise there are headed by contact
Touching sire is the distinguishing mark of contact
Suppose sire two hands are clapped together One of these hands should be understood as the eye
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of feeling
Sire being felt is a distinguishing mark of feeling and experiencing is a distinguishing mark
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of perception
Perceiving sire is the distinguishing mark of perception
What does one perceive
One perceives blue and one perceives yellow and one perceives red and one perceives white and one perceives crimson
Make a simile
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of volition
Being willed sire is a distinguishing mark of volition and effective preparation is also a distinguishing mark
Even so sire some man here having through volition willed an unwholesome deed would arise after death in a bad bourn and those who follow his example also arise after death in a bad bourn
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of consciousness
The distinguishing mark of consciousness sire is cognizing
Even so sire is cognizing a distinguishing mark of consciousness
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of applied thought
Fixing  sire is the distinguishing mark of applied thought
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of sustained thought
Constantly pondering sire is the distinguishing mark of sustained thought
That being so sire you can have no mother nor can you have a father nor can you have a teacher nor can you be master of a craft nor can you be one of morality nor can you be one of wisdom
Make a simile
Is the flame of the first watch of the night the same as the flame of the middle watch
No revered sir
Is it then sire that the lamp in the first watch was one thing the lamp in the middle watch another and the lamp in the third watch still another
Make a further simile
As sire milk on being taken from a cow would turn after a time into curds and from curds into butter and from butter into ghee so sire would one be speaking rightly if one were to speak thus That milk is precisely those curds it is precisely that butter it is precisely that ghee
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
How does he know revered sir
Make a simile
As sire an agriculturist a householder when he had ploughed and sown would fill his granary
but if after a time he should neither plough nor sow but should use his storedup grain or should dispose of it or deal with it according to circumstances then sire would that agriculturist the householder know that his granary would not be filled
How would he know
Even so sire it is from the termination of whatever is the cause whatever is the condition of rebirth that he knows he will not take rebirth
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
What revered sir is knowledge the same as wisdom
But revered sir would he in whom knowledge which is the same as wisdom has arisen be bewildered or would he not be bewildered
Where would he be bewildered revered sir where not
Where would he not be bewildered revered sir
But where revered sir does his delusion go
Make a simile
It is as if sire some person might bring a lamp into a house
But where does wisdom go revered sir
Make a simile
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
What does he feel what does he not feel
Why is it so sire
Revered Nāgasena why does he who does not feel a painful feeling not attain complete Nibbāna
I delight not in dying I delight not in living
But I wait for the time as a hireling his wages
But I wait for the time clearly conscious and mindful
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
If revered sir wholesome feelings are not painful if painful feelings are not wholesome to say That which is wholesome is painful is not acceptable
Is this sire because both are hot
Is it then that both are cold sire
if what is cold hurts but if both of them are not cold the pain does not arise from that
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
What is it this same mindandmatter itself that takes rebirth
If revered sir this mindandmatter itself does not take rebirth would one not be freed from evil deeds
Make a simile
Suppose sire some man were to steal another mans mangoes and the owner of the mangoes were to seize him and bring him before the king saying Your majesty my mangoes were stolen by this man and he were to say Your majesty I did not steal his mangoes the mangoes he planted were different from these that I stole I do not deserve punishment
Would he sire not deserve punishment
For what reason
Even so sire by means of this mindandmatter one does a good or bad deed and because of this deed another mindand matter takes rebirth therefore one is not freed from evil deeds
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
What is the reason revered sir that mind does not take rebirth alone nor matter alone
Make a simile
As sire there could not be just a yolk or just an eggshell from a hen since both the yolk and the eggshell are dependent the one upon the other and there is no separate arising of these two
even so sire if there were not mind there would be no matter for that which is mind and that which is matter are both dependent the one upon the other and there is no separate arising of these two
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
But does this time exist revered sir
But which exists revered sir which does not
For those beings who die and arise elsewhere time exists
for those beings who die and do not arise elsewhere time does not exist
for those beings who have attained final Nibbāna time does not exist
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Thus the earliest point of this whole time cannot be shown
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
As sire an egg comes from a hen and a hen from an egg and an egg from a hen
Venerable Nāgasena traced a circle on the ground and asked King Milinda Is there an end to this circle sire
There is not revered sir
Even so sire are those circles spoken of by the Blessed One Eyeconsciousness arises because of eye and visible forms the meeting of the three is contact conditioned by contact is feeling conditioned by feeling is craving conditioned by craving is kamma and eye is born again from kamma
Is there thus an end of this series
There is not revered sir
And sire the same applies to earconsciousness ear and sounds noseconsciousness nose and smells tongueconsciousness tongue and tastes bodyconsciousness body and touch mindconsciousness arises because of mind and mental objects the meeting of the three is contact conditioned by contact is feeling conditioned by feeling is craving conditioned by craving is kamma and mind is born again from kamma
Is there thus an end of this series
There is not revered sir
Even so sire the earliest point of time cannot be shown either
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
There is not revered sir
is there thus an end of this series
Even so sire the earliest point of time cannot be shown either
Make a further simile
even so revered sir this soul within can look out of any door it wants to look out of
Even so sire if a tasty object had been put on the tongue would the soul within know whether it were acidic or salty or bitter or sharp or astringent or sweet
But when the tasty object had passed into the stomach would it know whether it had been acidic or salty or bitter or sharp or astringent or sweet
No revered sir
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Now revered sir does eyeconsciousness instruct mindconsciousness saying Where I arise do you likewise arise or does mindconsciousness instruct eyeconsciousness saying Where you arise I will likewise arise
Then how is it revered Nāgasena that where eyeconsciousness arises there mindconsciousness also arises
Make a simile
When it is raining by what means may the water run away
But sire if it continued to rain by what means would that later amount of water run away
Then sire does the earlier water instruct the later saying You run away by the same course as I do or does the later water instruct the earlier saying I will also run away by the same course as you will take
Even so sire it is because of tendency that where eyeconsciousness arises mindconsciousness arises there too
How is it revered sir that because of door mindconsciousness also arises where eyeconsciousness arises
If another man wanted to leave that town how would he do so
Does the first man instruct the second saying You go out in the same way as I do or does the second man instruct the first saying I too will go out in the same way as you do
Even so sire it is because of door that where eyeconsciousness arises mindconsciousness arises there too
If one cart went ahead then which way would the second cart go
Does the first cart instruct the second saying You go by the same way as I go or does the second cart instruct the first saying I too will go by the same way as you do
How is it revered sir that because of practice mindconsciousness also arises where eyeconsciousness arises
Make a simile
Now revered Nāgasena   there is no conversation between them They arise because of practice
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Now revered Nāgasena does eyeconsciousness arise first and mindconsciousness later or does mindconsciousness arise first and eyeconsciousness later
Revered Nāgasena what is the distinguishing mark of contact
Make a simile
the other as visible form
the meeting of the two as contact
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Make a simile
Suppose sire some man should render a king a service and that king being delighted should repay the service and that because of this the man should go about possessed of and provided with the five strands of sense pleasures and that it should occur to him Earlier I rendered the king a service and the king delighted repaid the service of mine so that I am now experiencing such and such feelings
Even so sire being felt is a distinguishing mark of feeling and experiencing is a distinguishing mark
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Even so sire is perceiving the distinguishing mark of perception
As sire when a kings storekeeper has gone into the storeroom and seen the things that are the property of the king he perceives that they are blue yellow red white and crimson
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Make a simile
Suppose sire some man has prepared poison and were to drink it himself or make others drink iteither he or the others would become afflicted
Even so sire is being willed a distinguishing mark of volition and effective preparation a distinguishing mark
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Make a simile
As sire the superintendent of a city sitting at the crossroads in the middle of the city could see a man coming from the eastern southern western or northern quarters
even so sire whatever form a man sees he cognizes it by consciousness
and whatever sound he hears
whatever smell he smells
whatever taste he tastes
whatever touch he feels and whatever mental state he cognizes he cognizes it by consciousness
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Make a simile
As sire a carpenter fixes a wellturned piece of wood in a socket even so sire is fixing the distinguishing mark of applied thought
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Make a simile
As sire a bronze gong that has been struck reverberates afterwards and the sound lingers on even so sire applied thought is to be understood thus as striking
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
and sustained thought is to be understood thus as reverberating
He has passed beyond doubt in that he lives having crossed over and transcended doubt
and after a time he might be freed from his bonds without any loss with no deduction from his possessions
It was said above with reference to the mundane kinds of direct knowledge that this development of concentration provides  the benefit of the kinds of directknowledge  Now in order to perfect those kinds of directknowledge the task must be undertaken by a meditator who has reached the fourth jhāna in the earth kasiṇa and so on
And in doing this not only will this development of concentration have provided benefits in this way it will also have become more advanced and when he thus possesses concentration so developed as to have both provided benefits and become more advanced he will then more easily perfect the development of understanding
So meanwhile we shall deal with the explanation of the kinds of directknowledge now
In order to show the benefits of developing concentration to clansmen whose concentration has reached the fourth jhāna and in order to teach progressively refined Dhamma five kinds of mundane directknowledge have been described by the Blessed One They are the kinds of supernormal power described in the way beginning When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of defilement and has become malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs he inclines his mind to the kinds of supernormal power
He wields the various kinds of supernormal power Having been one he becomes many   the knowledge of the divine ear element the knowledge of penetration of minds the knowledge of recollection of past lives and the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
If a meditator wants to begin performing the transformation by supernormal power described as Having been one he becomes many etc he must achieve the eight attainments in each of the eight kasiṇas ending with the white kasiṇa He must also have complete control of his mind in the following fourteen ways
 in the order of the kasiṇa in the reverse order of the kasiṇa in the order and reverse order of the kasiṇa in the order of the jhāna in the reverse order of the jhāna in the order and reverse order of the jhāna skipping jhāna skipping kasiṇa skipping jhāna and kasiṇa transposition of factors transposition of object transposition of factors and object definition of factors and definition of object
But what is in the order of the kasiṇa here
What is definition of object
 Here a bhikkhu attains jhāna in the earth kasiṇa after that in the water kasiṇa and so progressing through the eight kasiṇas doing so even a hundred times even a thousand times in each one This is called in the order of the kasiṇas
 Attaining them in like manner in reverse order starting with the white kasiṇa is called in the reverse order of the kasiṇas
 Attaining them again and again in forward and reverse order from the earth kasiṇa up to the white kasiṇa and from the white kasiṇa back to the earth kasiṇa is called in the order and reverse order of the kasiṇas
 Attaining again and again from the first jhāna up to the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is called in the order of the jhānas
 Attaining again and again from the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception back to the first jhāna is called in the reverse order of the jhānas
 Attaining in forward and reverse order from the first jhāna up to the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception and from the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception back to the first jhāna is called in the order and reverse order of the jhānas
 He skips alternate jhānas without skipping the kasiṇas in the following way having first attained the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa he attains the third jhāna in that same kasiṇa and after that having removed the kasiṇa  he attains the base consisting of boundless space after that the base consisting of nothingness This is called skipping jhānas
And that based on the water kasiṇa etc should be construed similarly
 When he skips alternate kasiṇas without skipping jhānas in the following way having attained the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa he again attains that same jhāna in the fire kasiṇa and then in the blue kasiṇa and then in the red kasiṇa this is called skipping kasiṇas
 When he skips both jhānas and kasiṇas in the following way having attained the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa he next attains the third in the fire kasiṇa next the base consisting of boundless space after removing the blue kasiṇa next the base consisting of nothingness arrived at from the red kasiṇa this is called skipping jhānas and kasiṇas
 Attaining the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa and then attaining the others in that same kasiṇa is called transposition of factors
 Attaining the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa and then that same jhāna in the water kasiṇa  in the white kasiṇa is called transposition of object
 Transposition of object and factors together takes place in the following way he attains the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa the second jhāna in the water kasiṇa the third in the fire kasiṇa the fourth in the air kasiṇa the base consisting of boundless space by removing the blue kasiṇa the base consisting of boundless consciousness arrived at from the yellow kasiṇa the base consisting of nothingness from the red kasiṇa and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception from the white kasiṇa This is called transposition of factors and object
 The defining of only the jhāna factors by defining the first jhāna as five factored the second as threefactored the third as twofactored and likewise the fourth the base consisting of boundless space  and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is called definition of factors
 Likewise the defining of only the object as This is the earth kasiṇa This is the water kasiṇa  This is the white kasiṇa is called definition of object
Some would also have defining of factors and object
It is not possible for a meditator to begin to accomplish transformation by supernormal powers unless he has previously completed his development by controlling his mind in these fourteen ways
Now the kasiṇa preliminary work is difficult for a beginner and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it
The arousing of the sign is difficult for one who has done the preliminary work and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it
To extend the sign when it has arisen and to reach absorption is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it
To tame ones mind in the fourteen ways after reaching absorption is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it
The transformation by supernormal power after training ones mind in the fourteen ways is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it
Rapid response after attaining transformation is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it
Like the Elder Rakkhita who eight years after his full admission to the Order was in the midst of thirty thousand bhikkhus possessing supernormal powers who had come to attend upon the sickness of the Elder MahāRohaṇa Gutta at Therambatthala
His feat is mentioned under the earth kasiṇa 
Seeing his feat an elder said Friends if Rakkhita had not been there we should have been put to shame It could have been said They were unable to protect the royal nāga
So we ourselves ought to go about with our abilities perfected just as it is proper to go about with weapons cleaned of stains
And helping another after acquiring rapidity in responding is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it Like the elder who gave protection against the rain of embers by creating earth in the sky when the rain of embers was produced by Māra at the Giribhaṇḍavahana offering 
It is only in Buddhas Paccekabuddhas chief disciples etc who have vast previous endeavour behind them that this transformation by supernormal power and other such special qualities as the discriminations are brought to success simply with the attainment of Arahantship and without the progressive course of development of the kind just described
So just as when a goldsmith wants to make some kind of ornament he does so only after making the gold malleable and wieldy by smelting it etc and just as when a potter wants to make some kind of vessel he does so only after making the clay well kneaded and malleable a beginner too must likewise prepare for the kinds of supernormal powers by controlling his mind in these fourteen ways and he must do so also by making his mind malleable and wieldy both by attaining under the headings of zeal consciousness energy and inquiry and by mastery in adverting and so on
But one who already has the required condition for it owing to practice in previous lives needs only prepare himself by acquiring mastery in the fourth jhāna in the kasiṇas
Now the Blessed One showed how the preparation should be done in saying When his concentrated mind and so on
Here is the explanation which follows the text 
Herein he is a meditator who has attained the fourth jhāna
Thus signifies the order in which the fourth jhāna comes
Concentrated concentrated by means of the fourth jhāna
Mind finematerialsphere consciousness
But as to the words purified etc it is purified by means of the state of mindfulness purified by equanimity
It is bright precisely because it is purified it is limpid  is what is meant
It is unblemished since the blemishes consisting of greed etc are eliminated by the removal of their conditions consisting of bliss and the rest
for it is by the blemish that the consciousness becomes defiled
It has become malleable because it is well developed it suffers mastery is what is meant
For a malleable consciousness is wieldy like wellsmelted gold and it is both of these because it is well developed
It is steady because it is steadied in this purifiedness and the rest
It is attained to imperturbability precisely because it is steady it is motionless without perturbation  is what is meant
Or alternatively it is steady because steady in its own masterability through malleability and wieldiness
For consciousness reinforced by faith is not perturbed by faithlessness
when reinforced by understanding it is not perturbed by ignorance
So when it is reinforced by these six states it is attained to imperturbability
Consciousness possessing these eight factors in this way is susceptible of being directed to the realization by directknowledge of states realizable by directknowledge
Another method It is concentrated by means of fourthjhāna concentration
It is purified by separation from the hindrances
It is bright owing to the surmounting of applied thought and the rest
It is unblemished owing to absence of evil wishes based on the obtainment of jhāna
It is become malleable by masterability
It is wieldy by reaching the state of a road to power 
It is steady and attained to imperturbability by reaching the refinement of completed development
And the consciousness possessing these eight factors in this way is susceptible of being directed to the realization by directknowledge of states realizable by directknowledge since it is the basis the proximate cause for them
but since that is not given in the commentaries it is certainly not a heading in the development
The thirty thousand bhikkhus heeded the elders advice and achieved rapid response
having obtained the fourth jhāna in this order beginning with attaining the first jhāna is what is meant
It is rid of defilement precisely because it is unblemished
for consciousness that suffers mastery is called malleable
It is wieldy precisely because it is malleable it suffers being worked  is fit to be worked  is what is meant
according as it is said Bhikkhus I do not see anyone thing that when developed and cultivated becomes so malleable and wieldy as does the mind 
when reinforced by energy it is not perturbed by idleness
and it is attained to imperturbability because it is reinforced by faith and so on
when reinforced by mindfulness it is not perturbed by negligence
when reinforced by concentration it is not perturbed by agitation
and when illuminated it is not perturbed by the darkness of defilement
It is rid of defilement owing to the disappearance of the defilements of the mind consisting in covetousness etc
and both of these should be understood according to the Anaṅgaṇa Sutta and the Vattha Sutta 
the meaning is that according as it has attained imperturbability so it is steady
He directs he inclines his mind to the kinds of supernormal powers  here success is the success of succeeding  in the sense of production in the sense of obtainment is what is meant
For what is produced and obtained is called successful
Another method success is in the sense of succeeding
That is a term for the effectiveness of the means
according as it is said This householder Citta is virtuous and magnanimous If he should aspire Let me in the future become a Wheelturning Monarch being virtuous he will succeed in his aspiration because it is purified 
Another method beings succeed by its means thus it is success
They succeed thus they are successful they are enriched promoted is what is meant
 Herein Normally one he adverts to himself as many
 That given as follows Having abandoned his normal form he shows himself in the form of a boy or the form of a serpent  or he shows a manifold military array  is called success as transformation because of the abandoning and alteration of the normal form
 That given in this way Here a bhikkhu creates out of this body another body possessing visible form mindmade  is called success as the mindmade because it occurs as the production of another mindmade body inside the body
 A distinction brought about by the influence of knowledge either before the arising of the knowledge or after it or at that moment is called success by intervention of knowledge
There was success by intervention of knowledge in the venerable Bakkula
There was success by intervention of knowledge in the venerable Saṅkicca
There was success by intervention of knowledge in the venerable Bhūtapāla 
Herein when the venerable Bakkula as an infant was being bathed in the river on an auspicious day he fell into the stream through the negligence of his nurse
A fish swallowed him and eventually came to the bathing place at Benares
There it was caught by a fisherman and sold to a rich mans wife
The fish interested her and thinking to cook it herself she slit it open
When she did so she saw the child like a golden image in the fishs stomach She was overjoyed thinking At last I have got a son So the venerable Bakkulas safe survival in a fishs stomach in his last existence is called success by intervention of knowledge because it was brought about by the influence of the Arahantpath knowledge due to be obtained by him in that life
But the story should be told in detail 
The Elder Saṅkiccas mother died while he was still in her womb
At the time of her cremation she was pierced by stakes and placed on a pyre The infant received a wound on the corner of his eye from the point of a stake and made a sound
Then thinking that the child must be alive they took down the body and opened its belly They gave the child to the grandmother
Under her care he grew up and eventually he went forth and reached Arahantship together with the discriminations
So the venerable Saṅkiccas safe survival on the pyre is called success by intervention of knowledge in the way just stated 
The boy Bhūtapālas father was a poor man in Rājagaha
He went into the forest with a cart to get a load of wood It was evening when he returned to the city gate
Then his oxen slipped the yoke and escaped into the city
He seated the child beside the cart and went into the city after the oxen
Before he could come out again the gate was closed
The childs safe survival through the three watches of the night outside the city in a place infested by wild beasts and spirits is called success by intervention of knowledge in the way just stated
But the story should be told in detail
 A distinction brought about by the influence of serenity either before the concentration or after it or at that moment is called success by intervention of concentration
There was success by intervention of concentration in the venerable Sāriputta  in the venerable Sañjīva  in the venerable KhāṇuKondañña  in the laywoman devotee Uttarā  in the laywoman devotee Sāmāvatī 
Herein while the venerable Sāriputta was living with the Elder Mahā Moggallāna at Kapotakandarā he was sitting in the open on a moonlit night with his hair newly cut Then a wicked spirit though warned by his companion gave him a blow on the head
the noise of which was like a thunder clap
At the time the blow was given the elder was absorbed in an attainment
This was success by intervention of concentration in that venerable one
The story is given in the Udāna too 
While the Elder Sañjīva was in the attainment of cessation cowherds etc who noticed him thought he was dead They brought grass and sticks and cow dung and set fire to them
Not even a corner of the elders robe was burnt
This was success by intervention of concentration in him because it was brought about by the influence of the serenity occurring in his successive attainment of each of the eight jhānas preceding cessation
But the story is given in the Suttas too 
The Elder Khāṇu Kondañña was naturally gifted in attainments
He was sitting absorbed in attainment one night in a certain forest
Five hundred robbers came by with stolen booty Thinking that no one was following them and needing rest they put the booty down Believing the elder was a tree stump  they piled all the booty on him
The elder emerged at the predetermined time just as they were about to depart after resting at the very time in fact when the one who had put his booty down first was picking it up
When they saw the elder move they cried out in fear
The elder said Do not be afraid lay followers I am a bhikkhu
They came and paid homage Such was their confidence in the elder that they went forth into homelessness and they eventually reached Arahantship together with the discriminations
The absence here of harm to the elder covered as he was by five hundred bundles of goods was success by intervention of concentration 
The laywoman devotee Uttarā was the daughter of a rich man called Puṇṇaka
A harlot called Sirimā who was envious of her poured a basin of hot oil over her head
At that moment Uttarā had attained jhāna in lovingkindness
The oil ran off her like water on a lotus leaf
This was success by intervention of concentration in her
But the story should be given in detail 
King Udenas chief queen was called Sāmāvatī
The brahman Māgaṇḍiya who aspired to elevate his own daughter to the position of chief queen put a poisonous snake into Sāmāvatīs lute Then he told the king Sāmāvatī wants to kill you sire She is carrying a poisonous snake about in her lute
When the king found it he was furious Intending to kill her he took his bow and aimed a poisoned arrow
Sāmāvatī with her retinue pervaded the king with loving kindness
The king stood trembling unable either to shoot the arrow or to put it away
Then the queen said to him What is it sire are you tired
Yes I am tired
Then the queen advised him Sire one should not hate one who has no hate
 That which consists in dwelling perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive etc is called Noble Ones success
Here if a bhikkhu should wish May I dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive he dwells perceiving the unrepulsive in that  he dwells in equanimity towards that mindful and fully aware 
This is called Noble Ones success because it is only produced in Noble Ones who have reached mind mastery
For if a bhikkhu with cankers destroyed possesses this kind of success then when in the case of a disagreeable object he is practicing pervasion with lovingkindness or giving attention to it as elements he dwells perceiving the unrepulsive
Likewise when in the case of the repulsive and unrepulsive he is practicing that same pervasion with lovingkindness or giving attention to it as elements he dwells perceiving the unrepulsive
But when he is exercising the sixfactored equanimity in the following way On seeing a visible object with the eye he is neither glad nor   etc then rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive he dwells in equanimity mindful and fully aware
For the meaning of this is expounded in the Paṭisambhidā in the way beginning How does he dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive
In the case of a disagreeable object he pervades it with lovingkindness or he treats it as elements 
Thus it is called Noble Ones success because it is only produced in Noble Ones who have reached mind mastery
 That consisting in travelling through the air in the case of winged birds etc is called success born of kamma result
That in all winged birds in all deities in some human beings in some inhabitants of states of loss is success born of kamma result 
For here it is the capacity in all winged birds to travel through the air without jhāna or insight that is success born of kamma result
 That consisting in travelling through the air etc in the case of Wheel turning Monarchs etc is called success of the meritorious
The Wheelturning Monarch travels through the air with his fourfold army even with his grooms and shepherds
The householder Jotika had the success of the meritorious
The householder Jaṭilaka had the success of the meritorious
The householder Ghosita had the success of the meritorious
The householder Meṇḍaka had the success of the meritorious
That of the five very meritorious is success of the meritorious 
In brief however it is the distinction that consists in succeeding when the accumulated merit comes to ripen that is success of the meritorious
A crystal palace cleft the earth and sprang into existence for the householder Jotika
and sixtyfour wishing trees That was success of the meritorious in his case 
A golden rock of eighty cubits high was made for Jaṭilaka 
Ghositas safe survival when attempts were made in seven places to kill him was success of the meritorious 
The appearance to Meṇḍaka of rams made of the seven gems in a place the size of one sītā  was success of the meritorious in Meṇḍaka 
The five very meritorious are the rich man Meṇḍaka his wife Candapadumasiri his son the rich man Dhanañjaya his daughterinlaw Sumanadevī and his slave Puṇṇa
When the rich man Meṇḍaka washed his head and looked up at the sky twelve thousand five hundred measures were filled for him with red rice from the sky
When his wife took a nāḷi measure of cooked rice the food was not used up though she served the whole of Jambudīpa with it
When his son took a purse containing a thousand ducats  the ducats were not exhausted even though he made gifts to all the inhabitants of Jambudīpa
When his daughterinlaw took a pint measure of paddy the grain was not used up even when she shared it out among all the inhabitants of Jambudīpa
When the slave ploughed with a single ploughshare there were fourteen furrows seven on each side 
This was success of the meritorious in them
 That beginning with travelling through the air in the case of masters of the sciences is success through the sciences
Masters of the sciences having pronounced their scientific spells travel through the air
 But the succeeding of such and such work through such and such right exertion is success in the sense of succeeding due to right exertion applied here or there
And the text here is similar to the previous text in the illustration of right exertion in other words the way
But in the Commentary it is given as follows Any work belonging to a trade such as making a cart assemblage etc any medical work the learning of the Three Vedas the learning of the Three Piṭakas even any work connected with ploughing sowing etcthe distinction produced by doing such work is success in the sense of succeeding due to right exertion applied here or there
So among these ten kinds of success only success by resolve is actually mentioned in the clause kinds of supernormal power 
 To the kinds of supernormal power  to the components of supernormal power or to the departments of supernormal power
He directs he inclines his mind when that bhikkhus consciousness has become the basis for directknowledge in the way already described he directs the preliminarywork consciousness with the purpose of attaining the kinds of supernormal power he sends it in the direction of the kinds of supernormal power leading it away from the kasiṇa as its object
Inclines makes it tend and lean towards the supernormal power to be attained
He the bhikkhu who has done the directing of his mind in this way
The various varied of different sorts
Kinds of supernormal power departments of supernormal power
Wields paccanubhoti  paccanubhavati  the meaning is that he makes contact with realizes reaches
Now in order to show that variousness it is said Having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one He appears and vanishes He goes unhindered through walls through enclosures through mountains as though in open space He dives in and out of the earth as though in water He goes on unbroken water as though on earth Seated crosslegged he travels in space like a winged bird With his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so mighty and powerful He wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmāworld 
Herein having been one having been normally one before giving effect to the supernormal power
He becomes many wanting to walk with many or wanting to do a recital or wanting to ask questions with many he becomes a hundred or a thousand
But how does he do this
He accomplishes the four planes the four bases  the eight steps and the sixteen roots of supernormal power and then he resolves with knowledge
Herein the four planes should be understood as the four jhānas
They are the first jhāna as the plane born of seclusion the second jhāna as the plane of happiness and bliss the third jhāna as the plane of equanimity and bliss the fourth jhāna as the plane of neither pain nor pleasure
These four planes of supernormal power lead to the attaining of supernormal power to the obtaining of supernormal power to the transformation due to supernormal power to the majesty of supernormal power to the mastery of supernormal power to fearlessness in supernormal power 
And he reaches supernormal power by becoming light malleable and wieldy in the body after steeping himself in blissful perception and light perception due to the pervasion of happiness and pervasion of bliss which is why the first three jhānas should be understood as the accessory plane since they lead to the obtaining of supernormal power in this manner
But the fourth is the natural plane for obtaining supernormal power
The four bases should be understood as the four bases of success 
Here a bhikkhu develops the basis for success that possesses both concentration due to zeal and the will to strive 
These four bases for success lead to the obtaining of supernormal power  to the fearlessness due to supernormal power  
And here the concentration that has zeal as its cause or has zeal outstanding is concentration due to zeal
Will as endeavour is will to strive
Possesses is furnished with concentration due to zeal and with the four instances of the will to strive
Road to power  the meaning is the total of consciousness and its remaining concomitants except the concentration and the will which are in the sense of resolve the road to the concentration due to zeal and will to strive associated with the directknowledge consciousness which latter are themselves termed power  either by treatment as production or in the sense of succeeding or by treatment in this way beings succeed by its means thus they are successful they are enriched promoted 
For this is said Basis for success  it is the feeling aggregate perception aggregate formations aggregate and consciousness aggregate in one so become 
Or alternatively it is arrived at by means of that thus that is a road 
Iddhipāda  iddhiyā pāda 
He awakens zeal for the nonarising of unarisen evil unprofitable states strives puts forth energy strains his mind and struggles He awakens zeal for the abandoning of arisen evil unprofitable states  He awakens zeal for the arousing of unarisen profitable states  He awakens zeal for the maintenance nondisappearance increase growth development and perfection of arisen profitable states strives puts forth energy strains his mind and struggles These are called instances of the will to strive
So this zeal and this concentration due to zeal and these four instances of will to strive are called the road to power that possesses concentration due to zeal and the will to strive 
And the meaning should be understood in this way in the case of the other roads to power 
The eight steps should be understood as the eight beginning with zeal
If a bhikkhu obtains concentration obtains unification of mind supported by zeal
The zeal is one the concentration is another
If a bhikkhu  supported by energy  supported by natural purity of consciousness  supported by inquiry 
The inquiry is one the concentration is another
These eight steps to power lead to the obtaining of supernormal power  to fearlessness due to supernormal power  
For here it is the zeal consisting in the desire to arouse supernormal power  which zeal is joined with concentration that leads to the obtaining of the supernormal power Similarly in the case of energy and so on
That should be understood as the reason why they are called the eight steps
The sixteen roots the minds unperturbedness should be understood in sixteen modes
for this is said What are the sixteen roots of success 
Undejected consciousness is not perturbed by indolence thus it is unperturbed Unelated consciousness is not perturbed by agitation thus it is unperturbed Unattracted consciousness is not perturbed by greed thus it is unperturbed Unrepelled consciousness is not perturbed by ill will thus it is unperturbed Independent consciousness is not perturbed by false view thus it is unperturbed Untrammelled consciousness is not perturbed by greed accompanied by zeal thus it is unperturbed Liberated consciousness is not perturbed by greed for sense desires thus it is unperturbed Unassociated consciousness is not perturbed by defilement thus it is unperturbed Consciousness rid of barriers is not perturbed by the barrier of defilement thus it is unperturbed Unified consciousness is not perturbed by the defilement of variety thus it is unperturbed Consciousness reinforced by faith is not perturbed by faithlessness thus it is unperturbed Consciousness reinforced by energy is not perturbed by indolence thus it is unperturbed Consciousness reinforced by mindfulness is not perturbed by negligence thus it is unperturbed Consciousness reinforced by concentration is not perturbed by agitation thus it is unperturbed Consciousness reinforced by understanding is not perturbed by ignorance thus it is unperturbed Illuminated consciousness is not perturbed by the darkness of ignorance thus it is unperturbed
These sixteen roots of success lead to the obtaining of supernormal power  to fearlessness due to supernormal power  
Of course this meaning is already established by the words When his concentrated mind etc too but it is stated again for the purpose of showing that the first jhāna etc are the three planes bases  steps and roots of success 
And the firstmentioned method is the one given in the Suttas
So it is stated again for the purpose of avoiding confusion in each of the two instances
He resolves with knowledge  when he has accomplished these things consisting of the planes bases  steps and roots of success  then he attains jhāna as the basis for directknowledge and emerges from it Then if he wants to become a hundred he does the preliminary work thus Let me become a hundred let me become a hundred after which he again attains jhāna as basis for directknowledge emerges and resolves He becomes a hundred simultaneously with the resolving consciousness
The same method applies in the case of a thousand and so on
If he does not succeed in this way he should do the preliminary work again and attain emerge and resolve a second time
For it is said in the Saṃyutta Commentary that it is allowable to attain once or twice
Herein the basicjhāna consciousness has the sign as its object
The resolving consciousness has likewise the hundred as its object or the thousand as its object
That arises once only next to changeoflineage consciousness as in the case of absorption consciousness already described  and it is finematerialsphere consciousness belonging to the fourth jhāna
Now it is said in the Paṭisambhidā Normally one he adverts to himself as many or a hundred or a thousand or a hundred thousand having adverted he resolves with knowledge Let me be many He becomes many like the venerable CūḷaPanthaka 
Here he adverts is said with respect only to the preliminary work
Having adverted he resolves with knowledge is said with respect to the knowledge of the directknowledge
Consequently he adverts to many After that he attains with the last one of the preliminarywork consciousnesses After emerging from the attainment he again adverts thus Let me be many after which he resolves by means of the single consciousness belonging to the knowledge of directknowledge which has arisen next to the three or four preparatory consciousnesses that have occurred and which has the name resolve owing to its making the decision This is how the meaning should be understood here
Like the venerable CūḷaPanthaka is said in order to point to a bodily witness of this multiple state
There were two brothers it seems who were called Panthaka  because they were born on a road
The senior of the two was called MahāPanthaka He went forth into homelessness and reached Arahantship together with the discriminations
When he had become an Arahant he made CūḷaPanthaka go forth too
As a scented kokanada lotus Opens in the morning with its perfume
See the One with Radiant Limbs who glitters Like the suns orb blazing in the heavens 
Four months went by but he could not get it by heart
Then the elder said You are useless in this dispensation and he expelled him from the monastery
At that time the elder had charge of the allocation of meal invitations
Jīvaka approached the elder saying Take alms at our house venerable sir together with the Blessed One and five hundred bhikkhus
The Blessed One saw him with the divine eye and he went to him Why are you weeping he asked
and he was told what had happened
The Blessed One said No one in my dispensation is called useless for being unable to do a recitation Do not grieve bhikkhu Taking him by the arm he led him into the monastery He created a piece of cloth by supernormal power and gave it to him saying Now bhikkhu keep rubbing this and recite over and over again Removal of dirt removal of dirt
While doing as he had been told the cloth became black in colour
What he came to perceive was this The cloth is clean there is nothing wrong there It is this selfhood that is wrong He brought his knowledge to bear on the five aggregates and by increasing insight he reached the neighbourhood of conformity knowledge and changeoflineage knowledge
Then the Blessed One uttered these illuminative stanzas
Now greed it is not dust that we call dirt
And dirt is just a term in use for greed
This greed the wise reject and they abide
Keeping the Law of him that has no greed
Delusion too it is not dust that we call dirt
And dirt is just a term used for delusion
Delusion the wise reject and they abide
Keeping the Dhamma of him without delusion 
When the stanzas were finished the venerable CūḷaPanthaka had at his command the nine supramundane states attended by the four discriminations and six kinds of directknowledge
On the following day the Master went to Jīvakas house together with the Community of Bhikkhus
Then when the gruel was being given out at the end of the wateroffering ceremony he covered his bowl
Jīvaka asked What is it venerable sir
There is a bhikkhu at the monastery
When the Blessed One had left the monastery
Now having multiplied himself Up to a thousand Panthaka
Sat in the pleasant mango wood until the time should be announced 
When the man went and saw the monastery all glowing with yellow he returned and said Venerable sir the monastery is crowded with bhikkhus I do not know which of them the lord is
Then the Blessed One said Go and catch hold of the hem of the robe of the first one you see tell him The Master calls you and bring him here
At once all the creations vanished
The elder dismissed him saying You may go and when he had finished attending to his bodily needs such as mouth washing he arrived first and sat down on the seat prepared
It was with reference to this that it was said like the venerable CūḷaPanthaka
The many who were created there were just like the possessor of the supernormal power because they were created without particular specification
Then whatever the possessor of the supernormal powers does whether he stands sits etc or speaks keeps silent etc they do the same
But if he wants to make them different in appearance some in the first phase of life some in the middle phase and some in the last phase and similarly some longhaired some halfshaved some shaved some greyhaired some with lightly dyed robes some with heavily dyed robes or expounding phrases explaining Dhamma intoning asking questions answering questions cooking dye sewing and washing robes etc or if he wants to make still others of different kinds he should emerge from the basic jhāna do the preliminary work in the way beginning Let there be so many bhikkhus in the first phase of life etc then he should once more attain and emerge and then resolve
They become of the kinds desired simultaneously with the resolving consciousness
The same method of explanation applies to the clause having been many he becomes one
but there is this difference After this bhikkhu thus created a manifold state then he again thinks As one only I will walk about do a recital ask a question or out of fewness of wishes he thinks This is a monastery with few bhikkhus If someone comes he will wonder Where have all these bhikkhus who are all alike come from Surely it will be one of the elders feats  and so he might get to know about me Meanwhile wishing Let me be one only he should attain the basic jhāna and emerge Then after doing the preliminary work thus Let me be one he should again attain and emerge and then resolve thus Let me be one
He becomes one simultaneously with the resolving consciousness
But instead of doing this he can automatically become one again with the lapse of the predetermined time
He appears and vanishes the meaning here is that he causes appearance causes vanishing
For it is said in the Paṭisambhidā with reference to this He appears he is not veiled by something he is not hidden he is revealed he is evident
Vanishes he is veiled by something he is hidden he is shut away he is enclosed 
Now this possessor of supernormal power who wants to make an appearance makes darkness into light or he makes revealed what is hidden or he makes what has not come into the visual field come into the visual field
How
If he wants to make himself or another visible even though hidden or at a distance he emerges from the basic jhāna and adverts thus Let this that is dark become light or Let this that is hidden be revealed or Let this that has not come into the visual field come into the visual field Then he does the preliminary work and resolves in the way already described It becomes as resolved simultaneously with the resolve
and he himself sees too if he wants to see
But by whom was this miracle formerly performed
By the Blessed One
For when the Blessed One had been invited by CūḷaSubhaddā and was traversing the sevenleague journey between Sāvatthī and Sāketa with five hundred palanquins created by Vissakamma  he resolved in suchwise that citizens of Sāketa saw the inhabitants of Sāvatthī and citizens of Sāvatthī saw the inhabitants of Sāketa
And when he had alighted in the centre of the city he split the earth in two and showed Avīci and he parted the sky in two and showed the Brahmāworld
And this meaning should also be explained by means of the Descent of the Gods 
When the Blessed One it seems had performed the Twin Miracle and had liberated eightyfour thousand beings from bonds he wondered Where did the past Enlightened Ones go to when they had finished the Twin Miracle  He saw that they had gone to the heaven of the Thirtythree
Then he stood with one foot on the surface of the earth and placed the second on Mount Yugandhara Then again he lifted his first foot and set it on the summit of Mount Sineru He took up the residence for the Rains there on the Red Marble Terrace and he began his exposition of the Abhidhamma starting from the beginning to the deities of ten thousand worldspheres
At the time for wandering for alms he created an artificial Buddha
Meanwhile the Blessed One himself would chew a toothstick of nāgalatā wood and wash his mouth in Lake Anotatta Then after collecting alms food among the Uttarakurus he would eat it on the shores of that lake
Each day the Elder Sāriputta went there and paid homage to the Blessed One
In this way he gave an uninterrupted exposition of the Abhidhamma for three months
Eighty million deities penetrated the Dhamma on hearing it
At the time of the Twin Miracle an assembly gathered that was twelve leagues across Then saying We will disperse when we have seen the Blessed One they made an encampment and waited there
Anāthapiṇḍika the Lesser supplied all their needs
People asked the Elder Anuruddha to find out where the Blessed One was
The elder extended light and with the divine eye he saw where the Blessed One had taken up residence for the Rains As soon as he saw this he announced it
They asked the venerable Mahā Moggallāna to pay homage to the Blessed One
In the midst of the assembly the elder dived into the earth Then cleaving Mount Sineru he emerged at the Perfect Ones feet and he paid homage at the Blessed Ones feet This is what he told the Blessed One Venerable sir the inhabitants of Jambudīpa pay homage at the Blessed Ones feet and they say We will disperse when we have seen the Blessed One
The Blessed One said But Moggallāna where is your elder brother the General of the Dhamma
 At the city of Saṅkassa venerable sir
Saying Good venerable sir the elder paid homage to Him of the Ten Powers and descending by the way he came he reached the human neighbourhood
And at the time of his going and coming he resolved that people should see it
This firstly is the miracle of becoming apparent that the Elder Mahā Moggallāna performed here
Having arrived thus he related what had happened and he said Come forth after the morning meal and pay no heed to distance thus promising that they would be able to see in spite of the distance
The Blessed One informed Sakka Ruler of Gods Tomorrow O King I am going to the human world
On the following day the Blessed One stood on the summit of Sineru and surveyed the eastward world element Many thousands of worldspheres were visible to him as clearly as a single plain
And as the eastward world element so too he saw the westward the northward and the southward world elements all clearly visible
And he saw right down to Avīci and up to the Realm of the Highest Gods
That day it seems was called the day of the Revelation of Worlds 
Human beings saw deities and deities saw human beings
And in doing so the human beings did not have to look up or the deities down They all saw each other face to face
The Blessed One descended by the middle flight of stairs made of crystal the deities of the six sensesphere heavens by that on the left side made of gold and the deities of the Pure Abodes and the Great Brahmā by that on the right side made of silver
The Ruler of Gods held the bowl and robe The Great Brahmā held a threeleaguewide white parasol Suyāma held a yaktail fan Fivecrest  the son of the gandhabba descended doing honour to the Blessed One with his baelwood lute measuring three quarters of a league
On that day there was no living being present who saw the Blessed One but yearned for enlightenment
This is the miracle of becoming apparent that the Blessed One performed here
Furthermore in Tambapaṇṇi Island  while the Elder Dhammadinna resident of Taḷaṅgara was sitting on the shrine terrace in the Great Monastery of Tissa expounding the Apaṇṇaka Sutta Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu possesses three things he enters upon the untarnished way  he turned his fan face downwards and an opening right down to Avīci appeared
Then he turned it face upwards and an opening right up to the Brahmāworld appeared
Having thus aroused fear of hell and longing for the bliss of heaven the elder taught the Dhamma
Some became streamenterers some oncereturners some nonreturners some Arahants
But one who wants to cause a vanishing makes light into darkness or he hides what is unbidden or he makes what has come into the visual field come no more into the visual field
How
If he wants to make himself or another invisible even though unconcealed or nearby he emerges from the basic jhāna and adverts thus Let this light become darkness or Let this that is unhidden be hidden or Let this that has come into the visual field not come into the visual field Then he does the preliminary work and resolves in the way already described
It becomes as he has resolved simultaneously with the resolution
Others do not see even when they are nearby
He too does not see if he does not want to see
But by whom was this miracle formerly performed
By the Blessed One
For the Blessed One so acted that when the clansman Yasa was sitting beside him his father did not see him 
Likewise after travelling two thousand leagues to meet King Mahā Kappina and establishing him in the fruition of nonreturn and his thousand ministers in the fruition of streamentry he so acted that Queen Anojā who had followed the king with a thousand women attendants and was sitting nearby did not see the king and his retinue And when he was asked Have you seen the king venerable sir  he asked But which is better for you to seek the king or to seek your self  
She replied My self venerable sir Then he likewise taught her the Dhamma as she sat there so that together with the thousand women attendants she became established in the fruition of streamentry while the ministers reached the fruition of nonreturn and the king that of Arahantship 
Furthermore this was performed by the Elder Mahinda who so acted on the day of his arrival in Tambapaṇṇi Island that the king did not see the others who had come with him 
Furthermore all miracles of making evident are called an appearance
Herein in the miracle of making evident both the supernormal power and the possessor of the supernormal power are displayed
That can be illustrated with the Twin Miracle
He produces a mass of fire from the upper part of his body and a shower of water from the lower part of his body  
In the case of the miracle of making unevident only the supernormal power is displayed not the possessor of the supernormal power
That can be illustrated by means of the Mahaka Sutta  and the Brahmanimantanika Sutta 
For there it was only the supernormal power of the venerable Mahaka and of the Blessed One respectively that was displayed not the possessors of the supernormal power
When he had sat down at one side the householder Citta said to the venerable Mahaka Venerable sir it would be good if the lord would show me a miracle of supernormal power belonging to the higher than human state
Then householder spread your upper robe out on the terrace and scatter a bundle of hay on it
Then the venerable Mahaka went into his dwelling and fastened the latch after which he performed a feat of supernormal power such that flames came out from the keyhole and from the gaps in the fastenings and burned the hay without burning the upper robe 
Also according as it is said
I saw the fear in all kinds of becoming Including becoming that seeks nonbecoming
And no becoming do I recommend I cling to no delight therein at all 
He goes unhindered through walls through enclosures through mountains as though in open space here through walls is beyond walls the yonder side of a wall is what is meant
So with the rest
And wall is a term for the wall of a house
Unhindered not sticking
As though in open space just as if he were in open space
One who wants to go in this way should attain the spacekasiṇa jhāna and emerge and then do the preliminary work by adverting to the wall or the enclosure or some such mountain as Sineru or the Worldsphere Mountains and he should resolve Let there be space
He goes through it unhindered
But here the Elder Tipiṭaka CūḷaAbhaya said Friends what is the use of attaining the spacekasiṇa jhāna Does one who wants to create elephants horses etc attain an elephantkasiṇa jhāna or horsekasiṇa jhāna and so on Surely the only standard is mastery in the eight attainments and after the preliminary work has been done on any kasiṇa
it then becomes whatever he wishes
Here is the text
He adverts Through the wall through the enclosure through the mountain
He goes unhindered through the wall through the enclosure through the mountain
Just as men normally not possessed of supernormal power go unhindered where there is no obstruction or enclosure so too this possessor of supernormal power by his attaining mental mastery goes unhindered through the wall through the enclosure through the mountain as though in open space 
What if a mountain or a tree is raised in this bhikkhus way while he is travelling along after resolving should he attain and resolve again
There is no harm in that
For attaining and resolving again is like taking the dependence in the preceptors presence
And because this bhikkhu has resolved Let there be space there will be only space there
However if it has been created by another possessor of supernormal power and created first it prevails
He dives in and out of the ground  here it is rising up that is called diving out 
Ummujjanimmujjaṃ  ummujjañ ca nimmujjañ ca 
One who wants to do this should attain the waterkasiṇa jhāna and emerge Then he should do the preliminary work determining thus Let the earth in such an area be water and he should resolve in the way already described
Simultaneously with the resolve that much extent of earth according as determined becomes water only
It is there he does the diving in and out
Here is the text
He adverts to earth
Having adverted he resolves with knowledge Let there be water
He does the diving in and out of the earth
Just as men normally not possessed of supernormal power do diving in and out of water so this possessor of supernormal power by his attaining mental mastery does the diving in and out of the earth as though in water 
And he does not only dive in and out but whatever else he wants such as bathing drinking mouth washing washing of chattels and so on
And not only water but there is whatever else he wants such as ghee oil honey molasses and so on When he does the preliminary work after adverting thus Let there be so much of this and this and resolves it becomes as he resolved
If he takes them and fills dishes with them the ghee is only ghee
If he wants to be wetted by it he is wetted if he does not want to be wetted by it he is not wetted
And it is only for him that that earth becomes water not for anyone else
People go on it on foot and in vehicles etc and they do their ploughing etc there
But if he wishes Let it be water for them too it becomes water for them too
When the time determined has elapsed all the extent determined except for water originally present in water pots ponds etc becomes earth again
On unbroken water here water that one sinks into when trodden on is called broken
Simultaneously with the resolve the water in that place becomes earth
He goes on that  Here is the text
He is normally an obtainer of the earthkasiṇa attainment
He adverts to water
Having adverted he resolves with knowledge Let there be earth
He goes on unbroken water
Just as men normally not possessed of supernormal power go on unbroken earth so this possessor of supernormal power by his attaining of mental mastery goes on unbroken water as if on earth 
And he not only goes but he adopts whatever posture he wishes
And not only earth but whatever else solid that he wants such as gems gold rocks trees etc he adverts to that and resolves and it becomes as he resolves
And that water becomes earth only for him it is water for anyone else And fishes and turtles and water birds go about there as they like
But if he wishes to make it earth for other people he does so too
When the time determined has elapsed it becomes water again
Seated crosslegged he travels he goes seated crosslegged
Like a winged bird like a bird furnished with wings
One who wants to do this should attain the earth kasiṇa and emerge Then if he wants to go crosslegged he should do the preliminary work and determine an area the size of a seat for sitting crosslegged on and he should resolve in the way already described
If he wants to go lying down he determines an area the size of a bed If he wants to go on foot he determines a suitable area the size of a path and he resolves in the way already described Let it be earth Simultaneously with the resolve it becomes earth
Here is the text
There is earth
He travels  stands sits and lies down in space in the sky
Just as men normally not possessed of supernormal power travel  stand sit and lie down on earth so this possessor of supernormal power by his attaining of mental mastery travels  stands sits and lies down in space in the sky 
And a bhikkhu who wants to travel in space should be an obtainer of the divine eye
Why
On the way there may be mountains trees etc that are temperatureoriginated or jealous nāgas supaṇṇas etc may create them He will need to be able to see these
But what should be done on seeing them
He should attain the basic jhāna and emerge and then he should do the preliminary work thus Let there be space and resolve
But the Elder Tipiṭaka CūḷaAbhaya said Friends what is the use of attaining the attainment Is not his mind concentrated Hence any area that he has resolved thus Let it be space is space
Though he spoke thus nevertheless the matter should be treated as described under the miracle of going unhindered through walls
Moreover he should be an obtainer of the divine eye for the purpose of descending in a secluded place for if he descends in a public place in a bathing place or at a village gate
So seeing with the divine eye he should avoid a place where there is no open space and descend in an open space
With his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so mighty and powerful here the might of the moon and sun should be understood to consist in the fact that they travel at an altitude of fortytwo thousand leagues and their power to consist in their simultaneous illuminating of three of the four continents
Or they are mighty because they travel overhead and give light as they do and they are powerful because of that same might
He touches he seizes or he touches in one place
Strokes he strokes all over as if it were the surface of a lookingglass
This supernormal power is successful simply through the jhāna that is made the basis for directknowledge there is no special kasiṇa attainment here
For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā
It is within hands reach
Sitting or lying down with his hand he touches makes contact with strokes the moon and sun
Just as men normally not possessed of supernormal power touch make contact with stroke some material object within hands reach so this possessor of supernormal power by his attaining of mental mastery sitting or lying down with his hands touches makes contact with strokes the moon and sun  If he wants to go and touch them he goes and touches them But if he wants to touch them here sitting or lying down he resolves Let them be within hands reach
Then he either touches them as they stand within hands reach when they have come by the power of the resolve like palmyra fruits loosened from their stalk or he does so by enlarging his hand
But when he enlarges his hand does he enlarge what is clung to or what is not clung to
He enlarges what is not clung to supported by what is clung to
Here the Elder Tipiṭaka CūḷaNāga said But friends why does what is clung to not become small and big too When a bhikkhu comes out through a keyhole does not what is clung to become small
And when he makes his body big does it not then become big as in the case of the Elder Mahā Moggallāna 
according as it is said When a mortal desires if his desire is fulfilled 
and likewise Renunciation succeeds  thus it is a success  It metamorphoses lust thus it is a metamorphosis  
The Arahant path succeeds thus it is a success  It metamorphoses all defilements thus it is a metamorphosis 
for effectiveness of the means succeeds with the production of the result intended
or a hundred or a thousand or a hundred thousand having adverted he resolves with knowledge Let me be many  is called success by resolve because it is produced by resolving the success shown in the exposition of the above summary thus 
for this is said The meaning as abandoning perception of permanence succeeds through contemplation of impermanence thus it is success by intervention of knowledge  The meaning as abandoning all defilements succeeds through the Arahant path thus it is success by intervention of knowledge
for this is said The meaning as abandoning the hindrances succeeds by means of the first jhāna thus it is success by intervention of concentration  The meaning as abandoning the base consisting of nothingness succeeds by means of the attainment of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception thus it is success by intervention of concentration
consequently he suffered no harm from the blow
Then put down the bow
The arrow fell at the kings feet
So the kings not daring to release the arrow was success by intervention of concentration in the laywoman Sāmāvatī
