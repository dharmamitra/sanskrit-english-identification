The armies of Wei are on the move in three divisions and I need your advice Gu Yong stood forth saying There is only one man fit to cope with the present need he is Lu Xun So Lu Xun was summoned and made Grand Commander General Who Pacifies the North CommanderinChief of all the State Armies including the Royal Corps of Guards and Associate Assistant in the Royal Duties He was given the White Banners and the Golden Axes which denoted imperial rank All officers civil and military were placed under his ordersMoreover Sun Quan personally stood beside him and held his whip while he mounted his steedHaving received all these marks of confidence and favor Lu Xun wanted two persons to be his assistantsSun Quan asked their names and Lu Xun said There are Zhu Huan General Who Fortifies Prowess and Quan Zong General Who Calms the South These two should be in command Sun Quan approved and appointed Zhu Huan and Quan Zong as Commander of the Left and Commander of the Right respectivelyThen the grand army comprising all the forces of the eightyone counties of the South Land and the levies of Jingzhou seven hundred thousand troops in total was assembled and marched out in three divisions Lu Xun in the center with Zhu Huan and Quan Zong supporting him left and right with the other two columnsThen said Zhu Huan Cao Xiu is neither able nor bold he holds office because he is of the blood He has fallen into the trap laid by Zhou Fang and marched too far to be able to withdrawIf the CommanderinChief will smite Cao Xiu must be defeatedDefeated he must flee along two roads one Jiashi on the left the other Guichi on the right both of which are precipitous and narrow Let me and my colleague go to prepare an ambush in these roads We will block them and so cut off their escapeIf this Cao Xiu could be captured and a hasty advance made success would be easy and sure We should get Shouchun whence Xuchang and Luoyang can be seenThis is the one chance in the thousand I do not think the plan good said Lu Xun I have a better one Zhu Huan resented the rejection of his scheme and went away angryLu Xun ordered Zhuge Jin and certain others to garrison Jiangling and oppose Sima Yi and made all other dispositions of forcesCao Xiu neared Huancheng and Zhou Fang came out of the city to welcome him and went to the generals tentCao Xiu said I received your letter and the memorandum which was most logical and sent it to His Majesty He has set in motion accordingly three armiesIt will be a great merit for you Sir if the South Land can be added to His Majestys dominionsPeople say you are insufficient in craft but I do not believe what they say for I think you will be true to me and not fail Zhou Fang wept He seized a sword from one of his escort and was about to kill himself but Cao Xiu stopped himStill leaning on the sword Zhou Fang said As to the seven things I mentioned my regret is that I cannot show you allYou doubt me because some persons from Wu and Wei have been poisoning your mind against meIf you heed them the only course for me is to dieHeaven only can make manifest my loyal heart Again he made to slay himselfBut Cao Xiu in trepidation threw his arms about him saying I did not mean it the words were uttered in jest Why do you act thus Upon this Zhou Fang with his sword cut off his hair and threw it on the ground saying I have dealt with you with sincerity Sir and you joke about itNow I have cut off the hair which I inherited from my parents in order to prove my sincerity Then Cao Xiu doubted no more but trusted him fully and prepared a banquet for him and when the feast was over Zhou Fang returned to his ownGeneral Jia Kui came to Cao Xiu and when asked whether there was any special reason for the visit he said I have come to warn you Commander to be cautious and wait till you and I can attack the enemy togetherThe whole army of Wu is encamped at Huancheng You mean you want to share in my victory sneered Cao XiuIt is said Zhou Fang cut off his hair as a pledge of sincerity that is only another bit of deceit According to the Spring and Autumn Annals Yao Li cut off his arm as a pledge of loyalty before he assassinated Qing Ji mutilation is no guarantee Do not trust Zhou Fang Why do you come to utter illomened words just as I am opening the campaignYou destroy the spirit of the army said Cao XiuIn his wrath he told the lictors to put Jia Kui to deathHowever the officers interceded saying Before the march killing our general is not favorable to the armyO General spare him until after the expedition And Jia Kui was reprieved but he was not assigned any part in the campaign and his troops were left in reserve Cao Xiu himself went away to the East PassWhen Zhou Fang heard that Jia Kui had been broken he rejoiced in his heart saying If Cao Xiu had attended to his words then Wu would have lostHeaven is good to me and is giving me the means of achieving great things Then he sent a secret messenger to Huancheng and Lu Xun knew that the time had come He assembled the officers for ordersLu Xun said Shiding lying over against us is a hilly country fit for preparing an ambushIt will be occupied as suitable to array our army and await the coming of WeiXu Sheng is to be leader of the van and the army will move there Now Cao Xiu told Zhou Fang to lead the way for his attackWhile on march Cao Xiu asked What is the place lying ahead Zhou Fang replied Shiding a suitable place to camp in So a great camp was made thereBut soon after the scouts reported that a very large number of soldiers of Wu had occupied the hills Cao Xiu began to feel alarmedZhou Fang said there were no soldiers why these preparations Cao Xiu hastily sought Zhou Fang to ask him and was told he had gone away with a few riders no one knew whitherI have been deceived and am in a trap said Cao Xiu now very repentant of his easy confidence However there is nothing to fear Then he made his arrangements to march against the enemy and when they were complete and the array drawn up Zhang Pu the leader of the van rode out and began to rail at the men of WuRebel leader come and surrender cried Zhang PuThen rode out Xu Sheng and fought with him But Zhang Pu was no match for Xu Sheng as was soon evident wherefore he led his troops to retire Xu Sheng is too strong said Zhang Pu when he saw Cao XiuThen will we defeat him by a surprise said Cao XiuHe sent Zhang Pu with twenty thousand troops to hide in the south of Shiding while another equal party under Xue Qiao was sent northAnd Cao Xiu arranged saying Tomorrow I will lead a thousand soldiers to provoke the troops of Wu into battle then I will feign defeat and lead them to the hills in the north when a bomb will explode and a threepronged ambush will bring us victory On the other side Lu Xun called his two generals Zhu Huan and Quan Zong and said Each of you is to lead thirty thousand troops and take a cross cut from Shiding to the enemys campGive a fire signal on arrival and then the main army will advance As evening fell these two moved out their troops and by the middle of the second watch both had got close to the camp of WeiZhang Pu Cao Xius general who was there in ambush did not recognize that the troops who approached him were enemies but went as to meet friends and was at once slain by the blade of Zhu HuanThe soldiers of Wei then fled and Zhu Huan lit his signal fires Quan Zong marching up came across the northern ambush under Xue Qiao Quan Zong began a battle at once and the troops of Wei were soon put to flightBoth the armies of Wu pursued and confusion reigned in Cao Xius camp troops fighting with others of their own side and slaying each otherCao Xiu despaired and fled toward JiashiXu Sheng with a strong force came along the high road and attackedAnd the soldiers of Wei killed were very many Those who escaped did so by abandoning all their armorsCao Xiu was in straits but he struggled along the Jiashi Road Here came a cohort into the road from the side It was led by Jia Kui Cao Xius alarm gave place to shame on meeting Jia KuiI took no notice of what you said and so this evil came upon me said heJia Kui replied Sir you should quickly get out of this road for if the troops of Wu block it we shall be in grave danger So Cao Xiu hastened while Jia Kui protected his retreatAnd Jia Kui ordered his soldiers to set flags and banners up among trees and in thickets and along bypaths so as to give an impression of having many men posted all round Wherefore when Xu Sheng came in pursuit he thought the country was full of ambushing men and dared not proceed far So he gave up the pursuit and retiredBy these means Cao Xiu was rescued and finally Sima Yi withdrew his army upon the news of Cao Xius defeatIn the meantime Lu Xun was awaiting news of victory Soon Xu Sheng Zhu Huan and Quan Zong came and reported their successes and they brought great spoil of carts and bullocks horses and mules and military material and weapons And they had also ten thousand prisonersThere was great rejoicing and Lu Xun with Zhou Fang led the army home into WuOn their return Sun Quan the Prince of Wu came out with a numerous cortege of officers to welcome the victors and an imperial umbrella was borne over the head of Lu Xun as they wended their way homewardWhen the officers presented their felicitations Sun Quan noticed that Zhou Fang had no hair and Sun Quan was very gracious to him saying This deed of yours and the sacrifice you made to attain it will surely be written in the histories He made Zhou Fang the Lord of the Gate WithinThen there were great feastings and greetings and much revelryLu Xun said Cao Xiu has been thoroughly beaten and the soldiers of Wei are cowedI think now is an occasion to send letters into Shu to advise Zhuge Liang to attack Wei Sun Quan agreed and letters were sentThe east successful in one fight Would unto war the west inciteThe next chapter will say if Zhuge Liang once more tried to overcome Wei CHAPTER  Sending A Second Memorial Zhuge Liang Renews The Attack On Wei Forging A Letter Jiang Wei Defeats The Northern ArmyIt was in the autumn of the sixth year of Beginning Prosperity  that the Wei army was defeated with very great loss by Lu Xun of Wu Cao Xius mortification brought on an illness from which he died in LuoyangBy command of Cao Rui the Ruler of Wei Cao Xiu received most honorable burialThen Sima Yi brought the army home again The other officers went to welcome him and asked The defeat of Commander Cao Xiu is also partly yours Why O General did you hurry home Sima Yi replied I came for reasons of strategy because of Zhuge Liangs probable intentionsIf he knows I have suffered a defeat he may try to attack ChanganThe whole west would be helpless if I did not return They listened and smiled for they thought he was afraidLetters from Wu came to Shu proposing a joint attack on Wei and detailing their recent victory In these letters two feelings were gratifiedthat of telling the story of their own grandeur and prowess and furthering the design of a treaty of peaceThe Latter Ruler was pleased and sent the letters to Zhuge Liang in HanzhongAt that time the army was in excellent state the soldiers hardy the horses strong There were plentiful supplies of all kinds Zhuge Liang was just going to propose a new warOn receipt of the letter he made a great banquet to discuss an expeditionA severe gale came on from the northeast and brought down a fir tree in front of the generals shelterIt was an inauspicious omen to all the officers and they were troubled Zhuge Liang cast lots to know what portent was intended and announced That gale signals the loss of a great leader They hardly believed himBut before the banquet ended two sons of Zhao Yun Zhao Tong and Zhao Guang came and wished to see the Prime MinisterZhuge Liang deeply affected threw aside his wine cup and cried That is it Zhao Yun is gone When the two young men came in they prostrated themselves and wept saying Our father died the night before at the third watch Zhuge Liang staggered and burst into lamentationMy friend is gone the country has lost it great beam and I my right arm Those about him joined in wiping away their tearsZhuge Liang bade the two young men go in person to Chengdu to bear the sad tidings to the Emperor And the Latter Ruler wept bitterlyZhao Yun was my savior and friend he saved my life when I was a child in the time of great confusion cried the Latter RulerAn edict was issued creating Zhao Yun Regent Marshal and Lord of Shunping and permitting burial on the east of Silky HillsA temple was ordered to his memory and sacrifices were offered in four seasonsFrom Changshan came a general tigerbold In wit and valor he was fitting mate For Guan Yu and Zhang Fei his exploits rivaling Even theirsRiver Han and Dangyang recall His nameTwice in his stalwart arms he bore The prince his wellloved leaders son and heir In storied page his name stands out writ largeFair record of most brave and loyal deedsThe Latter Ruler showed his affectionate gratitude to the late leader not only in according him most honorable burial but in kindness to his sonsThe elder Zhao Tong was made General in the Tiger Army and the younger Zhao Guang Station General He also set guards over the tomb When the two sons had left the ministers reported to the Latter RulerThe dispositions of the army are complete and the Prime Minister proposes to march against Wei without delay Talking this over with one and another the Latter Ruler found the courtiers much inclined to a cautious policy and somewhat fearfulAnd the doubts entered into the Latter Rulers mind so that he could not decideThen came a memorial from Zhuge Liang and the messenger Yang Yi was called into the presence and gave it to the Latter RulerThe Emperor spread it on the imperial table and readThe First Ruler was anxious lest the rebels should set up a rival empire and the legitimate Rulers domain be restricted Wherefore he laid upon me thy minister to destroy themMeasuring my powers by his perspicacity he knew that I should attack and oppose my talents inadequate as they might be to their strength for if I did not the royal domain would be destroyedIt was a question whether to await destruction without effort or to attackWherefore he assigned me the task confidently Thenceforward this task occupied all my thoughtsConsidering that the south should be made secure before the north could be attacked I braved the heat of summer and plunged deep into the wilds of the Mang nationsSparing not myself nor regarding privation urged by the one consideration that the royal domain should not be confined to the capital of Shu I faced dangers in obedience to the First Rulers behestBut there are critics who may say that I failedNow the rebels have been weakened in the west and have become involved in the east The rule of war is to take advantage of the enemys weakness and so now is the time to attack I shall discuss the various circumstances in orderThe enlightenment of the Founder of the Hans Liu Bang rivaled the glory of the sun and moon his counselors were profound as the ocean abyss Nevertheless he trod a hazardous path and suffered losses only attaining repose after passing through great dangers Your Majesty does not reach his level nor do your counselors equal Zhang Liang and Chen PingYet while we desired victory we would sit idle waiting till the empire should become settled This attitude is beyond my comprehensionImperial Protector Liu Yao and Governor Wang Lang each occupied a territory They passed their time in talking of tranquillity and discussing plans quoting the sayings of the sages till they were filled with doubts and obsessed with difficultiesSo this year was not the time to fight nor next year the season to punish and thus talking it came about that Sun Ce grew powerful and possessed himself of all the South Land This sort of behavior I cannot understandIn craft Cao Cao surpassed all humans He could wield armies like the great strategists of old Sun Zi and Wu Qi Yet he was surrounded in Nanyang was in danger at Wuchao was in difficulties at Qilian was hard pressed in Liyang was nearly defeated at Beishan and nearly killed at Tong Pass Yet after all these experiences there was a temporary and artificial state of equilibriumHow much less can I a man of feeble powers bring about a decision without running risks I fail to understandCao Cao failed in five attacks on Changba and four times crossed Lake Chaohu without success He employed Li Fu who betrayed him and put his trust in Xiahou Yuan who was defeated and died The First Ruler always regarded Cao Cao as an able man and yet Cao Cao made such mistakesHow then can I in my wornout condition necessarily conquer I do not understand whyOnly one year has elapsed since I went into Hanzhong yet we have lost Zhao Yun Yang Qun Ma Yu Yan Zhi Ding Li Bo Shou Liu He Deng Tong and others and leaders of rank and generals of stations to the number of near eighty all people unsurpassed in dash and valor and more than a thousand of the specialized forces of horse and trained cavalry of the Sou and the Tangut tribespeople in the Gobi Desert whose martial spirit we have fostered these ten years all about us and not only in one regionIf we delay much longer twothirds of this will have dissipated and how then shall we meet the situation I do not understand delayThe people are poor and the army exhausted indeed and confusion does not ceaseIf confusion does not cease then whether we go on or stand still the drain is the same Yet it seems that attack should not be made yetIs it that the rebels are to be allowed to obtain a permanent hold on some territory I do not understand the argumentsA stable condition of affairs is indeed difficult to obtainOnce when the First Ruler was defeated in Jingzhou Cao Cao patted himself on the back and said that the empire was settledYet after that the First Ruler obtained the support of Wu and Yue on the east took Ba and Shu on the west and undertook an expedition to the north wherein Xiahou Yuan lost his life So Cao Cao calculations proved erroneous and the affairs of Han seemed about to prosperBut still later Wu proved false to pledges our Guan Yu was defeated we sustained a check at Ziguiand Cao Pi assumed the imperial style Such events prove the difficulty of forecastI shall strive on to the end but the final result whether success or failure whether gain or loss is beyond my powers to foresee The Latter Ruler was convinced and by edict directed Zhuge Liang to start on the expeditionZhuge Liang marched out with three hundred thousand welltrained soldiers Wei Yan leading the first division and made all haste to ChencangThe news soon reached Luoyang and Sima Yi informed the Ruler of Wei who called his councilThen Cao Zhen stepped forth and said I failed to hold Xizhou and my disgrace is terrible to bearBut now I beg to be given another command that I may capture Zhuge LiangLately I have found a stalwart soldier for a leader a man who wields a ninetypound sword rides a swift and savage steed bends the threehundredpound bow and carries hidden about him when he goes into battle three meteor maces with which his aim is certain So valorous is he that none dare stand against him He comes from Didao in Xizhou and is named Wang ShuangI would recommend him for my leader of the van Cao Rui approved at once and summoned this marvel to the hallThere came a tall man with a dusky complexion hazel eyes strong as a bear in the hips and with a back supple as a tigersNo need to fear anything with such a man said Cao Rui laughingHe gave the new hero rich presents a silken robe and golden breastplate and gave him the title General Who Possesses the Tiger Majesty And he became leader of the van of the new armyCao Zhen was appointed CommanderinChief Cao Zhen took leave of his master and left the courtHe collected his one hundred fifty thousand veterans and in consultation with Guo Huai and Zhang He decided upon the strategic points to be guarded The first companies of the army of Shu sent out their scouts as far as Chencang They came back and reported A rampart has been built and behind it is a general named Hao Zhao in command The rampart is very strong and is further defended by thorny barriersInstead of taking Chencang which seems difficult it would be easier to go out to Qishan by the Taibo Mountains where is a practicable though winding road But Zhuge Liang said Due north of Chencang is Jieting so that I must get this city in order to advance Wei Yan was sent to surround Chencang and take itHe went but days passed without success Therefore he returned and told his chief the place was impregnableIn his anger Zhuge Liang was going to put Wei Yan to death but an officer stepped forth and said I have followed the Prime Minister for a long time but have not achieved worthy serviceNow I want to go to Chencang and persuade Hao Zhao to yield thus our army does not need to use a single bow or arrow Others turned their attention to Counselor Jin XiangHow do you think you will persuade him said Zhuge LiangWhat will you say Hao Zhao and I are both from Xizhou and pledged friends from boyhoodIf I can get to see him I will so lay matters before him that he must surrender Jin Xiang got permission to try and rode quickly to the wall of ChencangThen he called out Friend Hao Zhao your old chum Jin Xiang has come to see you A sentry on the wall told Hao Zhao who bade them let the visitor enter and bring him up on the wallFriend why have you come asked Hao ZhaoI am in the service of Shu serving under Zhuge Liang as an assistant in the tactical departmentI am created exceedingly well and my chief has sent me to say something to you Hao Zhao was rather annoyed and said Zhuge Liang is my enemy I serve Wei while you serve Shu Each serves his own lordWe were brothers once but now we are enemies so do not say any more And the visitor was requested to take his leaveJin Xiang tried to reopen the conversation but Hao Zhao left him and went up on the towerThe Wei soldiers hurried Jin Xiang on to his horse and led him to the gateAs he passed out he looked up and saw his friend leaning on the guard railHe pulled up his horse pointed with his whip at Hao Zhao and said My friend and worthy brother why has your friendship become so thin Brother you know the laws of Wei replied Hao ZhaoI have accepted their bounty and if that leads to death so be itSay no more but return quickly to your master and tell him to come and attack I am not afraid So Jin Xiang had to return and report failure He would not let me begin to explain said heTry again said Zhuge LiangGo and really talk to him So the gobetween soon found himself once more at the foot of the wallHao Zhao presently appeared on the tower and Jin Xiang shouted to him My worthy brother please listen to my words while I explain clearly Here you are holding one single city how can you think of opposing one hundred thousand troopsIf you do not yield you will be sorry when it is too lateInstead of serving the great Hans you are serving a depraved country called Wei Why do you not recognize the decree of Heaven Why do you not distinguish between the pure and the foulThink over it Then Hao Zhao began to get really angry He fitted an arrow to his bow and he called out Go Or I will shoot I meant what I said at first and I will say no more Again Jin Xiang returned and reported failure to Zhuge LiangThe fool is very illmannered said Zhuge LiangDoes he think he can beguile me into sparing the city He called up some of the local people and asked about the forces in the cityThey told him about three thousandI do not think such a small place can beat me said Zhuge LiangAttack quickly before any reinforcements can arrive Thereupon the assailants brought up scaling ladders upon the platforms of which ten or more men could stand These were surrounded by planks as protectionThe other soldiers had short ladders and ropes and at the beat of the drum they attempted to scale the wallsBut when Hao Zhao saw the ladders being brought up he made his soldiers shoot firearrows at them Zhuge Liang did not expect thisHe knew the city was not well prepared for defense and he had had the great ladders brought up and bade the soldiers take the wall with a rushHe was greatly chagrined when the fire arrows set his ladders on fire and so many of his soldiers were burned And as the arrows and stones rained down from the wall the soldiers of Shu were forced to retireZhuge Liang angrily said So you burn my ladders then I will use battering rams So the rams were brought and placed against the walls and again the signal given for assaultBut the defenders brought up great stones suspended by ropes which they swung down at the battering rams and so broke them to piecesNext the besiegers set to work to bring up earth and fill the moat and Liao Hua led three thousand soldiers to excavate a tunnel under the rampartsBut Hao Zhao cut a countertrench within the city and turned that device So the struggle went on for near a month and still the city was not taken Zhuge Liang was very depressed That was not allThe scouts reported the coming of a relief force of Wei the flags of which bore the name of Wang ShuangSome one had to try to turn him back and Wei Yan offered himselfNo said Zhuge Liang you are too valuable as Leader of the Van General Xie Xiong offered his services they were accepted and Xie Xiong was given three thousand troopsAfter he had gone Zhuge Liang decided to send a second force and for command of this General Gong Qi volunteered and was acceptedGong Qi also had three thousand troopsThen Zhuge Liang feared lest there would be a sortie from the city to aid the relief force just arriving so he led off the army seven miles and made a campThe first body sent against Wang Shuang had no success Xie Xiong fell almost immediately under Wang Shuangs great swordThe men fled and Wang Shuang pursued and so came upon Gong Qi who had come to support his colleagueGong Qi met a similar fate being slain in the third boutWhen the defeated parties returned Zhuge Liang was anxious and called up Liao Hua Wang Ping and Zhang Ni to go out to check this Wang Shuang They went and drew up in formal array and then Zhang Ni rode to the frontWang Shuang rode to meet him and they two fought several bouts Then Wang Shuang ran away and Zhang Ni followedHis colleague Wang Ping suspected this flight was but a ruse so he called to Zhang Ni Do not follow the fleeing general Wang Shuang then turned and hurled one of his meteor hammers which hit Zhang Ni in the back so that he fell forward and lay over the saddleWang Shuang rode on to follow up this advantage but Liao Hua and Wang Ping poured out and checked himWang Shuangs whole force then came on and slew many of the troops of Shu Zhang Ni was hurt internally and vomited blood at timesHe came back and told Zhuge Liang saying Wang Shuang is very terrible and no one can stand up to himBeside there is a strong camp at the city with double walls and a deep moat Having lost two generals and a third being wounded Zhuge Liang called up Jiang Wei and said We are stopped this way can you suggest another road Yes said Jiang Wei Chencang is too well protected and with Hao Zhao as defender and Wang Shuang as supporter cannot be taken I would propose to move away to some suitable place and make a strong campThen try to hold the roads so that the attack on Jieting may be preventedThen if you will send a strong force against Qishan I can do something which will capture Cao Zhen Zhuge Liang agreedHe sent Wang Ping and Li Hui to hold the narrow road to Jieting and Wei Yan was sent to guard the way from ChencangAnd then the army marched out of the Xie Valley by a small road and made for QishanNow Cao Zhen still remembered bitterly that in the last campaign Sima Yi had filched from him the credit he hoped to obtain So when he received the commission of defending the capitals against the invading forces he detached Guo Huai and Sun Li and sent them to hold positions east and westThen he had heard that Chencang was threatened so had sent Wang Shuang to its relief and now to his joy he heard of his henchmans successHe placed Grand Commander Fei Yao in command of the van and stationed other generals at strategic and commanding pointsThen they caught a spyHe was taken into the presence of the CommanderinChief to be questionedThe man knelt down and said I am not really a spy in the bad senseI was bringing a secret communication for you Sir but I was captured by one of the parties in ambushPray send away your attendants The mans bonds were loosed and the tent clearedThe captive said I am a confidant of Jiang Wei who has entrusted me with a secret letter Where is the letter The man took it from among his garments and presented it to Cao Zhen who read I Jiang Wei your guilty general make a hundred prostrations to the great leader Cao Zhen now in the fieldI have never forgotten that I was in the employment of Wei and disgraced myself having enjoyed favors I never repaid themLately I have been an unhappy victim of Zhuge Liangs wiles and so fell into the depthsBut I never forgot my old allegiance how could I forgetNow happily the army of Shu has gone west and Zhuge Liang trusts meI rely upon your leading an army this way If resistance be met then you may simulate defeat and retire but I shall be behind and will make a blaze as signalThen I shall set fire to their stores whereupon you will face about and attack Zhuge Liang ought to fall into your handsIf it be that I cannot render service and repay my debt to the state then punish me for my former crimeIf this should be deemed worthy of your attention then without delay communicate your commands The letter pleased Cao Zhen and he said This is heavensent help to aid me in an achievement Cao Zhen rewarded the messenger and bade him return to say that it was acceptedThen he called Fei Yao to his councils and said I have just had a secret letter from Jiang Wei telling me to act in a certain fashion But Fei Yao replied Zhuge Liang is very crafty and Jiang Wei is very knowingIf by chance Zhuge Liang has planned all this and sent this man we may fall into a snare But Jiang Wei is really a man of Wei he was forced into surrender Why are you suspicious My advice is not to go but to remain here on guardLet me go to meet this man and any service I can accomplish will redound to your creditAnd if there be any craft I can meet it for you Cao Zhen approved this and bade Fei Yao take fifty thousand troops by way of the Xie ValleyFei Yao marched away and halted after the second or third stage and send out scoutsThis was done and the scouts reported that the Shu army was coming through the valleyFei Yao at once advanced but before the troops of Shu got into contact with him they retired Fei Yao pursuedThen the troops of Shu came on againJust as Fei Yao was forming up for battle the Shu army retreated again And these maneuvers were repeated thrice and a day and a night passed without any repose for the Wei armyAt length rest was imperative and they were on the point of entrenching themselves to prepare food when a great hubbub arose all around and with beating of drums and blaring of trumpets the whole country was filled with the soldiers of ShuSuddenly there was a stir near by the great standard and out came a small fourwheeled chariot in which sat Zhuge Liang He bade a herald call the leader of the Wei army to a parleyFei Yao rode out and seeing Zhuge Liang he secretly rejoicedTurning to those about him he said If the soldiers of Shu come on you are to retire and look out for a signal If you see a blaze you are to turn and attack for you will be reinforced by Jiang Wei Then Fei Yao rode to the front and shouted You rebel leader in front there how dare you come here again after the last defeat Zhuge Liang replied Go and call Cao Zhen to a parley My chief Cao Zhen is of the royal stock think you that he will come to parley with rebels Zhuge Liang angrily waved his fan and there came forth Ma Dai and Zhang Ni and their troops with a rushThe Wei army retiredBut ere they had gone far they saw a blaze in the rear of the advancing host of Shu and heard a great shoutingFei Yao could only conclude that this was the signal of Jiang Wei he was looking for and so he faced about to attackBut the enemy also turned about and retiredFei Yao led the pursuit sword in hand hastening to the point whence the shouting cameNearing the signal fire the drums beat louder than ever and then out came two armies one under Guan Xing and the other under Zhang Bao while arrows and stones rained from the hilltopsThe Wei troops could not stand it and knew not only they were beaten but beaten by a ruseFei Yao tried to withdraw his force into the shelter of the valley to rest but the enemy pressed on him and the army of Wei fell into confusion Pressing upon each other many fell into the streams and were drownedFei Yao could do nothing but flee for his life Just as he was passing by a steep hill there appeared a cohort and the leader was Jiang Wei Fei Yao began to upbraid him crying Faithless ingrateI have haplessly fallen in your treachery and craftiness Jiang Wei replied You are the wrong victim we meant to capture Cao Zhen not youYou would do well to yield But Fei Yao only galloped away toward a ravineSuddenly the ravine filled with flame Then he lost all hopeThe pursuers were close behind so Fei Yao with a sword put an end to his own life Of the army of Wei many surrenderedThe Shu army pressed home their advantage and hastening forward reached Qishan and made a camp There the army was mustered and put in order Jiang Wei received a reward but he was chagrined that Cao Zhen had not been takenMy regret is that I did not slay Cao Zhen said he Indeed yes replied Zhuge LiangIt is a pity that a great scheme should have had so poor a result Cao Zhen was very sad when he heard of the loss of Fei YaoHe consulted Guo Huai as to a new plan to drive back the enemyMeanwhile flying messengers had gone to the capital with news of Zhuge Liangs arrival at Qishan and the defeat Cao Rui called Sima Yi to ask for a plan to meet these new conditionsI have a scheme all ready not only to turn back Zhuge Liang but to do so without any exertion on our partThey will retire of their own will Cao Zhens wits are dull so he Fights on Sima Yis strategyThe strategy will appear in the next chapter CHAPTER Pursuing The Shu Army Wang Shuang Meets His Death Raiding Chencang Zhuge Liang Scores A Victory Now Sima Yi spoke to the Ruler of Wei saying I have said repeatedly that Zhuge Liang would come against us by way of Chencang wherefore I set Hao Zhao to guard itIf an enemy did invade he could easily obtain his supplies by that road but with Hao Zhao and Wang Shuang on guard there he will not dare to come that wayIt is very difficult to get supplies any other wayTherefore I can give the invaders a month to exhaust their food Hence their advantage lies in forcing a battle ours is postponing it as long as possibleWherefore I pray Your Majesty order Cao Zhen to hold passes and positions tenaciously and on no account to seek battleIn a month the enemy will have to retreat and that will be our opportunity Cao Rui was pleased to hear so succinct a statement but he said Since Noble Sir you foresaw all this so plainly why did you not lead an army to prevent it It is not because I grudged the effort but I had to keep the army here to guard against Lu Xun of WuSun Quan will declare himself Emperor before longIf he does he will be afraid of Your Majestys attack and so he will try to invade us first I shall be ready to defend our frontierThe army is prepared Just then one of the courtiers announced dispatches from Cao Zhen on military affairs and Sima Yi closed his speech saying Your Majesty should send someone especially to caution the general to be careful not to be tricked by Zhuge Liang not to pursue rashly and never to penetrate deeply into the enemy country The Ruler of Wei gave the order and he sent the command by the hand of Minister Han Ji and gave him authority to warn Cao Zhen against giving battleSima Yi escorted the royal messenger out of the city and at parting said I am giving this magnificent opportunity to obtain glory to Cao Zhen but do not tell him the suggestion was mine only quote the royal commandTell him that defense is the best pursuit is to be most cautious and he is not to send any impetuous leader to follow up the enemy Han Ji agreed and took leaveCao Zhen was deep in affairs connected with his army when they brought news of a royal messenger but he went forth to bid Han Ji welcome and when the ceremonial receipt of the edict had come to an end he retired to discuss matters with Guo Huai and Sun LiThat is Sima Yis idea said Guo Huai with a laughBut what of the idea asked Cao ZhenIt means that the man who perfectly understands Zhuge Liangs plans and who will eventually have to be called in to defeat them is our friend Sima Yi But if the Shu army holds its ground We will send Wang Shuang to reconnoiter and keep on the move along the byroads so that they dare not attempt to bring up suppliesThey must retreat when they have no more to eat and we shall be able to beat them Then said Sun Li Let me go out to Qishan as if to escort a convoy from Xizhou only the carts shall be laden with combustibles instead of grain We will sprinkle sulfur and saltpeter over wood and reedsThe troops of Shu who lack supplies will surely seize the convoy and take it to their own camp when we will set fire to the cartsWhen they are blazing our hidden men can attack It seems an excellent plan said Cao Zhen And he issued the requisite ordersSun Li to pretend to escort a convoy Wang Shuang to prowl about the byroads Guo Huai and various generals to command in the Chi Valley Jieting and other strategic pointsAlso Zhang Hu son of Zhang Liao was made leader of the van and Yue Chen son of Yue Jin was his second These two were to remain on guard in the outermost campNow at Qishan Zhuge Liang sought to bring on a battle and daily sent champions to provoke a combat But the men of Wei would not come outThen Zhuge Liang called Jiang Wei and certain others to him and said I do not know what to do The enemy refuse battle because they know we are short of foodWe can get none by way of Chencang and all other roads are very difficultI reckon the grain we brought with us will not last a month While thus perplexed they heard that many carts of provisions for Wei were passing by from Xizhou and the convoy was commanded by Sun Li What is known of this Sun Li asked Zhuge LiangA certain man of Wei replied He is a bold man Once he was out hunting with the Ruler of Wei on Great Rock Hill and a tiger suddenly appeared in front of his masters chariot He jumped off his horse and dispatched the beast with his sword He was rewarded with a leadershipHe is an intimate friend of Cao Zhen This is a ruse said Zhuge LiangThey know we are short of food and those carts are only a temptation They are laden with combustiblesHow can they imagine that I shall be deceived by this sort of thing when I have fought them with fire so many timesIf we go to seize the convoy they will come and raid our campBut I will meet ruse with ruse Then Zhuge Liang sent Ma Dai with order You and three thousand troops are to make your way to the enemys store camp and when the wind serves to start a fireWhen the stores are burning the soldiers of Wei will come to surround our campThat is how we will provoke a battle He also sent Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni with five thousand troops each to halt near the camp so that they might attack from withoutThese having gone he called Guan Xing and Zhang Bao and said The outermost camp of Wei is on the main roadThis night when the enemy see a blaze our camp will be attacked so you two are to lie in wait on the two sides of the Wei camp and seize it when they have left Calling Wu Ban and Wu Yi he said You are to lie in wait outside the camp to cut off the retreat of the force of Wei All these arrangements made Zhuge Liang betook himself to the summit of the Qishan Mountains to watch the resultsThe soldiers of Wei heard that their enemies were coming to seize the grain convoy and ran to tell Sun Li who sent on a message to Cao ZhenCao Zhen sent to the chief camp to Zhang Hu and Yue Chen and told them to look out for a signal blaze that would mean the coming of the army of Shu and then they were to raid the Shu camp immediatelyWatchers were sent on the tower to look out for the promised blazeMeanwhile Sun Li marched over and hid in the west hills to await the coming of the men of ShuThat night at the second watch Ma Dai came with his three thousand troops all silent the soldiers with gags the horses with a lashing round their muzzlesThey saw tier after tier of carts on the hills making an enclosure like a walled camp and on the carts were planted many flagsThey waited Presently the southwest wind came up and then they launched the fire Soon all the carts were in a blaze that lit up the skySun Li saw the blaze and could only conclude that the troops of Shu had arrived and his own side were giving the signal so he dashed out to attackBut soon two parties of soldiers were heard behind him closing in These were Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni who soon had Sun Li as in a net Then he heard a third ominous roll of drums which heralded the approach of Ma Dai from the direction of the blazeUnder these several attacks the troops of Wei quailed and gave wayThe fire grew more and more fierce Soldiers ran and horses stampeded and the dead were too many to countSun Li made a dash through the smoke and fire of the battle and got awayWhen Zhang Hu and Yue Chen saw the fire they threw open the gates of their camp and sallied forth to help defeat the army of Shu by seizing their camp But when they reached the Shu camp they found it empty So they hurried to set out to returnThat was the moment for Wu Ban and Wu Yi to appear and cut off their retreat However they fought bravely and got throughBut when at length they reached their own camp they were met by arrows flying thick as locusts For Guan Xing and Zhang Bao had taken possession in their absenceThey could only set out for headquarters to report their mishap As they neared Cao Zhens camp they met another remnant marching upThey were Sun Lis soldiers and the two parties went into camp together and told the tale of their victimizationCao Zhen thereafter looked to his defenses and attacked no moreThus victorious the soldiers of Shu went to Zhuge Liang who at once dispatched secret directions to Wei Yan Then Zhuge Liang gave orders to break camp and retreatThis move was not understood and Yang Yi asked the leader O Minister you have just scored a victory and the enemy have lost their bravery why retreat Because we are short of food said Zhuge LiangOur success lay in swift victory but the enemy will not fight and thus they weaken us day by dayThough we have worsted them now they will soon be reinforced and their light horse can cut off our provisions Then we could not retreat at allFor a time they will not dare look at us and we must take the occasion to do what they do not expect and retreatBut I am solicitous about Wei Yan who is on the Chencang road to keep off Wang Shuang I fear he cannot get awayI have sent him certain orders to slay Wang Shuang and then the force of Wei will not dare to pursue So the retreat began but to deceive the enemy the watchmen were left in the empty camp to beat the watches through the nightCao Zhen was depressed at his recent misfortune Then they told him Zhang He had come Zhang He came up to the gate dismounted and enteredWhen he saw Cao Zhen he said I have received a royal command to come and to be into your arrangements Did you take leave of friend Sima Yi asked Cao ZhenZhang He said His instructions to me were to stay away if you were victor to come if you were not It seems that our side has missed successHave you since found out what the troops of Shu are doing Not yet So Cao Zhen sent out some scouts and they found empty campsThere were flags flying but the army had been gone two daysCao Zhen was disgustedWhen Wei Yan received his secret orders he broke up camp that night and hastened toward HanzhongWang Shuangs scouts heard this and told their chief who hurried in pursuitAfter about seven miles he came in sight of Wei Yans ensignsAs soon as he got within hailing distance he shouted Do not flee Wei Yan But no one looked back so he again pressed forwardThen he heard one of his guards behind him shouting There is a blaze in the camp outside the wall I think it is some wile of the enemy Wang Shuang pulled up and turning saw the fire He therefore tried to draw off his troopsJust as he passed a hill a horseman suddenly came out of a wood Here is Wei Yan shouted the horsemanWang Shuang was too startled to defend himself and fell at the first stroke of Wei Yans bladeWang Shuangs troops thought this was only the beginning of an ambush and serious attack so they scattered but really Wei Yan only had thirty men with him and they moved off leisurely toward HanzhongNo man could better Zhuge Liangs foresight keen Brilliant as a comet where it flashedBack and forth at will his soldiers dashed And Wang Shuangs dead body marked where they had beenThe secret orders sent to Wei Yan was that he was to keep back thirty men and hide beside Wang Shuangs camp till that warrior leftThen the camp was to be set on fire After that the thirty were to wait till Wang Shuangs return to fall upon himThe plan being successfully carried out Wei Yan followed the retreating army into Hanzhong and handed over his commandThe Shu army having retreated safely to Hanzhong feastings were held in celebration of the eventZhang He who failing to come up with the retiring enemy presently returned to camp Hao Zhao sent a letter to say that Wang Shuang had met his endThis loss caused Cao Zhen deep grief so that he became ill and had to return to LuoyangHe left Zhang He Sun Li and Guo Huai to guard the approaches to ChanganAt a court held by Sun Quan the Prince of Wu a certain spy reported the doings in the west and the damages Wei had suffered in Zhuge Liangs expeditionsThereupon certain ministers urged on Sun Quan that he should attack Wei and try to gain the Middle Land However Sun Quan could not make up his mind and Zhang Zhao endeavored to prove to him that his hour was come by this memorialI have heard that a phoenix has lately appeared in the hills east of Wuchang and bowed that a yellow dragon has been seen in the Great RiverMy lord your virtue matches that of Kings Tang and Yu and your understanding is on a level with that of Kings Wu and Wen Wherefore you should now proceed to the imperial style and then raise an army to maintain your authority And many other officers supported Zhang Zhaos proposalThey finally persuaded Sun Quan to decide upon the tiger day in the forth month in summerThey prepared an altar on the south of Wuchang and on that day his courtiers formally requested him to ascend to the high place and assume the style of Emperor Yellow Dragon was chosen as the style of the reignSun Jian the deceased father of the new Emperor was given the title of the Martially Glorious Emperor his mother Empress Wu and his elder brother Sun Ce was made posthumously Prince of Changsha and his son Sun Deng was styled Heir ApparentThe rank of Left Companion of the Heir Apparent was conferred upon the eldest son of Zhuge Jin Zhuge Ke The rank of Right Companion of the Heir Apparent was bestowed upon the second son of Zhang Zhao Zhang XiuThis son of Zhuge Jin was a person below middle height but very clever and especially apt at capping versesSun Quan liked him muchWhen Zhuge Ke was six he went with his father to a banquetSun Quan noticed that Zhuge Jin had a long face so he bade a man lead in a donkey and he wrote on it with chalk My friend Zhuge Jin Every one roared with laughterBut the youngster ran up and added a few strokes making it read My friend Zhuge Jins donkey The guests were astonished at his ready wit and praised himSun Quan was also pleased and made him a present of the donkeyAnother day at a large official banquet Sun Quan sent the boy with a goblet of wine to each courtierWhen he came to Zhang Zhao the old man declined it saying This is not the proper treatment for old age Can you not make him drink said Sun QuanThen said Zhuge Ke to the old gentleman You remember Father Lu Wang he was ninety and yet gripped the signaling flags and wielded the axes of an army commander in the field He never spoke of ageNowadays in battle we put seniors behind but at the banquet board we give them a front placeHow can you say we do not treat old age properly Zhang Zhao had no reply ready and so had to drinkThis sort of precocity endeared the boy to Sun Quan and now Sun Quan made him the Left Companion to the Heir ApparentZhang Zhaos son Zhang Xiu was chosen for honor on account of the eminent services of his fatherThen Gu Yong became Prime Minister and Lu Xun Regent Marshal And Lu Xun assisted the Heir Apparent in the custody of WuchangAs Sun Quan seemed powerful and well established the whole of his court turned their thoughts toward the suppression of Wei Only Zhang Zhao opposed it and tendered counsels of internal reformIt is not well to begin Your Majestys new reign with fighting rather improve learning and hide the sword establish schools and so give the people the blessings of peaceMake a treaty with Shu to share the empire and lay your plans slowly and carefully Sun Quan saw the wisdom of the adviceHe sent an envoy into the Lands of Rivers to lay the scheme of an alliance before the Latter RulerThe Latter Ruler called his courtiers to discuss itMany were opposed to Sun Quan as an upstart usurper and advised rejection of any friendly proposals from himThen Jiang Wan said they might get the opinion of Zhuge Liang So they sent and put the matter before the Prime MinisterZhuge Liang said Send an envoy with presents and felicitations and ask Sun Quan to send Lu Xun against WeiThen Sima Yi will be engaged with Wu and I may once more march to Qishan and attempt Capital Changan Wherefore the Chair of the Secretariat Chen Zhen was sent with presents of horses and a jeweled belt and gold and pearls and precious things into the South Land to congratulate the Ruler of Wu on his newly assumed dignityAnd the presents were accepted and the bearer thereof honored and allowed to returnWhen this was all over Sun Quan called in Lu Xun and asked his opinion about the concerted attack on Wei Lu Xun saw through the scheme at onceWe owe this to Zhuge Liangs fear of Sima Yi said heHowever we must consent since Shu asks itWe will make a show of raising an army and in a measure support themWhen Zhuge Liang has actually attacked Wei we will make for the Middle Land ourselves Orders went forth for enlisting and training Jingzhou soldiers ready for an expedition to start presentlyWhen Chen Zhen returned to Hanzhong and reported to the Prime Minister Zhuge Liang was still worried that he could not advanced by the road through ChencangSoon after this however scouts brought the news that the able defender of the city Hao Zhao was very ill That means success for me cried he cheeringHe called in Wei Yan and Jiang Wei and said Take five thousand troops and hasten to ChencangIf you see a blaze then attack They could hardly believe the order was meant and came again to see their chief and asked the exact date of departureIn three days you should be ready to marchDo not come to take leave of me but set out as soon as possible After they had left his tent he summoned Guan Xing and Zhang Bao and gave them secret instructionsNow when Guo Huai heard that the commander of Chencang was ill he and Zhang He talked over the matter Guo Huai said Hao Zhao is very ill you would better go and relieve himI will report to the capital what we have done that they may arrange So Zhang He started with his three thousand troops to relieve the sick manHao Zhao was indeed at the point of death and suddenly they told him that the army of Shu had reached the wallsHao Zhao roused himself and bade them go on the rampartsBut then fire broke out at each gate a panic spread in the city and the noise of the confusion startled the dying man so that he passed away just as the troops of Shu were bursting inWhen Wei Yan and Jiang Wei reached the walls they were perplexed to find no sign of life No flags were flying and no watchmen struck the hours They delayed their attack for a timeThen they heard a bomb and suddenly the wall was thick with flags and there appeared the wellknown figure of the ministerYou have come too late cried Zhuge LiangBoth dropped out of the saddle and prostrated themselves Really you are supernatural O Minister they criedThey entered the city and then he explained to them saying I heard the news that Hao Zhao was seriously sick so I sent you with the deadline of three days as a blind to calm the people of this cityThen I hid myself in the ranks of another force under Guan Xing and Zhang Bao which came to Chencang by double marchesAlso I had sent spies into the city to start the fires and throw the defenders into confusionAn army without a leader could never fight and I could take the city easilyThis is an instance of the rule of war Do the unexpected attack the unprepared They bowedIn commiseration Zhuge Liang sent all the family of Hao Zhao and his coffin over to Wei thus showing his sense of the dead mans loyaltyTurning once more to Wei Yan and Jiang Wei he said But do not divest yourself of your armorGo and attack San Pass and drive away the guards while they are in a state of surpriseIf you delay Wei will have sent reinforcements They wentSurely enough the capture of San Pass was easy as the Wei soldiers scatteredBut when they went up to look around they saw a great cloud of dust moving toward them the reinforcements were already nearThey remarked to each other The Prime Ministers foresight was superhuman When they had looked a little longer they saw the leader of the Wei army then approaching was Zhang HeThey then divided their soldiers to hold the approaches When Zhang He saw that all was prepared he retiredWei Yan followed and fought a battle defeating Zhang He heavilyWei Yan sent to report his success but Zhuge Liang had already left Chencang and had gone into the Xie Valley to capture the county of JianweiOther armies from Shu followedMoreover the Latter Ruler sent Chen Shi to assist in the campaignZhuge Liang then marched his main force to Qishan and there made a camp Then he called an assembly of officersTwice have I gone out by Qishan without success but at last I am here I think Wei will resume the former battle ground and oppose usIf so they will assume that I shall attack Yongcheng and Meicheng and send armies to defend themBut I see Yinping and Wudu are connected with Hanzhong and if I can win these I can drive a wedge into the Wei forceWho will go to take these places Jiang Wei and Wang Ping offered themselvesThe former was sent with ten thousand troops to capture Wudu the latter with an equal force went to YinpingZhang He went back to Changan and saw Guo Huai and Sun Li to whom he said Chencang is lost Hao Zhao is dead San Pass is taken and Zhuge Liang is again at Qishan and thence has sent out two armies Guo Huai was frightened saying In that case Yongcheng and Meicheng are in danger Leaving Zhang He to guard Changan he sent Sun Li to Yongcheng and he himself set out at once for Meicheng He sent an urgent report to Luoyang At Weis next court the Emperor was informed of all the misfortunes in the west and the threats in the eastMan Chong said Sun Quan has declared himself Emperor and Lu Xun is drilling his army in WuchangAn invasion from the east can be expected soon Cao Rui was embarrassed and frightenedCao Zhen being ill could not be consulted and Sima Yi was called He was ready with a proposalIn my humble opinion Wu will not attack us said Sima YiWhat makes you think so asked the Ruler of Wei Because Zhuge Liang still resents and wishes to avenge the event at Xiaoting He never ceases to desire to absorb Wu His only fear is that we may swoop down upon Shu That is why there is an alliance with WuLu Xun knows it also quite well and he is only making a show of raising an army as they arranged The truth is he is sitting on the fenceHence Your Majesty may disregard the menace on the east and only protect yourself against Shu Your insight is very profound said the Ruler of WeiSima Yi was created CommanderinChief of all the forces in the west and the Ruler of Wei directed a courtier to go to Cao Zhen for the sealI would rather go myself said Sima YiSo he left the audience and went to the palace of Cao Zhen where presently he saw the invalid First he asked after his health and then gradually opened his errand Shu and Wu have made an alliance to invade us and Zhuge Liang is at QishanHave you heard Illustrious Sir My people have kept back all news as I am ill said he startledBut if this is true the country is in danger Why have they not made you CommanderinChief to stop this invasion I am unequal to the post said Sima YiBring the seal and give it to him said Cao Zhen to his attendantsYou are anxious on my account really I am only come to lend you an armI dare not accept the seal Cao Zhen started up saying If you do not take it I shall have to go to see the Emperor ill as I amThe Middle Land is in danger Really the Emperor has already shown his kindness but I dare not accept his offer If you have been appointed then Shu will be driven off Thrice Sima Yi declined the seal but eventually he received it into his hands as he knew Cao Zhen was sincereThen he took leave of the Ruler of Wei and marched to ChanganThe seal of office changes hands Two armies now one force becomeSima Yis success or failure will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER  Zhuge Liang Defeats The Wei Army Sima Yi Invades The Western Land Of Rivers The fourth month of Beginning Prosperity seventh year  found Zhuge Liang camped at Qishan in three camps waiting for the army of WeiWhen Sima Yi reached Changan the officer in command Zhang He told him all that had happenedHe gave Zhang He the post of Leader of the Van with Dai Ling as his Assistant General and a hundred thousand troops and then marched out toward the enemy camping on River Weis south bankWhen the local commanders Guo Huai and Sun Li went to see the new CommanderinChief he asked if they had fought any battleNot yet said theySima Yi said The enemy had a long march their chance lay in attacking quicklyAs they have not attacked they have some deep laid scheme to work outWhat news have you from Xizhou Guo Huai replied The scouts say that the greatest care is being taken in every countyBut there is no news from Wudu and Yinping I must send someone to fight a decisive battle with them thereYou get away as quickly and privily as you can to the rescue of those two cities and then attack the rear of the Shu army so as to throw them into disorder They set out to obey these orders and on the way they fell to discussing Sima YiHow does Sima Yi compare with Zhuge Liang said Guo HuaiZhuge Liang is by far the better replied Sun LiThough Zhuge Liang may be the cleverer yet this scheme of our leaders shows him to be superior to most peopleThe enemy may have got those two cities yet when we unexpectedly fall upon their rear they will certainly be disordered Soon after this a scout came in to reportWang Ping has captured Yinping and Wudu is in possession of Jiang WeiFurthermore the Shu army is not far in front Said Sun Li There is some crafty scheme afoot Why are they prepared for battle in the open when they hold two citiesWe would better retire Guo Huai agreed and they issued orders to face about and retreatJust then a bomb exploded and at the same time there suddenly appeared from the cover of some hills a small body of troops On the flag that came forward they read the name Zhuge Liang and in the midst of the company they saw him seated in a small chariotOn his left was Guan Xing and on his right Zhang Bao They were quite taken abackZhuge Liang laughed and said Do not run away did you think that your leaders ruse would take me inSima Yi sent a challenge to fight every day indeed while you were to slip round behind my army and attackI have the two citiesWudu and Yinping and if you have not come to surrender then hurry up and fight a battle with me By now Guo Huai and Sun Li were really frightenedThen behind them there rose a shout as of battle and Wang Ping and Jiang Wei began to smite them in the rear while Guan Xing and Zhang Bao bore down upon them in frontThey were soon utterly broken and the two leaders escaped by scrambling up the hillsideZhang Bao saw them and was urging his steed forward to catch them when unhappily he and his horse went over together into a gully When they picked him up they found that he had been kicked in the head and was badly hurtZhuge Liang sent him back to Chengdu It has been said that Guo Huai and Sun Li escapedThey got back to Sima Yis camp and said Wudu and Yinping were both in the enemys possession and Zhuge Liang had prepared an ambush so that we were attacked front and rearWe lost the day and only escaped on foot It is no fault of yours said Sima Yi The fact is he is sharper than INow go to defend Yongcheng and Meicheng and remain on the defensive do not go out to give battleI have a plan to defeat them These two having left Sima Yi called in Zhang He and Dai Ling and said Zhuge Liang has captured Wudu and Yinping He must restore order and confidence among the people of these places and so will be absent from his campYou two will take ten thousand troops each start tonight and make your way quietly to the rear of the Shu army Then you will attack vigorouslyWhen you have done that I shall lead out the army in front of them and array ready for battleWhile they are in disorder I shall make my attack Their camp ought to be capturedIf I can win the advantage of these hills their defeat will be easy These two left Dai Ling marching on the left and Zhang He on the right They took byroads and got well to the rear of the Shu armyIn the third watch they struck the high road and joined forces Then they marched toward the enemyAfter about ten miles there was a halt in frontThe two leaders galloped up to see what had caused it and found many strawcarts drawn across the road The enemy has been prepared said Zhang HeWe should return Just as they ordered the troops to turn about torches broke into flame all over the hills the drums rolled trumpets blared and soldiers sprang out on every side At the same time Zhuge Liang shouted from the hilltop Dai Ling and Zhang He listen to my words Your master reckoned that I should be busy restoring order in the two cities and so should not be in my camp Wherefore he sent you to take the camp and you have just fallen into my snareAs you are leaders of no great importance I shall not harm youDismount and yield Zhang Hes wrath blazed forth at this and he pointed at Zhuge Liang crying You peasant out of the woods invader of our great country How dare you use such words to meWait till I catch you I will tear you to shreds He galloped forward to ascend the hill his spear ready for the thrust But the arrows and stones pelted too quickly Then he turned and dashed in among the Shu soldiers scattering them right and left He got clear but he saw Dai Ling was not with him At once he turned back fought his way to his comrade and brought Dai Ling out safelyZhuge Liang on the hilltop watched this warrior and saw he was a right doughty fighting manI have heard that soldiers stood aghast when Zhang Fei fought his great fight with Zhang HeNow I can judge Zhang Hes valor for myselfHe will do harm to Shu one day if I spare himHe will have to be removed Then Zhuge Liang returned to his campBy this time Sima Yi had completed his battle line and was waiting the moment of disorder in the Shu army to attackThen he saw Zhang He and Dai Ling come limping back dejected and crestfallen They said Zhuge Liang forestalled us he was well prepared and so we were quite defeated He is more than human exclaimed Sima YiWe must retreat So the whole army retired into the fortified camps and would not come outThus a great victory fell to Shu and their booty was immense weapons and horses innumerable Zhuge Liang led his army back to campThereafter he sent parties to offer a challenge at the gate of the Wei camp every day but the soldiers remained obstinately behind their shelters and would not appearWhen this had continued half a month Zhuge Liang grew sad Then came Fei Yi from Capital Chengdu with an edict of the Emperor Fei Yi was received with all respect and incense was burnt as propriety demandedThis done the command was unsealed and Zhuge Liang read The failure at Jieting was really due to the fault of Ma SuHowever you held yourself responsible and blamed yourself very severelyIt would have been a serious matter for me to have withstood your intentions and so I did what you insisted onHowever that was a glorious exploit last year when Wang Shuang was slainThis year Guo Huai has been driven back and the Qiangs have been reduced the two counties of Wudu and Yinping have been captured you have driven fear into the hearts of all evil doers and thus rendered magnificent services But the world is in confusion and the original evil has not been destroyedYou fill a great office for you direct the affairs of the stateIt is not well for you to remain under a cloud for any length of time and cloak your grand virtue wherefore I restore you to the rank of Prime Minister and pray you not to decline the honor Zhuge Liang heard the edict to the end and then said My task is not yet accomplished how can I return to my duties as Prime MinisterI must really decline to accept this Fei Yi said If you decline this you flout the desires of the Emperor and also show contempt for the feelings of the armyAt any rate accept for the moment Then Zhuge Liang humbly bowed acquiescenceFei Yi took leave and returnedSeeing that Sima Yi remained obstinately on the defensive Zhuge Liang thought of a plan by which to draw him He gave orders to break camp and retireWhen the scouts told Sima Yi he said We may not move certainly there is some deep craftiness in this move Zhang He said It must mean that their food is exhausted Why not pursue I reckon that Zhuge Liang laid up ample supplies last yearNow the wheat is ripe and he has plenty of every sortTransport might be difficult but yet he could hold out half a year Why should he run awayHe sees that we resolutely refuse battle and he is trying some ruse to inveigle us into fightingSend out spies to a distance to see what is going on They reconnoitered a long way round and the scouts returned to say that a camp had been formed ten miles awayAh then he is not running away said Sima YiRemain on the defensive still more strictly and do not advance Ten days passed without further news nor did the soldiers of Shu offer the usual challengeAgain spies were sent far afield and they reported a further retreat of ten miles and a new encampment Zhuge Liang is certainly working some scheme said Sima Yi Do not pursue Another ten days passed and spies went out The enemy had gone ten miles farther and encamped Zhang He said What makes you so oversuspiciousI can see that Zhuge Liang is retreating into Hanzhong only he is doing it gradually and arousing our suspicion Why not pursue before it is too lateLet me go and fight one battle No said Sima YiA defeat would destroy the morale of our soldiers and I will not risk itZhuge Liangs vile tricks are innumerable If I go and get beaten I will stand the full rigor of military punishment said Zhang HeWell if you are set on going we will divide the armyYou take your wing and go but you will have to fight your best I will follow to help in case of needTomorrow you should march only halfway and rest your troops for the battle So Zhang He got independent command of thirty thousand troops and took Dai Ling as his second in command and he had a few score of generals as assistants Halfway they campedThen Sima Yi leaving a substantial guard for his camp set out along the same road with fifty thousand troopsZhuge Liang knew the movements of the army of Wei and when Zhang Hes army camped to restIn the night he summoned his generals and told them The enemy are coming in pursuit and will fight desperately You will have to fight every one of you like ten but I will set an ambush to attack their rearOnly a wise and bold leader is fit for this task Wang Ping stepped forth and said he was willing to go on this expeditionBut if you fail what then said Zhuge LiangThen there is the military rule Zhuge Liang sighedWang Ping is most loyal He is willing to risk wounds and death in his countrys serviceHowever the enemy are in two divisions one coming in front the other trying to get round to the rearWang Ping is crafty and bold but he cannot be in two places at once so I must have yet another generalIs it that among you there is no other willing to devote himself to death He did not wait long for a reply Zhang Yi stepped to the front Zhang He is a most famous leader in Wei and valorous beyond all compareYou are not a match for him said Zhuge LiangIf I fail may my head fall at the tent door said Zhang Yi Since you wish to go I accept youEach of you shall have ten thousand veteransYou will hide in the valleys till the enemy come up and you will let them pass Then you will fall upon their rearIf Sima Yi comes you must divide the army Zhang Yi to hold the rear and Wang Ping to check the advance But they will fight desperately and I must find a way to aid you When they had gone Jiang Wei and Liao Hua were called and Zhuge Liang said I am going to give you a silken bag You are to proceed secretly into those mountains in frontWhen you see that Zhang Yi and Wang Ping are in great straits with the enemy then open the bag and you will find a plan of escape After this he gave secret instructions to four other generalsWu Ban Wu Yi Ma Zhong and Zhang Nito observe the enemy and if the enemy seemed confident of victory to retire fighting at intervals till they saw Guan Xing come up when they could turn and fight their bestThen calling Guan Xing he said to them Hide in the valleys with five thousand troops till you see a red flag flutter out and then fall on the enemy Zhang He and Dai Ling hurried along like a rain squall till they were suddenly confronted by Ma Zhong Zhang Ni Wu Yi and Wu BanZhang He dashed toward his enemy and then they retired stopping at intervals to fightThe Wei army pursued for about seven miles It was the sixth moon and very hot so that soldiers and horses sweated profuselyWhen they had gone ten miles farther the soldiers and horses were panting and nearly spentThen Zhuge Liang who had watched the fighting from a hill gave the signal for Guan Xing to emerge and join battleMa Zhong Zhang Ni Wu Ban and Wu Yi all led on their troopsZhang He and Dai Ling fought well but they could not extricate themselves and retire Presently with a roll of drums Wang Ping and Zhang Yi came out and made for the rear to cut the retreatWhy do you not fight to death shouted Zhang He to his generals when he saw the new dangersThe soldiers of Wei dashed this way and that but were stayed at every attempt Then there was heard another roll of drums and Sima Yi came up in the rearHe at once signaled to his generals to surround Wang Ping and Zhang YiOur minister is truly wonderful The battle goes just as he foretold cried Zhang YiHe will surely send help now and we will fight to the death Thereupon the Shu force were divided into two partiesWang Ping led one army to hold up Zhang He and Dai Ling Zhang Yi led the other division to oppose Sima YiOn both sides the fighting was keen and continued all the dayFrom their station on a hill Jiang Wei and Liao Hua watched the battle They saw that the Wei force was very strong and their side was in danger and slowly giving wayNow surely is the moment to open the bag said Jiang Wei So the bag was opened and they read the letter It saidIf Sima Yi comes and Wang Ping and Zhang Yi seem hard pressed you are to divide forces and go off to attack Sima Yis camp which will cause him to retire and then you can attack him as his army is in disorderThe actual capture of the camp is not of great moment So Jiang Wei and Liao Hua divided the force and started for the enemys campNow Sima Yi had really feared that he would fall victim to some ruse of Zhuge Liang so he had arranged for messengers and news to meet him at intervals along the roadHe was pressing his troops to fight when a messenger galloped up to report The soldiers of Shu are making for the main camp by two directions Sima Yi was frightened and changed color He turned on his generals saying I knew Zhuge Liang would plan some trick but you did not believe me You forced me to pursue and now the whole scheme has gone astray Thereupon he gathered in his army and turned to retireThe troops went hurriedly and got into disorderZhang Yi came up behind causing huge damage to the Wei armyZhang He and Dai Ling having but few troops left sought refuge among the hillsThe victory was to Shu and Guan Xing came up helping in the rout wherever there appeared a chance to strikeSima Yi defeated hurried to the camp But when he reached it the army of Shu had already leftHe gathered in his broken army and abused his generals as the cause of his failure You are all ignorant of the proper way to wage war and think it simply a matter of valor and rude strength This is the result of your unbridled desire to go out and give battleFor the future no one of you will move without definite orders and I will apply strict military law to any who disobey They were all greatly ashamed and retired to their quartersIn this fight the losses of Wei were very heavy not only in soldiers but in horses and weaponsZhuge Liang led his victorious army to their campHe intended to advance again when a messenger arrived from Capital Chengdu with the sad news that Zhang Bao had diedWhen they told Zhuge Liang he uttered a great cry blood gushed from his mouth and he fell in a swoonHe was raised and taken to his tent but he was too ill to march and had to keep his bedHis generals were much grieved A later poet sangFierce and valiant was Zhang Bao Striving hard to make a name Sad the gods should interfere And withhold a heros fameZhuge Liang wept his end In the western winds blowing For he knew the warrior gone This grieving is beyond knowing Zhuge Liangs illness continuedTen days later he summoned to his tent Dong Jue and Fan Jian and said I feel void and am too ill to carry on and the best thing for me is to return into Hanzhong and get wellYou are to keep my absence perfectly secret for Sima Yi will certainly attack if he hears Zhuge Liang issued orders to break up the camp that night and the army retired into Hanzhong forthwithSima Yi only heard of it five days later and he knew that again he had been outwitted The man appears like a god and disappears like a demon he is too much for me sighed Sima YiSima Yi set certain generals over the camp and placed others to guard the commanding positions and he also marched homewardAs soon as the Shu army was settled in Hanzhong Zhuge Liang went to Chengdu for treatmentThe officials of all ranks came to greet him and escort him to his palace The Latter Ruler also came to inquire after his condition and sent his own physicians to treat him So gradually he recoveredIn Beginning Prosperity eighth year and seventh month  Cao Zhen the CommanderinChief in Wei had recovered and he sent a memorial to his master saying Shu has invaded more than once and threatened Changan If this state be not destroyed it will ultimately be our ruinThe autumn coolness is now here The army is in good form and it is the time most favorable for an attack on ShuI desire to take Sima Yi as colleague and march into Hanzhong to exterminate this wretched horde and free the borders from trouble Personally the Ruler of Wei approved but he consulted Liu Ye who replied The CommanderinChief speaks wellIf that state be not destroyed it will be to our hurtYour Majesty should give effect to his desire When Liu Ye came out a crowd of officers flocked to inquire saying We heard the Emperor has consulted you about an expedition against Shuwhat think you No such thing said Liu YeShu is too difficult a country to invade it would be a mere waste of humans and weapons They left himThen Yang Ji went into the Emperor and said It is said that yesterday Liu Ye advised Your Majesty to fall upon Shu today when we talked with him he said Shu could not be attackedThis is treating Your Majesty with indignity and you should issue a command to punish him Wherefore Cao Rui called in Liu Ye and asked him to explainLiu Ye replied I have studied the details Shu cannot be attacked Cao Rui laughedIn a short time Yang Ji left and then Liu Ye said Yesterday I advised Your Majesty to attack Shu that being a matter of state policy should be divulged to no personThe essential of a military move is secrecy Then Cao Rui understood and thereafter Liu Ye was held in greater considerationTen days later Sima Yi came to court and Cao Zhens memorial was shown himSima Yi replied The moment is opportune I do not think there is any danger from Wu Cao Zhen was created Minister of War General Who Conquers the West and CommanderinChief of the Western Expedition Sima Yi was made Grand Commander General Who Conquers the West and was second in command and Liu Ye was made Instructor of the ArmyThese three then left the court and the army of four hundred thousand troops marched to Changan intending to dash to Saber Pass and attack HanzhongThe army was joined by Guo Huai and Sun LiThe defenders of Hanzhong brought the news to Zhuge Liang then quite recovered and engaged in training his army and elaborating the Eight Arrays All was in an efficient state and ready for an attack on Changan When he heard of the intended attack he called up Zhang Ni and Wang Ping and gave ordersYou are to lead one thousand troops to Chencang and garrison that road so as to check the Wei army The two replied It is said the Wei army numbers four hundred thousand though they pretend to have eight hundred thousandBut they are very numerous and a thousand troops is a very small force to meet them Zhuge Liang replied I would give you more but I fear to make it hard for the soldiersIf there be a failure I shall not hold you responsibleI send you thus you may be sure there is a meaning in itI observed the stars yesterday and I see there will be a tremendous rain this monthThe army of Wei may consist of any number of legions but they will be unable to penetrate into a mountainous countrySo there is no need to send a large forceYou will come to no harm and I shall lead the main body into Hanzhong and rest for a month while the enemy retreats Then I shall smite them My strong army needs only one hundred thousand to defeat their worn four hundred thousand Do not say any more but get off quickly This satisfied Wang Ping and Zhang Ni and they left while Zhuge Liang led the main body out toward HanzhongMoreover every station was ordered to lay in a stock of wood and straw and grain enough for a whole months use ready against the autumn rainsA months holiday was given and food and clothing were issued in advance The expedition was postponed for the presentWhen Cao Zhen and Sima Yi approached Chencang and entered the city they could not find a single houseThey questioned some of the people near who said that Zhuge Liang had burned everything before he leftThen Cao Zhen proposed to advance along the road but Sima Yi opposed saying that the stars foretold much rainI have watched the Heaven and the stars movement signals long rainsIf we get deep in a difficult country and are always victorious it is all very wellBut if we lose we shall not get out againBetter remain in this city and build what shelter we can against the rains Cao Zhen followed his adviceIn the middle of the month the rain began and came down in a deluge so that the surrounding country was three feet under water The equipment of the soldiers was soaked and the soldiers themselves could get no place to sleep For a whole month the rain continuedThe horses could not be fed and the soldiers grumbled incessantlyThey sent to Luoyang and the Ruler of Wei himself ceremonially prayed for fine weather but with no effect Minister Wang Su sent up a memorialThe histories say that when supplies have to be conveyed a long distance the soldiers are starved if they have to gather brushwood before they can cook then the army is not full fedThis applies to ordinary expeditions in an ordinary countryIf in addition the army has to march through a difficult country and roads have to be cut the labor is doubledNow this expedition is hindered by rain and steep and slippery hills movement is cramped and supplies can only be maintained with difficulty All is most unpropitious to the armyCao Zhen has been gone over a month and has only got half through the valley Road making is monopolizing all energies and the fighting soldiers have to work on them The state of affairs is the opposite to ideal and the fighting soldiers dislike it I may quote certain parallelsKing Wu of Zhou attacked the last Shang King he went through the pass but returned In recent times Emperors Cao and Pi attacking Sun Quan reached the river and went no fartherDid they not recognize limitations and act accordinglyI pray Your Majesty remember the grave difficulties caused by the rain and put an end to this expeditionBy and by another occasion will arise for using force and in the joy of overcoming difficulties the people will forget death The Ruler of Wei could not make up his mind but two other memorials by Yang Fu and Hua Xin followed and then he issued the command to return which was sent to Cao Zhen and Sima Yi Cao Zhen and Sima Yi had already discussed the abandonment of the expedition Cao Zhen had said We have had rain for a whole month and the soldiers are downhearted and think only of getting home againHow can we stop them Sima Yi replied Return is best If Zhuge Liang pursue how shall we repulse him We can leave an ambush While they were discussing this matter the Emperors command arrived Whereupon they faced about and marched homewardNow Zhuge Liang had reckoned upon this month of rain and so had had his troops camped in a safe place Then he ordered the main army to assemble at Red Slope and camp thereHe summoned his officers to his tent and said In my opinion the enemy must retire for the Ruler of Wei will issue such an orderTo retreat needs preparation and if we pursue we will fall in their trapSo we will let them retire without molestationSome other plan must be evolved So when Wang Ping sent news of the retreat of the enemy the messenger carried back the order not to pursueIt is only lost labor to cover retreat When your enemy does not pursueBy what means Zhuge Liang intended to defeat Wei will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER Raiding A Camp The Shu Soldiers Defeat Cao Zhen Contesting Array Battles Zhuge Liang Shames Sima Yi When the Shu officers got to know that the Wei army had gone but they were not to pursue they were inclined to discontent and went in a body to the Prime Ministers tent and said The rain has driven the enemy away surely it is the moment to pursue Zhuge Liang replied Sima Yi is an able leader who would not retreat without leaving an ambush to cover itIf we pursue we shall fall victimsLet him go in peace and I shall then get through the Xie Valley and take Qishan making use of the enemys lack of defense But there are other ways of taking Changan said they why only take Qishan Because Qishan is the first step to Changan and I want to gain the advantage of positionAnd every transportation from Xizhou must come this wayIt rests on River Wei in front and is backed by the Xie ValleyIt gives the greatest freedom of movement and is a natural maneuvering groundThat is why I want it They bowed to his wisdomThen he dispatched Wei Yan Zhang Ni Du Qiong and Chen Shi for Chi Valley and he sent Ma Dai Wang Ping Zhang Yi and Ma Zhong for the Xie Valley all were to meet at the Qishan MountainsHe led the main army himself with Guan Xing and Liao Hua in the van When the Wei army retreated Cao Zhen and Sima Yi remained in the rear superintending the movementThey sent a reconnoitering party along the old road to Chencang and they returned saying no enemy was to be seenTen days later the leaders who had commanded in the ambush joined the main body saying that they had seen no sign of the enemyCao Zhen said This continuous autumn rain has rendered all the ways impassable how could the soldiers of Shu know of our retreat They will appear later said Sima Yi How can you know These late five dry days they have not pursued because they think we shall have left a rearguard in ambush Therefore they have let us get well awayBut after we have gone they will try to occupy Qishan Cao Zhen was not convinced Why do you doubt asked Sima YiI think Zhuge Liang will certainly advance by way of the two valleys and you and I should guard the entrancesI give them ten days and if they do not appear I will come to your camp painted in the face to own my mistake If the army of Shu do appear I will give you the girdle and the steed that the Emperor gave me replied Cao ZhenAnd they split their force Cao Zhen taking up his station on the west of Qishan in the Xie Valley and Sima Yi going to the east in the Chi ValleyAs soon as the camp was settled Sima Yi led a cohort into hiding in the valleyThe remainder of the force was placed in detachments on the chief roadsSima Yi disguised himself as a soldier and went among the soldiers to get a private survey of all the campsIn one of them he happened upon a junior officer who was complaining saying The rain has drenched us for days and they would not retireNow they have camped here for a wager They have no pity for us soldiers Sima Yi returned to his tent and assembled his officersHauling out the grumbler Sima Yi said to him angrily The state feeds and trains soldiers a thousand days for one hours serviceHow dare you give vent to your spleen to the detriment of discipline The man would not confess so his comrades were called to bear witnessStill he would not own upI am not here for a wager but to overcome Shu said Sima YiNow you all have done well and are going home but only this fellow complains and is guilty of mutinous conduct Sima Yi ordered the lictors to put him to death and in a short time they produced his headThe others were terrified but Sima Yi said All you must do your utmost to guard against the enemyWhen you hear a bomb explode rush out on all sides and attack With this order they retiredNow Wei Yan Zhang Ni Chen Shi and Du Qiong with twenty thousand troops entered the Chi ValleyAs they were marching Adviser Deng Zhi came I bear an order from the Prime MinisterAs you go out of the valley beware of the enemy said Deng ZhiChen Shi said Why is the Prime Minister so full of doubtsWe know the soldiers of Wei have suffered severely from the rain and must hasten home They will not lay any ambushWe are doing double marches and shall gain a great victoryWhy are we to delay Deng Zhi replied You know the Prime Ministers plans always succeedHow dare you disobey his orders Chen Shi smiled saying If he was really so resourceful we should not have lost Jieting Wei Yan recalling that Zhuge Liang had rejected his plan also laughed and said If he had listened to me and gone out through Ziwu Valley not only Changan but Luoyang too would be oursNow he is bent on taking Qishan what is the good of itHe gave us the order to advance and now he stops usTruly the orders are confusing Then said Chen Shi I will tell you what I will do I shall take only five thousand troops get through the Chi Valley and camp at Qishan Then you will see how ashamed the Prime Minister will look Deng Zhi argued and persuaded but to no avail the willful leader hurried on to get out of the valleyDeng Zhi could only return as quickly as possible and report Chen Shi proceeded He had gone a few miles when he heard a bomb and he was in an ambushHe tried to withdraw but the valley was full of the enemy and he was surrounded as in an iron caskAll his efforts to get out failedThen there was a shout and Wei Yan came to the rescueWei Yan saved his comrade but Chen Shis five thousand troops was reduced to about five hundred and these woundedThe Wei soldiers pursued but two other divisions of Zhang Ni and Du Qiong prevented the pursuit and finally the army of Wei retiredChen Shi and Wei Yan who had criticized Zhuge Liangs powers of prevision no longer doubted that he saw very clearly They regretted their own shortsightednessWhen Deng Zhi told his chief of the bad behavior of Chen Shi and Wei Yan Zhuge Liang only laughedSaid he That fellow Wei Yan has never been quite true he has always been disposed to disobey and is unsteady However he is valiant and so I have saved him for our use but he will do real harm some day Then came a messenger with news of Chen Shis defeat and loss of troopsZhuge Liang sent Deng Zhi back again to Chi Valley to console with Chen Shi and so keep him from actual mutinyThen Zhuge Liang called to his tent Ma Dai and Wang Ping and said If there are any troops of Wei in the Xie Valley you are to go across the mountains marching by night and concealing yourselves by day and make for the east of Qishan When you arrive make a fire as a signal Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni were told to go in similar fashion to the west of Qishan and join up with the other two Then they were to make a joint attack on Cao Zhens camp Zhuge Liang would also attack in the centerGuan Xing and Liao Hua also received secret orders The armies marched rapidlyNot long after starting two other detachments led by Wu Ban and Wu Yi received secret orders and left the main bodyThe doubts about the coming of the Shu army made Cao Zhen careless and he allowed his soldiers to become slack and restHe only thought of getting through the allotted ten days when he would have the laugh against his colleague Seven of the days had passed when a scout reported a few odd men of Shu in the valleyCao Zhen sent Qin Liang with five thousand troops to reconnoiter and keep them at a distanceQin Liang he led his troops to the entrance of the valley As soon as he arrived the enemy retired Qin Liang went after them but they had disappearedHe was perplexed and puzzled and while trying to decide he told the troops to dismount and restBut almost immediately he heard a shout and ambushing troops appeared in front of himHe jumped on his horse to look about him and saw a great cloud of dust rising among the hills He disposed his troops for defense but the shouting quickly came nearer and then Wu Ban and Wu Yi appeared advancing towards him Retreat was impossible for Guan Xing and Liao Hua had blocked the roadThe hills were on both sides and from the hilltops came shouts of Dismount and yield More than half did surrenderQin Liang rode out to fight but he was slain by Liao HuaZhuge Liang put the Wei soldiers who had come over to his side in one of the rear divisions With their dress and arms he disguised five thousand of his own troops so that they looked like his enemies and then he sent this divisionunder Guan Xing Liao Hua Wu Yi and Wu Banto raid Cao Zhens campBefore they reached the camp they sent one of their number ahead as a galloper to tell Cao Zhen that there had been only a few men of Shu and they had all been chased out of sight and so lull him into security This news satisfied Cao ZhenBut just then a trusty messenger from Sima Yi came with a messageOur troops have fallen into an ambush and many have been killed Do not think any more about the wager that is canceledBut take most careful precautions But there is not a single soldier of Shu near said Cao ZhenHe told the messenger to go backJust then they told him Qin Liangs army had returned and he went out to meet themJust as he got near someone remarked that some torches had flared up in the rear of his camp He hastened thither to see As soon as he was out of sight the four leaders waved on their troops and dashed up to the campAt the same time Ma Dai and Wang Ping came up behind and Ma Zhong and Zhang Yi came outThe soldiers of Wei were trapped and helpless they scattered and fled for lifeCao Zhen protected by his generals fled away to the eastward The enemy chased them closelyAs Cao Zhen fled there arose a great shouting and up came an army at full speedCao Zhen thought all was lost and his heart sank but it was Sima Yi who drove off the pursuersThough Cao Zhen was saved he was almost too ashamed to show his faceThen said Sima Yi Zhuge Liang has seized Qishan and we cannot remain here let us go to River Wei whence we may try to recover our lost ground How did you know I was in danger of defeat asked Cao ZhenMy messenger told me that you said there was not a single soldier of Shu near and I knew Zhuge Liang would try to seize your campSo I came to your helpThe enemys plan succeeded but we will say no more about that wagerWe must both do our best for the country But the fright and excitement made Cao Zhen ill and he took to his bedAnd while the army were in such a state of disorder Sima Yi was afraid to advise a return They camped at River WeiAfter this adventure Zhuge Liang hastened back to QishanAfter the soldiers had been feasted and services recognized the four discontented leadersWei Yan Chen Shi Du Qiong and Zhang Nicame to the tent to apologizeWho caused the loss said Zhuge LiangWei Yan said Chen Shi disobeyed orders and rushed into the valley Wei Yan told me to said Chen ShiWould you still try to drag him down after he rescued you said Zhuge LiangHowever when orders have been disobeyed it is useless to try and gloze it over Zhuge Liang sentenced Chen Shi to death and he was led awaySoon they brought his head into the presence of the assembled generals Wei Yan was spared as there was yet work for him to accomplish After this Zhuge Liang prepared to advanceThe scouts reported that Cao Zhen was ill but was being treated by doctors in his tentThe news pleased Zhuge Liang and he said to his officers If Cao Zhens illness is slight they will surely return to Changan They must be delayed by his serious sicknessHe stays on so that his soldiers may not lose heartNow I will write him such a letter that he will die Then he called up the soldiers of Wei who had yielded and said to them You are Wei troops and your families are all over there it is wrong for you to serve meSuppose I let you go home They thanked him falling prostrate and weepingThen Zhuge Liang continued Friend Cao Zhen and I have a compact and I have a letter for him which you shall takeThe bearer will be well rewarded They received the letter and ran home to their own tents where they gave their CommanderinChief the letterCao Zhen was too ill to rise but he opened the cover and read The Prime Minister of Han Zhuge Liang to the Minister of War Cao Zhen You will permit me to say that a leader of an army should be able to go and come to be facile and obdurate to advance and retire to show himself weak or strong to be immovable as mountains to be inscrutable as the operations of nature to be infinite as the universe to be everlasting as the blue void to be vast as the ocean to be dazzling as the lights of heaven to foresee droughts and floods to know the nature of the ground to understand the possibilities of battle arrays to conjecture the excellencies and defects of the enemyOne of your sort ignorant and inferior rising impudently in heavens vault has had the presumption to assist a rebel to assume the imperial style and state at Luoyang to send some miserable soldiers into Beach Valley There they happened upon drenching rainThe difficult roads wearied both soldiers and horses driving them franticWeapons and armors littered the countryside swords and spears covered the groundYou the CommanderinChief were heartbroken and cowed your generals fled like ratsYou dare not show your faces at home nor can you enter the halls of stateThe historians pens will record your defeats the people will recount your infamiesSima Yi is frightened when he hears of battle fronts Cao Zhen is alarmed at mere rumors My soldiers are fierce and their steeds strong my great generals are eager as tigers and majestic as dragonsI shall sweep the Middle Land bare and make Wei desolate Cao Zhens wrath rose as he read at the end it filled his breastHe died that eveningSima Yi sent his coffin to Luoyang on a wagonWhen the Ruler of Wei heard of the death of Cao Zhen he issued an edict urging Sima Yi to prosecute the war to raise a great army and fight with Zhuge LiangA declaration of war was sent one day in advance and Zhuge Liang replied that he would fight on the morrowAfter the envoy had left Zhuge Liang called Jiang Wei by night to receive secret ordersHe also summoned Guan Xing and told him what to doNext morning the whole force marched to the bank of River Wei and took up a position in a wide plain with the river on one flank and hills on the otherThe two armies saluted each others appearance with heavy flights of arrowsAfter the drums had rolled thrice the Wei center opened at the great standard and Sima Yi appeared followed by his officersOpposite was Zhuge Liang in a fourhorse chariot waving his feather fanSima Yi addressed Zhuge Liang Our masters ascension of the throne was after the manner of King Yao who abdicated in favor of King Shun Two emperors have succeeded and have their seat in the Middle Land Because of his liberality and graciousness my lord has suffered the rule of Shu and Wu lest the people should suffer in a struggleYou who are but a plowman from Nanyang ignorant of the ways of Heaven wish to invade us and you should be destroyed but if you will examine your heart and repent of your fault and retire then each may maintain his own borders and a settled state of three kingdoms will be attainedThus the people may be spared distress and you will save your life Zhuge Liang smiled and replied Our First Ruler entrusted to me the custody of his orphan son think you that I shall fail to exert myself to the uttermost to destroy rebels against his authorityYour soldiers of the Cao family will soon be exterminated by HanYour ancestors were servants of Han and for generations ate of their bounty Yet instead of giving grateful service you assist usurpers Are you not ashamed The flush of shame spread over Sima Yis face but he replied We will try the test of battleIf you can conquer I pledge myself to be no longer a leader of armies but if you are defeated then you will retire at once to your own village and I will not harm you Do you desire a contest of generals or of weapons or of battle array asked Zhuge LiangLet us try a contest of battle array replied Sima YiThen draw up your array that I may see said Zhuge LiangSima Yi withdrew within the line and signaled to his officers with a yellow flag to draw up their troopsWhen he had finished he rode again to the front saying Do you recognize my formation The least of my generals can do as well said Zhuge Liang smilingThis is called the DisorderinOrder formation Now you try while I look on said Sima Yi Zhuge Liang entered the lines and waved his fanThen he came out and said Do you recognize that Of course this is the Eight Arrays Yes you seem to know itBut dare you attack Why not since I know it replied Sima YiThen you need only try Sima Yi entered the ranks and called to him three generalsDai Ling Zhang Hu and Yue Chento whom he said That formation consists of eight gatesBirth Exit Expanse Wound Fear Annihilation Obstacle and DeathYou will go in from the east at the Gate of Birth turn to the southwest and make your way out by the Gate of Annihilation Then enter at the north at the Exit Gate and the formation will be broken upBut be cautious They started with Zhang Hu leading Dai Ling next and Yue Chen in rear each with thirty horsemen They made their way in at the Gate of Birth amid the applause of both sides But when they had got within they found themselves facing a wall of troops and could not find a way outThey hastily led their men round by the base of the line toward the southwest to rush out there But they were stopped by a flight of arrowsThey became confused and saw many gates but they had lost their bearings Nor could they aid each otherThey dashed hither and thither in disorder lose as in gathering clouds and rolling mistsThen a shout arose and each one was seized and boundThey were taken to the center where Zhuge Liang sat in his tent and the three leaders with their ninety men were ranged in frontIndeed you are prisoners are you surprised said Zhuge Liang smilingBut I will set you free to return to your leader and tell him to read his books again and study his tactics before he comes to try conclusions with meYou are pardoned but leave your weapons and horses here So they were stripped of their arms and armors and their faces inked Thus were they led on foot out of the arraySima Yi lost his temper at sight of his people thus put to shame Said he After this disgrace how can I face the other officers in the Middle Land He gave the signal for the army to fall on and attack the enemy and grasping his sword led his brave generals into the fray and commanded the attackBut just as the two armies came to blows Guan Xing came up his drums rolling and troops shouting and attackedSima Yi told off a division from the rear to oppose Guan Xing and again turned to urge on his main bodyThen the army of Wei was thrown into confusion by another attack from Jiang Wei who came up silently and joined in the battle Thus three sides of the Wei army were attacked by three different divisions of the enemy and Sima Yi decided to retire However this was difficultThe soldiers of Shu hemmed him in and came closer every momentAt last by a desperate push he cut an arterial alley toward the south and freed his armyBut he had lost six or seven out of every ten of his soldiersThe Wei army withdrew to the south bank of River Wei and camped They strengthened their position and remained entirely on the defensiveZhuge Liang mustered his victorious army and returned to Qishan Now Li Yan sent an officer General Gou An from Baidicheng with a convoy of grainGou An was a drunkard and loitered on the road so that he arrived ten days lateZhuge Liang angry at the delay upbraided him saying This grain is of the utmost importance to the army and you delay itThree days delay ought to mean the death penalty what can you say to this delay of ten Gou An was sentenced to death and hustled outBut Yang Yi ventured to intervene saying Gou An is a servant of Li Yan and Li Yan has sent large supplies of all sorts from the Western Land of RiversIf you put this man to death perhaps others will not undertake escort duty Zhuge Liang then bade the executioners loose the offender give him eighty blows and let him goThis punishment filled Gou Ans heart with bitter resentment and in the night he deserted to the enemy he and his half dozen personal staffHe was taken before Sima Yi and told the tale of his wrongsYour tale may be true but it is hard to trust it said Sima Yi Zhuge Liang is full of guileHowever you may render me a service and if you do I will ask the Ruler of Wei that you may be allowed to serve him and obtain a post for you Whatever you ask I will do the best I can replied the deserterThen go to Chengdu and spread a lying report that Zhuge Liang is angry with the powers there and means to make himself emperor This will get him recalled and that will be a merit to you Gou An accepted the treacherous mission In Chengdu he got hold of the eunuchs and told them his lying taleThe eunuchs became alarmed for their own safety and told the Emperor all these thingsIn such a case what am I to do asked the Latter RulerRecall him to the capital said the eunuchs and take away his military powers so that he cannot rebel The Latter Ruler issued an edict recalling the armyJiang Wan said The Prime Minister has rendered many and great services since he led out the army wherefore is he recalled I have a private matter to consult him about said the Latter RulerI must see him personally So the edict was issued and sent to Zhuge LiangThe messenger was at once received as soon as he reached Qishan The Emperor is young and there is some jealous persons by his side said Zhuge Liang sadlyI was just going to achieve some solid success why am I recalledIf I go not I shall insult my Prince if I retire I shall never get such a chance again If the army retire Sima Yi will attack said Jiang WeiI will retire in five divisionsThus today this camp goes Supposing that there are a thousand soldiers in the camp then I shall have two thousand cooking places prepared or if there are three thousand soldiers then four thousand cooking plates shall be got ready and so on increasing the cooking arrangements as the troops are sent away Yang Yi said In the days of old when Sun Bin was attacking Pang Juan Sun Bin decreased the cooking arrangements as the soldiers were increasedWhy do you reverse this O Minister Because Sima Yi is an able leader and would pursue if he knew we were retreatingBut he would recognize the probability of an ambush and if he sees an increase in the cooking arrangements in a camp he will be unable to conclude whether the troops have gone or not and he will not pursueThus I shall gradually withdraw without loss The order for retreat was givenConfident of the effect that Gou Ans lying report would produce Sima Yi waited for the retreat of the Shu army to beginHe was still waiting when the scouts told him the enemys camps were emptyWishing to make sure he rode out himself with a small reconnoitering party and inspected the empty camps Then he bade them count the stovesNext day he paid a second visit to another empty camp and again the cooking stoves were counted The count showed an increase of a half I felt sure that Zhuge Liang would have more troops readyHe has increased the cooking arrangements and so if we pursue he will be ready for usNo we also will retire and await another opportunity So there was no pursuit and Zhuge Liang did not lose a soldier on his retreat to HanzhongBy and by people came in from the Lands of Rivers to say that the retreat was a fact and that only the cooking arrangements had been increased not the soldiersSima Yi knew that he had been tricked and looking up the sky he sighed Zhuge Liang imitated the ruse of Sun Bin to rouse my suspicion His thinking is superior to mine And Sima Yi set out for LuoyangWhen players of equal skill are matched Then victory hovers between Perhaps your opponents a genius So put on your lowliest mienWhat happened when Zhuge Liang returned to Chengdu will be told next CHAPTER  Going Out From Longshang Zhuge Liang Dresses As A God Dashing Toward Saber Pass Zhang He Falls Into A SnareBy means of the artifice just described Zhuge Liang withdrew his army safely into Hanzhong while Sima Yi retreated upon Changan Zhuge Liang distributed the rewards for success and then went to Capital Chengdu for audienceYour Majesty recalled me just as I was about to advance upon Changan what is the important matter said the Prime MinisterFor a long time the Latter Ruler made no replyPresently he said I longed to see your face once more that is the only reason Zhuge Liang replied I think my recall was not on your own initiative some slanderous persons has hinted that I cherished ulterior objects The Latter Ruler who indeed felt guilty and ill at ease made no reply and Zhuge Liang continued Your late father laid me under an obligation which I am pledged to fulfill to the deathBut if vile influences are permitted to work at home how can I destroy the rebels without The fact is I recalled you because of the talk of the eunuchsBut I understand now and am unutterably sorry Zhuge Liang interrogated the eunuchs and thus found out the base rumors that had been spread abroad by Gou AnHe sent to arrest this man but Gou An had already fled and gone over to WeiThe eunuchs who had influenced the Emperor were put to death and all the other eunuchs were expelled from the PalaceThe Prime Minister also upbraided Jiang Wan and Fei Yi for not having looked into the matter and set the Son of God rightZhuge Liang then took leave of the Latter Ruler and returned to the armyHe wrote to Li Yan to see to the necessary supplies and began preparations for a new expeditionYang Yi said The soldiers are wearied by the many expeditions and the supplies are not regularI think a better plan would be to send half the army to Qishan for three months and at the end of that time exchange them for the other half and so on alternately For example if you have two hundred thousand troops let one hundred thousand go into the field and one hundred thousand remainIn this way using ten legions and ten legions their energies will be conserved and you can gradually work toward the Middle Land I agree with you said Zhuge LiangOur attack is not a matter to be achieved in hasteThe suggestion for an extended campaign is excellent Wherefore the army was divided and each half went out for one hundred days service at a time when it was relieved by the other half Full penalties were provided for any laxity and failure to maintain the periods of active serviceIn the spring of the ninth year of Beginning Prosperity the Shu army once more took the held against WeiIn Wei it was the fifth year of Calm Peace When the Ruler of Wei heard of this new expedition he called Sima Yi and asked his adviceNow that my friend Cao Zhen is no more I am willing to do all that one man can to destroy the rebels against Your Majestys authority said Sima YiCao Rui was gratified by this ready offer and honored Sima Yi with a banquetNext day an edict was issued for the army to moveThe Ruler of Wei riding in his state chariot escorted Sima Yi out of the city and after the farewells the general took the road to Changan where the force was gathering There was assembled a council of warZhang He offered his services saying I volunteer to guard Yongcheng and Meicheng against the Shu army But Sima Yi said Our vanguard army is not strong enough to face the enemys whole forceMoreover to divide an army is not generally a successful scheme The better plan will be to leave a guard in Shanggui and send all the others to QishanWill you undertake the leadership of the van Zhang He consented saying I have always been most loyal and will devote my energies entirely to the service of the stateSo far I have not had an adequate opportunity to prove my sincerity but now that you confer upon me a post of such responsibility I can only say that no sacrifice can be too great for me and I will do my utmost So Zhang He was appointed vanleader and then Guo Huai was set over the defense of the counties of XizhouOther generals were distributed to other posts and the march began The spies reported The main force of Shu is directed toward Qishan and the Leaders of the Van are Wang Ping and Zhang NiThe route chosen for their march is from Chencang across San Pass and to the Xie Valley Hearing this Sima Yi said to Zhang He Zhuge Liang is advancing in great force and certainly intends to reap the wheat in Xizhou for his supplyYou get sufficient troops to hold Qishan while Guo Huai and I go to Tianshui and foil the enemys plan to gather the wheat So Zhang He took forty thousand troops to hold Qishan and Sima Yi set out westwards to XizhouWhen Zhuge Liang reached Qishan and had settled his army in camp he saw that the bank of River Wei had been fortified by his enemy That must be the work of Sima Yi remarked Zhuge Liang to his generalsBut we have not enough food in camp I have written to Li Yan to send grain but it has not yet arrivedThe wheat in Xizhou is now just ripe and we will go and reap it Leaving Wang Ping Zhang Ni Wu Ban and Wu Yi to guard for the camps Zhuge Liang with Wei Yan Jiang Wei and several other generals went over to LuchengThe Governor of that city knew he could not offer any real defense so he opened the gates and yielded After calming the people Zhuge Liang asked Where is the ripe wheat to be found The Governor replied Longshang is the place So Zhang Yi and Ma Zhong were left to guard the city and the remainder of the army went to LongshangBut soon the leading body returned to say Sima Yi has already occupied that city He guessed what I intended to do said Zhuge Liang taken abackZhuge Liang then retired bathed and put on another dress Next he bade them bring out three fourwheeled chariots all exactly alike that were among the impedimenta of the armyThey had been built in Shu some time beforeJiang Wei was told off to lead a thousand troops as escort for one chariot and five hundred drummers were appointed to accompany it The chariot with its escort and drummers was sent away behind the city In like manner two other chariots were equipped and sent east and west of the city under Ma Dai and Wei YanEach chariot was propelled by a team of twentyfour men all dressed in black barefooted and with loosened hair Each one of the team also had in hand a sword and a black sevenstarred flagWhile the chariots were taking up their positions thirty thousand soldiers were ordered to prepare wagons and sickles to cut and carry away the grainNext Zhuge Liang selected twentyfour good soldiers whom he dressed and armed like those sent away with the three chariotsThese were to push his own chariot Guan Xing was told to dress up as the God of Clouds and to walk in front of Zhuge Liangs chariot holding a black sevenstarred flagThese preparations complete Zhuge Liang mounted and the chariot took the road toward the Wei campThe appearance of a chariot with such attendants more than startled the enemys scouts who did not know whether the apparition was that of a human or a demon They hastened to their general and told himSima Yi came out himself and saw the cavalcade and its central figure being Zhuge Liang dressed as a Taoist mystic with headdress white robe and a feather fanAround the chariot were twentyfour hairloosened beings each with a sword in hand and leading was a being as a heavensent god with the sevenstarred flagSome of Zhuge Liangs odd doings said heAnd Sima Yi ordered two thousand troops saying Chase as fast as you can and bring in the chariot escort and the seated figure The soldiers went out to do their bidding but as soon as they appeared the chariot retired and took a road leading to the rear of the Shu campAlthough the Wei soldiers were mounted they could not come up with the cavalcade What they did meet with was a chilly breeze and a cold mist that rolled about themThey found it uncanny and halted saying one to another How extraordinary it is that we have been pressing on and yet we got no nearerWhat does it mean When Zhuge Liang saw that the pursuit had ceased he had his chariot pushed out again to the front and passed within sight of the halted troops At first they hesitated but presently took up the pursuit once moreWhereupon the chariot again retired proceeding slowly but always keeping out of reach And thus more than seven miles were covered and the chariot was still not capturedAgain the soldiers halted puzzled and perplexed at this incomprehensible chaseBut as soon as they stopped the chariot came again toward them and they retook pursuitSima Yi now came up with a strong force But he also halted and said to his generals This Zhuge Liang is a master in the arts of necromancy and juggling and Eight Gates and knows how to call up the Deities of Six Layers to his aidI know this trick of his it is the Ground Rolling in the Book of Six Layers Deities and it is vain to pursue So they ceased followingBut then a roll of drums came from the left side as if a body of troops were approachingSima Yi told off some companies to repel them but there only came into view a small force and in their midst was a party of men dressed in black the exact counterpart of the cavalcade he had first sent to pursueIn the chariot sat another Zhuge Liang just like the one that had just disappearedBut just now he was sitting in that other chariot which we chased for fifteen miles how can he be here said Sima Yi Shortly after they heard another roll of the drums and as the sound died away there appeared another body of men with a chariot in the midst exactly like the last and also carrying a sitting figure of Zhuge LiangThey must be heavensent soldiers said Sima YiThe soldiers were now feeling the strain of these weird appearances and began to get out of hand They dared not stay to fight such beings and some ran away But before they had gone far loanother roll of drums another cohort and another chariot with a similar figure seated thereinThe soldiers of Wei were now thoroughly frightened and even Sima Yi himself began to feel doubtful whether these appearances should be ascribed to humans or devilsHe realized however that he was in the midst of dangers as he did not know the number of the Shu soldiers and he and his troops ran away helterskelter never stopping till they reached Shanggui They entered the city and closed the gatesHaving thus driven off the Wei soldiers Zhuge Liang proceeded to reap and gather the wheat which was carried into Lucheng and laid out to drySima Yi remained shut up within the walls for three daysThen as he saw his enemies retiring he sent out some scouts who presently returned with a Shu soldier they had captured The prisoner was questionedI was of the reaping party said the man They caught me when I was looking for some horses that had strayed What wonderful soldiers were they of yours that one saw here lately asked the generalThe man replied Zhuge Liang was with one party of them the others were led by Jiang Wei Ma Dai and Wei YanThere was a thousand of fighting soldiers with each chariot and five hundred drummersZhuge Liang was with the first party His comings and goings are not human said Sima Yi sadlyThen Guo Huai came and he was called to a councilSaid Guo Huai I hear the soldiers of Shu in Lucheng are very few and they are occupied with gathering the grain why not smite them Sima Yi told him his last experience of his opponents wilesHe threw dust in your eyes that time said Guo Huai with a smile However now you know What is the good of more talkLet me attack the rear while you lead against the front and we shall take the city and Zhuge Liang too An attack was decided uponIn Lucheng while the soldiers were still busy with the wheat Zhuge Liang called up his generals and said The enemy will attack tonightThere is a suitable place for an ambush in the newly reaped fields but who will lead for me Four generalsJiang Wei Wei Yan Ma Dai and Ma Zhongoffered themselves and he posted them each with two thousand troops outside the four corners of the city They were to await the signal and then convergeWhen these had gone Zhuge Liang led out a small party of one hundred soldiers and hid in the newly reaped fields In the meantime Sima Yi was drawing near It was dusk when he stood beneath the walls of LuchengSaid he to his officers If we attacked by daylight we should find the city well prepared so we will take advantage of the darknessThe moat is shallow here and there will be no difficulty in crossing it The troops bivouacked till the time should come to attackAbout the middle of the first watch Guo Huai arrived and his force joined up with the othersThis done the drums began to beat and the city was quickly surroundedHowever the defenders maintained such a heavy discharge of arrows bolts and stones from the walls that the besiegers dared not close inSuddenly from the midst of the Wei army came the roar of a bomb soon followed by others from different places The soldiers were startled but no one could say whence the sounds had proceededGuo Huai went to search the wheat fields and then the four armies from the corners of the city converged upon the Wei armyAt the same time the defenders burst out of the city gates and a great battle began Wei lost many troopsAfter heavy fighting Sima Yi extricated his army from the battle and made his way to a hill which he set about holding and fortifying while Guo Huai got round to the rear of the city and called a haltZhuge Liang entered the city and sent his troops to camp again at the four corners of the wallsGuo Huai went to see his chief and said We have long been at grips with these soldiers and are unable to drive them off We have now lost another fight and unless something is done we shall not get away at all What can we do asked Sima Yi You might write to Xizhou and Yongzhou to send their forces to our help I will try my fortune against Saber Pass and cut off Zhuge Liangs retreat and suppliesThat should bring about discontent and mutiny and we can attack when we see the enemy in confusion The letters were sent and soon Sun Li came leading the troops foot and horse of two hundred thousandThe new arrivals were sent to help Guo Huai in the attack on Saber Pass After many days had passed without sight of the enemy Zhuge Liang thought it was time to make another moveCalling up Jiang Wei and Ma Dai he said The soldiers of Wei are well posted on the hills and refuse battle because firstly they think that we are short of food and secondly they have sent an army against Saber Pass to cut off our suppliesNow each of you will take ten thousand troops and garrison the important points about here to show them that we are well prepared to defend ourselves Then they will retire After these two had gone Yang Yi came to see the general about the change of troops then dueYang Yi said O Minister you have ordered the troops to be alternated every one hundred days Now the time is due and the replacing troops have already left Hanzhong and that dispatches from the leading divisions have come in Here we have eighty thousand troops of which forty will be due for relief There is the order carry it out replied Zhuge Liang So the forty thousand homegoing soldiers prepared to withdraw Just then came the newsSun Li has arrived with reinforcements of two hundred thousand troops from Xizhou and Yongzhou Guo Huai and Sun Li have gone to attack Saber Pass and Sima Yi is leading an army against Lucheng In the face of such important news Yang Yi went to ask if the change of forces was to take place or be postponed for a time Zhuge Liang replied I must keep faith with the soldiersSince the order for the periodical exchange of troops has been issued it must be carried outBeside the soldiers due for relief are all prepared to start their expectations have been roused and their relatives await themIn the face of yet greater difficulties I would let them go So orders were given for the timeexpired soldiers to march that dayBut when the legionaries heard it a sudden movement of generosity spread among them And they said Since the Prime Minister loves us so much we do not wish to go but will prefer to remain to fight the Wei army to death But you are due for home you cannot stay here said Zhuge LiangThey reiterated that they all wished to stay instead of going homeSince you wish to stay and fight with me you can go out of the city and camp ready to encounter the army of Wei as soon as they arrive Do not give them time to rest or recover breath but attack vigorously at onceYou will be fresh and fit waiting for those fagged with a long march So they gripped their weapons and joyfully went out of the city to array themselves in readinessNow the Xiliang troops had traveled by double marches and so were worn out and needed restBut while they were pitching their tents the troops of Shu fell upon them lustily leaders full of spirit soldiers full of energy The weary soldiers could make no proper stand and retiredThe troops of Shu followed pressing on them till corpses littered the whole plain and blood flowed in runnelsIt was a victory for Zhuge Liang and he came out to welcome the victors and led them into the city and distributed rewardsJust then arrived an urgent letter from Li Yan then at Baidicheng and when Zhuge Liang had torn it open he readNews has just come that Wu has sent an envoy to Luoyang and entered into an alliance with Wei whereby Wu is to attack usThe army of Wu has not yet set out but I am anxiously awaiting your plans Doubts and fears crowded in upon Zhuge Liangs mind as he read He summoned his officersAs Wu is coming to invade our land we shall have to retire quickly said heIf I issue orders for the Qishan force to withdraw Sima Yi will not dare to pursue while we are camped here The Qishan force broke camp and marched in two divisions Zhang He watched them go but was too fearful of the movement being some ruse to attempt to follow He went to see Sima YiThe enemy have retired but I know not for what reason Zhuge Liang is very crafty and you will do well to remain where you are and keep a careful lookoutDo nothing till their grain has given out when they must retire for good said Sima YiHere General Wei Ping stepped forward saying But we should seize the occasion of their retreat to smite them Are they tigers that you fear to move How the world will laugh at us But Sima Yi was obstinate and ignored the protestWhen Zhuge Liang knew that the Qishan troops had got away safely he called Yang Yi and Ma Zhong and gave them secret orders to lead ten thousand of bowmen and crossbowmen out by the Wooden Path of Saber Pass and place them in ambush on both sides of the roadIf the soldiers of Wei pursue wait till you hear a bomb When you hear the bomb at once barricade the road with timber and stones so as to impede them When they halt shoot at them with the bows and the crossbows Wei Yan and Guan Xing were told to attack the rear of the enemyThese orders given the walls of Lucheng were decorated lavishly with flags and at various points within the city were piled straw and kindling wood ready to make some smoke as though there were cooking activities in the cityThe soldiers were sent out along the road from the Wooden PathThe spies of Wei returned to headquarters to say that most of the Shu soldiers had left only a few being in the cityIn doubt Sima Yi went himself to look and when he saw the smoke rising from within the walls and the fluttering flags he said The city is deserted He sent men in to confirm this and they said the place was emptyThen Zhuge Liang is really gone who will pursue Let me replied Zhang HeYou are too impulsive said Sima YiI have been leader of the van from the first day of this expedition why not use me today when there is work to be done and glory to be gained Because the utmost caution is necessaryThey are retreating and they will leave an ambush at every possible point I know that and you need not be afraid Well you wish to go and may but whatever happens you must be prepared for A really noble man is prepared to sacrifice self for country never mind what happens Then take five thousand troops and start Wei Ping shall follow with twenty thousand of horse and foot to deal with any ambush that may discover itselfI will follow later with three thousand to help where need be So Zhang He set out and advanced quicklyTen miles out he heard a roll of drums and suddenly appeared from a wood a cohort led by Wei Yan who galloped to the front crying Whither would you go O rebel leader Zhang He swiftly turned and engaged Wei Yan but after some ten passes Wei Yan fled Zhang He rode after Wei Yan along the road for ten miles and then stopped to observeAs he saw no ambush he turned again and resumed the pursuitAll went well till he came to a slope when there arose shouts and yells and another body of soldiers came out Zhang He do not run away cried this leader who was Guan Xing Guan Xing galloped close and Zhang He did not fleeThey fought and after half a score of passes Guan Xing seemed to have the worst of the encounter and fledZhang He followedPresently they neared a dense wood Zhang He was fearful of entering in so he sent forward scouts to search the thicketsThey could find no danger and Zhang He again pursuedBut quite unexpectedly Wei Yan who had formerly fled got round ahead of Zhang He and now appeared again The two fought a half score bouts and again Wei Yan ranZhang He followed but Guan Xing also got round to the front by a side road and so stopped the pursuit of Zhang He Zhang He attacked furiously as soon as he was checked this time so successfully that the troops of Shu threw away their wargear and ranThe road was thus littered with spoil and the Wei soldiers could not resist the temptation to gather it They slipped from their horses and began to collect the armsThe maneuvers just described continued Wei Yan and Guan Xing one after the other engaging Zhang He and Zhang He pressing on after each one but achieving nothingAnd as evening fell the running fight had led both sides close to the Wooden Path Then suddenly Wei Yan made a real stand and he rode to the front yelling Yield rebelI have not fought yet and you have had it all your own way so farNow we will fight to the death Zhang He was furious and nothing loath so he came on with his spear to meet Wei Yan who was flourishing his swordThey met yet again after some ten bouts Wei Yan threw aside weapons armor helmet and all his gear and even left his horse and led his defeated company sway along the Wooden PathZhang He was filled with the lust to kill and he could not let Wei Yan escape So he set out after Wei Yan although it was already darkBut suddenly lights appeared and the sky became aglow and at the same time huge boulders and great bulks of timber came rolling down the slopes and blocked the way Fear gripped Zhang He and he cried I have blundered into an ambush The road was blocked in front and behind and bordered by craggy precipices Then rattattat came the sound of a rattle and therewith flew clouds of arrows and showers of bolts Zhang He and many of his officers were killedWith myriad shining bolts the air was filled The road was littered with brave soldiers killed The force to Saber Pass faring perished here The tale of valor grows from year to year Soon the second army of Wei under Wei Ping came up but too late to helpFrom the signs they knew that their comrades had been victims of a cruel trick and they turned backBut as they faced about a shout was heard and from the hilltops came I Zhuge Liang am here Looking up they saw his figure outlined against a firePointing to the slain he cried I have gone hunting in this wood as you see only instead of slaying a horse I have killed a deerBut you may go in peace and when you see your general tell him that he will be my quarry one day The soldiers told this to Sima Yi when they returned and he was deeply mortified saying Letting friend Zhang He die is my fault And when he returned to Luoyang the Ruler of Wei wept at the death of his brave leader and had his body searched and honorably buriedZhuge Liang had no sooner reached Hanzhong than he prepared to go on to Capital Chengdu and see his lordBut Li Yan who was in the capital said to the Latter Ruler Why does the Prime Minister return for I have kept him fully supplied with all things needed for the army Then the Latter Ruler sent Fei Yi into Hanzhong to inquire why the army had retiredAnd when he had arrived and showed the cause of his coming Zhuge Liang was greatly surprised and showed the letter from Li Yan saying Li Yan wrote to warn that East Wu was about to invade the country Fei Yi said Li Yan memorialized to the Throne saying he had sent you supplies and knew not why Your Excellency returned So Zhuge Liang inquired carefully and then it came out that Li Yan had failed to find sufficient grain to keep the army supplied and so had sent the first lying letter to the army that it might retire before the shortage showed itself His memorial to the Throne was designed to cover the former faultThe fool has ruined the great design of the state just to save his own skin cried Zhuge Liang bitterly He called in the offender and sentenced him to deathBut Fei Yi interceded saying O Minister the First Ruler had loved and trusted Li Yan with his sonPlease forgive him this time And so Li Yans life was sparedHowever when Fei Yi made his report the Latter Ruler was wroth and ordered Li Yan to suffer deathBut this time Jiang Wan intervened saying Your late father named Li Yan as one of the guardians of your youth And the Latter Ruler relented However Li Yan was stripped of all ranks and relegated to ZitongZhuge Liang went to Chengdu and appointed Li Feng Li Yans son as High Counselor Preparations then began for another expeditionPlans were discussed provisions were accumulated weapons put in order and officers and soldiers kept fit and trained By his kindness to the people Zhuge Liang waited for three years before beginning marching and in the Two Lands of Rivers peoples hearts filled with joysAnd the time passed quickly In the second month of the twelfth year  Zhuge Liang presented a memorial saying I have been training the army for three years supplies are ample and all is in order for an expedition We may now attack WeiIf I cannot destroy these rebels sweep away the evil hordes and bring about a glorious entry into the capital then may I never again enter your Majestys presence The Latter Ruler replied Our state is now firmly established and Wei troubles us not at all why not enjoy the present tranquillity O FatherMinister Because of the mission left me by your fatherI am ever scheming to destroy Wei even in my dreamsI must strive my best and do my utmost to restore you to the ancient capital of your ancestry and replace the Hans in their old palace As Zhuge Liang said this a voice cried An army may not go forth O Minister Qiao Zhou had raised a last protestZhuge Liangs sole thought was service Himself he would not spare But Qiao Zhou had watched the starry sky And read misfortune thereThe next chapter will give the arguments against fighting CHAPTER Sima Yi Occupies The Banks Of River Taurus Zhuge Liang Constructs Mechanical Bullocks And Horses Qiao Zhou who protested against the war was Grand Historian He was also an astrologerHe opposed the war saying My present office involves the direction of the observations on the Astrological Terrace and I am bound to report whether the aspect forebodes misfortune or promises happiness Not long since several flights of thousands of birds came from the south plunged into River Han and were drowned This is an evil auguryMoreover I have studied the aspect of the sky and the Wolf constellation is influencing the aspect of the planet Venus An aura of prosperity pervades the north To attack Wei will not be to our profitAgain the people in Chengdu say that the cypress trees moan in the night With so many evil omens I wish that the Prime Minister should not go forth to war but remain at home to guard what we have How can I said Zhuge LiangHis late Majesty laid upon me a heavy responsibility and I must exert myself to the utmost in the endeavor to destroy these rebels The policy of a state cannot be changed because of vain and irresponsible talk of inauspicious signs Zhuge Liang was not to be deterredHe instructed the officials to prepare the Great Bovine Sacrifice in the Dynastic Temple Then weeping he prostrated himself and made this declaration Thy servant Zhuge Liang has made five expeditions to Qishan without gaining any extension of territory His fault weighs heavily upon himNow once again he is about to march pledged to use every effort of body and mind to exterminate the rebels against the Han House and to restore to the dynasty its ancient glory in its old capital To achieve this end he would use the last remnant of his strength and could die content The sacrifice ended he took leave of the Latter Ruler and set out for Hanzhong to make the final arrangements for his marchWhile so engaged he received the unexpected news of the death of Guan Xing He was greatly shocked and fainted When he had recovered consciousness his officers did their utmost to console him How pitiful Why does Heaven deny long life to the loyal and goodI have lost a most able general just as I am setting out and need him most As all are born so all must die People are as gnats against the sky But loyalty or piety May give them immortalityThe armies of Shu numbered three hundred forty thousand strong and they marched in five divisions with Jiang Wei and Wei Yan in the van and when they had reached Qishan Li Hui the Commissary General was instructed to convey stores into the Xie Valley in readinessIn Wei they had recently changed the style of the year period to Green Dragon because a green dragon had been seen to emerge from Mopo WellThe year of the fighting was the second year The courtiers said to the Ruler of Wei The commanders of the passes report thirty or so legions advancing in five divisions from Shu upon Qishan The news distressed the Ruler of Wei who at once called in Sima Yi and told him of the invasionSima Yi replied The aspect of the sky is very auspicious for the Middle Land The Wolf star has encroached upon the planet Venus which bodes ill for the Lands of RiversThus Zhuge Liang is pitting his powers against the heavens and will meet defeat and suffer deathAnd I by virtue of Your Majestys good fortune am to be the instrument of destructionI request to name four leaders to go with me Who are theyName them said the kingThey are the four sons of Xiahou Yuan Xiahou Ba Xiahou Wei Xiahou Hui and Xiahou HeXiahou Ba and Xiahou Wei are trained archers and cavaliers Xiahou Hui and Xiahou He are deep strategistsAll four desire to avenge the death of their fatherXiahou Ba and Xiahou Wei should be leaders of the van Xiahou Hui and Xiahou He should be Marching Generals to discuss and arrange plans for the repulse of our enemy You remember the evil results of employing the Dynastic SoninLaw Xiahou Mao he lost his army and is still too ashamed to return to court Are you sure these are not of the same kidney They are not like Xiahou Mao in the least The Ruler of Wei granted the request and named Sima Yi as CommanderinChief with the fullest authorityWhen Sima Yi took leave of the Ruler of Wei he received a command in Cao Ruis own writingWhen you Noble Sir reach the banks of River Wei and have well fortified that position you are not to give battleThe army of Shu disappointed of their desire will pretend to retire and so entice you on but you will not pursueYou will wait till their supplies are consumed and they are compelled to retreat when you may smite them Then you will obtain the victory without distressing the army undulyThis is the best plan of campaign Sima Yi took it with bowed head He proceeded forthwith to Changan When he had mustered the forces assembled from all western counties they numbered four hundred thousand and they were all camped on River WeiIn addition fifty thousand troops were farther up the stream preparing nine floating bridgesThe two leaders of the van Xiahou Ba and Xiahou Wei were ordered to cross the river and camp and in rear of the main camp on the east a solid earth rampart was raised to guard against any surprises from the rearWhile these preparations were in progress Guo Huai and Sun Li came to the new camp and the former said With the troops of Shu at Qishan there is a possibility of their dominating River Wei going up on the plain and pushing out a line to the northern hills whereby to cut off all highways in Xizhou You say well said Sima Yi See to itTake command of all the Xizhou forces occupy Beiyuan and make a fortified camp thereBut adopt a defensive policy wait till the enemys food supplies get exhausted before you think of attack So Guo Huai and Sun Li left to carry out these ordersMeanwhile Zhuge Liang made five main camps at Qishan and between Xie Valley and Saber Pass he established a line of fourteen large camps He distributed the troops among these camps as for a long campaignHe appointed inspecting officers to make daily visits to see that all was in readinessWhen he heard that the army of Wei had camped in Beiyuan he said to his officers They camp there fearing that our holding this area will sever connection with XizhouI am pretending to look toward Beiyuan but really my objective is River WeiI am going to build several large rafts and pile them with straw and I have five thousand of marines to manage themIn the darkness of the night I shall attack Beiyuan Sima Yi will come to the rescueIf he is only a little worsted I shall cross the river with the rear divisionsThen the leading divisions will embark on the rafts drop down the river set fire to the floating bridges and attack the rear of the enemyI shall lead an army to take the gates of the first campIf we can get the south bank of the river the campaign will become simple Then the generals took orders and went to prepareThe spies carried information of the doings of the troops of Shu to Sima Yi who said to his generals Zhuge Liang has some crafty scheme but I think I know itHe proposes to make a show of taking Beiyuan and then dropping down the river he will try to burn our bridges throw our rear into confusion and then attack our camps So he gave Xiahou Ba and Xiahou Wei ordersYou are to listen for the sounds of battle about Beiyuan if you hear the shouting you are to march down to the river to the hills on the south and lay an ambush against the troops of Shu as they arrive Zhang Hu and Yue Chen were to lead two other forces of two thousand of bowmen each and lie in hiding on the north bank near the bridges to keep off the rafts that might come down on the current and keep them from touching the bridgesThen he sent for Guo Huai and Sun Li and said Zhuge Liang is coming to Beiyuan to cross the river secretly Your force is small and you can hide half way along the roadIf the enemy cross the river in the afternoon that will mean an attack on us in the evening Then you are to simulate defeat and run They will pursueYou can shoot with all your energy and our marines and land troops will attack at onceIf the attack is in great force look out for orders All these orders given Sima Yi sent his two sons Sima Shi and Sima Zhao to reinforce the front camp while he led his own army to relieve BeiyuanZhuge Liang sent Wei Yan and Ma Dai to cross River Wei and attack Beiyuan while the attempt to set fire to the bridges was confided to Wu Ban and Wu YiThe general attack on the Wei camp by River Wei was to be made by three divisions the front division under Wang Ping and Zhang Ni the middle division under Jiang Wei and Ma Zhong the rear division under Liao Hua and Zhang YiThe various divisions started at noon and crossed the river where they slowly formed up in battle orderWei Yan and Ma Dai arrived Beiyuan about duskThe scouts having informed the defenders of their approach Sun Li abandoned his camp and fled This told Wei Yan that his attack was expected and he turned to retireAt this moment a great shouting was heard and there appeared two bodies of the enemy under Sima Yi and Guo Huai bearing down upon the attackersDesperate efforts were made to extricate themselves but many of the soldiers of Shu fell into the river and drowned The others scatteredHowever Wu Yi came up and rescued the force from entire destructionWu Ban set half his troops to navigate the rafts down the river to the bridges But Zhang Hu and Yue Chen stationed near the bridges shot clouds of arrows at them and the Shu leader Wu Ban was wounded He fell into the river and was drownedThe crews of the rafts jumped into the water and got away The rafts fell into the hands of the soldiers of WeiAt this time the front division under Wang Ping and Zhang Ni were ignorant of the defeat of their Beiyuan army and they went straight for the camps of Wei They arrived in the second watchThey heard loud shouting and Wang Ping said to Zhang Ni We do not know whether the cavalry sent to Beiyuan has been successful or notIt is strange that we do not see a single soldier of the enemySurely Sima Yi has found out the plan and prepared to frustrate the attackLet us wait here till the bridges have been set on fire and we see the flames So they halted Soon after a mounted messenger came up with ordersThe Prime Minister bade you retire immediately as the attack on the bridges has failed Wang Ping and Zhang Ni attempted to withdraw but a bomb exploded and the troops of Wei who had taken a byroad to their rear at once attacked A great fire started alsoA disorderly battle ensued from which Wang Ping and Zhang Ni eventually forced their ways out but only with great lossAnd when Zhuge Liang collected his army at Qishan once more he found to his sorrow that he had lost more than ten thousand troops Just at this time Fei Yi arrived front ChengduZhuge Liang received him and after the ceremonies were over said I would trouble you Sir to carry a letter for me into East Wu will you undertake the mission Could I possibly decline any task you laid upon me said Fei YiSo Zhuge Liang wrote a letter and sent it to Sun QuanFei Yi took it and hastened to Jianye where he saw Sun Quan the Ruler of Wu and presented this letterThe Hans have been unfortunate and the line of rulers has been broken The Cao party have usurped the seat of government and still hold the commandMy late master Emperor Bei confided a great task to me and I must exhaust every effort to achieve it Now my army is at Qishan and the rebels are on the verge of destruction on River WeiI hope Your Majesty in accordance with your oath of alliance will send a leader against the north to assist by taking the Middle Land and the empire can be sharedThe full circumstances cannot be told but I hope you will understand and act Sun Quan was pleased at the news and said to the envoy I have long desired to set my arm in motion but have not been able to arrange with Zhuge LiangAfter this letter I will lead an expedition myself and go to Juchao and capture Xincheng of WeiMoreover I will send Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to camp at Miankou and Jiangxia and take Xiangyang I will also send an army under Sun Shao into Guangling to capture HuaiyangThe total number will be three hundred thousand troops and they shall start at once Fei Yi thanked him and said In such a case the Middle Land will fall forthwith A banquet was preparedAt this Sun Quan said Whom did the Prime Minister send to lead the battle Fei Yi replied Wei Yan was the chief leader A man brave enough but crookedOne day he will work a mischief unless Zhuge Liang is very waryBut surely he knows Your Majestys words are to the point said the envoy I will return at once and lay them before Zhuge Liang Fei Yi quickly took leave and hastened to Qishan with his news of the intended expedition of WuDid the Ruler of Wu say nothing else asked Zhuge LiangThen Fei Yi told him what had been said about Wei YanTruly a comprehending ruler said Zhuge Liang appreciativelyBut I could not be ignorant of this However I use Wei Yan because he is very bold Then Sir you ought to decide soon what to do with him I have a scheme of my own Fei Yi returned to Chengdu and Zhuge Liang resumed the ordinary camp duties of a leaderWhen Zhuge Liang was in a council with his commanders suddenly a certain Wei leader came and begged to be allowed to surrender Zhuge Liang had the man brought in and questioned himI am a leader Zheng Wen by name General Qin Lang and I are old colleaguesRecently Sima Yi transferred us and showing great partiality for my colleague appointed him Leader of the Van and threw me out like a weedI was disgusted and left and I wish to join your ranks if you will accept my service Just at that moment a soldier came in to say that Qin Lang with a company had appeared in front of the tents and was challenging Zheng WenSaid Zhuge Liang How does this man stand with you in fighting skill I should just kill him said Zheng WenIf you were to slay him that would remove my doubts Zheng Wen accepted the proposer with alacrity mounted his horse and away he wentZhuge Liang went out to see the fight There was the challenger shaking his spear and reviling his late friend as rebel and brigand and horsethiefGive me back my horse you stole cried Qin Lang galloping toward Zheng Wen as soon as he appearedZheng Wen whipped up his horse waved his sword and went to meet the attackIn the first bout he cut down Qin Lang The Wei soldiers then ran away the victor hacked off the head of his victim and returned to lay it at Zhuge Liangs feetSeated in his tent Zhuge Liang summoned Zheng Wen and burst out Take him away and behead him I have done nothing wrong cried Zheng Wen As if I do not know Qin LangThe man you have just killed was not Qin LangHow dareyou try to deceive me Zheng Wen said I will own up but this was his brother Qin Ming Zhuge Liang smiled Sima Yi sent you to try this on for some reason of his own but he could not throw dust in my eyesIf you do not tell the truth I will put you to death Thus caught the false deserter confessed and begged his lifeZhuge Liang said You can save your life by writing a letter to Sima Yi telling him to come to raid our camp I will spare you on this conditionAnd if I capture Sima Yi I will give you all the credit and reward you handsomely There was nothing for it but to agree and the letter was writtenThen Zheng Wen was placed in confinement How did you know this was only a pretended desertion said Fan JianSima Yi looks to his people replied Zhuge LiangIf he made Qin Lang a leading general Qin Lang was certainly a man of great military skill and not the sort of man to be overcome by this fellow Zheng Wen in the first encounterSo Zheng Wens opponent certainly was not Qin LangThat is how I knew They congratulated him on his perspicacityThen Zhuge Liang selected a certain persuasive speaker from among his officers and whispered certain instructions in his earThe officer at once left and carried the letter just written to the Wei camp where he asked to see the CommanderinChief He was admitted and the letter was readWho are you said Sima Yi I am a man from the Middle Land a poor fellow stranded in ShuZheng Wen and I are fellow villagersZhuge Liang has given Zheng Wen a vanleadership as a reward for what he has done and Zheng Wen got me to bring this letter to you and to say that he will show a light tomorrow evening as a signal and he hopes you will lead the attack yourselfZheng Wen will work from the inside in your favor Sima Yi took great pains to test the reliability of these statements and he examined the letter minutely to see if it bore any signs of fabrication but he found it was Zheng Wens writingPresently he ordered in refreshments for the bearer of the letter and then he said We will fix today at the second watch for the raid and I will lead in personIf it succeeds I will give you a good appointment as a reward Taking leave the soldier retraced his steps to his own camp and reported the whole interview to Zhuge Liang Zhuge Liang held his sword aloft toward the North Star took the proper paces for an incantation and prayedThis done he summoned Wang Ping Zhang Ni Wei Yan Ma Dai Ma Zhong and Jiang Wei to whom he gave certain instructionsWhen they had gone to carry them out he ascended a hill taking with him a few score guards onlySima Yi had been taken in by Zheng Wens letter and intended to lead the night raidBut the elder of his sons Sima Shi expostulated with his father Father you are going on a dangerous expedition on the faith of a mere scrap of paper said his son I think it imprudentWhat if something goes unexpectedly wrongLet some general go in your place and you come up in rear as a reserve Sima Yi saw there was reason in this proposal and he finally decided to send Qin Lang with ten thousand troops and Sima Yi himself would command the reserveThe night was fine with a bright moonBut about the middle of the second watch the sky clouded over and it became very black so that a man could not see his next neighbor This is providential chuckled Sima YiThe expedition duly started soldiers with gags and horses with cords round their muzzlesThey moved swiftly and silently and Qin Lang made straight for the camp of Shu But when he reached it and entered and saw not a soldier he knew he had been trickedHe yelled to his troops to retire but lights sprang up all round and attacks began from four sidesFight as he would Qin Lang could not free himselfFrom behind the battle area Sima Yi saw flames rising from the camp of Shu and heard continuous shouting but he knew not whether it meant victory for his own army or to his enemy He pressed forward toward the fireSuddenly a shout a roll of drums and a blare of trumpets close at hand a bomb that seemed to rend the earth and Wei Yan and Jiang Wei bore down upon Sima Yi one on each flankThis was the final blow to him Of every ten soldiers of Wei eight or nine were killed or wounded and the few others scattered to the four windsMeanwhile Qin Langs ten thousand troops were falling under arrows that came in locustflights and their leader was killedSima Yi and the remnant of his army ran away to their own campAfter the third watch the sky clearedZhuge Liang from the hilltop sounded the gong of retreatThis obscurity in the third watch was due to an incantation called Concealing Method The sky became clear because Zhuge Liang performed another incantation to have the Deities of Six Layers sweep away the few floating clouds that still persisted The victory was completeThe first order on Zhuge Liangs return to camp was to put Zheng Wen to death Next he considered new plans for capturing the south bankEvery day be sent a party to offer a challenge before the camps of the enemy but no one acceptedOne day Zhuge Liang rode in his small chariot to the front of the Qishan Mountains keenly scanned the course of River Wei and carefully surveyed the lie of the landPresently he came to a valley shaped like a bottlegourd large enough to form a hiding place for a whole thousand soldiers in the inner recess while half as many more could hide in the outerIn rear the mountains were so close that they left passage only for a single horsemanThe discovery pleased the general mightily and he asked the guides what the place was calledThey replied It is called Shangfang Valley and nicknamed Gourd Valley Returning to his camp he called up two leaders named Du Rui and Hu Zhong and whispered into their ears certain secret ordersNext he called up a thousand craftspeople and sent them into the Gourd Valley to construct wooden oxen and running horses for the use of the troopsFinally he set Ma Dai with five hundred troops to guard the mouth of the Gourd Valley and prevent all entrance and exitZhuge Liang said People from outside cannot enter from inside cannot exitI will visit the valley at irregular intervals to inspect the workA plan for the defeat of Sima Yi is being prepared here and must be kept a profound secret Ma Dai left to take up the positionThe two generals Du Rui and Hu Zhong were superintendents of the work in the Gourd ValleyZhuge Liang came every day to give instructionsOne day Yang Yi went to Zhuge Liang and said The stores of grain are all at Saber Pass and the labor of transport is very heavyWhat can be done Zhuge Liang replied smiling I have had a scheme ready for a long timeThe timber that I collected and bought in the Lands of Rivers was for the construction of wooden transport animals to convey grainIt will be very advantageous as they will require neither food nor water and they can keep on the move day and night without resting All those within hearing said From old days till now no one has ever heard of such a deviceWhat excellent plan have you O Minister to make such marvelous creatures They are being made now after my plans but they are not yet readyHere I have the sketches for these mechanical oxen and horses with all their dimensions written out in fullYou may see the details Zhuge Liang then produced a paper and all the generals crowded round to look at itThey were all greatly astonished and lauded The Prime Minister is superhuman A few days later the new mechanical animals were complete and began workThey were quite lifelike and went over the hills in any desired directionThe whole army saw them with delightThey were but in charge of General Gao Xiang and a thousand soldiers to guide them They kept going constantly between Saber Pass and the front carrying grain for the use of the soldiersAlong the Saber Pass mountain roads The running horses bore their loads And through Xie Valleys narrow way The wooden oxen paced each dayO generals use these means today And transport troubles take awaySima Yi was already sad enough at his defeat when the spies told him of these wooden bullocks and horses of new design which the soldiers of Shu were using to convey their grainThis troubled him still more and he said to his generals I knew the transportation from the Lands of Rivers was difficult therefore I shut the gates and remained on the defensive waiting for the enemy to be starvedWith this device they may never be compelled to retreat for want of food Then he called up Zhang Hu and Yue Chen and gave orders Each of you with five hundred troops will goes to the Xie Valley by byroadsWhen you see the Shu soldiers transport their grain by you are to let them through but only to attack at the end and capture four or five of the wooden horses and bullocks So a thousand soldiers went on this service disguised as soldiers of Shu They made their way along the byways by night and hid Presently the wooden convoy came along under the escort of Gao XiangJust as the end of it was passing they made a sudden rush and captured a few of the animals which the soldiers of Shu abandoned In high glee they took them to their own camp When Sima Yi saw them he had to confess they were very lifelike But what pleased him most was that he could imitate them now that he had modelsIf Zhuge Liang can use this sort of thing it would be strange if I could not said heHe called to him many clever craftspeople and made them then and there take the machines to pieces and make some exactly like themIn less than half a month they had completed a couple of thousand after Zhuge Liangs models and the new mechanical animals could moveThen Sima Yi placed Cen Wei General Who Guards the Frontiers in charge of this new means of transport and the animals began to ply between the camp and XizhouThe Wei soldiers were filled with joysGao Xiang returned to camp and reported the loss of a few of his wooden oxen and horses I wished him to capture some of them said Zhuge Liang much pleasedI am just laying out these few and before long I shall get some very solid help in exchange How do you know O Minister said his officersBecause Sima Yi will certainly copy them and when he has done that I have another plan ready to play on him Some days later Zhuge Liang received a report that the enemy were using the same sort of wooden bullocks and horses to bring up supplies from XizhouExactly as I thought said beCalling Wang Ping he said Dress up a thousand soldiers as those of Wei and find your way quickly and secretly to Beiyuan Tell them that you are escort for the convoy and mingle with the real escortThen suddenly turn on them so that they scatter Next you will turn the herd this way By and by you will be pursued When that occurs you will give a turn to the tongues of the wooden animals and they will be locked from movement Leave them where they are and run awayWhen the soldiers of Wei come up they will be unable to drag the creatures and equally unable to carry themI shall have soldiers ready and you will go back with them give the tongues a backward turn and bring the convoy here The enemy will be greatly astonished Next he called Zhang Ni and said Dress up five hundred soldiers in the costume of the Deities of the Six Layers so that they appear supernatural Fit them with demon heads and wild beast shapes and let them stain their faces various colors so as to look as strange as possibleGive them flags and swords and bottlegourds with smoke issuing from combustibles insideLet these soldiers hide among the hills till the convoy approaches when they will start the smoke rush out suddenly and drive off the wooden animalsNo one will dare pursue such uncanny company When Zhang Ni had left Wei Yan and Jiang Wei were calledYou will take ten thousand troops go to the border of Beiyuan to receive the wooden transport creatures and defend them against attack Then another five thousand under Zhang Yi and Liao Hua was sent to check Sima Yi if he should come while a small force under Ma Dai and Ma Zhong was sent to bid defiance to the enemy near their camp on the south bankSo one day when a convoy was on its way from Xizhou the scouts in front suddenly reported some soldiers ahead who said they were escort for the grainCommander Cen Wei halted and sent to inquire It appeared the newcomers were really the soldiers of Wei however and so he started once more The newcomers joined up with his own troopsBut before they had gone much farther there was a yell and the men of Shu began to kill while a voice shouted Wang Ping is here The convoy guard were taken abackMany were killed but the others rallied round Cen Wei and made some defenseHowever Wang Ping slew Cen Wei and the others ran this way and that while the convoy was turned toward the Shu campThe fugitives ran off to Beiyuan and reported the mishap to Guo Huai who set out hot foot to rescue the convoyWhen he appeared Wang Ping gave the order to turn tongues left the wooden animals in the road and ran awayGuo Huai made no attempt to pursue but tried to put the wooden animals in motion toward their proper destination But he could not move themHe was greatly perplexed Then suddenly there arose the roll of drums all round and out burst two parties of soldiers These were Wei Yan and Jiang Weis troops and when they appeared Wang Pings soldiers faced about and came to the attack as wellThese three being too much for Guo Huai he retreated before themThereupon the tongues were turned back again and the wooden herd set in motionSeeing this Guo Huai came on again But just then he saw smoke curling up among the hills and a lot of extraordinary creatures burst out upon him Some held swords and some flags and all were terrible to look at They rushed at the wooden animals and urged them awayTruly these are supernatural helpers cried Guo Huai quite frightenedThe soldiers also were terrorstricken and stood stillHearing that his Beiyuan troops had been driven off Sima Yi came out to the rescueMidway along the road just where it was most precipitous a cohort burst out upon him with fierce yells and bursting bombsUpon the leading banner he read Zhang Yi and Liao Hua Generals of HanPanic seized upon his army and they ran like windsIn the field the craftier leader on the convoy makes a raid And his rivals life endangers by an ambush subtly laidIf you would know the upshot read the next chapter CHAPTER In Gourd Valley Sima Yi Is Trapped In Wuzhang Hills Zhuge Liang Invokes The Stars Heavily smitten in the battle Sima Yi fled from the field a lonely horseman a single spear Seeing a thick wood in the distance he made for its shelterZhang Yi halted the rear division while Liao Hua pressed forward after the fugitive whom he could see threading his way among the treesAnd Sima Yi indeed was soon in fear of his life dodging from tree to tree as his pursuer nearedOnce Liao Hua was actually close enough to slash at his enemy but Liao Hua missed the blow and his sword struck a tree and before he could pull his sword out of the wood Sima Yi had got clear awayWhen Liao Hua got through into the open country he did not know which way to go Presently he noticed a golden helmet lying on the ground to the east just lately thrown asideHe picked it up hung it on his saddle and went away eastwardBut the crafty fugitive having flung away his helmet thus on the east side of the wood had gone away west so that Liao Hua was going away from his quarryAfter some time Liao Hua fell in with Jiang Wei when he abandoned the pursuit and rode with Jiang Wei back to campThe wooden oxen and running horses having been driven into camp their loads were put into the storehouse The grain that fell to the victors amounted to ten thousand carts or moreLiao Hua presented the enemys helmet as proof of his prowess in the field and received a reward of the first grade of merit But Wei Yan had nothing to offer and so was overlookedWei Yan went away angry and discontented but Zhuge Liang pretended to be ignorant of his servicesVery sadly Sima Yi returned to his own campBad news followed for a messenger brought letters telling of an invasion by three armies of Wu The letters said that forces had been sent against them and the Ruler of Wei again enjoined upon his CommanderinChief a waiting and defensive policySo Sima Yi deepened his moats and raised his rampartsCao Rui had sent three armies against the invaders Liu Shao led that to save Jiangxia Tian Du led the Xiangyang force Cao Rui himself with Man Chong went into HefeiThis last was the main army Man Chong led the leading division toward Lake Chaohu Thence looking across to the eastern shore he saw a forest of battleships and flags and banners crowded the sky So he returned to the main army and proposed an attack without loss of timeThe enemy think we shall be fatigued after a long march and have not troubled to prepare any defense we should attack this night and we shall overcome them What you say accords with my own ideas said the Ruler of Wei and he told off the cavalry leader Zhang Qiu to take five thousand troops and try to burn out the enemyMan Chong was also to attack from the eastern bankIn the second watch of that night the two forces set out and gradually approached the entrance to the lakeThey reached the marine camp unobserved burst upon it with a yell and the soldiers of Wu fled without striking a blowThe troops of Wei set fires going in every direction and thus destroyed all the ships together with much grain and many weaponsZhuge Jin who was in command led his beaten troops to Miankou and the attackers returned to their camp much elatedWhen the report come to Lu Xun he called together his officers and said I must write to the Emperor to abandon the siege of Xincheng that the army may be employed to cut off the retreat of the Wei army while I will attack them in front They will be harassed by the double danger and we shall break them All agreed that this was a good plan and the memorial was draftedIt was sent by the hand of a junior officer who was told to convey it secretlyBut this messenger was captured at the ferry and taken before the Ruler of Wei who read the dispatch saying with a sigh This Lu Xun of East Wu is really very resourceful The captive was put into prison and Liu Shao was told off to defend the rear and keep off Sun Quans armyNow Zhuge Jins defeated soldiers were suffering from hot weather illnesses and at length he was compelled to write and tell Lu Xun and ask that his army be relieved and sent homeHaving read this dispatch Lu Xun said to the messenger Make my obeisance to the General and say that I will decide When the messenger returned with this reply Zhuge Jin asked what was doing in the CommanderinChiefs campThe messenger replied The soldiers were all outside planting beans and the officers were amusing themselves at the gates They were playing a game of skill throwing arrows into narrownecked vases Then Zhuge Jin himself went to his chiefs camp and asked how the pressing danger was to be metLu Xun replied My messenger to the Emperor was captured and thus my plans were discoveredNow it is useless to prepare to fight and so we would better retreatI have sent in a memorial to engage the Emperor to retire gradually Zhuge Jin replied Why delayIf you think it best to retire it had better be done quickly My army must retreat slowly or the enemy will come in pursuit which will mean defeat and lossNow you must first prepare your ships as if you meant to resist while I make a semblance of an attack toward Xiangyang Under cover of these operations we shall withdraw into the South Land and the enemy will not dare to follow So Zhuge Jin returned to his own camp and began to fit out his ships as if for an immediate expedition while Lu Xun made all preparations to march giving out that he intended to advance upon XiangyangThe news of these movements were duly reported in the Wei camps and when the leaders heard it they wished to go out and fightBut the Ruler of Wei knew his opponent better than they and would not bring about a battleSo he called his officers together and said to them This Lu Xun is very crafty keep careful guard but do not risk a battle The officers obeyed but a few days later the scouts brought in news that the armies of Wu had retiredThe Ruler of Wei doubted and sent out some of his own spies who confirmed the report When he thus knew it was true he consoled himself with the words Lu Xun knows the art of war even as did Sun Zi and Wu QiThe subjugation of the southeast is not for me this time Thereupon Cao Rui distributed his generals among the various vantage points and led the main army back into Hefei where he camped ready to take advantage of any change of conditions that might promise successMeanwhile Zhuge Liang was at Qishan where to all appearances he intended to make a long sojourn He made his soldiers mix with the people in Wei and share in the labor of the fields and the cropsthe soldiers onethird the people twothird He gave strict orders against any encroachment on the property of the farmers and so they and the soldiers lived together very amicablyThen Sima Yis son Sima Shi went to his father and said These soldiers of Shu have despoiled us of much grain and now they are mingling with the people of Qishan and tilling the fields along the banks of River Wei as if they intended to remain there This would be a calamity for usWhy do you not appoint a time to fight a decisive battle with Zhuge Liang His father replied I have the Emperors orders to act on the defensive and may not do as you suggest While they were thus talking one reported that Wei Yan had come near and was insulting the army and reminding them that he had the helmet of their leader And he was challenging themThe generals were greatly incensed and desired to accept the challenge but the CommanderinChief was immovable in his decision to obey his orders The Holy One says If one cannot suffer small things great matters are imperiled Our plan is to defend So the challenge was not accepted and there was no battleAfter reviling them for some time Wei Yan went awaySeeing that his enemy was not to be provoked into fighting Zhuge Liang gave orders to Ma Dai to build a strong stockade in the Gourd Valley and therein to excavate pits and to collect large quantities of inflammablesSo on the hill they piled wood and straw in the shape of sheds and all about they dug pits and buried minesWhen these preparations were complete Ma Dai received instructions to block the road in rear of Gourd Valley and to lay an ambush at the entranceIf Sima Yi comes let him enter the valley and then explode the mines and set fire to the straw and the wood said Zhuge LiangAlso set up a sevenstar signal at the mouth of the valley and arrange a night signal of seven lamps on the hill After Ma Dai had gone Wei Yan was called in and Zhuge Liang said to him Go to the camp of Wei with five hundred troops and provoke them to battleThe important matter is to entice Sima Yi out of his strongholdYou will be unable to obtain a victory so retreat that he may pursue and you are to make for the signal the seven stars by day or the seven lamps at nightThus you will lead him into the Gourd Valley where I have a plan prepared for him When Wei Yan had gone Gao Xiang was summonedTake small herds forty or fifty at a time of the wooden oxen and running horses load them up with grain and lead them to and fro on the mountainsIf you can succeed in getting the enemy to capture them you will render a service So the transport wooden cattle were sent forth to play their part in the scheme and the remainder of the Qishan soldiers were sent to work in the fields with orders to join in the battle only if Sima Yi came in personIn that case they were to attack the south bank of the river and cut off the retreatThen Zhuge Liang led his army away to camp next to the Gourd ValleyXiahou Hui and Xiahou He went to their chief Sima Yi and said The enemy have set out camps and are engaged in field work as though they intended to remainIf they are not destroyed now but are allowed to consolidate their position they will be hard to dislodge This certainly is one of Zhuge Liangs ruses said the chiefYou seem very afraid of him General retorted they When do you think you can destroy himAt least let us two brothers fight one battle that we may prove our gratitude for the Emperors kindness If it must be so then you may go in two divisions said Sima YiAs the two divisions five thousand troops each were marching along they saw coming toward them a number of the transport wooden animals of the enemy They attacked at once drove off the escort captured them and sent them back to campNext day they captured more with soldiers and horses as well and sent them also to camp Sima Yi called up the prisoners and questioned them They told him saying The Prime Minister understood that you would not fight and so had told off the soldiers to various places to work in the fields and thus provide for future needsWe had been unwittingly captured Sima Yi set them free and bade them begone Why spare them asked Xiahou HeThere is nothing to be gained by the slaughter of a few common soldiersLet them go back to their own and praise the kindliness of the Wei leaders That will slacken the desire of their comrades to fight against usThat was the plan by which Lu Meng captured Jingzhou Then he issued general orders that all Shu prisoners should be well treated and sent away free and he rewarded those of his army who had done wellAs has been said Gao Xiang was ordered to keep pretended convoys on the move and the soldiers of Wei attacked and captured them whenever they saw themIn half a month they had scored many successes of this sort and Sima Yis heart was cheeredOne day when he had made new captures of soldiers he sent for them and questioned them againWhere is Zhuge Liang now He is no longer at Qishan but in camp about three miles from the Gourd ValleyHe is gathering a great store of grain there After he had questioned them fully he set the prisoners freeCalling together his officers he said Zhuge Liang is not camped on Qishan but near the Gourd ValleyTomorrow you shall attack the Qishan camp and I will command the reserve The promise cheered them and they went away to prepareFather why do you intend to attack the enemys rear asked Sima ShiQishan is their main position and they will certainly hasten to its rescueThen I shall make for the valley and burn the stores That will render them helpless and will be a victory The son dutifully agreed with his father Sima Yi began to march out with Zhang Hu and Yue Chen following as the reservesFrom the top of a hill Zhuge Liang watched the Wei soldiers march and noticed that they moved in companies from three to five thousand observing the front and the rear carefully as they marched He guessed that their object was the Qishan camp and sent strict orders to his generals that if Sima Yi led in person they were to go off and capture the camp on the south bankWhen the troops of Wei had got near and made their rush toward the camp of Shu the troops of Shu ran up also yelling and pretending to reinforce the defendersSima Yi seeing this suddenly marched his center army with his two sons changed his direction and turned off for the Gourd ValleyHere Wei Yan was expecting him and as soon as he appeared Wei Yan galloped up and soon recognized Sima Yi as the leaderSima Yi stay shouted Wei Yan as he came nearHe flourished his sword and Sima Yi set his spearThe two warriors exchanged a few passes and then Wei Yan suddenly turned his steed and boltedAs he had been ordered he made direct for the sevenstarred flag and Sima Yi followed the more readily as he saw the fugitive had but a small forceThe two sons of Sima Yi rode with him Sima Shi on the left Sima Zhao on the rightPresently Wei Yan and his troops entered the mouth of the valleySima Yi halted a time while he sent forward a few scouts but when they returned and reportedNot a single Shu soldier is seen but a many straw houses on the hills Sima Yi rode in saying This must be the store valley But when he had got well within Sima Yi noticed that kindling wood was piled over the straw huts and as he saw no sign of Wei Yan he began to feel uneasySupposing soldiers seize the entrance what then said he to his sonsAs he spoke there arose a great shout and from the hillside came many torches which fell all around them and set fire to the straw so that soon the entrance to the valley was lost in smoke and flameThey tried to get away from the fire but no road led up the hillside Then firearrows came shooting down and the earthmines exploded and the straw and firewood blazed high as the heavensSima Yi scared and helpless dismounted clasped his arms about his two sons and wept saying My sons we three are doomed But suddenly a fierce gale sprang up black clouds gathered a peal of thunder followed and rain poured down in torrents speedily extinguishing the fire all through the valleyThe mines no longer exploded and all the fiery contrivances ceased to work mischief If we do not break out now what better chance shall we have cried the father and he and his two sons made a dash for the outlet As they broke out of the valley they came upon reinforcements under Zhang Hu and Yue Chen and so were once more safeMa Dai was not strong enough to pursue and the soldiers of Wei got safely to the riverBut there they found their camp in the possession of the enemy while Guo Huai and Sun Li were on the floating bridge struggling with the troops of ShuHowever as Sima Yi neared the troops of Shu retreated whereupon Sima Yi ordered the bridges burned and the north bank occupiedThe Wei army attacking the Qishan camp were greatly disturbed when they heard of the defeat of their general and the loss of the camp on River Wei The troops of Shu took the occasion to strike with greater vigor and so gained a great victory The beaten army suffered great loss Those who escaped fled across the riverWhen Zhuge Liang from the hilltop saw that Sima Yi had been inveigled into the trap by Wei Yan he rejoiced exceedingly and when he saw the flames burst forth he thought surely his rival was done forThen unhappily for him Heaven thought it well to send down torrents of rain which quenched the fire and upset all his calculationsSoon after the scouts reported the escape of his victims and he sighed saying Human proposes God disposes We cannot wrest events to our will Fierce fires roared in the valley But the rain quenched themHad Zhuge Liangs plan but succeeded Where had been the JinsFrom the new camp on the north bank of the river Sima Yi issued an order that he would put to death any officer who proposed going out to battleThe final result of the late illadvised expedition had been the loss of the south bank of the river Accordingly no one spoke of attacking but all turned their energies toward defenseGuo Huai went to the general to talk over plansHe said The enemy have been carefully spying out the country and are certainly selecting a new position for a camp Sima Yi said If Zhuge Liang goes out to Wugong Hills and thence eastward we shall be in grave danger if he goes southwest by River Wei and halts on the Wuzhang Hills we need feel no anxiety They decided to send scouts to find out the movements of their enemyPresently the scouts returned to say that Zhuge Liang had chosen the Wuzhang HillsOur great Emperor of Wei has remarkable fortune said Sima Yi clapping his hand to his foreheadThen he confirmed the order to remain strictly on the defensive till some change of circumstances on the part of the enemy should promise advantageAfter his army had settled into camp on the Wuzhang Hills Zhuge Liang continued his attempts to provoke a battle Day after day parties went to challenge the army of Wei but they resisted all provocationOne day Zhuge Liang put a dress made of deer hide in a box which he sent with a letter to his rivalThe insult could not be concealed so the generals led the bearer of the box to their chiefSima Yi opened the box and saw the deer hide dress Then he opened the letter which read something like thisFriend Sima Yi although you are a CommanderinChief and lead the armies of the Middle Land you seem but little disposed to display the firmness and valor that would render a contest decisive Instead you have prepared a comfortable lair where you are safe from the keen edge of the sword Are you not very like a deerWherefore I send the bearer with a suitable gift and you will humbly accept it and the humiliation unless indeed you finally decide to come out and fight like a manIf you are not entirely indifferent to shame if you retain any of the feelings of a tiger you will send this back to me and come out and give battle Sima Yi although inwardly raging pretended to take it all as a joke and smiled So he regards me as a deer said heHe accepted the gift and treated the messenger wellBefore the messenger left Sima Yi asked him a few questions about his masters eating and sleeping and hours of laborThe Prime Minister works very hard said the messenger He rises early and retires to bed late He attends personally to all cases requiring punishment of over twenty of strokesAs for food he does not eat more than a few pints of grain daily Indeed he eats little and works much remarked Sima YiCan he last long The messenger returned to his own side and reported that Sima Yi had taken the whole episode in good part and shown no sign of anger He had only asked about the Prime Ministers hours of rest and food and such things He had said no word about military mattersI told him that you ate little and worked long hours and then he said Can he last long That was all He knows said Zhuge Liang pensivelyFirst Secretary Yang Yong presently ventured to remonstrate with his chief I notice said Yang Yong that you check the books personallyI think that is needless labor for a Prime Minister to undertake In every administration the higher and subordinate ranks have their especial fields of activity and each should confine his labors to his own fieldIn a household for example the male servants plow and the female servants cook and thus operations are carried on without waste of energy and all needs are supplied The master of the house has ample leisure and tranquillityIf one individual strives to attend personally to every matter he only wearies himself and fails to accomplish his end How can he possibly hope to perform all the various tasks so well as the maids or the servantsHe fails in his own part that of playing the masterAnd indeed the ancients held this same opinion for they said that the high officers should attend to the discussion of ways and means and the lower should carry out detailsOf old Bing Ji was moved to deep thought by the panting of an ox but inquired not about the corpses of certain brawlers which lay about the road for this matter concerned the magistrateChen Ping was ignorant of the figures relating to taxes for he said these were the concern of the controllers of taxesO Minister you weary yourself with minor details and sweat yourself every dayYou are wearing yourself out and Sima Yi has good reason for what he said I know I cannot but know replied Zhuge LiangBut this heavy responsibility was laid upon me and I fear no other will be so devoted as I am Those who heard him weptThereafter Zhuge Liang appeared more and more harassed and military operations did not speedOn the other side the officers of Wei resented bitterly the insult that had been put upon them when their leader had been presented with the deer hide dressThey wished to avenge the taunt and went to their general saying We are reputable generals of the army of a great state how can we put up with such insults from these soldiers of ShuWe pray you let us fight them It is not that I fear to go out said Sima Yi nor that I relish the insults but I have the Emperors command to hold on and may not disobey The officers were not in the least appeasedWherefore Sima Yi said I will send your request to the Throne in a memorial what think you of that They consented to await the Emperors reply and a messenger bore to the Ruler of Wei in Hefei this memorialI have small ability and high office Your Majesty laid on me the command to defend and not fight till the army of Shu had suffered by the flux of timeBut Zhuge Liang has now sent me a gift of a deer hide dress and my shame is very deepWherefore I advise Your Majesty that one day I shall have to fight in order to justify your kindness to me and to remove the shameful stigma that now rests upon my army I cannot express the degree to which I am urged to this course Cao Rui read it and turned questioningly to his courtiers seeking an explanation Xin Pi supplied itSima Yi has no desire to give battle this memorial is because of the shame put upon the officers by Zhuge Liangs gift They are all in a rageHe wishes for an edict to pacify them Cao Rui understood and gave to Xin Pi an authority flag and sent him to the River Wei camp to make known that it was the Emperors command not to fightSima Yi received the messenger with all respect and it was given out that any future reference to offering battle would be taken as disobedience to the Emperors especial command in the edictThe officers could but obeySima Yi said to Xin Pi Noble Sir you interpreted my own desire correctly It was thenceforward understood that Sima Yi was forbidden to give battleWhen it was told to Zhuge Liang he said This is only Sima Yis method of pacifying his armyHe has never had any intention of fighting and requested the edict to justify his strategy It is well known that a general in the field takes no command from any person not even his own kingIs it likely that he would send a thousand miles to ask permission to fight if that was all he neededThe officers were bitter and so Sima Yi got the Emperor to assist him in maintaining disciplineAll this is meant to slacken our soldiers Just at this time Fei Yi came He was called in to see the Prime Minister and Zhuge Liang asked the reason for his comingHe replied The Ruler of Wei Cao Rui hearing that Wu has invaded his country at three points has led a great army to Hefei and sent three other armies under Man Chong Tian Du and Liu Shao to oppose the invadersThe stores and fightmaterial of Wu have been burned and the army of Wu have fallen victims to sicknessA letter from Lu Xun containing a scheme of attack fell into the hands of the enemy and the Ruler of Wu has marched back into his own country Zhuge Liang listened to the end then without a word he fell in a swoon He recovered after a time but he was broken He said My mind is all in confusionThis is a return of my old illness and I am doomed Ill as he was Zhuge Liang that night went forth from his tent to scan the heavens and study the stars They filled him with fearHe returned and said to Jiang Wei My life may end at any moment Why do you say such a thing Just now in the Triumvirate constellation the Guest Star was twice as bright as usual while the Host Star was darkened the supporting stars were also obscureWith such an aspect I know my fate If the aspect be as malignant as you say why not pray in order to avert it replied Jiang WeiI am in the habit of praying replied Zhuge Liang but I know not the will of GodHowever prepare me fortynine guards and let each have a black flag Dress them in black and place them outside my tent Then will I from within my tent invoke the Seven Stars of the NorthIf my masterlamp remain alight for seven days then is my life to be prolonged for twelve yearsIf the lamp goes out then I am to dieKeep all idlers away from the tent and let a couple of guards bring me what is necessary Jiang Wei prepared as directedIt was then the eighth month midautumn and the Milky Way was brilliant with scattered jade The air was perfectly calm and no sound was heardThe fortynine men were brought up and spaced out to guard the tent while within Zhuge Liang prepared incense and offeringsOn the floor of the tent he arranged seven lamps and outside these fortynine smaller lamps In the midst he placed the lamp of his own fate This done he prayed Zhuge Liang born into an age of trouble would willingly have grown old in retirementBut His Majesty Liu Bei the Glorious Emperor sought him thrice and confided to him the heavy responsibility of guarding his son He dared not do less than spend himself to the utmost in such a task and he pledged himself to destroy the rebelsSuddenly the star of his leadership has declined and his life now nears its closeHe has humbly indited a declaration on this silk piece to the Great Unknowable and now hopes that He will graciously listen and extend the number of his days that he may prove his gratitude to his prince and be the savior of the people restore the old state of the empire and establish eternally the Han sacrificesHe dares not make a vain prayer this is from his heart This prayer ended in the solitude of his tent he awaited the dawnNext day ill as he was he did not neglect his duties although he spat blood continuallyAll day he labored at his plans and at night he paced the magic steps the steps of seven stars of Ursa Major and Ursa MinorSima Yi remained still on the defensive One night as he sat gazing up at the sky and studying its aspect he suddenly turned to Xiahou Ba saying A leadership star has just lost position surely Zhuge Liang is ill and will soon die Take a reconnoitering party to the Wuzhang Hills and find outIf you see signs of confusion do not attack it means that Zhuge Liang is illI shall take the occasion to smite hard Xiahou Ba left with an armyIt was the sixth night of Zhuge Liangs prayers and the lamp of his fate still burned brightly He began to feel a secret joy Presently Jiang Wei entered and watched the ceremoniesHe saw Zhuge Liang was loosening his hair his hand holding a sword his heels stepping on Ursa Major and Ursa Minor to hold the leadership starSuddenly a great shouting was heard outside and immediately Wei Yan dashed in crying The Wei soldiers are upon us In his haste Wei Yan had knocked over and extinguished the Lamp of FateZhuge Liang threw down the sword and sighed saying Life and death are foreordained no prayers can alter them Wei Yan fell to the earth and craved forgivenessJiang Wei got angry and drew his sword to slay the unhappy soldierNought is under mans control Nor can he with fate contendThe next chapter will unfold what happenedCHAPTER  A Falling Star The Prime Minister Ascends To Heaven A Wooden Statue The CommanderinChief Is TerrifiedThe unhappy Wei Yan did not suffer the edge of the sword for Zhuge Liang stayed the stroke saying It is my fate not his fault So Jiang Wei put up his sword and Zhuge Liang sank wearily upon his couchSima Yi thinks I am dead and he sent these few troops to make sure Go ye and drive them off said heWei Yan left the tent and led out a small party to drive away the troops of Wei who fled as they appearedHe chased them to more than seven miles and returnedThen Zhuge Liang sent Wei Yan to his own camp and bade him keep a vigilant lookoutPresently Jiang Wei came in went up to the sick mans couch and asked how he feltZhuge Liang replied My death is very near My chief desire has been to spend myself to the utmost to restore the Hans and lead a glorious return of the Hans to their capital but Heaven decrees it otherwise I have never ceased from my studiesI have written a book in twentyfour chapters  words treating the Eight Needfuls the Seven Cautions the Six Fears and the Five Dreads of warBut among all those about me there is no one fit to receive it and carry on my work save youI pray you not to despise it He gave the treatise to Jiang Wei who received it sobbingI have also a plan for a multiple crossbow which I have been unable to executeThe weapon shoots ten bolts of eight inches length at every dischargeThe sketches are quite ready and the weapons can be made according to them Jiang Wei took the papers with a deep bowThe dying man continued There is no part of Shu that causes anxiety save the Yinping MountainsThat must be carefully guarded It is protected naturally by its lofty precipices but it will surely be the cause of great losses Next Zhuge Liang sent for Ma Dai to whom he gave certain whispered instructions and then said You are to follow out my instructions after my death Soon after Yang Yi entered the tent and went to the couchHe received a silken bag containing certain secret ordersAs Zhuge Liang gave it to him he said After my death Wei Yan will turn traitorWhen that happens and the army is in danger you will find herein what to do Just as these arrangements were finished Zhuge Liang fell into a swoon from which he did not revive till the eveningThen he set himself to compose a memorial to the Latter RulerWhen this reached the Latter Ruler he was greatly alarmed and at once sent High Counselor Li Fu to visit and confer with the dying ministerLi Fu traveled quickly to the Wuzhang Hills and was led to the tent of the CommanderinChief He delivered the Latter Rulers command and inquired after the sick mans welfareZhuge Liang wept and he replied Unhappily I am dying and leaving my task incomplete I am injuring my countrys policy and am in fault to the worldAfter my death you must aid the Emperor in perfect loyalty and see that the old policy is continued and the rules of government maintainedDo not lightly cast out the people I have employedMy plans of campaign have been confided to Jiang Wei who can continue my policy for the service of the stateBut my hour draws near and I must write my testament Li Fu listened and then took his leaveZhuge Liang made one final effort to carry out his duties He rose from his couch was helped into a small carriage and thus made a round of inspection of all the camps and postsBut the cold autumn wind chilled him to the bone I shall never again lead the army against the rebels said heO Azure Heaven when will this regret end Zhuge Liang returned to his tent He became rapidly weaker and called Yang Yi to his bedside Said he Ma Dai Wang Ping Liao Hua Zhang Yi Zhang Ni may be depended on to the death They have fought many campaigns and borne many hardships they should be retained in the public serviceAfter my death let everything go on as before but the army is to be gradually withdrawnYou know the tactics to be followed and I need say littleMy friend Jiang Wei is wise and brave set him to guard the retreat Yang Yi received these orders weepingNext writing materials were brought in and the dying minister set himself to write his testamentIt is here given in substance Life and death are the common lot and fate cannot be evaded Death is at hand and I desire to prove my loyalty to the endI thy servant Zhuge Liang dull of parts was born into a difficult age and it fell to my lot to guide military operations I led a northern expedition but failed to win complete successNow sickness has laid hold upon me and death approaches so that I shall be unable to accomplish my task My sorrow is inexpressibleI desire Your Majesty to cleanse your heart and limit your desires to practice selfcontrol and to love the people to maintain a perfectly filial attitude toward your late father and to be benevolent to all the worldSeek out the recluse scholars that you may obtain the services of the wise and good repel the wicked and depraved that your moral standard may be exaltedTo my household belong eight hundred mulberry trees and a hundred acres of land thus there is ample provision for my familyWhile I have been employed in the service of the state my needs have been supplied from official sources but I have not contrived to make any additions to the family estateAt my death I shall not leave any increased possessions even an excess roll of silk that may cause Your Majesty to suspect that I have wronged you Having composed this document the dying man turned again to Yang Yi saying Do not wear mourning for me but make a large coffer and therein place my body with seven grains of rice in my mouthPlace a lamp at my feet and let my body move with the army as I was wont to doIf you refrain from mourning then my leadership star will not fall for my inmost soul will ascend and hold it in placeSo long as my star retains its place Sima Yi will be fearsome and suspiciousLet the army retreat beginning with the rearmost division send it away slowly one camp at a timeIf Sima Yi pursues array the army and offer battle turn to meet him and beat the attackLet him approach till he is very near and then suddenly display the wooden image of myself that I have had carved seated in my chariot in the midst of the army with the generals right and left as usualAnd you will frighten Sima Yi away Yang Yi listened to these words intently and without remarkThat night Zhuge Liang was carried into the open and gazed up at the sky That is my star said he pointing to one that seemed to be losing its brilliancy and to be tottering in its placeZhuge Liangs lips moved as if he muttered a spellPresently he was borne into his tent and for a time was oblivious of all about himWhen the anxiety caused by this state of coma was at its height Li Fu arrivedHe wept when he saw the condition of the great leader crying I have foiled the great designs of the state However presently Zhuge Liangs eyes reopened and fell upon Li Fu standing near his couchI know your mission said Zhuge LiangI came with the royal command to ask also who should control the destinies of the state for the next century replied Li FuIn my agitation I forgot to ask that After me Jiang Wan is the most fitting man to deal with great matters And after Jiang Wan After him Fei Yi Who is next after Fei Yi No reply came and when they looked more carefully they perceived that the soul of the Prime Minister had passedThus died Zhuge Liang on the twentythird day of the eighth month in the twelfth year of Beginning Prosperity at the age of fifty and four  The poet Du Fu wrote some verses on his deathA bright star last night falling from the sky This message gave The Master is no more No more in camps shall bold men tramp at his command At court no statesman ever will fill the place he held At home his clients miss their patron kindCalm was his bosom full of strategyBut lately fared we to the woods green shade To hail him victor hushed that song for himAnd Bo Juyi also wrote a poem Within the forest dim the Master lived obscure Till thrice returning there the prince his mentor metAs when a fish the ocean gains desire was filled Wholly the dragon freed could soar aloft at will As kings sons guardian none more zealous was As minister most loyally he wrought at courtHis war memorials still to us are left And reading them the tears unconscious fallNow in past days Commander Liao Li in Changshui had a high opinion of his own abilities and thought himself perfectly fitted to be Zhuge Liangs second So he neglected the duties of his proper post showed discontent and indiscipline and was constantly slandering the ministerThereupon Zhuge Liang degraded him and transferred him to MinshanWhen Liao Li heard of Zhuge Liangs death he shed tears and said Then after all I am but a barbarian Li Yan also grieved deeply at the sad tidings for he had always hoped that Zhuge Liang would restore him to office and so give him the opportunity of repairing his former faultsAfter Zhuge Liang had died he thought there was no hope of reemployment and so he died Another poet Yuan Weizhi also wrote in praise of the great adviserHe fought disorder helped a weak king Most zealously he kept his masters sonIn statecraft he excelled Guan Zhong Yue Yi In warcraft he overpassed Wu Qi Sun ZiWith awe the court his war memorials heard With majesty his Eight Arrays were plannedVirtue and wisdom both filled in his heart For thousand autumns his fame would still stayHeaven grieved and earth mourned on the night of Zhuge Liangs death Even the moon was dimmed as Zhuge Liangs soul returned to HeavenAs the late commander had directed Jiang Wei and Yang Yi forbade the mourning of his death His body was placed in the coffer as he had wished and three hundred of his near comrades were appointed to watch itSecret orders were given to Wei Yan to command the rearguard and then one by one the camps were broken up and the army began its homeward marchSima Yi watched the skies One night a large red star with bright rays passed from the northeast to the southwest and dropped over the camps of Shu It dipped thrice and rose again Sima Yi heard also a low rumbling in the distanceHe was pleased and excited and said to those about him Zhuge Liang is dead At once he ordered pursuit with a strong force But just as he passed his camp gates doubts filled his mind and he gave up the plan Zhuge Liang is a master of mysteries he can get aids from the Deities of the Six Layers and it may be that this is but a ruse to get us to take the field We may fall victims to his guile So he haltedBut he sent Xiahou Ba with a few scouts to reconnoiter the enemys campsOne night as Wei Yan lay asleep in his tent he dreamed a dream In his vision two horns grew out of his head When he awoke he was much perplexed to explain his dreamMarching General Zhao Zhi came to see him and Wei Yan said You are versed in the Book of Changes I have dreamed that two horns grew upon my head and would trouble you to expound the dream and tell me its portent Zhao Zhi thought a moment and replied It is an auspicious dreamDragon and Linlion both have horns on the headIt augurs transformation into an ascending creature Wei Yan much pleased thanked the interpreter of his dream and promised him gifts when the dream proved trueZhao Zhi left and presently met Fei Yi who asked whence he cameFrom the camp of our friend Wei Yan He dreamed that he grew horns upon his head and I have given him an auspicious interpretation But really it is inauspiciousHowever I did not wish to annoy him How do you know it is inauspicious The word for horn is composed of two parts knife above and use below and so means that there is a knife upon his headIt is a terrible omen Keep it secret said Fei YiThen Fei Yi went to the camp of Wei Yan and when they were alone he said The Prime Minister died last night in the third watchHe left certain final orders and among them that you are to command the rearguard to keep Sima Yi at bay while the army retreats No mourning is to be wornHere is your authority so you can march forthwith Who is acting in place of the late minister asked WeiThe chief command has been delegated to Yang Yi but the secret plans of campaign have been entrusted to Jiang WeiThis authority was issued from Yang Yi Wei Yan replied Though the Prime Minister is dead I am yet aliveThe Military Counselor Yang Yi is only a civil officer and unequal to this postHe ought to conduct the coffin home while I lead the army against Sima YiI shall achieve success and it is wrong to abandon a whole plan of campaign because of the death of one man even if that be the Prime Minister The Prime Ministers orders were to retire and these orders are to be obeyed If the Prime Minister had listened to me we should now have been at ChanganI am the General Who Conquers the West and Lord of Nanzheng I am not going to act as rearguard for any civil official said Wei Yan angryIt may be as you say General but you must not do anything to make us ridiculousLet me go back to Yang Yi and explain and I may be able to persuade him to pass on to you the supreme military authority he holds Wei Yan agreed and Fei Yi went back to the main camp and told Yang Yi what had passedYang Yi replied When near death the Prime Minister confided to me that Wei Yan would turn traitorI sent him the authority to test him and now he has discovered himself as the Prime Minister foretoldSo I will direct Jiang Wei to command the rearguard The coffer containing the remains of Zhuge Liang was sent on in advance and Jiang Wei took up his post to cover the retreat Meanwhile Wei Yan sat in his tent waiting for the return of Fei Yi and was perplexed at the delayWhen the suspense became unbearable he sent Ma Dai to find out the reason Ma Dai returned and told himJiang Wei is covering the retreat and that most of the army has already gone Wei Yan was furiousHow dare he play with me the pedantic blockhead cried heBut he shall die for this Turning to Ma Dai Wei Yan said Will you help me Ma Dai replied I have long hated Yang Yi certainly I am ready to attack him So Wei Yan broke camp and marched southward By the time Xiahou Ba had reached the Shu camps they were all empty and he hastened back with this newsThen Zhuge Liang is really dead let us pursue said Sima Yi much irritated at being misledBe cautious said Xiahou BaSend an subordinate leader first No I must go myself this time So Sima Yi and his two sons hastened to the Wuzhang HillsWith shouts and waving flags they rushed into the camps only to find them quite desertedSima Yi said to his sons You are to bring up the remaining force with all speed whereas I will lead the vanguard Sima Yi hastened in the wake of the retreating armyComing to some hills he saw them in the distance and pressed on still harderThen suddenly a bomb exploded a great shout broke the stillness and the retiring army turned about and came toward him ready for battle In their midst fluttered a great banner bearing the words Prime Minister of Han Lord of Wuxiang Zhuge LiangSima Yi stopped pale with fearThen out from the army came some score of generals of rank and they were escorting a small carriage in which sat Zhuge Liang as he had always appeared in his hand the feather fanThen Zhuge Liang is still alive gasped Sima YiAnd I have rashly placed myself in his power As he pulled round his horse to flee Jiang Wei shouted Do not try to run away O rebel you have fallen into one of the Prime Ministers traps and would better stay The soldiers seized with panic fled throwing off all their gear They trampled each other down and many perishedTheir leader galloped fifteen miles without pulling rein When at last two of his generals came up with him and had stopped his flying steed by catching at the bridle Sima Yi clapped his hand to his head crying Have I still a head Do not fear General the soldiers of Shu are now far away they repliedBut he still panted with fear and only after some time did he recognize that his two companions were Xiahou Ba and Xiahou HuiThe three found their way by byroads to their own camp whence scouts were sent out in all directionsIn a few days the natives brought news The Shu army had really gone and as soon as the retiring army entered the valley they raised a wailing for the dead and hoisted white flags Zhuge Liang was really dead and Jiang Weis rearguard consisted of only one thousand troopsThe figure in the carriage was only a wooden image of the Prime Minister While he lived I could guess what he would do dead I was helpless said Sima YiThe people had a saying that a dead Zhuge Liang was enough to scare off a live Sima YiIn the depth of night a brilliant star Fell from the northern sky Doubts stayed Sima Yi When he would pursue His dead but fearsome enemyAnd even now the western people With scornful smile will say Oh is my head on my shoulder still It was nearly lost today Now indeed Sima Yi knew that his rival was no more so he retook the pursuitBut when he reached the Red Hills the Shu army had marched too far away As he took the homeward road he said to his officers We can now sleep in comfort As they marched back they saw the camps of their enemies and were amazed at their skillful arrangementTruly a wonderful genius sighed Sima YiThe armies of Wei returned to Changan leaving officers to guard the various strategic points Sima Yi himself went on to Luoyang to see the audienceYang Yi and Jiang Wei retired slowly and in good order till they neared the Plank Trail when they donned mourning garb and began to wail for their deadThe soldiers threw themselves on the ground and wailed in sorrow Some even wailed themselves to deathBut as the leading companies entered upon the Plank Trail they saw a great blaze in front and with a great shout a cohort came out barring the wayThe leaders of the retreating army were taken aback and sent to inform Yang YiThe regiments of Wei are nowhere near Then who are these soldiers that now appear The next chapter will tell who they wereCHAPTER  The Lord of Wuxiang Leaves A Plan In The Silken Bag The Ruler of Wei Removes The Bronze Statue With The Dew BowlYang Yi sent forward a man to find out what force this was that stood in his way and the scout returned to say they were soldiers of Shu led by Wei YanWei Yan had burned the Plank Trail and now barred the wayThen said Yang Yi Just before his death the Prime Minister foretold that this man would one day turn traitor and here it has come to passI did not expect to meet it thus but now our road of retreat is cut and what is to be done Then replied Fei Yi He certainly has slandered us to the Emperor and said that we were rebelling and therefore he has destroyed the wooden roads in order to prevent our progress first therefore we must memorialize to the Throne the truth about him and then plan his destruction Jiang Wei said I know a byway hereabout that will lead us round to the rear of these covered roads True it is precipitous and dangerous but it will take us to our destinationIt is called the Chashan Mountain Path So they prepared a memorial and turned off in order to follow the narrow mountain roadMeanwhile in Chengdu the Latter Ruler of Shu was troubled he lost his appetite and was sleeplessThen he dreamed that the Silky Hills that protected his capital was rived and fellThis dream troubled him till morning when he called in his officers of all ranks to ask them to interpret his visionWhen he had related his dream Qiao Zhou stood forth and said Last night I saw a large red star fall from the northeast to the southwest surely it forebodes a misfortune to the First MinisterYour Majestys dream corresponds to what I saw The Latter Rulers anxiety increasedPresently Li Fu returned and was summoned into the Latter Rulers presenceLi Fu bowed his head and wept saying The Prime Minister is dead He repeated Zhuge Liangs last messages and told all that he knewThe Latter Ruler was overcome with great sorrow and wailed crying Heaven smites me and he fell over and lay upon his couchThey led him within to the inner chambers and when Empress Wu the Empress Dowager heard the sad tidings she also wailed without ceasingAnd all the officers were distressed and wept and the common people showed their griefThe Latter Ruler was deeply affected and for many days could hold no courtAnd while thus prostrate with grief they told him that Wei Yan had sent up a memorial charging Yang Yi with rebellion The astounded courtiers went to the Latter Rulers chamber to talk over this thing and Empress Wu was also there The memorial was read aloud It was much like thisI thy Minister and General Wei Yan General Who Conquers the West and Lord of Nanzheng humbly and with bowed head write that Yang Yi has assumed command of the army and is in rebellion He has made off with the coffin of the late Prime Minister and wishes to lead enemies within our bordersAs a precaution and to hinder his progress I have burned the Plank Trail and now report these matters The Latter Ruler said Wei Yan is a valiant warrior and could easily have overcome Yang Yi why then did he destroy the Plank Trail Empress Wu said The First Ruler used to say that Zhuge Liang knew that treachery lurked in the heart of Wei Yan and he wished to put Wei Yan to death he only spared Wei Yan because of his valorWe should not believe too readily this tale of his that Yang Yi has rebelledYang Yi is a scholar and a civil officer and the late Prime Minister placed him in a position of great responsibility thereby proving that he trusted and valued Yang YiIf we believe this statement surely Yang Yi will be forced to go over to WeiNothing should be done without due meditation As they were discussing this matter an urgent memorial came from Yang Yi and opening it they read I Yang Yi leader of the retreating army humbly and with trepidation present this memorialIn his last moments the late Prime Minister made over to me the charge of the great enterprise and bade me carry out his plan without change I have respected his charge I ordered Wei Yan to command the rearguard with Jiang Wei as his secondBut Wei Yan refused obedience and led away his own army into Hanzhong Then he burned the Plank Trail tried to steal away the body of the late CommanderinChief and behaved altogether unseemly His rebellion came upon me suddenly and unexpectedlyI send this memorial in haste The Empress Dowager listened to the endThen turning to the officers she said What is your opinion now Jiang Wan replied Yang Yi is hasty and intolerant but he has rendered great services in supplying the army He has long been a trusted colleague of the late Prime Minister who being near his end entrusted to him the conduct of affairs Certainly he is no rebelOn the other hand Wei Yan is bold and ambitious and thinks himself everybodys superiorYang Yi is the only one who has openly been of different opinion and hence Wei Yan hates him When he saw Yang Yi placed over his head in command of the army Wei Yan refused his supportThen Wei Yan burned the Plank Trail in order to cut off Yang Yis retreat and maligned him hoping to bring about his fallI am ready to guarantee Yang Yis fealty to the extent of my whole house but I would not answer for Wei Yan Dong Yun followed Wei Yan has always been conceited and discontentedHis mouth was full of hate and resentment and only fear of the late Prime Minister held him in checkThe Prime Ministers death gave him his opportunity and he turned traitor This is certainly the true state of the caseYang Yi is able and his employment by the late Prime Minister is proof of his loyalty If this is true and Wei Yan is really a rebel what should be done asked the Latter RulerI think the late Prime Minister has framed some scheme by which to get rid of Wei YanIf Yang Yi had not felt secure he would scarcely have set out to return through the valleysYour Majesty may feel sure that Wei Yan will fall into some trapWe have received almost at the same time two memorials from two men each bringing against the other a charge of rebellionLet us wait Just then Fei Yi arrivedHe was summoned into the royal presence and told the story of Wei Yans revoltThe Latter Ruler replied In that case I should do well to send Dong Yun with the flag of authority to mediate the situation and attempt to persuade Wei Yan with kind words So Dong Yun left on this mission At this time Wei Yan was camped at Nangu Valley which was a commanding positionHe thought his plan was succeeding wellIt had not occurred to him that Yang Yi and Jiang Wei could get past him by any bywayOn the other hand Yang Yi thinking that Hanzhong was lost sent He Ping with three thousand troops on in front while he followed with the coffinWhen He Ping had got to the rear of Nangu Valley they announced their presence with rolling drumsThe scouts quickly told Wei Yan who at once armed himself took his sword and rode out to confront He PingWhen both sides were arrayed He Ping rode to the front and began to revile his opponent Where is that rebel Wei Yan cried He PingYou aided that traitor Yang Yi cried Wei Yan no way backward with his tongue how dare you abuse me He Ping waxed more indignantYou rebelled immediately after the late chiefs death before even his body was cold How could you Then shaking his whip at the followers of Wei Yan He Ping cried And you soldiers are Shu people Your fathers and mothers wives and children and your friends are still in the landWere you treated unkindly that you have joined a traitor and aid his wicked schemesYou ought to have returned home and waited quietly the rewards that would have been yours The soldiers were touched by his words they cheered and more than a half ran away Wei Yan was now ragingHe whirled up his sword and galloped forward straight for He Ping who went to meet him with his spear readyThey fought several bouts and then He Ping rode away as if defeatedWei Yan followed but He Pings troops began to shoot and Wei Yan was driven backwardAs he got near his own ranks Wei Yan saw many generals leaving their companies and going away He rode after them and cut some of them down But this did not stay the movement they continued to go The only steady portion of his own army was that commanded by Ma Dai They stood their ground Will you really help me said Wei Yan I will surely remember you in the day of success The two then went in pursuit of He Ping who fled before them However it was soon evident that He Ping was not to be overtaken and the pursuers halted Wei Yan mustered his now small forceWhat if we go over to Wei said Wei YanI think your words unwise said Ma DaiWhy should we join anyone A really strong person would try to carve out his own fortune and not be ready to crook the knee to anotherYou are able enough and brave enough to be more than a match for any leader in the Lands of Rivers No one would dare to stand up to youI pledge myself to go with you to the seizure of Hanzhong and thence we will attack the Western Land of Rivers So they marched together toward Nanzheng where was Jiang WeiFrom the bridge Jiang Wei saw their approach and marked their proud martial lookHe ordered the drawbridge to be raised and sent to tell his colleague Yang YiAs they drew near both Wei Yan and Ma Dai shouted out Surrender In spite of the smallness of their following Jiang Wei felt that Ma Dai acting with Wei Yan was a dangerous combination and he wanted the advice of Yang Yi Wei Yan is valorous and he is having the help of Ma Dai How shall we repel them asked Jiang WeiYang Yi replied Just before his death the Prime Minister gave me a silken bag which he said I was to open when Wei Yans mutiny reached a critical pointIt contains a plan to rid ourselves of this traitor and it seems that now is the moment to see what should be done So Yang Yi opened the bag and drew forth the letter it heldOn the cover he read To be opened when Wei Yan is actually arrayed opposite you Said Jiang Wei As this has all been arranged for I would better go out and when his line is formed then you can come forth Jiang Wei donned his armor took his spear and rode out with three thousand troops They marched out of the city gates with the drums beating The array completed Jiang Wei took his place under the great standard and opened with a volley of abuseRebel Wei Yan the late Prime Minister never harmed you why have you turned traitor Wei Yan reined up lowered his sword and replied Friend Jiang Wei this is no concern of yours tell Yang Yi to come Now Yang Yi was also beneath the standard but hiddenHe opened the letter and the words therein seemed to please him for he rode forward blithelyPresently he reined in pointed to Wei Yan and said The Prime Minister foresaw your mutiny and bade me be on my guardNow if you are able thrice to shout Who dares kill me then you will be a real hero and I will yield to you the whole of Hanzhong Wei Yan laughed Listen you old foolWhile Zhuge Liang lived I feared him somewhatBut he is dead and no one dares stand before meI will not only shout the words thrice but a myriad timesWhy not Wei Yan raised his sword shook his bridle and shouted Who dares kill me He never finishedBehind him someone shouted savagely I dare kill you and at the same moment Wei Yan fell dead cut down by Ma DaiThis was the denouement and was the secret entrusted to Ma Dai just before Zhuge Liangs death Wei Yan was to be made to shout these words and slain when he least expected itYang Yi knew what was to happen as it was written in the letter in the silken bag A poem says Zhuge Liang foresaw when freed from his restraint Wei Yan would traitor proveThe silken bag Contained the plan for his undoing We see How it succeeded when the moment cameSo before Dong Yun had reached Nanzheng Wei Yan was deadMa Dai joined his army to Jiang Weis and Yang Yi wrote another memorial which he sent to the Latter Ruler The Latter Ruler issued an edictWei Yan had paid the penalty of his crime he should be honorably buried in consideration of his former services Then Yang Yi continued his journey and in due time arrived at Chengdu with the coffin of the late Prime MinisterThe Latter Ruler led out a large cavalcade of officers to meet the body at a point seven miles from the walls and he lifted up his voice and wailed for the dead and with him wailed all the officers and the common people so that the sound of mourning filled the whole earthBy royal command the body was borne into the city to the Palace of the Prime Minister and his son Zhuge Zhan was chief mournerWhen next the Latter Ruler held a court Yang Yi bound himself and confessed he had been in faultThe Latter Ruler bade them loose his bonds and said Noble Sir the coffin would never have reached home but for youYou carried out the orders of the late Prime Minister whereby Wei Yan was destroyed and all was made secureThis was all your doing Yang Yi was promoted to be the Instructor of the Center Army and Ma Dai was rewarded with the rank that Wei Yan had forfeitedYang Yi presented Zhuge Liangs testament which the Latter Ruler read weepingBy a special edict it was commanded that soothsayers should cast lots and select the site for the tomb of the great servant of the stateThen Fei Yi said to the Latter Ruler When nearing his end the Prime Minister commanded that he should be buried on Dingjun Mountain in open ground without sacrifice or monument This wish was respected and they chose a propitious day in the tenth month for the interment and the Latter Ruler followed in the funeral procession to the grave on the Dingjun MountainThe posthumous title conferred upon the late Prime Minister was Zhuge Liang the Loyally Martial and a temple was built in Mianyang wherein were offered sacrifices at the four seasons The poet Du Fu wrote a poemTo Zhuge Liang stands a great memorial hall In cypress shade without the Chengdu Wall The steps thereto are bright with new grass springing Hiding among the branches orioles are singing Devotion patient met reward upon The throne built for the father sat the sonBut ere was compassed all his plans conceived He died and heroes since for him have ever grieved Another poem by the same author saysZhuge Liangs fair fame stands clear to all the world Among kings ministers he surely takes Exalted rank for when the empire cleft In three a kingdom for his lord he won By subtle craftThroughout all time he stands A shining figure clear against the skyAkin was he to famous Yi Yin Lu Wang Yet stands with chiefs like Xiao He Cao Shen The fates forbade that Han should be restored Warworn and weary yet he steadfast stood Evil tidings came to the Latter Ruler on his return to his capital He heard that Quan Zong had marched out with a large army from Wu and camped at the entrance to Baqiu No one knew the object of this expeditionHere is Wu breaking their oath just as the Prime Minister has died cried the Latter RulerWhat can we do Then said Jiang Wan My advice is to send Wang Ping and Zhang Ni to camp at Baidicheng as a measure of precaution while you send an envoy to Wu to announce the death and period of mourningHe can there observe the signs of the times The envoy must have a ready tongue said the Latter Ruler One stepped from the ranks of courtiers and offered himselfHe was Zong Yu a man of Nanyang a Military AdviserSo he was appointed as envoy with the commissions of announcing the death of the Prime Minister and observing the conditionsZong Yu set out for Jianye arrived and was taken in to the Emperors presenceWhen the ceremony of introduction was over and the envoy looked about him he saw that all were dressed in mourningBut Sun Quans countenance wore a look of anger and he said Wu and Shu are one house why has your master increased the guard at Baidicheng Zong Yu replied It seemed as necessary for the west to increase the garrison there as for the east to have a force at BaqiuNeither is worth asking about As an envoy you seem no way inferior to Deng Zhi said Sun Quan smilingSun Quan continued When I heard that your Prime Minister Zhuge Liang had gone to heaven I wept daily and ordered my officers to wear mourningI feared that Wei might take the occasion to attack Shu and so I increased the garrison at Baqiu by ten thousand troops that I might be able to help you in case of need That was my sole reason Zong Yu bowed and thanked the Ruler of WuI would not go back upon the pledge between us said Sun QuanZong Yu said I have been sent to inform you of the mourning for the late Prime Minister Sun Quan took up a goldtipped arrow and snapped it in twain saying If I betray my oath may my posterity be cut off Then the Ruler of Wu dispatched an envoy with incense and silk and other gifts to be offered in sacrifice to the dead in the land of ShuZong Yu and the envoy took leave of the Ruler of Wu and journeyed to Chengdu where they went to the Latter Ruler and Zong Yu made a memorial saying The Ruler of Wu has wept for our Prime Minister and put his court into mourningThe increased garrison at Baqiu is intended to safeguard us from Wei lest they take the occasion of a public sorrow to attackAnd in token of his pledge the Ruler of Wu broke an arrow in twain The Latter Ruler was pleased and rewarded Zong Yu moreover the envoy of Wu was generously treatedAccording to the advice in Zhuge Liangs testament the Latter Ruler made Jiang Wan Prime Minister and Chair of the Secretariat while Fei Yi became Deputy Prime Minister and Chair of a BoardWu Yi was made Commander of the Flying Cavalry and Commandant of Hanzhong Jiang Wei General Who Upholds the Han Lord of Pingxiang and Commandant of HanzhongNow as Yang Yi was senior in service to Jiang Wan who had thus been promoted over his head and as he considered his services had been inadequately rewarded he was discontented and spoke resentfullyHe said to Fei Yi If when the Prime Minister died I had gone over to Wei with the whole army I should not have been thus left out in the cold Fei Yi secretly reported this speech to the Latter Ruler who was angered and threw Yang Yi into prisonThe Latter Ruler intended putting him to death but Jiang Wan interceded saying Yang Yi had followed the late Prime Minister in many campaigns and had had many good servicesYour Majesty should not put him to death but take away his rank And Yang Yi was reprievedHowever he was degraded and sent into Hanjia in Hanzhong where he committed suicide through shameIn the thirteenth year of Beginning Prosperity of Shu the same year being the third year of Green Dragon of Wei and the fourth year of Domestic Peace of Wu  there were no military expeditions In Wei Sima Yi was created Regent Marshal with command over all the forces of Wei and he departed for LuoyangThe Ruler of Wei at Xuchang made preparations to build himself a palace complexAt Luoyang he also built the Hall of Sunrise the Hall of the Firmament and the Hall of Complete Patterns all lofty and of beautiful designsHe also raised a Hall of Beautiful Passions a Green Flageolet Tower and a Phoenix Tower He also dug a Nine Dragons Pool Over all these works he placed Doctorate Scholar Ma Jun as superintendent of their building Nothing was spared that would contribute to the beauty of these buildings The beams were carved the rafters were painted the walls were of golden bricks and the roofs of green tiles They glittered and glowed in the sunlightThe most cunning craftspeople in the world were sought many thousands of them and myriads of ordinary workers labored day and night on these works for the Emperors glory and pleasureBut the strength of the people was spent in this toil and they cried aloud and complained unceasinglyMoreover the Ruler of Wei issued an edict to carry earth and bring trees for the Fragrant Forest Park and he employed officers of state in these labors carrying earth and transporting treesThe Minister of Works Dong Xun ventured upon a remonstrance sending a memorialFrom the beginning of Rebuilt Tranquillity Era a generation ago wars have been continuous and destruction rifeThose who have escaped death are few and these are old and weakNow indeed it may be that the palaces are too small and enlargement is desired but would it not be more fitting to choose the building season so as not to interfere with cultivationYour Majesty has always valued many honorable officers letting them wear beautiful headdresses clad in handsome robes and riding in decorated chariots to distinguish them from the common peopleNow these officers are being made to carry timber and bear earth to sweat and soil their feet To destroy the glory of the state in order to raise a useless edifice is indescribable follyConfucius the Teacher said that princes should treat ministers with polite consideration and ministers should serve princes with loyaltyWithout loyalty without propriety can a state endureI recognize that these words of mine mean death but I am of no value a mere bullocks hair and my life is of no importance as my death would be no lossI write with tears bidding the world farewellThy servant has eight sons who will be a burden to Your Majesty after his deathI cannot say with what trepidation I await my fate Has the man no fear of death said Cao Rui greatly angeredThe courtiers requested the Emperor to put Dong Xun to death but Cao Rui remembered his rectitude and proven loyalty and only degraded him adding a warning to put to death those who would remonstrate A certain Zhang Mao in the service of the Heir Apparent also ventured upon a remonstrance Cao Rui put him to death immediatelyThen Cao Rui summoned his Master of Works Ma Jun and said I have built high terraces and lofty towers with intent to hold intercourse with gods and goddesses that I may obtain from them the elixir of life Then Ma Jun replied Of the four and twenty emperors of the line of Latter Han only Emperor Wu enjoyed the throne very long and really attained to old age That was because he drank of the essence of the brilliancy of the sun and the brightness of the moonIn the Palace at Changan is the Terrace of Cypress Beams upon which stands the bronze figure of a man holding up a Dew Bowl whereinto distills in the third watch of the night the vapor from the great constellation of the northThis liquid is called Celestial Elixir or Sweet DewIf mingled with powdered jade and swallowed it restores youth to the aged Take workers to Changan immediately and bring hither the bronze figure to set up in the Fragrant Forest Park said the Ruler of Wei As the Ruler of Wei commanded they took ten thousand workers to Changan and they built a scaffold around the figure Then they attached ropes to haul it downThe terrace being two hundred feet high and the pedestal ten cubits in circumference Ma Jun bade his laborers first detach the bronze image They did so and brought it downIts eyes were moist as with tears and the workers were affrightedThen suddenly beside the terrace sprang up a whirlwind with dust and pebbles flying thick as a shower of rain and there was a tempestuous roar as of an earthquakeDown fell the pedestal and the platform crumbled crushing a thousand people to deathHowever the bronze figure and the golden bowl were conveyed to Luoyang and presented to the EmperorWhere is the pedestal asked the Ruler of WeiIt is too heavy to transport replied the Ma JunIt weighs a million and half of pounds Wherefore the Ruler of Wei ordered the pillar to be broken up and the metal brought and from this he caused to be cast two figures which he named Saints of Wengzhong They were placed outside the gate of the Board of WarA pair of dragons and a pair of phoenixes were also cast the dragons forty feet high and the birds thirty These were placed in front of the Hall of AudienceMoreover in the Fragrant Forest Park the Ruler of Wei planted wonderful flowers and rare trees and he also established a menagerie of strange animalsYang Fu remonstrated with the Emperor on these extravagancesAs is well known King Yao preferred his humble thatched cottage and all the world enjoyed tranquillity King Yu contented himself with a small modest palace and all the empire rejoicedIn the days of Yin and Zhou Dynasties the hall of the ruler stood three feet above the usual height and its area was nine matsThe sage emperors and illustrious kings had no decorated chambers in lofty palaces built with the wealth and by the strength of a wornout and despoiled peopleEmperor Jie built a jade chamber and elephant stables Emperor Zhou erected a surpassingly beautiful palace and a Deer Terrace But these lost the empireKing Ling of Chu built beautiful palaces but he came to an evil endThe First Emperor of Qin made the Afang Palace but calamity fell upon his son for the empire rebelled and his house was exterminated in the second generationAll those who have failed to consider the means of the people and given way to sensuous pleasures have perishedYour Majesty has the examples of Kings Yao Yu Shun and Tang on the one hand and the warnings of Kings Jie Zhou Ling and the First Emperor on the otherTo seek only selfindulgence and think only of fine palaces will surely end in calamityThe prince is the first and the head his ministers are his limbs they live or die together they are involved in the same destructionThough I am timorous yet if I dared forget my duty or failed to speak firmly I should be unable to move Your MajestyNow I have prepared my coffin and bathed my body ready for the most condign punishment But the Ruler of Wei disregarded this memorial and only urged on the rapid completion of the terraceThereon he set up the bronze figure with the golden bowlMoreover he sent forth a command to select the most beautiful women in the empire for his garden of delightMany memorials were presented but the Ruler of Wei heeded them notNow the Consort of the Ruler of Wei was of the Mao family of HeneiIn earlier days when he was a prince he had loved her exceedingly and when he succeeded to the throne she became Empress MaoLater he favored Lady Guo and his Consort Mao was neglectedLady Guo was beautiful and clever and the Ruler of Wei delighted in her He neglected state affairs for her society and often spent a month at a time in retirement with her Every day there was some new gaietyIn the spring when the plants in the Fragrant Forest Park were in flower the Ruler of Wei and Lady Guo came to the garden to enjoy them and to feastWhy not invite the Empress asked Lady GuoIf she came nothing would pass my lips replied the Ruler of WeiHe gave orders that his Consort should be kept in ignorance of these rejoicingsBut when a month passed without the appearance of the Emperor Empress Mao and her ladies went to the Blue Flower Pavilion to entertain themselvesHearing music she asked who was providing it and they told her that the Emperor and Lady Guo were feasting in the groundsThat day Empress Mao returned to her palace filled with rage Next day she went out in her carriage and saw the Emperor on a verandah Yesterday Your Majesty was walking in the north garden and you had plenty of music too said she laughing Cao Rui was wroth and sent for all the attendantsHe upbraided them with disobedience saying I had forbidden you to tell things to the Empress and you disobeyed my command With this he put them all to deathEmpress Mao feared and returned to her palace Then an edict appeared forcing Empress Mao to commit suicide and raising Lady Guo to be Empress in her placeAnd no officer dared to utter a remonstranceJust after this the Imperial Protector of Youzhou Guanqiu Jian sent in a memorial saying that Gongsun Yuan of Liaodong had risen in revolt had assumed the style of Prince of Yan  and adopted a reign title of Extending Han Gongsun Yuan had built himself a palace established an administration of his own and was disturbing the whole north with plundering A council met to consider this memorialWithin officials labor at ignoble tasks and mean Without the glint of weapons on the border may be seenHow the insurgents were attacked will be related in the next chapter CHAPTER Suffering Defeat Gongsun Yuan Meets His Death In Xiangping Pretending Illness Sima Yi Deceives Cao Shuang This Gongsun Yuan was a grandson of Gongsun Du the Warlike and a son of Gongsun Kang in LiaodongIn the twelfth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity when Cao Cao was pursuing Yuan Shang who had fled eastward Gongsun Kang had captured Yuan Shang beheaded him and sent his head to Cao Cao For this service Gongsun Kang received the title of Lord of XiangpingAfter Gongsun Kangs death as his two sonsGongsun Huang and Gongsun Yuanwere young his brother Gongsun Gong took the chiefship and Cao Pi beside confirming the lordship gave him the rank of General of the Flying CavalryA few years later the second son Gongsun Yuan being now grown up welleducated and trained in military exercises obstinate and fond of fighting took away his uncles power and ruled the heritage of his father Cao Rui conferred upon him the title of General Who Wields Ferocity and made him Governor of LiaodongThen the Ruler of Wu Sun Quan anxious to secure Gongsun Yuans support sent two envoys Zhang Mi and Xu Yan with gifts of gold and gems and pearls and offered Gongsun Yuan the title of Prince of YanFearing that the Middle Land would resent any dallying with Wu Gongsun Yuan slew the Wu envoys and sent the heads to the Ruler of WeiFor this proof of fealty Cao Rui gave him the title of Grand General and the Dukedom of Yuelang However Gongsun Yuan was dissatisfied and his thoughts turned toward independenceHe took council with his officers and proposed to style himself Prince of Yan and to adopt a reigntitle of Extending Han the first yearOne general Jia Fan opposed this and said My lord the central authorities have treated you well and honored youI fear that Sima Yi is too skillful a leader for rebellion to succeedYou see even Zhuge Liang cannot defeat him how much less can you Gongsun Yuans reply was to condemn Jia Fan to deathHowever Adviser Lun Zhi ventured upon further remonstrance Jia Fan spoke wellThe Sacred One says that extraordinary phenomena presage the destruction of a stateNow this time portents are not wanting and wonders have been seen A dog dressed in red and wearing a turban went up to the roof and walking like a manMoreover while a certain person living in a village south of the city was cooking his food he saw a child in the pan boiled to deathA great cave opened near the market place and threw out a large fleshy body completely human save that it lacked limbs Swords could not cut it arrows could not penetrate itNo one knew what to call it and when they consulted the soothsayers they obtained the reply Incomplete shape silent moutha state is near destruction These prodigies are all inauspiciousFlee from evil and strive to walk in fair fortunes wayMake no move without most careful thought This second remonstrance enraged Gongsun Yuan still more and he sent Lun Zhi to death with Jia Fan Both were executed in the public placeGongsun Yuan then prepared to make a bid for empire He raised an army of one hundred fifty thousand appointed Bei Yan as Commander and Yang Zuo as Leader of the Van This army set out for the Middle LandRuler of Wei was alarmed at the report of this rising and sent for Sima YiSima Yi was not greatly perturbed and said My forty thousand troops will be equal to the task The Ruler of Wei replied The task is heavy for your troops are few and the road is long The strength of an army is not in numbers but in strategyAided by Your Majestys good fortune I shall certainly be able to bring this fellow Gongsun Yuan a captive to your feet What do you think will be the rebels plan asked the Ruler of WeiHis high plan would be flight before our army can arrive his middle plan would be defending his position in Liaodong his low plan would be to try to hold XiangpingIn the last case I shall certainly capture him How long will the expedition take We have to cover one thousand five hundred miles which will take a hundred days Attack will consume another hundred The return will need a hundred and with sixty days to rest we shall take a year Suppose during that year we are attacked by Wu or Shu My plans provide for that Your Majesty need have no anxiety The Ruler of Wei being thus reassured formally ordered Sima Yi to undertake the expeditionHu Zun was appointed to lead the van He went and camped in LiaodongThe scouts hastened to tell Gongsun Yuan who sent Bei Yan and Yang Zuo to camp at Liaosui with eighty thousand troops They surrounded their camp with a wall seven miles in circumference and placed thorny barriers outside the rampartIt seemed very secure Hu Zun saw these preparations and sent to tell his chief Sima Yi smiledSo the rebel does not want to fight but thinks to weary my soldiers said Sima YiNow I am disposed to think that most of his army is within that wall so that his stronghold is empty and undefended I will make a dash at XiangpingHe will have to go to its rescue and I will smite him on the wayI should score a great success So Sima Yi hastened to Xiangping along unfrequented waysMeanwhile Bei Yan and Yang Zuo the two generals within the walled camp discussed their plans Yang Zuo said When the Wei army comes near we will not fightThey will have come a long march and their supplies will be short so that they cannot hold out long When they retreat we shall find our opportunityThese were the tactics Sima Yi used against Zhuge Liang on River Wei and Zhuge Liang died before the end of the expeditionWe will try similar means Presently the scouts reported that the Wei army had marched southBei Yan at once saw the danger and said They are going to attack Xiangping which they know has few troopsIf that base be lost this position is useless So they broke up their camp and followed the enemyWhen Sima Yi heard it he rejoiced saying Now they will fall into the snare I have laid for them Sima Yi sent Xiahou Ba and Xiahou Wei to take up position on the River JiThey were to attack if the army of Liaodong came near them They had not long to waitAs soon as Bei Yan and his army approached Xiahou Ba and Xiahou Wei exploded a bomb beat the drums waved their flags and came out one force on each sideBei Yan and Yang Zuo made a fight but soon fled to Shoushan Mountain where they fell in with Gongsun Yuan and joined the main army Then they turned to give battle to the Wei armyBei Yan rode to the front and reviled the enemy taunted them with trickery and challenged to a fight in the openXiahou Ba rode out to accept the challenge and after a few bouts Bei Yan fellIn the confusion caused by the death of their leader Xiahou Ba urged on his troops and drove Gongsun Yuan back to Xiangping and Gongsun Yuan took refuge in the city The city was surroundedIt was autumn and the rain fell day after day without ceasing At the end of the month the plain was under three feet of water so that the grain boats sailed straight from River Ji to the city walls The besiegers suffered much from the floodsPei Jing Commander of the Left went to Sima Yi and asked that the army might be moved to camp on the higher ground out of the mud and water But Sima Yi flouted the suggestion How can the army move away just when success is in sightThe rebels will be conquered now any day and if any other speaks about drawing off he will be put to death Pei Jing agreed and went awaySoon after Chou Lian Commander of the Right came to see his chief and repeated the suggestion saying The soldiers are suffering from the rainsO Commander let them camp on the hills Sima Yi got angry and said I have sent the command and you are against it And he ordered Chou Lian to be executedHis head was suspended at the camp gate as a warning to othersThe soldiers dared to complain any moreThen Sima Yi ordered the south camp to be abandoned and the army marched seven miles south thus allowing the soldiers and people in the city to come out to gather fuel and pasture their cattle The attacking army could not understand this move and Chen Qun spoke about itWhen you besieged Shangyong O Regent Marshal you attacked all round at eight points and the city fell in eight days Meng Da was taken and you won a great successNow your forty thousand troops have borne their armors many days over long marches and you do not press the attack but keep the them in the mud and mire and let the enemy gather supplies and feed their cattleI do not know what your intention may be Sir replied the CommanderinChief I see you are ignorant of war after all You do not understand the different conditionsMeng Da then had ample supplies and few troops we were under exactly opposite conditions and so we had to attack vigorously and at onceThe suddenness of the attack defeated the enemyBut look at present conditions The Liaodong troops are many and we few they are on the verge of starvation and we are full fed Why should we force the attackOur line is to let the soldiers desert and capture the cityTherefore I leave a gate open and the road free that they may run away Chen Qun then understood and acknowledged the correctness of the strategySima Yi sent to Luoyang to hasten supplies that there should be no shortageHowever the war was not supported in the capital for when the messenger arrived and the Ruler of Wei summoned his courtiers they said In Liaodong the rain has been continuous for a month and the soldiers are in miserySima Yi ought to be recalled and the war renewed at a more convenient season The Ruler of Wei replied The leader of our army is most capable and best able to decide upon what should be done He understands the conditions and is teeming with magnificent plans He will certainly succeedWherefore Noble Sirs wait a few days and let us not be anxious about the result So Cao Rui heeded not the voice of the dissentients but took care that provisions were sentAfter a few days the rain ceased and fine clear weather followedThat night Sima Yi went out of his tent that he might study the sky Suddenly he saw a very large and bright star start from a point over Shoushan Mountain and travel over toward Xiangping where it fellThe soldiers were rather frightened at this apparition but the leader rejoicedFive days from now Gongsun Yuan will be slain where that star fell said he Therefore attack with vigor They opened the attack the next morning at dawn throwing up banks and sapping the walls setting up stonethrowing machines and rearing ladders When night came the attack did not ceaseArrows fell in the city like pelting rainWithin the city grain began to run short and soon there was none They slaughtered bullocks and horses for food The soldiers began to be mutinous and no longer fought with any spirit There was talk of slaying Gongsun Yuan and yielding the cityGongsun Yuan was disheartened and frightened and decided to sue for peace He sent his Prime Minister Wang Jian and Imperial Censor Liu Fu out of the city to beg Sima Yi to allow him to submit These two had to be let down from the walls by ropes as no other means of exit were possibleWang Jian and Liu Fu found their way to Sima Yi and said We pray you O Regent Marshal retire seven miles and allow the officers to come forth and surrender Why did not Gongsun Yuan himself come said Sima YiHe is rude He put the two envoys to death and sent their heads back into the cityGongsun Yuan was still more alarmed but he resolved to make one more attempt This time he sent High Counselor Wey Yan as his envoySima Yi received this messenger sitting in state in his tent with his officers standing right and leftWey Yan approached on his knees and when he reached the door of the tent recited his petitionI pray you O Regent Marshal turn your thunderous wrath from us we will send the son of our leader Gongsun Xiu the Heir Apparent as hostage and all the officers shall appear before you bound with cords Sima Yi replied There are five possible operations for any armyIf you can fight fight if you cannot fight defend if you cannot defend flee if you cannot flee surrender if you cannot surrender die These five courses are open to you and a hostage would be uselessNow return and tell your master Wey Yan put his hands over his head and fled like a rat He went into the city and related what had happened to him The Gongsuns father and son resolved to fleeThey chose a thousand of mounted troops and in the dead of night opened the south gate and got out They took the road to the east and were rejoiced to find it clear All went well for a distance of three miles when a bomb explodedThis was followed by a roll of drums and the blare of trumpets and a cohort stood in the wayThe leader was Sima Yi supported by his two sonsSima Shi and Sima Zhao Stop O rebel cried the sonsBut Gongsun Yuan lashed his steed to a gallop Then Hu Zun Xiahou Ba Xiahou Wei Zhang Hu and Yue Chen with their troops came up and quickly surrounded them so that they were helplessGongsun Yuan saw that escape was impossible so he came with his son dismounted and offered surrenderSima Yi hardly looked at the two men but he turned to his officers and said That night the star fell to this land and today five days later the omen becomes true They all felicitated him saying The Regent Marshal is superhuman Gongsun Yuan and Gongsun Xiu were slain where they stoodThen Sima Yi turned to resume the siege of Xiangping but before he had reached the walls Hu Zuns army had entered Sima Yi went in and was received with great respect the people burning incense as he passedHe went to the residence and then the whole of the Gongsun Yuans clan and all who had assisted in his rising were beheaded They counted heads to the number of seventyThe city taken and the rebels destroyed Sima Yi issued a proclamation in order to restore confidence among the peopleCertain persons told him Jia Fan and Lun Zhi had been against the revolt and had therefore suffered death So Sima Yi honored their tombs and conferred ranks upon their childrenThe contents of the treasury were distributed among the soldiers as rewards and then the army marched back to LuoyangOne night the Ruler of Wei was suddenly awakened by a chill blast that extinguished all the lights but he saw the form of the late Empress Mao with a score or two of other palace attendants coming toward the bed whereon he lay and as they approached they demanded his lifeHe was very frightened and fell ill so that he was like to dieSo the two officers Liu Fang and Sun Zi were set over the privy council and he summoned his brother Cao Yu the Prince of Yan to the capital to make him Grand Commander and Regent Marshal to assist the Heir Apparent Cao FangHowever Cao Yu being modest and retiring by nature declined these high offices and their responsibilitiesThe Ruler of Wei then turned to his two confidants Liu Fang and Sun Zi inquired of them saying Who of the family is a suitable person to support the Heir Apparent As Liu Fang and Sun Zi had both received many favors from Cao Zhen they replied None is so fit as Cao Shuang the son of Cao Zhen The Ruler of Wei approved their choice and thus Cao Shuang became a great personThen Liu Fang and Sun Zi memorialized saying As Cao Shuang has been chosen Cao Yu the Prince of Yan should be ordered to leave the capital and return to Yan his own place The Ruler of Wei consented and issued an edict which these two bore to Cao Yu saying The edict in the Emperors own hand bids you return to your own domain at once and you are not to return to court without a special command Cao Yu wept but he left forthwithThereupon Cao Shuang was created Grand Commander and Regent Marshal and administered the governmentBut the Ruler of Weis illness advanced rapidly and he sent messenger with authority flag to call Sima Yi into the palaceAs soon as he arrived he was led to the Emperors chamberI feared lest I should not see you again said the Ruler of Wei but now I can die content The general bowed and said On the road they told me the sacred person was not perfectly well I grieved that I had not wings to hasten hitherBut I am happy in that I now behold the dragon countenance The heir Cao Fang was summoned to the Emperors bedside and also Cao Shuang Liu Fang Sun Zi and certain othersTaking Sima Yi by the hand the dying Emperor said When Liu Bei lay dying at Baidicheng he confided his son so soon to be an orphan to the care of Zhuge Liang who labored in this task to the very end and whose devotion only ceased with death If such conduct is possible in the mere remnant of a dying dynasty continued in a small state how much more may I hope for it in a great countryMy son is only eight years of age and incapable of sustaining the burden of rulership Happily for him he has ample merit and experience around him in the persons of yourself and his relativesHe will never lack friends for my sake Turning to the young prince he continued My friend Sima Yi is as myself and you are to treat him with the same respect and deference Cao Rui bade Sima Yi lead the young prince forwardThe boy threw his arms around Sima Yis neck and clung to himNever forget the affection he has just shown said Cao Rui weepingAnd Sima Yi wept alsoThe dying man swooned although he could not speak his hand still pointed to his son and soon after he diedCao Rui had reigned thirteen years and was thirtysix years of age His death took place in the first month of the third year of Spectacular Beginning No time was lost in enthroning the new Emperor the supporters being Sima Yi and Cao Shuang The new rulers name was Cao Fang However he was Cao Ruis son only by adoptionHe had been brought up in the palace secretly and no one knew his real originThe posthumous title of Emperor Rui the Knowledgeable was conferred upon the late ruler and he was buried in the Gaoping TombsEmpress Guo was given the title of Empress DowagerThe new reign was styled Right Beginning the first yearSima Yi and Cao Shuang conducted the government and in all matters Cao Shuang treated Sima Yi with deference and took no steps without his knowledge Cao Shuang was no stranger at courtCao Rui had respected him for his diligence and care and had been very fond of him He had had the freedom of the palace all his lifeHe had a host of five hundred clients and retainers Among them were five wholly light and foppishTheir names were He Yan Deng Yang Li Sheng Ding Mi and Bi GuiBeside these five there was another named Huan Fan Minister of Agriculture a man of good parts who had the sobriquet of Bag of Wisdom These six were Cao Shuangs most trusted companions and confidantsOne day He Yan said My lord you should not let your great powers slip into the hands of any other or you will repent it Cao Shuang replied Sima Yi as well as I received the late Emperors sacred trust and I mean to be true He Yan said When your father and this Sima Yi were winning their victories in the west your father suffered much from this mans temper which ultimately brought about his deathWhy do you not look into that Cao Shuang seemed suddenly to wake upHaving entered into an intrigue with the majority of the officers about the court then one day he presented to the Ruler of Wei a memorial saying Sima Yi should be promoted to the rank of Guardian of the Throne for his great merits and services The promotion was made and consequently Sima Yi now a civil officer let the whole military authority fall into the hands of Cao ShuangHaving thus far succeeded Cao Shuang next appointed his brothers to high military posts Cao Xi as Commander of the Center Army Cao Xun Commander of the Imperial Guard Cao Yan Commander of the Cavalry Each commanded three thousand of the palace guards with right to go in and out of the palace at willMoreover three of his friendsHe Yan Deng Yang and Ding Miwere created Chairs of three Boards Bi Gui Commander of Capital District and Li Sheng Governor of Henan These five and their patron were close associates in all concerns of stateCao Shuang gathered about him larger and still larger numbers of supporters till Sima Yi gave out that he was ill and remained in seclusion His two sons also resigned their officesCao Shuang and his friends now gave themselves up to dissipation spending days and nights in drinking and music In their dress and the furniture of their table they copied the palace patternsTribute in the shape of jewels and curios went to the residence of Cao Shuang before it entered the Emperor Palace and his courts swarmed with beautiful damselsMinister Zhang Dang of the Palace Bureau toadied to Cao Shuang so far as to select eighteen of the late Emperors handmaids and send them to the now powerful ministerCao Shuang also chose for him a chorus of two score wellborn ladies who were skilled in music and dancingCao Shuang also built for himself beautiful towers and pavilions and made to himself vessels of gold and silver the work of the most expert craftspeople whom he kept constantly employedNow He Yan heard of Guan Lus great skill in divination and sent to Pingyuan to invite him to discuss about the Book of ChangesWhen the soothsayer arrived Deng Yang was of the company to meet him and he said to Guan Lu You call yourself a skillful diviner but your speech does not resemble the language of the Book of ChangesHow is that Guan Lu replied An interpreter does not use the language of the original He Yan laughed saying Certainly good words are not wearisomeBut cast a lot for me and tell me whether I shall ever arrive at the highest office or not for I have dreamed repeatedly that many blue flies settled on my nose Guan Lu replied Gao Kai and Gao Yuan aided King Shun Duke Zhou assisted the young Emperor Cheng of Zhou Dynasty all these were kindly and modest and enjoyed great happinessYou Sir have come to high honors and wield great powers but those who esteem you are few and those who fear you many You are not careful to walk in the way of good fortuneNow the nose is an eminenceIf an eminence retains its characteristic thereby it remains in honor But is it not that blue flies gather to foul objects and the lofty fears a fall I would wish you to give of your abundance for the good of the poor and avoid walking in the wrong roadThen indeed may you reach the highest dignity and the blue flies will disperse This is mere senile gossip said Deng YangThe gift of age is to see that which is yet to come the gift of gossip is to perceive what is not said replied Guan LuThereupon he shook out his sleeves and went awayHe is very mad really said his two hostsGuan Lu went home When he saw his uncle Guan Lu gave him an account of the interviewHis uncle was alarmed at the probable consequences and said Why did you anger themThey are too powerful for you to offend What is there to fearI have keen talking to two dead men What do you mean Deng Yangs gait is that of one whose sinews are loosed from his bones and his pulse is unsteady When he would stand he totters as a man without limbs This is the aspect of a disembodied soulHe Yan looks as if his soul was about to quit its habitation He is bloodless and what should be solid in him is mere vapor He looks like rotten wood This is the aspect of a soul even now in the dark valleyBoth these men will certainly soon die a violent death and none need fear them His uncle left cursing him for a madman Cao Shuang and his five friends were devoted to hunting and were often out of the cityCao Xi a brother of Cao Shuang remonstrated with him about this and pointed out the dangers of such frequent absence on these excursions You are in an exalted position and yet you are constantly being out huntingIf anyone took advantage of this to work you evil you might have to be exceedingly regretful Cao Shuang only showed anger and replied The whole military authority is in my hands and what is there to fear Huan Fan Minister of Agriculture also reasoned with him but Cao Shuang would not listenAbout this time the style of the reign was changed from Right Beginning the tenth year to Domestic Calm the first year Now ever since Cao Shuang had enjoyed the monopoly of military authority he had never heard the truth about the state of health of the man he had maneuvered out of power But when the Ruler of Wei appointed Li Sheng to the governorship of Qingzhou Cao Shuang bade Li Sheng go to take leave of Sima Yi at the same time to find out the true state of his health So Li Sheng proceeded to the residence of the High Minister and was announcedSima Yi saw through the device at once and told his sons saying This is Cao Shuangs wish to find out my real condition And he bade them play their parts in the scene he arranged before the visitor was admittedSima Yi threw aside his headdress so letting his hair fall in disorder stretched himself upon his couch tumbled the bed ding into confusion got a couple of servant girls to support him and then told his servants to lead in the visitorLi Sheng came in and went up to the sick man saying It is a long time since I have seen you and I did not know you were so seriously illHis Majesty is sending me to Qingzhou and I have come to pay my respects to you and bid you farewell Ah Bingzhou is in the north you will have to be very careful there said Sima Yi feigning that he had not heardI am going as Governor of Qingzhou not Bingzhou said Li ShengOh you have just come from Bingzhou Qingzhou in Huashang Mountains Just back from Qingzhou eh said Sima Yi smilingHow very ill the Imperial Guardian is said Li Sheng to the servantsThe Minister is deaf said theyGive me paper and a pen said Li ShengWriting materials were brought when Li Sheng wrote what he wished to say and put it before his hostMy illness has made me very deaf take care of yourself on the way said Sima YiLooking up he pointed to his mouthOne of the girls brought some broth and held the cup for him to drink He put his lips to the cup but spilled the broth all over his dress I am very weak and ill said he and may die at any momentMy sons are but poor things but you will instruct them and when you see the Regent Marshal you will ask him to take care of them for me will you not At this point Sima Yi fell back on the couch panting and Li Sheng took his leaveHe told Cao Shuang what he had seen and Cao Shuang rejoiced thinking his rival could not last longIf the old man died I should not be the one to grieve said Cao ShuangBut no sooner had Cao Shuang gone than Sima Yi rose from his couch and said to his sons Li Sheng will take a full account of this to Cao Shuang who will not fear me any moreBut wait till Cao Shuang goes on his next hunting trip and we will see what can be done Soon after this Cao Shuang proposed to the Ruler of Wei Cao Fang to visit the Gaoping Tombs where his father lay and perform the filial sacrifices in person So they went a goodly company of officers in the train of the imperial chariot and Cao Shuang with all his brothers and his friends went with the guards Huan Fan Minister of Agriculture entreated him to remain in the city for fear of plots and risingsYour Lordship are in charge of the capital security and you and your brothers should not leave the city togetherSuppose there were a revolt what then But Cao Shuang asked angrily and rudely Who would dare make trouble Hold your wild tongue And he went with the Emperor His departure rejoiced the heart of Sima Yi who at once began quietly to muster his trusty friends and henchmen and put the finishing touches to the plot for the overthrow of his rivalNow terminates his forced inaction He must destroy the hostile factionCao Shuangs fate will appear in the next chapter CHAPTER  The Ruler of Wei Hands Over The Power To Sima Yi Jiang Wei Is Defeated At Ox Head Hills Sima Yi was very pleased to hear that Cao Shuang and his party were to follow the Ruler of Wei on a visit to the tombs combined with a hunt for it meant that the whole enemy faction left the cityAs soon as they left Sima Yi entered with his authority as Guardian of the Throne gave Gao Rou Minister of the Interior provisional command of the army and sent him to seize the camp of Cao ShuangA similar command was given to Wang Guan Supervisor of the Palace to occupy the camp of Cao XiHaving secured his position thus Sima Yi and his supporters went to the palace of the Empress Dowager and said to her Cao Shuang has betrayed the trust placed in him by the late Emperor and has ruined the governmentHis fault must be expiated Empress Guo replied What can be done in the absence of His Majesty I have prepared plans for the destruction of these base ministers and will see to it that no trouble happens to yourself The Empress was much alarmed but could only act as she was directed and agreeSo two of Sima Yis supporters Commander Jiang Ji and High Minister Sima Fu copied out the memorial he had prepared and it was sent to the Ruler of Wei by the hand of an eunuchThen the arsenals were seizedSoon the news of the rising came to the knowledge of the family of Cao Shuang and his wife Lady Liu came out from the inner apartments and summoned Pan Ju Commander of the Gates and inquired The Master is outside and Sima Yi is revoltingwhat does it mean Your Ladyship need feel no alarm Let me go and find out the truth said Pan JuThereupon Pan Ju at the head of a several bowmen went up on the wall and looked aroundAt that moment Sima Yi was crossing the court and Pan Ju bade his men shoot Sima Yi could not passBut Sun Qian one of his generals said You must not shoot at the Guardian of the Throne he is on public service Thrice Sun Qian urged his chief not to let the men shoot and so Pan Ju desistedSima Yi went across guarded by his son Sima Zhao Then he went out of the city and camped on River Luo at the Floating Bridge When the revolution began one of Cao Shuangs officers Luu Zhi by name took counsel with Military Adviser Xin ChangNow that this revolt has begun what should we do Let us go to the Emperor with what troops we have replied Xin ChangPerhaps the best course replied Luu ZhiAnd Xin Chang went into the inner chamber to get ready to startThere he met his sister Xin Xianying who asked the meaning of all this hasteHis Majesty is out on a hunt and Sima Yi has closed the gates of the city This is rebellion I do not think soHe only means to slay Cao Shuang his rival replied sheWhat will be the outcome of this asked her brotherCao Shuang is no match for Sima Yi replied she If Sima Yi asks us to join him should we asked Xin ChangXin Xianying replied You know what a true man should doWhen a man is in danger there is the greater need for sympathyTo be of Cao Shuangs people and desert him in an emergency is the greatest of evils This speech decided Xin Chang who went with Luu ZhiAt the head of a some twenty horsemen they forced the gate and got out of the cityWhen their escape was reported to Sima Yi he thought that Huan Fan would surely try to follow their example so he sent to call him However on the advice of his son Huan Fan did not answer the summons but decided to flee He got into his carriage and drove hastily to the South GateBut the gate was barred The Commander of the Gate Si Fan was an old dependant of Huan FanHuan Fan pulled out from his sleeve a slip of bamboo and said The Empresss command open the gate for me Let me look said Si FanHow dare you an old servant of mine behave thus Si Fan let Huan Fan passAs soon as he had got outside Huan Fan shouted to Si Fan Sima Yi has raised a revolt and you would better follow me Si Fan realized that he had made a mistake and chase after Huan Fan but failed to come up with himSo the Bag of Wisdom has got away too that is a pity but what can we do said Sima Yi when they reported the escapeThe old horse always hankers after the old stable and manger and he would have been useless to us replied Jiang JiThen Sima Yi called to him Xu Yun and Chen Tai and said Go you to Cao Shuang and say that I have no other intention than to take away the military power from him and his brothers As soon as they had left he called Yin Damu and ordered Jiang Ji prepare a letter to be taken to Cao Shuang by Yin DamuSaid Sima Yi You are on good terms with the man and are the fittest person for this missionTell him that Jiang Ji and I are concerned solely with the military powers in the hands of himself and his brothers as we have sworn pointing to River Luo So Yin Damu went his wayOut in the country Cao Shuang was enjoying the hunting flying his falcons and coursing his hounds Suddenly came the news of the rising in the city and the memorial against himHe almost fell out of the saddle when they told himThe eunuch handed in the memorial to the Ruler of Wei in the presence of Cao Shuang who took it and opened itA minister in attendance was ordered to read itIt said Sima Yi General Who Conquers the West and Imperial Guardian with bowed head and trepidation presents this memorial On my return from the expedition into Liaodong His late Majesty summoned Your Majesty Cao Shuang myself and certain others to his bedside took me by the arm and impressed upon us all our duty in the years to beNow Cao Shuang has betrayed the trust placed in him has disordered the kingdom usurped power at court and seized upon power in the regionsHe has appointed Zhang Dang Administer of the City to control the court and spy upon Your MajestyHe is surely lying in wait to seize the empireHe has sown dissension in the royal family and injured his own flesh and bloodThe whole land is in confusion and peoples hearts are full of fear All this is opposed to the injunctions of His late Majesty and his commands to meStupid and worthless as I am yet I dare not forget the words of His late MajestyMy colleagues Jiang Ji and Sima Fu agree that Cao Shuang is disloyal at heart and great military powers should not be entrusted to him or his brothersI have memorialized Her Majesty and obtained her authority to actAll military powers have been wrested from the hands of Cao Shuang Cao Xi and Cao Xun leaving them only the simple title of lordships so that hereafter they may be unable to hinder or control Your Majestys actionsIf there be any obstruction the matter shall be summarily dealt withAlthough in ill health as a precautionary measure I have camped at the Floating Bridge whence I write this When they had made an end of reading the Ruler of Wei turned to Cao Shuang and said In the face of such words what mean you to do Cao Shuang was at a loss and turned to his younger brother saying What now Cao Xi replied I remonstrated with you but you were obstinate and listened not So it has come to thisSima Yi is false and cunning beyond measure If Zhuge Liang could not get the better of him could we hope to do soI see nothing but to yield that haply we may live Just at this moment arrived Xin Chang and Luu ZhiCao Shuang asked what tidings they broughtThey replied The city is completely and closely surrounded Sima Yi is camped on the river at the Floating Bridge and you cannot returnYou must decide how to act at once Then galloped up Huan Fan who said This is really rebellion why not request His Majesty to proceed to Xuchang till regional troops can arrive and deal with Sima Yi Cao Shuang replied How can we go to another place when all our families are in the city Even a fool in this crisis would think only of lifeYou have the Son of Heaven with you here and command all the forces of the empire None would dare disobey you and yet you march quietly to death Cao Shuang could not decide to strike a blow for safety he did nothing but snivelHuan Fan continued The stay in Xuchang would be but brief and there are ample supplies for yearsYou have forces at your call at the South PassYou hold the seal of Minister of War and I have brought it with me Everything is in your favor Act at onceDelay is death Do not hurry me said Cao ShuangLet me think it over carefully Then came Xu Yun and Chen Tai the two messengers of Sima Yi and said The Guardian of the Throne desires only to strip the military power of the Regent MarshalIf the Regent Marshal yields he may return peacefully to the city Still Cao Shuang hesitatedNext arrived Yin Damu saying The Imperial Guardian had sworn by River Luo to the singleness of his aimHere is letter of Minister Jiang JiThe Regent Marshal should relinquish the military power and return to the palace in peace When Cao Shuang seemed disposed to accept the assurance of Sima Yi Huan Fan inveighed against it saying You are a dead man if you listen to the voice of these people Night found Cao Shuang still vacillatingAs twilight faded into darkness he stood sword in hand sad sighing and weeping And morning found him still trying to make up his mindHuan Fan again urged him to decide upon some course You have had a whole day and a whole night for reflection and must decide said heI will not fight I will yield all being a wealthy man is enough said Cao Shuang throwing down his sword Huan Fan left the tent wailingCao Zhen might boast of his abilities but his sons are mere cattle said he weeping copiouslyThe two messengers Xu Yun and Chen Tai bade Cao Shuang offer his seal of office to Sima Yi and it was broughtBut First Secretary Yang Zong clung to it and would not give it up saying Alas That you my lord should resign your powers and make such a pitiful surrender For surely you will not escape death in the eastern market place The Imperial Guardian will surely keep faith with me said Cao ShuangThe seal was borne away and Cao Shuangs generals and soldiers thus released from the bonds of discipline dispersed and the hosts melted awayWhen the brothers reached the Floating Bridge they were ordered to go to their dwellings and they wentTheir supporters were imprisoned to await the edicts of the EmperorCao Shuang and his friends so lately allpowerful entered the city alone without even a servant followingAs Huan Fan approached the bridge Sima Yi from horseback pointed his whip disdainfully at him and said What brought you to this Huan Fan made no reply but with head bent followed the othersIt was decided to request the Emperor to declare the hunt at an end and order a return to the cityCao Shuang Cao Xi and Cao Xun were confined in their own house the gate whereof was fastened with a huge lock and soldiers were set to guard it round aboutThey were sad and anxious not knowing what would be their fateThen Cao Xi said We have but little food left Let us write and ask for suppliesIf Sima Yi sends us food we may be sure he does not intend harm They wrote and a hundred carts of supplies were sentThis cheered them and Cao Shuang said Our lives are safe in the hands of Sima Yi Sima Yi had Zhang Dang arrested and put to the questionZhang Dang said he was not the only one who had tried to subvert the government and he named the five friends of Cao ShuangHe Yan Deng Yang Li Sheng Ding Mi and Bi GuiSo they were arrested and when interrogated confessed that a revolt had been arranged for the third monthSima Yi had them locked in one long wooden collarThe Commander of the Gates Si Fan testified that Huan Fan had imposed upon him with a pretended command from Her Majesty and so had escaped out of the city Beside Huan Fan had said the Imperial Guardian was a rebelThen said Sima Yi When a person maligns another and is false the punishment for such a crime as he imputes falls upon his own head Huan Fan and those with him were thrown into prison Presently Cao Shuang and his brothers all persons connected with them and their clans were put to death in the market placeAll the treasures of their houses was sent to the public treasuryNow there was a certain woman of the Xiahou family who had been wife to Wen Shu a second cousin of Cao Shuang Early left a childless widow her father wished her to marry again Lady Xiahou refused and cut off her ears as a pledge of constancyHowever when the Caos were all put to death her father arranged another marriage for her whereupon she cut off her nose Her own people were chagrined at her obstinate determination For whom are you keeping your vow said theyMan is but as the light dust upon the tender grass and what is the good of mutilating your body The woman replied weeping I have heard that honorable persons do not break a vow of chastity for the sake of wealth and the hearts of righteous persons are constant unto death regardless of all lossesWhile the house of Cao enjoyed prosperity I remained faithful how much more should I be true now that it has fallen upon evil daysCan I act like a mere beast of the field The story of her devotion came to the ears of Sima Yi who praised her conduct and allowed her to adopt a son to rear as her own and so continue the family A poem says What is a man to be mindful ofA grain of dust on a blade of grass Such virtue as Lady Xiahou had Stands out sublime as the ages pass This fair young wife of gentle mien Dared all to maintain her purpose high What people though strong in the flush of life Have equaled her in constancyAfter Cao Shuang had suffered death Jiang Ji said to Sima Yi Xin Chang and Luu Zhi and others who had been of his party had forced the gate and joined the rebels Yang Zong had opposed the surrender of the seal of the late minister They deserve punishment However no action was taken against themThey are righteous people who serves their master faithfully said Sima Yi and he even confirmed these men in their officesXin Chang sighed Had I not listened to the advice of my sister I would have walked in the way of unrighteousness A poet has praised his sister Xin XianyingYou call him lord and take his pay Then stand by him when danger nears Thus to her brother spoke Xin Xianying And won fair fame though endless yearsA general amnesty was extended to all Cao Shuangs partisans and no officer was removed or dismissed for having supported the late order of things All were left in possession of their property and soon all was tranquillityHowever it is to be noted that He Yan and Deng Yang met the unhappy end that Guan Lu had foretold for themThe seer Guan Lu was deeply read In all the lore of the ancient sages Thus he could see events to come As clear as those of former ages And he perceived the soul of He Yan Already in the vale of gloomAnd knew the outer shell of Deng Yang Was hastening to an early tombAfter his recovery of power Sima Yi was made Prime Minister and received the Nine Gifts of DignitiesSima Yi refused these honors but the Ruler of Wei insisted and would take no denialHis two sons were made assistants to their father and all state affairs fell under the control of these threeHowever Sima Yi remembered that one man Xiahou Ba a member of the Cao clan still commanded at Yongzhou In his position Xiahou Ba might be a real danger and he must be removed So an edict was issued calling him to Capital Luoyang to discuss affairsUpon receiving this call Xiahou Ba was shocked but instead of obeying this call he declared himself a rebel and he had a force of three thousand troops to support him As soon as this was known Guo Huai marched to suppress the malcontent The two armies were soon face to face and Guo Huai went to the front and began to revile his opponentHow could you rebel against the ruling house you who are of the same clan as our great founder and you who have always been treated generously Xiahou Ba replied My forefathers served the state right well but who is this Sima Yi that he has put to death my kinspeople and would now destroy meWhat is his aim if it be not to usurp the ThroneIf I can cut him off and so frustrate his design I shall at least be no traitor to the state Guo Huai rode forward to attack and Xiahou Ba advanced to the encounterThey fought some ten bouts and then Guo Huai turned and fledBut this was only a feint to lead on his enemy for ere Xiahou Ba had gone far he heard a shout behind him and turned to see Chen Tai about to attackAt the same moment Guo Huai turned again and thus Xiahou Ba was between two firesHe could effect nothing so he fled losing many troops Soon he decided that his only course was to flee to Hanzhong and to surrender to the Ruler of ShuWherefore he went into Hanzhong to see if haply the Latter Ruler would accept his services When Jiang Wei heard of his desire to surrender he had doubts of Xiahou Bas sincerityHowever after due inquiry Jiang Wei was satisfied and allowed the renegade from Wei to enter the cityAfter making his obeisance Xiahou Ba with many tears told the story of his wrongs Jiang Wei expressed sympathySaid Jiang Wei In the ancient time Wei Zi left the court of Zhou in disgust and this act has assured to him everlasting honor You may be able now to assist in the restoration of the House of Han and you will then stand no whit inferior to any person of antiquity A banquet was ordered and while it was being prepared the host talked of affairs in Capital Luoyang The Simas are now most powerful and in a position to carry out any scheme they plannedThink you that they have any intentions against Shu The old traitor has enough to do with his rebellion he has no leisure to trouble about any outside mattersHowever two other young leaders in Wei have lately come to the front and if Sima Yi sent them against Shu and Wu it might go ill with you both And who are these two One is named Zhong Hui a man of Changsha he is a son of the former Imperial Guardian Zhong YaoAs a mere boy he was noted for being bold and smart His father used to take him and his brother Zhong Yu to court Zhong Hui was seven and his brother a year olderEmperor Pi noticed one day that the elder boy was sweating and asked him the reasonZhong Yu replied Whenever I am frightened the sweat pours out Then Emperor Pi said to the other boy You do not seem frightened And Zhong Hui replied I am so frightened that the sweat cannot come out The Emperor was discerned the extraordinary ability of the boyA little later Zhong Hui was always studying books on war and tactics and became an able strategist so that he won admiration from both Sima Yi and Jiang Ji Zhong Hui is being a secretary in the Palace The second man is Deng Ai from Yiyang He was left an orphan very early but he was ambitious and enterprising If he saw lofty mountains or wide marshes he always looked for those points where soldiers might be stationed or depots of provisions made or combustibles laidPeople ridiculed him but Sima Yi saw there was much to admire and employed the young man on his staffDeng Ai had an impediment in his speech so that he called himself DengengengAi and Sima Yi used to make fun of him and asked him one day how many there were of him since he called himself DengengengAi Deng Ai at once replied There is only one phoenix when they say O PhoenixO Phoenix This ready repartee shows the quickness of his intellect and you may well be on your guard against him and the other for they are to be feared I do not think them worth even talking about replied Jiang WeiJiang Wei took Xiahou Ba to Chengdu and presented him to the Latter RulerJiang Wei said Sima Yi had slain Cao Shuang and he wanted to bait Xiahou Ba who yielded to ShuNow the Simas father and sons are holding the supreme power the young Ruler Cao Fang is a weakling and Weis fortune is near its endFor many years in Hanzhong our troops have been well trained and our stores and depots filled with ample suppliesNow I wish to lead an expedition using Xiahou Ba as guide to conquer the Middle Land and to reestablish the House of Han in its old capitalThis is how I could show my gratitude to Your Majesty and fulfill the desire of the late Prime Minister But Fei Yi Chair of the Secretariat opposed any expedition saying We have lately lost by death two trusty minister Jiang Wan and Dong Yun and there is no one left fit to take care of the governmentThe attempt should be postponed no hasty move should be made Not so replied Jiang Wei Life is shortOur days flash by as the glint of a white horse across a chink in the door We are waiting and waiting Are we never to try to restore Han to its old glory Remember the saying of the wise Sun ZiKnow thyself and know thine enemy then is victory sure We are not the equals of the late Prime Minister and where he failed are we likely to succeed Jiang Wei said I would enlist the aid of the QiangsI have lived near them in Xizhou and know them wellWith their help even if we do not gain the whole empire we can at least conquer and hold all west of Xizhou The Latter Ruler here closed the discussion saying Sir as you desire to conquer Wei do your best I will not damp your enthusiasm Thus the Latter Rulers consent was givenThen Jiang Wei left the court and betook himself with Xiahou Ba into Hanzhong to prepare for a new expeditionWe will first send an envoy to the Qiangs to make a league with them said Jiang WeiThen we will march out by the Xiping Pass to Yongzhou where we will throw up two ramparts in Qushan in Qushan Mountains and garrison them The position is a point of vantageThen we will send supplies beyond the pass by land and waterways and advance gradually according to the plan devised by the late Prime Minister In the autumn of the year  they sent the two Shu generals Li Xin and Gou An with fifteen thousand troops to construct the two ramparts in Qushan in Qushan Mountains of which Gou An was to hold the eastern and Li Xin the westernWhen the news reached Yongzhou the Imperial Protector Guo Huai sent a report to Luoyang and also dispatched Chen Tai with a force of fifty thousand troops to oppose the troops of ShuWhen that army arrived Li Xin and Gou An led their troops to meet it but their armies were too weak to stand such a large force and they once more retired into the cityChen Tai ordered his army to lay siege and occupy the road that led to Hanzhong so that supplies were cut offAfter some days and when the soldiers of Shu began to feel the pinch of hunger Guo Huai came to see what progress his general was makingAt sight of the position he rejoiced exceedingly and when he returned to camp he said to Chen Tai In this high country the city must be short of water which means that the besieged must come out for suppliesLet us cut off the streams that supply them and they will perish of thirst So the Wei soldiers were set to work to divert the streams above the city and the besieged were soon distressedLi Xin led out a strong force to try to seize the water sources and fought stubbornly but was at length worsted and driven back within the walls After that Li Xin and Gou An joined their forces and made another attempt to go out and fightBut the Yongzhou troops surrounded them and a melee ensured until Li Xin and Gou An fought their way back to the cityMeanwhile the soldiers were parched with thirst Gou An discussed the circumstance with Li Xin saying I do not understand the delay of Commander Jiang Weis reinforcements Li Xin said Let me try to fight my way out and get help So the gates were opened and Li Xin rode out with some twenty horsemenThese were opposed and had to fight every inch of the way but eventually Li Xin won though severely woundedAll his followers had fallen That night a strong north wind brought a heavy fall of snow and the besieged were thus temporarily relieved from the water famine They melted the snow and prepared foodLi Xin severely wounded made his way west along the hill paths After two days he fell in with Jiang Wei He dismounted prostrated himself and told his story Qushan had been surrounded and cut off water suppliesBy luck it snowed and our soldiers were partly relievedBut the situation was very urgent The delay is not due to my slackness the Qiang allies we depended upon have not come said Jiang WeiJiang Wei sent an escort with the wounded Li Xin to conduct him to Chengdu where his wounds could be treatedTurning to Xiahou Ba Jiang Wei asked The Qiangs do not come and the Wei army is besieging Qushan General do you have any plan to propose Xiahou Ba replied If we wait for the coming of the Qiangs it looks as if we shall be too late to relieve QushanIt is very probable that Yongzhou has been left undefended wherefore I propose that you go toward Ox Head Hills and work round to the rear of Yongzhou which will cause the Wei army to fall back to relieve Yongzhou and so relieve our force The plan appears excellent replied Jiang Wei And he set out When Chen Tai knew that Li Xin had escaped he said to his chief Now that this man has got out he will tell Jiang Wei of the danger and Jiang Wei will conclude that our efforts are concentrated on the ramparts and will endeavor to attack our rearTherefore I suggest General that you go to River Yao and stop the supplies of our enemies while I go to the Ox Head Hills and smite themThey will retreat as soon as they know their supplies are threatened So Guo Huai marched secretly to River Yao while Chen Tai went to the hillsWhen the Shu army led by Jiang Wei came near the Ox Head Hills they heard a great shouting in front and the scouts came in to report that the road was barredJiang Wei himself rode out to lookSo you intended to attack Yongzhou did you shouted Chen Tai But we know it and have been watching for you a long time Jiang Wei rode forth to attackChen Tai advanced with a flourish of his sword and they engagedChen Tai soon ran awayThen the soldiers of Shu came forward and fell on driving the soldiers of Wei back to the summit of the hillsBut they halted there and Jiang Wei encamped at the foot of the hills whence he challenged the enemy every day But he could gain no victorySeeing no result after some days of this Xiahou Ba said This is no place to remain inWe can get no victory and are tempting fate by remaining open to a surpriseI think we should retire till some better plan can be tried Just then it was reported that the supplies road by River Yao was in the hands of Guo Huai and it was imperative to retreatShocked with the news Jiang Wei bade Xiahou Ba march away first and he covered the retreatChen Tai pursued in five divisions along five different roads but Jiang Wei got possession of the meeting point and held them all in check finally forcing them back on the hillsBut from this position Chen Tai ordered his troops to shoot heavy discharges of arrows and stones so that Jiang Wei was forced to abandon his positionHe went to River Yao where Guo Huai led his force out to attackJiang Wei went to and fro smiting where he could but he was surrounded and only got out by a desperate effort and after suffering more than half of his forceJiang Wei hastened toward Yangping Pass but fell in with another body of the enemy at the head of which he saw a fierce youthful leader who at once rode out furiously to attackThis leader had a round face long ears and a square mouth with thick lips Below his left eye was a large hairy mole It was the elder son of Sima Yi He was General of the Flying Cavalry Sima ShiSimpleton how dare you stand in my way yelled Jiang Wei as he rode forward with his spear setSima Shi met the attack and a few bouts were fought before Sima Shi fled Jiang Wei came off victor and so was free to continue his wayPresently he reached the pass and was welcomed within its sheltering wallsSima Shi soon followed and attacked the Pass after his arrival but those within the ramparts replied with the multiple crossbows which threw ten bolts at each discharge For the army of Shu had made these engines of war after the design left by Zhuge Liang Owing to superior weapons Shu defeated Wei Wei would never recover what was lost that dayWhat befell Sima Shi will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER In The Snow Ding Feng Wins A Victory At A Banquet Sun Jun Executes A Secret Plan As has been said Jiang Wei in his retreat fell in with a force under Sima Shi barring his roadIt came about thus After Jiang Wei invaded Yongzhou Guo Huai had sent a flying messenger to the capital and the Ruler of Wei summoned Sima Yi for advice It had then been decided to send reinforcements to Yongzhou and fifty thousand troops had marched led by the son of the Prime MinisterOn the march Sima Shi had heard that the Shu army had been beaten back and he had concluded they were weak So he decided to meet them on the road and give battleNear the Yangping Pass however the roads had been lined with troops armed with the multiple crossbows designed by Zhuge Liang Since Zhuge Liangs death large numbers of these weapons had been made and the bolts from them which went in flights of ten were poisoned Consequently the Wei losses were very heavy and Sima Shi himself barely escaped with life However eventually he returned to LuoyangFrom the walls of Qushan the Shu general Gou An watched anxiously for the expected help As it came not he ultimately surrenderedAnd Jiang Wei with a loss of twenty to thirty thousand soldiers marched back into HanzhongIn the third year of Domestic Calm  in the eighth month Sima Yi fell ill His sickness increased rapidly and feeling that his end was near he called his two sons to his bedside to hear his last words I have served Wei many years and reached the highest rank possible among ministersPeople have suspected me of ulterior aims and I have always felt afraid of thatAfter my death the government will be in your hands and you must be doubly careful Sima Yi passed away even as he said these last wordsThe sons informed the Ruler of Wei who conferred high honors upon the dead and advanced his sons Sima Shi to the rank of Regent Marshal with the leadership of the Chairs of the Boards and Sima Zhao to the rank of Commander of the Flying CavalryThe Ruler of Wu Sun Quan had named his son Sun Deng as his heir His mother was Lady Xu But Sun Deng died and the second son Sun He was chosen his successorHis mother was Lady Wang A quarrel arose between Sun He and Princess Quan who maligned him and intrigued against him so that he was set aside Sun He died of mortification Then the third son Sun Liang was named the Heir Apparent his mother was Lady PanAt this time Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin were both dead and the business of the government great and small was in the hands of Zhuge Ke son of Zhuge JinIn the first year of Grand Beginning  on the first of the eighth month a great storm passed over Wu The waves rose to a great height and the water stood eight feet deep over the lowlying landsThe pines and cypresses which grew at the cemetery of the Imperial Ancestors of Wu were uprooted and carried to the South Gate of Jianye where they stuck roots upward in the roadSun Quan was frightened and fell illIn the early days of the next year his illness became serious whereupon he called in Imperial Guardian Zhuge Ke and Regent Marshal Lu Dai to hear the declaration of his last wishesSoon after he died at the age of seventyone He had reigned for twentyfour years In ShuHan calendar it was the fifteenth year of Long Enjoyment A hero greeneyed and redbearded He called forth devotion from all He lorded the East without challenge Till deaths one imperative callZhuge Ke immediately placed his late lords son Sun Liang on the throne and the opening of the new reign was marked by the adoption of the style Great Prosperity the first year A general amnesty was proclaimedThe late ruler received the posthumous style of Sun Quan the Great Emperor and was buried in Jiangling When these things were reported in the Wei capital Sima Shis first thought was to attack the South LandBut his plans were opposed by First Secretary Fu Gu saying Remember what a strong defense to Wu is the Great River The country has been many times attacked by our ancestors but never conqueredRather let us all hold what we have till the time be expedient to possess the whole empire Sima Shi replied The way of Heaven changes thrice in a century and no threepart division is permanent I wish to attack Wu Sima Zhao his brother was in favor of attack saying The occasion is most opportuneSun Quan is newly dead and the present ruler is a child An expedition was decided uponWang Chang General Who Conquers the South was sent with one hundred thousand troops against Nanjun Guanqiu Jian General Who Guards the South was given one hundred thousand troops to go against Wuchang Hu Zun General Who Conquers the East led one hundred thousand troops against Dongxing They marched in three divisionsSima Zhao was made CommanderinChief of the campaignIn the winter of that year the tenth month Sima Zhao marched the armies near to the Wu frontiers and camped Sima Zhao called together Wang Chang Guanqiu Jian Hu Zun and various other commanders to decide upon plans He said The county of Dongxing is most important to WuThey have built a great rampart with walls right and left to defend Lake Chaohu from an attack in the rearYou gentlemen will have to exercise extreme care Then he bade Wang Chang and Guanqiu Jian each to take ten thousand troops and place themselves right and left but not to advance till Dongxing had been capturedWhen that city had fallen these two were to go forward at the same time Hu Zun was to lead the vanThe first step was to construct a floating bridge to storm the rampart The two walls should then be capturedNews of the danger soon came to Wu and Zhuge Ke called a council to take measuresThen said Ding Feng General Who Pacifies the North Dongxing is of the utmost importance as its loss would endanger Wuchang I agree with you said Zhuge KeYou say just what I thinkYou should lead three thousand marines up the river in thirty ships while on land Lu Ju Tang Zi and Liu Zan will follow in three directions with ten thousand troops eachThe signal for the general attack will be a cluster of bombs Ding Feng received the command and with three thousand marines and thirty battleships he sailed in the Great River to DongxingHu Zun the Van Leader of Wei crossed on the floating bridge took and camped on the rampartHe then sent Huan Jia and Han Zong to assault the left and right flanking forts which were held by the Wu Generals Quan Yi and Liu LueThese forts had high walls and strong and made a good resistance so that the Wei force could not overcome But Quan Yi and Liu Lue dared not venture out to attack so strong a force as was attacking themHu Zun made a camp at XutangIt was then the depth of winter and intensely cold Heavy snow fell Thinking that no warlike operations were possible in such weather Hu Zun and his officers made a great feastIn the midst of the feasting came one to report Thirty ships are coming in the river Hu Zun went out to look and saw them come into the bank He made out a hundred troops on eachAs they were so few he returned to the feast and told his officers Only three thousand sailors there is nothing to be alarmed at Giving orders to keep a careful watch they all returned to enjoy themselvesDing Fengs ships were all drawn up in line Then he said to his officers Today there is indeed a grand opportunity for a brave soldier to distinguish himselfWe shall need the utmost freedom of movement so throw off your armor leave your helmets cast aside your long spears and reject your heavy halberdsShort swords are the weapons for today From the shore the soldiers of Wei watched the Wu marines with amusement taking no trouble to prepare against an attackBut suddenly a cluster of bombs exploded and simultaneously with the roar Ding Feng sprang ashore at the head of his troopsThey dashed up the bank and made straight for the Wei camp The soldiers of Wei were taken completely by surprise and were helplessHan Zong grasped one of the halberds that stood by the door of the commanders tent but Ding Feng stabbed him in the breast and he rolled overHuan Jia went round and came up on the left Just as he poised his spear to thrust Ding Feng gripped it under his arm Huan Jia let go and turned to flee but Ding Feng sent his sword flying after him and caught him in the shoulderHe turned and was thrust through by Ding Fengs spearThe three companies of Wu marines went to and fro in the camp of Wei slaying as they wouldHu Zun mounted a horse and fledHis troops ran away across the floating bridge but that gave way and many were thrown into the water and drownedDead bodies lay about on the snow in large numbersThe spoil of military gear that fell to Wu was immenseSima Zhao Wang Chang and Guanqiu Jian seeing the Dongxing front had been broken decided to retreatZhuge Ke marched his army to Dongxing and he made great feastings and distribution of rewards in celebration of victory Then he said to his leaders Sima Zhao has suffered a defeat and retreated to the northIt is time to take the Middle Land So he told his officers that this was his intention and also sent away letters to Shu to engage the aid of Jiang Wei promising that the empire should be divided between them when they had taken itAn army of two hundred thousand troops was told off to invade the Middle LandJust as it was starting a stream of white vapor was seen emerging from the earth and as it spread it gradually enveloped the whole army so that people could not see each otherIt is a white rainbow said Jiang Yan and it bodes ill to the armyI advise you O Commander to return and not march against Wei How dare you utter such illomened words and blunt the keenness of my army cried Zhuge Ke angrilyHe bade the lictors take Jiang Yan out and put him to deathBut Jiang Yans colleagues interceded for him and he was spared but he was stripped of all rank Orders were issued to march quicklyThen Ding Feng offered a suggestion saying Weis chief defense is Xincheng it would be a severe blow to Sima Shi to capture it Zhuge Ke welcomed this suggestion and gave orders to march on XinchengThey came up and found the city gates closed wherefore they began to besiege the city The commander in the city Zhang Te saw the legions of Wu at the walls held a strict defenseA hasty messenger was sent to Luoyang and First Secretary Yu Song told the Prime Minister Sima ShiYu Song said Zhuge Ke is laying siege to Xincheng the city should not try to repulse the attack but simply hold out as long as possibleWhen the besiegers have exhausted their provisions they will be compelled to retireAs they retreat we can smite themHowever it is necessary to provide against any invasion from Shu Accordingly Sima Zhao was sent to reinforce Guo Huai so as to keep off Jiang Wei while Guanqiu Jian and Hu Zun kept the army of Wu at bayFor months the army of Zhuge Ke battered at Xincheng without successHe urged his generals to strenuous efforts threatening to put to death anyone who was dilatoryAt last his attacks looked like succeeding for the northeast corner of the wall seemed shaken Then Zhang Te the commander of Xincheng thought of a deviceHe sent a persuasive messenger with all the register documents to Zhuge Ke And the messenger said It is a rule in Wei that if a city holds out against attack for a hundred days and reinforcement has not arrived then its commander may surrender without penalty to his familyNow Xincheng has held out for over ninety days and my master hopes you will allow him to withstand the few days necessary to complete the hundred when he will yieldHere are all register documents that he desires to tender first Zhuge Ke had no doubts that the story was genuineHe ordered the army to retreat temporarily and the defenders enjoyed a rest But all Zhang Te really desired was time wherein to strengthen the weak angle of the wall As soon as the attacks ceased the defenders pulled down the houses near the corner and repaired the wall with the material As soon as the repairs were complete Zhang Te threw off all pretense and cried from the wall I have half a years provisions yet and will not surrender to any curs of Wu The defense became as vigorous as before the truceZhuge Ke was enraged at being so tricked and urged on the attackBut one day one of the thousands of arrows that flew from the rampart struck him in the forehead and he fellHe was borne to his tent but the wound inflamed and he became very illTheir leaders illness disheartened the troops and moreover the weather became very hotSickness invaded the camp so that soldiers and leaders alike wished to go homeWhen Zhuge Ke had recovered sufficiently to resume command he urged on the attack but the generals said The soldiers are sick and unfit for battle Zhuge Ke burst into fierce anger and said The next person who mentions illness will be beheaded When the report of this threat got abroad the soldiers began to desert freelyPresently Commander Cai Lin with his whole company went over to the enemyZhuge Ke began to be alarmed and rode through the camps to see for himself Surely enough the soldiers all looked sickly with pale and puffy facesThe siege had to be raised and Zhuge Ke retired into his own countryBut scout brought the news of retreat to Guanqiu Jian who led the Wei grand army to follow and harass Zhuge Kes march and inflicted a severe defeatMortified by the course of events Zhuge Ke did not report his return to the Ruler of Wu but pretended illnessSun Liang the Ruler of Wu went to the residence to see his general and the officers came to callIn order to silence comment Zhuge Ke assumed an attitude of extreme severity investigating every ones conduct very minutely punishing rigorously any fault or shortcoming and meting out sentences of banishment or death with exposure till every one walked in terrorHe also placed two of his own cliquesZhang Yue and Zhu Enover the royal guards making them the teeth and claws of his vengeanceNow Sun Jun was a son of Sun Gong and a great grandson of Sun Jing brother of Sun JianSun Quan loved him and had put him in command of the guardsSun Jun was enraged at being superseded by Zhang Yue and Zhu En the two creatures of Zhuge KeMinister Teng Yin who had an old quarrel with Zhuge Ke said to Sun Jun This Zhuge Ke is as cruel as he is powerful He abuses his authority and no one is safe against himI also think he is aiming at something yet higher and you Sir as one of the ruling family ought to put a stop to it I agree with you and I want to get rid of him replied Sun JunNow I will obtain an edict condemning him to death Both went in to see the Ruler of Wu Sun Liang and they laid the matter before himI am afraid of him too replied Sun LiangI have wanted to remove him for some time but have found no opportunityIf you would prove your loyalty you would do it for me Then said Teng Yin Your Majesty can give a banquet and invite him and let a few braves be ready hidden behind the curtainsAt a signal as the dropping of a wine cup they might jump out and slay him and all further trouble would be avoided Sun Liang agreedZhuge Ke had never been to court since his return from the unfortunate expedition Under a plea of indisposition he had remained moping at homeOne day he was going out of his reception room when he suddenly saw coming in a person dressed in the mourning white Who are you said he rather roughlyThe person seemed too terrorstricken to reply or resist when he was seizedThey questioned him and he said I was in mourning for my father newly dead and had come into the city to seek a priest to read the liturgyI had entered by mistake thinking it was a temple The gate wardens were questionedThey said There are scores of us at the gate which is never unwatchedWe have not seen a man enter Zhuge Ke raged and had the mourner and the gate wardens put to deathBut that night he was restless and sleepless By and by he heard a rending sound that seemed to come from the reception hall so he arose and went to see what it wasThe great main beam had broken in two Zhuge Ke much disturbed returned to his chamber to try once more to sleepBut a cold wind blew and shivering in the chilly air he saw the figures of the mourner and the gate wardens he had put to death They advanced toward him holding their heads in their hands and seemed to threaten him He was frightened and fell in a swoonNext morning when washing his face the water seemed tainted with the smell of bloodHe bade the maid throw it away and bring more it made no difference the odor was still thereHe was perplexed and distressed Then came a messenger with an invitation to a royal banquetHe had his carriage preparedAs he was passing through the gate a yellow dog jumped up and caught hold of his garment and then howled lugubriouslyThe dog even mocks me said he annoyed and he bade his attendants take it away Then he set out for the palaceBefore he had gone far he saw a white rainbow rise out of the earth and reach up to the sky While he was wondering what this might portend his friend Zhang Yue came up and spoke a word of warningI feel doubtful about the real purpose of this banquet said Zhang Yue and advise you not to go Zhuge Ke gave orders to drive home again but before he had reached his own gate the two conspiratorsSun Jun and Teng Yinrode up and asked O Commander why are you turning back I feel unwell and cannot see the Emperor today replied Zhuge Ke They replied This court is appointed to be held especially to do honor to you and the armyYou have not yet reported and there is a banquet for youYou may be ill but you really must go to court Zhuge Ke yielded and once more set his face toward the palaceSun Jun and Teng Yin went with him and his friend Zhang Yue followedThe banquet was spread when he arrived and after he had made his obeisance he went to his placeWhen the wine was brought in Zhuge Ke thinking it might be poisoned excused himself from drinking on account of his state of healthWill you have some of the medicated wine brought from your own residence said Sun JunYes I could drink that replied heSo a servant was sent for a supply that he might drink with the other guestsAfter several courses the Ruler of Wu made an excuse and left the banquet hallSun Jun went to the foot of the hall and changed his garments of ceremony for more homely garb but underneath these he put on armor Then suddenly he raised his keen sword and ran up the hall shouting The Emperor has issued an edict to slay a rebel Zhuge Ke startled so that he dropped his cup laid his hand upon his swordBut he was too late his head rolled to the floorHis friend Zhang Yue drew his sword and rushed at the assassin but Sun Jun evaded the full force of the blow and was only wounded in the left fingerSun Jun slashed back at Zhang Yue and wounded him in the right arm Then the braves dashed in and finished Zhang YueThe braves were then sent to arrest Zhuge Kes family while the bodies of Zhuge Ke and Zhang Yue were hastily rolled in matting thrown into a cart taken to the outside of the south gate and tossed into a rubbish pitWhile Zhuge Ke was absent in the palace his wife sat in the womens quarters at home feeling strangely unquietPresently a maid came in and when she drew near his wife said Why does your clothing smell of blood To her horror the maid suddenly transformed into a weird creature with rolling eyes and gritting teeth that went dancing about the room and leaping till it touched the roofbeams shrieking all the time I am Zhuge Ke and I have been slain by that bastard Sun Jun By this time the whole family were frightened and began wailingAnd a few minutes later the residence was surrounded by a crowd of armed guards sent to murder the inmates whom they bound carried off to the market place and put to the swordThese things occurred in the tenth month of the second year of Great Prosperity Before Zhuge Jin died he had a premonition that his sons ability would lead him into trouble and that he would not safeguard his family Others had also predicted an early deathZhang Qi High Minister in Wei used to say to Sima Shi Zhuge Ke will die soon And when asked why Zhang Qi replied Can a person live long when his dignity endangers that of his lord After the conspiracy Sun Jun became Prime Minister in place of his victimHe was also placed in command of all the military forces and became very powerful The control of all matters was in his handsIn Chengdu when the letter of Zhuge Ke asking help from Jiang Wei arrived Jiang Wei had audience with the Latter Ruler and requested authority to raise an army against the northThe army fought but fought in vain Success may crown a new campaignWho were victorious will appear in the next chapter CHAPTER  A Ruse Of A Han GeneralSima Zhao Is Surrounded Retribution For The House Of Wei Cao Fang Is Dethroned It was the autumn of the sixteenth year of Long Enjoyment  and Jiang Weis army of two hundred thousand was ready to march against the north Liao Hua and Zhang Yi were Leaders of the Van Xiahou Ba was Army Strategist Zhang Ni was in command of the commissariat The army marched out by the Yangping PassDiscussing the plan of campaign with Xiahou Ba Jiang Wei said Our former attack on Yongzhou failed so this time they will doubtless be even better prepared to resistWhat do you suggest Xiahou Ba replied Nanan is the only wellprovided place in all Longshang if we take that it will serve as an excellent baseOur former illsuccess was due to the nonarrival of the QiangsLet us therefore send early to tell them to assemble at Longyou after which we will move out at Shiying and march to Nanan by way of Dongting You spoke well said Jiang WeiHe at once sent Xi Zheng as his envoy bearing gifts of gold and pearls and silk to win the help of the King of the Qiangs whose name was Mi DangThe mission was successful King Mi Dang accepted the presents and sent fifty thousand troops to Nanan under the Qiang General Ehe ShaogeWhen Guo Huai heard of the threatened attack he sent a hasty memorial to LuoyangSima Shi at once asked his leaders Who will go out to meet the army from the west Xu Zhi volunteered and as Sima Shi had a high opinion of his capacity he appointed Xu Zhi as Leader of the VanThe brother of the Prime Minister Sima Zhao went as CommanderinChiefThe Wei army set out for Xizhou reached Dongting and there fell in with Jiang WeiWhen both sides were arrayed Xu Zhi who wielded a mighty splitterofmountains ax as his weapon rode out and challengedLiao Hua went forth to accept but after a few bouts he took advantage of a feint and fled Then Zhang Yi set his spear and rode forth to continue the fight He also soon fled and returned within his own ranksThereupon Xu Zhi gave the signal to fall on in force and the army of Shu lost the dayThey retired ten miles Sima Zhao also drew off his troops and both sides encampedXu Zhi is very formidable how can we overcome him asked Jiang WeiTomorrow make pretense of defeat and so draw them into an ambush replied Xiahou BaBut remember whose son this Sima Zhao is said Jiang WeiSima Zhao cannot be a novice in war and if he sees a likely spot for an ambush he will haltNow the troops of Wei have cut our transportation many times let us do the same to them and we may slay this Xu Zhi He called in Liao Hua and Zhang Yi and gave them secret orders sending them in different directionsThen he laid iron thorns along all the approaches and planted thorny barriers as if making a permanent defenseWhen the troops of Wei came up and challenged the troops of Shu refused battleThe scouts reported to Sima Zhao The Shu supplies are coming up along the rear of Iron Cage Mountain and they are using the wooden oxen and running horses as transport They also reported the look of permanency in the defenses and said they were evidently awaiting the arrival of their allies the Qiang tribesThen said Sima Zhao to Xu Zhi We formerly defeated the army of Shu by cutting off supplies and we can do that againLet five thousand troops go out tonight and occupy the road About the middle of the first watch Xu Zhi marched across the hills and when he came to the other side he saw a couple of hundred soldiers driving a hundred or so heads of mechanical animals laden with grain and forageHis army rushed down upon them with shouts and the troops of Shu seeing that their road was impassable abandoned their supplies and ran awayXu Zhi took possession of the supply train which he sent back to his own camp under the escort of half his troopsWith the other half he set out in pursuitAbout three miles away the road was found blocked with carts set across the trackSome of his soldiers dismounted to clear the way but as they did so the brushwood on both sides burst into a blazeXu Zhi at once drew off his force and turned to retire but coming to a defile he found the road again blocked with wagons and again the brushwood began to burnHe made a dash to escape but before he could get clear a bomb roared and he saw the troops of Shu coming down on him from two directionsLiao Hua and Zhang Yi from left and right fell on Xu Zhi with great fury and the troops of Wei were wholly defeated Xu Zhi himself got clear but without any following He struggled on till he and his steed were almost spent with fatigue Presently he saw another company of the enemy in his way and the leader was Jiang WeiBefore he could make any resistance Jiang Weis spear thrust him down and as Xu Zhi lay on the ground he was cut to pieces Meanwhile those troops of Wei who had been sent to escort to camp the convoy of supplies which they had seized were captured by Xiahou Ba They surrenderedXiahou Ba then stripped them of their weapons and clothing and therein disguised some of his own soldiersHolding aloft banners of Wei these disguised soldiers made for the Wei camp When they arrived they were mistaken by those in the camp for comrades and the gates were thrown openThey rushed in and began to slay Taken wholly by surprise Sima Zhao leaped upon his steed and fled But Liao Hua met him and drove him backThen appeared Jiang Wei in the path of retreat so that no road lay openSima Zhao made off for the hills hoping to be able to hold out on the Iron Cage MountainNow there was only one road up the hill which rose steeply on all sidesAnd the hill had but one small spring of water enough to serve a hundred people or so while Sima Zhaos force numbered six thousand Their enemies had blocked the only road of escape This one fountain was unequal to supplying the needs of the beleaguered army and soon they were tormented with thirstIn despair Sima Zhao looked up to heaven and sighed saying Death will surely come to me here The host of Wei on Iron Cage Mountain Were once fast held by Jiang Weis skill When Pang Juan first crossed the Maling Hills His strategy was reckoned fine As Xiang Yu at the Nine Mountains Both bent opponents to their willIn this critical situation a certain civil officer Wang Tao by name reminded his leader of what Geng Gong had done in ancient time saying O General why do you not imitate Geng Gong who being in great need prostrated himself and prayed at a well wherefrom he afterwards was supplied with sweet water So the leader went to the summit of the hill and knelt beside the spring and grayed thus The humble Sima Zhao received a command to repulse the army of Shu If he is to die here then may this spring cease its flow when he will end his own life and let his soldiers yield to the enemyBut if his allotted span of life be not reached then O Blue Vault increase the flow of water and save the lives of this multitude Thus he prayed and the waters gushed forth in plenty so that they all quenched their thirst and lived Jiang Wei had surrounded the hill holding the army thereon as in a prisonHe said to his officers I have always regretted that our great Prime Minister was unable to capture Sima Yi in the Gourd Valley but now I think his son is doomed to fall into our hands However news of the dangerous position of Sima Zhao had come to Guo Huai who set about a rescueChen Tai said to him Jiang Wei has made a league with the Qiangs and they have arrived to help himIf you go away to rescue Sima Zhao the Qiangs will attack from the rearTherefore I would propose to send some one to the tribespeople to try to create a diversion and get them to retireIf they are disposed of you may go to the rescue of Sima Zhao Guo Huai saw there was much reason in this and told Chen Tai to take a force of five thousand troops and go to the camp of the King of the Qiangs When Chen Tai reached the camp he threw off his armor and entered weeping and crying that he was in danger of death He said Guo Huai sets himself up as superior to everyone and is trying to slay me Therefore I have come to offer my services to youI know all the secrets of the Wei army and if you will this very night I can lead you to their campI have friends in the camp to help and you can destroy it King Mi Dang was taken with the scheme and sent his General Ehe Shaoge to go with Chen TaiThe deserters from Wei were placed in the rear but Chen Tai himself rode with the leading body of the QiangsThey set out at the second watch and soon arrivedThey found the gates open and Chen Tai rode in boldlyBut when Ehe Shaoge and his troops galloped in there suddenly arose a great cry as soldiers and horses went tumbling into great pits At the same time Chen Tai came round in the rear and attacked while Guo Huai appeared on the flankThe Qiangs trampled each other down and many were killed Those who escaped death surrendered and the leader Ehe Shaoge committed suicide in a pitGuo Huai and Chen Tai then hastened back into the camp of the Qiangs Mi Dang taken unprepared rushed out of his tent to get to horse but was made prisoner He was taken before Guo Huai who hastily dismounted loosed the prisoners bonds and soothed him with kindly words Our government has always regarded you as a loyal and true friend said Guo HuaiWhy then are you helping our enemies Mi Dang sank to the ground in confusion while Guo Huai continued If you will now raise the siege of Iron Cage Mountain and drive off the troops of Shu I will memorialize the Throne and obtain a substantial reward for you Mi Dang agreedHe set out forthwith his own army leading and the army of Wei in the rearAt the third watch he sent on a messenger to tell Jiang Wei of his coming And the Shu leader was gladMi Dang was invited to enterOn the march the soldiers of Wei had mingled with the Qiangs and many of them were in the forefront of the armyMi Dang went up toward the gate with a small company and Jiang Wei with Xiahou Ba went to welcome himJust as they met before Mi Dang could say a word the Wei generals dashed on past him and set on to slayJiang Wei was taken aback leaped on his steed and fled while the mixed force of troops of Wei and Qiangs drove the camp defenders before them and sent them flyingWhen Jiang Wei leaped upon his steed at the gate he had no weapon in his hand only his bow and quiver hung at his shoulderIn his hasty flight the arrows fell out and the quiver was empty so when he set off for the hills with Guo Huai in pursuit Jiang Wei had nothing to oppose to the spears of his pursuersAs they came near he laid hands upon his bow and made as if to shoot The string twanged and Guo Huai blenched But as no arrow went flying by Guo Huai knew Jiang Wei had none to shoot Guo Huai therefore hung his spear took his bow and shotJiang Wei caught the arrow as it flew by and fitted it to his bowstringHe waited till Guo Huai came quite near when he pulled the string with all his force and sent the arrow flying straight at Guo Huais face Guo Huai fell even as the bowstring sangJiang Wei pulled up and turned to finish his fallen enemy but the soldiers of Wei were nearly upon him and he had only time to snatch up Guo Huais spear and ride offNow that Jiang Wei was armed and their own leader wounded the soldiers of Wei had no more desire to fight They picked up their general and carried him to camp There the arrowhead was pulled out but the flow of blood could not be stanched and Guo Huai diedSima Zhao descended from the hill as soon as Jiang Wei moved away and pursued some distance before returningXiahou Ba forced his way out and rejoined Jiang Wei as soon as he could and they marched away together The losses of Shu in this defeat were very heavyOn the road they dared not halt to muster or reform but went helterskelter into HanzhongIn that campaign though the Shu army were defeated they had killed Xu Zhi and Guo Huai on the other side and had damaged the prestige of Wei Thus Jiang Weis achievement made up for his offenseAfter rewarding the Qiangs for their help Sima Zhao led his army back to Luoyang where he joined his brother Sima Shi in administering the governmentThey were too strong for any of the officers to dare opposition and they terrorized Cao Fang the Ruler of Wei so that he shook with fright whenever he saw Sima Shi at court and felt as if needles were being stuck into his backOne day when the Ruler of Wei was holding a court Sima Shi came into the hall wearing his sword Cao Fang hastily left his Dragon Throne to receive him What does this meanIs this the correct etiquette for a prince when his minister approaches said Sima Shi smilingI pray Your Majesty remember your dignity and listen while the ministers address the Throne Court business then proceededSima Shi decided every question without reference to the Ruler of Wei and when Sima Shi retired he stalked haughtily down the hall and went home followed by his escort which numbered thousands of horse and footWhen the Ruler of Wei left the court only three followed him to the private apartments They were Minister Xiahou Xuan Secretary Li Feng and High Minister Zhang Qi Zhang Qi was the father of his consort Empress ZhangSending away the servants Cao Fang and these three went into a private chamberSeizing his fatherinlaws hand Cao Fang began to weep saying That man Sima Shi treats me as a child and regards the officers of state as if they were so many strawsI am sure the throne will be his one day And he wept bitterlySaid Li Feng Do not be so sad SireI am but a poor sort of person but if Your Majesty will give me authority I will call together all the bold people in the country and slay this man It was from fear of this man that my brother Xiahou Ba was forced to go over to Shu said Xiahou XuanIf Sima Shi were destroyed my brother could returnI belong to a family related to the rulers of the state for many generations and I cannot sit still while a wretch ruins the governmentPut my name in the command as well and we will work together to remove him But I am afraid we can not overcome him said Cao FangThey wept and said We pledge ourselves to work together for the destruction of the tyrant and to show our gratitude to Your Majesty Cao Fang them stripped himself of his innermost garment gnawed his finger till the blood flowed and with his fingertip traced a command in bloodHe gave it to his fatherinlaw Zhang Qi saying My ancestor the Emperor Cao put to death Dong Cheng for just such a matter as this so you must be exceedingly careful and maintain the greatest secrecy Oh why use such illomened words cried Li FengWe are not like Dong Cheng and Sima Shi cannot compare to the FounderHave no doubts The three conspirators took leave and went out carrying the edict with them Beside the Donghua Gate of the palace they saw Sima Shi coming to meet them wearing a sword Following him were many armed guardsThe three ministers took the side of the road to let the party go byWhy are you three so late in leaving the Palace asked Sima ShiHis Majesty was reading and we stayed with him said Li FengWhat was he reading The histories of the Xia Shang and Zhou dynasties What questions did the Emperor ask as he read those books He asked about Yi Yin and how he upheld the Shang and the Duke of Zhou how he acted when he was regentAnd we told His Majesty that you were both Yi Yin and Duke Zhou to him Sima Shi smiled grimly and said Why did you compare me with those two when in your hearts you think me a rebel like Wang Mang and Dong Zhuo How should we dare when we are your subordinates said the three ministersYou are a lot of flatterers said Sima Shi angrilyAnd what were you crying about in that private chamber with the Emperor We did no such thing Your eyes are still red you cannot deny that Xiahou Xuan then knew that the secrecy had been showed so he broke out into a volley of abuse crying Well we were crying because of your conduct because you terrorize over the Emperor and are scheming to usurp the Throne Seize him roared Sima ShiXiahou Xuan threw back his sleeves and struck at Sima Shi with his fists but the lictors pulled him backThen the three were searched and on Zhang Qi was found the bloodstained garment of the EmperorThey handed it to their chief who recognized the object of his search the secret edictIt said The two Sima brothers have stolen away all my authority and are plotting to take the ThroneThe edicts I have been forced to issue do not represent my wishes and hereby all officers civil and military may unite to destroy these two and restore the authority of the ThroneThese ends achieved I will reward those who help to accomplish them Sima Shi more angry than ever said So you wish to destroy me and my brotherThis is too much He ordered his followers to execute the three on the public ground by waistbisection and to destroy their whole clansThe three reviled without ceasingOn the way to the place of execution they ground their teeth with rage spitting out the pieces they broke off They died muttering cursesSima Shi then went to the rear apartments of the palace where he found the Emperor talking with his ConsortJust as he entered she was saying to the Emperor The palace is full of spies and if this comes out it will mean trouble for me Sima Shi strode in sword in handMy father placed Your Majesty on the throne a service no less worthy than that of Duke Zhou I have served Your Majesty as Yi Yin served his masterNow is kindness met by enmity and service regarded as a fault Your Majesty has plotted with two or three insignificant officials to slay me and my brotherWhy is this I had no such intention said Cao FangIn reply Sima Shi drew the garment from his sleeve and threw it on the groundWho did this Cao Fang was overwhelmed his soul flew beyond the skies his spirit lied to the ninth heaven Shaking with fear he said I was forced into itHow could I think of such a thing To slander ministers by charging them with rebellion is an aggravated crime said Sima ShiCao Fang knelt at his feet saying Yes I am guilty forgive me I beg Your Majesty to rise the laws must be respected Pointing to Empress Zhang Sima Shi said She is of the Zhang house and must die Spare her cried Cao Fang weeping bitterly But Sima Shi was obdurateHe bade the lictors lead her away and she was strangled with a white silk cord at the palace gate Now I recall another year and lo An empress borne away to shameful deathBarefooted weeping bitterly she shrieks Farewell torn from her consorts armsHistory repeats itself times instrument Sima Shi avenges this on Cao Caos heirsThe day after these events Sima Shi assembled all the officers and addressed them thus Our present lord is profligate and devoid of principle familiar with the vile and friendly with the impure He lends a ready ear to slander and keeps good people at a distance His faults exceed those of Prince Changyi of old and he has proved himself unfit to ruleWherefore following the precedents of Yi Yin and Huo Guang I have decided to put him aside and to set up another thereby to maintain the sanctity of the ruler and ensure tranquillityWhat think you Sirs They all agreed saying General you are right to play the same part as Yi Yin and Huo Guang thereby acting in accordance with Heaven and fulfilling the desire of humankindWho dares dispute it Then Sima Shi followed by the whole of the officials went to the Palace of Everlasting Peace and informed the Empress Dowager of his intentionWhom do you propose to place on the throne General she askedI have observed that Cao Ju Prince of Pengcheng is intelligent benevolent and filial he is fit to rule the empire She replied He is my uncle and it is not convenientHowever there is Cao Mao Duke of Gaogui and grandson of Emperor PiHe is of mild temperament respectful and deferential and may be set upYou Sir and the high officers of state might favorably consider this Then spoke one saying Her Majesty speaks well Cao Mao should be raised to the throne All eyes turned toward the speaker who was Sima Fu uncle of Sima ShiThe Duke of Gaogui was summoned to the capitalThe Empress called Cao Fang into her presence in the Hall of Principles and blamed him saying You are vicious beyond measure a companion of lewd men and a friend of vile womenYou are unfitted to rule Therefore resign the imperial seal and revert to your status of Prince of Qi You are forbidden to present yourself at court without special command Cao Fang weeping threw himself at her feet He gave up the seal got into his carriage and went awayOnly a few faithful ministers restrained their tears and bade him farewellCao Cao the mighty minister of Han Oppressed the helpless little then thought he That only two score swiftly passing years Would bring like fate to his posterityThe Emperorelect Cao Mao was the grandson of Emperor Pi and son of Cao Lin Prince of DonghaiWhen Cao Mao he was nearing the capital all the officers attended to receive him at the Nanye Gate where an imperial carriage awaited himHe hastily returned their salutationsThe ruler ought not to return these salutations said Wang Su one of the officersI also am a minister and must respond replied heThey conducted him to the carriage to ride into the palace but he refused to mount it saying Her Majesty has commanded my presence I know not for what reason How dare I enter the Palace in such a carriage He went on foot to the Hall where Sima Shi awaited him He prostrated himself before Sima ShiSima Shi hastily raised him and led him into the presenceThe Empress Dowager said In your youth I noticed that you bore the impress of majestyNow you are to be the Ruler of the Empire You must be respectful and moderate diffusing virtue and benevolence You must do honor to your ancestorsthe former emperors Cao Mao modestly declined the proposed honor but he was compelled to accept itHe was led out of the presence of the Empress Dowager and placed in the seat of empire in the Hall of Principles The style of the reign was changed from Domestic Calm the sixth year to Right Origin the first year  An amnesty was granted Honors were heaped upon Sima Shi who also received the golden axes with the right to proceed leisurely within the precincts to address the Throne without using his name and to wear arms at courtMany other officers also received promotionsBut in the spring of the second year of Right Origin it was reported at court that Guanqiu Jian General Who Guards the East and Wen Qin Imperial Protector of Yangzhou were raising armies with the declared design of restoring the deposed emperorSima Shi disconcertedIf ministers of Han have always faithful been Wei leaders too prove their loyalty are keenHow this new menace was met will appear in the next chapter CHAPTER Riding Alone Wen Yang Repulses A Brave Force Following The River Jiang Wei Defeats The Enemy It has been said that in the second year of Right Origin  Guanqiu Jian of the South of River Huai General Who Guards the East was commanding the forces in River Huai when he heard the news Sima Shi deposed Cao FangHe was moved to great anger and his eldest son Guanqiu Dian fomented his fathers wrath saying Father you are chief of all this region With this Sima Shi in such a position the country is in danger and you cannot sit still and look on My son you speak well replied Guanqiu JianWhereupon he requested Wen Qin Imperial Protector of Yangzhou to come and consult with himThis Wen Qin had been a client of Cao Shuangs and he hastened at the call of the generalWhen he arrived he was led into the private apartments and the salutations at an end the two began to talk over the situation Presently the host began to weep and his visitor asked the cause of his tears Think you that this conduct of Sima Shi does not tear my heartHe has deposed the Emperor and now holds in his grip all authority of the stateThings are all upside down Wen Qin replied You are the chief of this region If you are willing to play the part you ought to take arms and slay this rebel I will help you regardless of consequencesMy second son Wen Yang is a good warrior and a man of great valor Moreover he hates Sima Shi and wishes to avenge on the Sima brothers the death of Cao ShuangHe would make an excellent leader of the van Guanqiu Jian was delighted to get such ready and willing support and the two poured a libation in pledge of mutual good faithThen pretending that they held an edict from the Empress Dowager they summoned all the officers to Shouchun where they built an altar on the west side and sacrificed a white horse smearing their lips with its blood in token of their oath They made this declaration Sima Shi is a rebel and devoid of rectitudeWe have a secret edict commanding us to muster the forces of the South of River Huai and put down this rebellion Thus supported Guanqiu Jian led sixty thousand troops to Xiangcheng where he camped while his fellowconspirator Wen Qin took twenty thousand troops to the front to go to and fro lending help where it was neededLetters were sent all through the counties and territories calling for assistanceNow that mole below the left eye of Sima Shi used to pain at times and he decided to have it removed The surgeon excised it closed and dressed the wound and the patient rested quietly in his palace till it should healIt was at this time that he received the disquieting news of opposition to his authority Whereupon he called in Commander Wang Su to discuss the matter Said Wang Su quoting Guan Yu as an example When Guan Yu was most famous Sun Quan sent Lu Meng to capture Jingzhou What did Lu Meng do He first won over the officers of Guan Yu by taking care of their families and thus broke the power of his enemy like a tile Now the families of all the officers in the South of River Huai are here in the Middle LandTreat them well at the same time taking care that they do not get away and you will be irresistible Your words are good said Sima ShiHowever I cannot go out to war till I have recoveredYet to send another is to take great risks and I shall feel insecure There was also present Secretary Zhong Hui who here interposed saying The forces of the South of River Huai and Chu are very formidableIf you send another there is danger whatever happens and if your leader makes a serious mistake your whole policy will fail No one but myself can succeed cried Sima Shi starting from his couchI must go So in spite of illness he resolved to lead in person He left his brother in charge of affairs at Luoyang and set out traveling in a padded carriageZhuge Dan General Who Guards the East was given command over all the forces of Yuzhou and ordered to march from Anfeng and to take possession of ShouchunHu Zun General Who Conquers the East with the Qingzhou forces was sent to bar any retreat at QiaosongWang Ji Imperial Protector of Yuzhou and Army Inspector was sent to capture ChennanTo his camp at Xiangyang Sima Shi summoned all his officers to a council Zheng Mao spoke first saying Guanqiu Jian is fond of laying plans but slow to come to any decisionHis fellowconspirator Wen Qin is bold but imprudentNow this scheme of theirs is too large for their minds but as their soldiers are full of spirit they should not be engaged lightlyWe should remain on the defensive till their ardor has burned outThis is what Zhou Yafu of old time did But Wang Ji objected saying This is not a rising of the people nor of the soldiers but is the work of Guanqiu Jian The people are merely his tools and cannot help themselvesThe rebellion will go to pieces as soon as an army approaches the county I agree with you replied Sima ShiThen he advanced upon River Ying and camped by the bridgeWang Ji said The city of Nandun is an excellent camping ground occupy it at once for if not the enemy will do so Sima Shi sent Wang Ji to carry out his own planReports of these movements of the enemy came to Guanqiu Jian in Xiangcheng and an assembly of officers was calledThe Leader of the Van Ge Yong said Nandun is an excellent site for a camp with a river beside it and hills at the rearIf the Wei armies camp there we shall be unable to dislodge themLet us occupy it So the army set out But before they drew near the scouts reported a camp already thereIt was incredible and Guanqiu Jian rode to the front to reconnoiterHe was convinced by the sight of flags and banners over all the plain fluttering above an orderly array of tents and hutsThe sight disconcerted him and he rode back to the main body not knowing what to do Just then a scout came in to saySun Jun of Wu has crossed the river to attack Shouchun If we lose that city we shall have no base cried Guanqiu JianThat same night he retreated upon XiangchengSeeing the enemy retreat Sima Shi called together his officers to talk it overHigh Minister Fu Gu who was of the expedition said The retirement to Xiangcheng was obviously due to Wus threatened attack upon Shouchun General you should send three armies to attack upon Xiangcheng Lojia and ShouchunThe Imperial Protector of Yanzhou Deng Ai is a man of tactics he should be sent against LojiaOur main army will reinforce them His plan was acceptable to Sima Shi who sent letters to Yanzhou telling Deng Ai to march against Lojia where Sima Shi himself would soon meet himCamped at Xiangcheng Guanqiu Jian sent spies to Lojia to see what might be happening there for he feared it would be attackedWhen he spoke of his fears to Wen Qin the latter said General you need not be anxious My son Wen Yang and I will answer for its safetyGive us but five thousand troops Father and son with the five thousand troops went to Lojia Before the main body arrived it was seen that Wei banners were flying on the west of the cityBy and by they made out that the leader was no other than Sima Shi himself with more than ten thousand troopsHis camp was forming rapidly but was not yet complete When this was reported to Wen Qin his son Wen Yang bearing his famous whip of steel was by his fathers side We should attack before they have settled down in camp Father said he Let us go quickly and attack on two sides When can we start said the father Tonight at dusk You lead half the force round by the south and I will march the other half round by the north and we will meet in the third watch at the Wei camp The youth who propounded this plan was then eighteen tall and strong He wore complete armor and carried at his waist a steel whipWhen the hour came to start he took his spear swung himself into the saddle and set outThat night Sima Shi who had arrived and had at once set about settling into camp lay on a couch in his tent for he was still suffering pain from the surgery wound beneath his eye The tent was surrounded by several hundred armored guards Deng Ai had not arrivedAbout the third watch Sima Shi heard a great shouting and asked what it was One replied An army has come round from the north and burst into the lines The leader is too bold for anyone to face Sima Shi became much troubledHis heart burned within him and the excitement caused the wound to open so that the eyeball protruded and blood flowed freely The pain became intense nearly unbearableIn his agony and alarm lest his army should be thrown into confusion he lay gnawing the bed clothes till they were in ragsWen Yangs force lost no time but attacked as soon as it arrived He dashed into the camp slashing and thrusting right and left and everyone gave way before himIf anyone stayed to oppose the sharp spear or the terrible whip did its work and that one fellBut after a time seeing no sign of his father Wen Yang grew anxiousAnd he had to retire several times before the fierce flights of arrows and crossbow bolts as he tried to reach the main tentAbout daylight he heard shouts and thought they must mean the arrival of his father with helpBut the shouting came from the north and his father was to arrive by the south road He galloped out to get a clearer view and saw a force sweeping down like a gale of wind It was not his father but a body of the enemy and the leader was Deng Ai Deng Ai rode forward shouting Rebel flee not Wen Yang had no intention to fleeSetting his spear he rode savagely toward his opponentThey engaged and fought half a hundred bouts without either gaining the advantageThen the duel still raging the Wei army attacked in full force and Wen Yangs troops began to give way and run so that soon he found himself alone However he got clear of the fight and went away southBut he was pursued for more than a hundred Wei generals plucked up courage to follow when he ran awayThey pressed on his heels till near the Lojia Bridge when it seemed that they must catch himThen he suddenly pulled up his steed turned and rode in among them flogging with the terrible steel whip and wherever it struck there lay warriors and horses in confused heapsSo they left him and he retook his way in peaceThen the Wei generals met and said Lo Here is a man who has driven us all backwardBut we are many and may not suffer that Wherefore they reformed and once again took up pursuitYou fools cried Wen Yang as he saw them coming onHave you then no regard for your lives Again he fell upon them with the steel whip and slew many so that the survivors retreated But yet again they found courage to come on and yet again but they had to fall back before the lash of that terrible whipDefiance hurled at Cao Caos mighty host Arrayed near Long Slope proclaimed Zhao Yun A valiant man and peerless stood he tillAt Lojia another hero faced Alone another host and Wen Yangs name Was added to the roll of famous peopleWen Qin never reached the appointed rendezvous In the darkness he lost his way among the precipices and gullies whence he only got out as day dawnedHe saw all the signs of a fight and a victory for Wei but could not discover whither his son had gone So he returned without fighting and in spite of pursuit made his way safely to Shouchun Now Minister Yin Damu had accompanied Sima Shi on his expedition but was no friend of his He had been of the Cao Shuangs party and bitterly resented the death of his patron He was watching for a chance to avenge himSeeing that Sima Shi was ill he thought to secure his end by making friends with Wen QinSo he went in to see the sick Sima Shi and said Wen Qin had no sincere intention to rebel but was led astray by Guanqiu JianIf you will let me go and speak with him he will come over to you at once Sima Shi said he might go to try and Yin Damu put on his armor and rode after Wen Qin By and by he got near enough to shout Do you not recognize me I am Yin Damu Wen Qin stopped and looked backYin Damu removed his helmet that his face might be clearly seen and said O Imperial Protector why can you not bear up for a few days Yin Damu implied that Sima Shi was very near death and he wished Wen Qin to remain at handBut Wen Qin did not understand He abused Yin Damu and even threatened that the bowmen should shoot and Yin Damu could only sorrowfully turn awayWhen Wen Qin reached Shouchun and found it occupied by Zhuge Dan he tried for XiangchengBut three armies under Hu Zun Wang Ji and Deng Ai came up and attacked at once so that it seemed impossible that his army could hold out longSo he decided to flee to Wu and serve Sun JunGuanqiu Jian then behind the walls of Xiangcheng heard that Shouchun had fallen that his fellowconspirator Wen Qin had failed and with three armies against his city knew that his case was desperate He mustered all the forces in the city and marched out to try his fortune As he went forth he fell in with Deng AiHe bade Ge Yong go out to fight but Ge Yong fell in the first encounter cut down by Deng Ai himselfThe enemy came on in forceGuanqiu Jian fought gallantly but his army fell into confusion Then two other armies under Wang Ji and Hu Zun came up and he was completely surroundedNothing could be done and he fled from the field with a dozen riders and made for ShenHere Governor Song Bai received him kindly and comforted him with a feast At the banquet Guanqiu Jian drowned his sorrows in the wine cup till he was helpless when he was slain by his hostHis head was sent to the Wei army as proof of his death and the rising came to an endPeace was restored in the South of River Huai Sima Shi grew worseRecovery being hopeless he called Zhuge Dan to his tent and gave him a seal and conferred upon him the title of General Who Conquers the East with command of all the forces in Yangzhou and soon after the army marched back to Xuchang The sick man began to have visionsNight after night he was troubled by the apparitions of the three courtiersZhang Qi Li Feng and Xiahou Xuan he had put to death and he knew that his end was nearHe sent for his brother Sima Zhao who came and wept by his couch while he listened to his elder brothers last commands The responsibility of power is heavy but we must bear it there is no possible reliefYou must continue my plans and maintain my policy yourself and you must be exceedingly careful how you entrust any other with power lest you bring about the destruction of our whole clan Then Sima Shi handed the seal of office to Sima Zhao weeping the whileSima Zhao would ask some questions still but with a deep groan as his eye popped out Sima Shi diedIt was the second month of the second year of Right Origin Sima Zhao put on mourning for his brother and informed the Ruler of Wei Cao Mao of the deathBy special edict Sima Zhao was ordered to remain at Xuchang so as to guard against any attack from WuThis order was unpleasing to its recipient but he felt doubtful what to doSima Zhao took counsel with Zhong Hui who said The death of your brother has disturbed the country and if you remain here some shifting of power at the capital will surely work to your disadvantageIt will be too late for regrets then Wherefore Sima Zhao left Xuchang and camped on River LuoThis move alarmed Cao MaoThen Wang Su advised saying Sima Zhao has succeeded the office of his late brotherIt is well that Your Majesty should placate him with a new title So Cao Mao sent Wang Su with an edict creating Sima Zhao Regent Marshal with control of the SecretariatSima Zhao came to Luoyang to thank the Emperor for these honors and stayedHenceforward all matters and the whole government were under Sima Zhaos handWhen news of these things came to Chengdu Jiang Wei thought the time had come to make another bid for the empire so he wrote a memorial to the king Sima Shi having just died his brother Sima Zhao who succeeds will be unable to leave Luoyang until he has consolidated his positionWherefore I crave permission to attack Wei The Latter Ruler agreed and bade him raise an armySo he went into Hanzhong to prepare for the expeditionHowever Zhang Yi General Who Conquers the West was opposed to the expedition and said Shu is not a big country and its resources are not too abundant Thus a far expedition should be avoided The state policy should rather be the improvement of conditions at homeThinking well for the soldiers and the people is the way to preserve the country You are mistaken said Jiang WeiBefore our great Minister Zhuge Liang emerged from his reed hut in the wilds and undertook the affairs of a state the three kingdoms were already a fact Six times he led armies to try to gain the northern portion of the empire but failed to attain his desireUnhappily he died leaving his design unaccomplishedBut he bequeathed to me the legacy of his intention and I must be a loyal and worthy executor If I die in the attempt I will perish without regretNow is our opportunity and if we miss it shall we find a better What you say is the real truth said Xiahou BaLet us send first some light horse out by Baohan to capture Nanan and thereby settle that county Then said Zhang Yi Procrastination and delay have been hitherto the causes of our failureWe ought to obey the precepts of the books of war strike where the enemy is unprepared and appear where he does not expect usA rapid march and a sudden blow will find Wei unready and we shall succeed So Jiang Wei led an army of fifty thousand troops out by BaohanWhen he reached River Yao the spies reported his arrival to Wang Jing Imperial Protector of Yongzhou who led out seventy thousand troops against himJiang Wei gave certain orders to Zhang Yi and Xiahou Ba and after they had marched he drew up the main body by River YaoWang Jing rode out to parleyWu Shu and Wei are now actually established as a tripod why then have you invaded our borders these many times Jiang Wei replied Because Sima Shi deposed hid prince without cause and it behooves the neighboring countries to punish such a crimeMoreover your country is a rival state Then Wang Jing turned and said to four of his generals Zhang Ming Hua Yong Liu Da and Zhu Fang You see that the enemy is drawn up with a river at his back so that his troops must conquer or drownThough Jiang Wei is bold you four can fight him at the same time and pursue if he retires The four rode out two and twoJiang Wei stood through a few encounters but then moved backward toward his campAt this Wang Jing led on his main body to smiteJiang Wei fled toward the riverAs he drew near he shouted Danger O GeneralsNow do your utmost His generals turned on the foe and fought with such vigor that the Wei army was defeated and as they turned away Zhang Yi and Xiahou Ba fell upon their rearSoon the Wei army was hemmed in and Jiang Wei rushed in among the host of Wei and threw them into utter confusion They trod each other down in the press and many fell into the river Dead bodies lay about over several milesWang Jing and a hundred horsemen forced their way out and fled to Didao where they entered within the walls and barred the gatesAfter Jiang Wei had rewarded and feasted his army he was for attacking Didao but Zhang Yi was against thisGeneral you have won a great victory which will bring you fameIf you attempt more things may go astray and you will only add legs to your sketch of a serpent Said Jiang Wei When our army were defeated not long ago they still desired to overrun the whole northNow our opponents have been overcome and that has broken the spirit of their army and this city can be easily capturedDo not damp the spirit of my soldiers So it was decided to attack DidaoChen Tai General Who Conquers the West and Commander of Yongzhou was just about to set out to avenge the defeat of Wang Jing when Deng Ai Imperial Protector of Yanzhou arrived with his armyChen Tai welcomed him and when Deng Ai had said he had come by imperial edict to assist to defeat the army of Shu Chen Tai asked his plansDeng Ai replied They are victors on River Yao If they enlist the aid of the Qiangs to cause a diversion in Longyou and Guanzhong and also obtain the support of the four counties it will be a misfortune for us If they do not think of that but try to take Didao they will only fritter away their energies against a place too strongly fortified for them to captureLet us now array our force along the Xiangling Mountain and then we can advance and smite themWe shall get a victory That is well said cried Chen TaiThen twenty cohorts of fifty soldiers each were told off to find their way secretly to the southeast of Didao and there hide in the valleysThey were then to display many ensigns and sound trumpets as if they were a very large force and make huge fires at night so as to cause anxiety among the enemyAnd thus they waited for the troops of Shu to come while Chen Tai and Deng Ai marched with forty thousand troops against the Shu army The army of Shu had marched to Didao and begun the siege around the whole circuit of the wallsAt the end of many days the fall of the city seemed no nearer and Jiang Wei began to fret He could think of no plan likely to succeedOne eventide a horseman came in to report the approach of two armies and the names on the banners were Chen Tai and Deng AiJiang Wei called in his colleague Xiahou Ba who said I have spoken to you of Deng Ai many timesHe is perspicacious valiant resourceful and has always delighted in the study of military topographyAs he is coming we shall have to put forth all our energies Jiang Wei replied We will attack before he can get a foothold and while his soldiers are fatigued with the march So Zhang Yi was left to carry on the siege while the two leaders went out to meet the new armiesJiang Wei went against Deng Ai and Xiahou Ba against Chen TaiBefore Jiang Wei had marched far the stillness was broken by the roar of a bomb and at once all about the Shu army arose the rolling of drums and the blare of trumpets soon followed by flames that shot up to the very skyJiang Wei rode to the front and saw the ensigns of Wei all about himI have fallen into a trap set by Deng Ai cried heHe sent orders to Xiahou Ba and Zhang Yi to withdraw immediately while he would cover their retreat When they had retired he followed them into Hanzhong harassed all along the road by the sounds of marching soldiers and glimpses of enemy bannersBut these enemies never attacked and it was only after the army had retreated to Saber Pass that Jiang Wei knew all this was makebelieveHe camped in ZhongtiFor his services and success on River Yao Jiang Wei was rewarded with the rank of Regent MarshalAs soon as the ceremonies connected with his promotion were ended he began again to talk of an expedition against WeiRemember enough is as good as a feast Having sketched a good snake dont add legs to the beast And in fighting remember that others are bold And tigers have claws though their teeth may be oldThe result of the new expedition will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER Deng Ai Outwits Jiang Wei Zhuge Dan Rises Up Against Sima Zhao Jiang Wei camped at Zhongti The army of Wei camped outside DidaoWang Jing welcomed Chen Tai and Deng Ai and prepared a banquet to celebrate the raising of the siege and also rewarded the army with giftsThen Chen Tai sent up a memorial to the Ruler of Wei Cao Mao eulogizing the magnificent services of Deng Ai who was rewarded with the title General Who Pacifies the West For the time Deng Ai was left in the west He and Chen Tai placed their men in cantonments in Yongzhou Xizhou and the counties round aboutAfter Deng Ai had rendered his thanks to the Emperor Chen Tai spread a great feast in his honor and in congratulating his guest said Jiang Wei slipped off in the night because he was broken and he will never dare to return I think he will replied Deng Ai smilingI can give five reasons why he should What are they First although the soldiers of Shu have retired they have the selfpossessed and confident look of holding the victory our soldiers are really weak and brokenSecond the soldiers of Shu were trained and inspirited by Zhuge Liang and are easy to mobilize our generals are all of different periods of service and our army indifferently trainedThird the Shu soldiers often use boats for traveling ours do all their journeys on land so that while one army moves at leisure and the troops arrive fresh those of the other arrive fatigued with marchingFourth again Didao Longxi Nanan and Qishan are all places suitable for defense or use as battle fields and thus the army of Shu can conceal their intentions and strike where they will we have to remain on guard at many points thus dividing our forcesWhen they concentrate they have only to reckon with a part of our forceAnd fifth if they come out by way of Longxi and Nanan they have the grain of the Qiangs to depend upon and if they choose Qishan they have the wheat thereThese are the five reasons why they should make another expedition Chen Tai was overcome with the clear vision of his new colleagueSir your foresight is godlike I think we need feel no anxiety about what the enemy can achieve The two leaders became the best of friends in spite of the difference of ageDeng Ai spent his time in training the army and garrisons were placed at all points where surprise attacks seemed possibleThere was feasting also at Zhongti and the occasion was taken to discuss a new attack on Wei But Fan Jian opposedGeneral your expeditions have partly failed many times you have never scored a complete victoryBut now on River Yao the army of Wei recognize your superiority and why should you try againThere is small chance of success and you risk all you have gained Jiang Wei replied You all regard only the largeness and population of Wei and the time necessary for conquest but you do not see five reasons for victory The assembly asked what these wereFirst the fighting spirit of the soldiers of Wei has been badly broken on River Yao while that of our soldiers although we retired is unimpairedIf we attack we shall certainly succeed Second our soldiers can travel in boats and so will not be wearied with marching their soldiers have to march to meet usThird our soldiers are thoroughly trained theirs are recruits a mere flock of crows quite undisciplinedFourth when we go out by Qishan we can seize upon the autumn wheat for foodFinally they are scattered having to defend various points while we can concentrate on any point we wish and they will find it difficult to bring up reinforcementsIf we miss this chance can we hope for a better Xiahou Ba said Deng Ai is young but he is deep and craftyHe has certainly taken great pains to secure the regions under his charge as General Who Pacifies the WestVictory will not be so easy as it was before Why should I fear him cried Jiang Wei angrilyYou should not laud the spirit of the enemy and belittle that of our own soldiersBut in any case I have made up my mind and shall take Longxi No one dared to offer any further oppositionJiang Wei himself led the first army the others followed in due order and thus the soldiers of Shu marched out of Zhongti to QishanBefore they could reach Qishan the scouts reported the hills already occupied by the armies of WeiJiang Wei rode forward to verify this and surely enough he saw the Wei camps nine in number stretching over the hills like a huge serpent and all arranged to give each other supportXiahou Ba spoke only too well said heThe plan of those camps is excellent and only our Zhuge Liang could have laid them out with equal skill Returning to his own army he said to his officers They must have known of my coming and I think Deng Ai is here tooNow from this as base you are to send out daily small reconnoitering parties showing my banner but different flags and uniforms blue yellow red white and black in turnsWhile you are thus distracting attention I will lead the main army by Dongting to attack Nanan Bao Su was sent to camp at the mouth of the Qishan Mountain Valley while the main army marchedAs soon as Deng Ai had heard that the enemy would come out at Qishan he had camped there with his colleague Chen Tai But when days had passed without anyone coming to fling a challenge he sent out spies to find out where the Shu army was lurkingThey could find nothing and so Deng Ai went to the summit of a hill to look aroundHe came to the conclusion saying Jiang Wei must not be in this camp He must be on his way to capture NananThose soldiers in the Shu camp were nothing but a feint accentuated by the daily change of uniformGoing to and fro for days the horses look tired and their leaders are certainly none of the ablest Therefore General I advise an attack here If that succeeds the Dongting road can be occupied and Jiang Wei will be unable to retreat I think I ought to try to relieve NananI will go by the Wucheng Mountain and if I occupy that the enemy will try to take ShangguiNear that place is a narrow and precipitous valley called Block Valley just the place for an ambush where I shall lie in wait till Jiang Wei comes to take the Wucheng Mountain Chen Tai replied I have been here over twenty years and have never known so much of the military possibilities of the placeYou are very wonderful and must carry out your plan So Deng Ai marched toward Nanan by double marchesSoon they came to the Wucheng Mountain where they camped without oppositionHe sent his son Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan each leading five thousand troops to lie in wait in the Block Valley and not to betray their presenceIn the meantime Jiang Wei was marching between Dongting and Nanan Near the Wucheng Mountain he turned to Xiahou Ba and said That hill is our point and Nanan is closeI fear lest the artful Deng Ai may seize and fortify it They hastened anxious to reach the hill before the enemy But it was not to bePresently they heard the roar of bombs and the beating of drums and then flags and banners appeared all of WeiAnd among them fluttered the leaders standard bearing the name Deng Ai This was a sad disappointmentThe army of Shu halted and veteran soldiers of Wei came rushing down from various points on the hill too many for the troops of Shu to drive back So the advance guard was defeatedJiang Wei went to their help with his central body but when he got near the soldiers of Wei had retreated up to the hillJiang Wei went on to the foot of the hill and challenged but no one came out to accept The soldiers of Shu began to shout abuse and kept it up till late in the day but they failed to provoke a fightAs the army of Shu began to retire the Wei drums beat furiously yet no one appearedJiang Wei turned about to ascend the hill but its defenders prevented that by stones thrown from above He hung on till the third watch when he tried againBut he failed Thereupon he went down the hill and halted bidding his soldiers build a barricade of wood and boulders The troops of Wei came on again and the Shu troops scrambled to run to the old campNext day Jiang Wei brought up many transport wagons and placed them on the slope as the nucleus of a campBut in the night a number of Wei troops came down with torches and set fire to them A fight ensued which lasted till dawnSeeing that a camp could not be made there Jiang Wei retired to consider new plans with Xiahou BaSince we cannot take Nanan our next best plan is to try for Shanggui which is the storehouse of Nanan Leaving Xiahou Ba on the hill Jiang Wei led a force of veteran soldiers and bold officers along the road toward ShangguiThey marched all night and dawn found them in a deep valley which the guides said was Block ValleyThat sounds too much like Cutoff Valley said Jiang WeiAnd if a force held the mouth we should be in sorry straits While hesitating whether to advance farther or not the leading troops came back to say they had seen a cloud of dust beyond the hills which seemed to indicate a body of soldiers in hiding So the order was given to retire At that moment the armies under Shi Zuan and Deng Zhong came out and attackedJiang Wei alternately fighting and retreating tried to get away Then Deng Ai himself appeared and the Shu army had enemies on three sidesThey were in grave danger but Xiahou Ba came to their rescue and so Jiang Wei escapedJiang Wei proposed to return to Qishan but Xiahou Ba said We cannot go thither for Chen Tai has destroyed the force under Bao Su and he himself was killed All that was left of that army has gone back into Hanzhong It was no longer a question of taking the Dongting road Jiang Wei sought out byroads to march alongDeng Ai came in pursuit and as he pressed hard on the rear Jiang Wei sent the others on ahead while he covered the retreatSoon Chen Tai came out from the hills and Jiang Wei was surrounded by a shouting body of the enemy He fought all directions but could not clear the way He and his horse were very weary when Zhang Ni who had heard of his straits came to his rescue with a body of cavalryZhang Ni cut his way in and Jiang Wei immediately broke the siege and got outZhang Ni saved his general but lost his own life in the meleeFinally Jiang Wei got back into HanzhongFrom Hanzhong the death of Zhang Ni in battle was reported to the Latter Ruler who bestowed suitable honors upon his familyThe Shu people blamed Jiang Wei for the serious loss of life of their relatives in the military operations that had just failed and Jiang Wei following the precedent in Jieting of the late Lord of Wuxiang asked that he himself should be degraded in rank retaining however the command He was put back to General of the Rear ArmyThe country being now cleared of the enemy Chen Tai and Deng Ai prepared a banquet in honor of victory and gave rewards to the soldiers who had foughtChen Tai sent a memorial to the capital upon the services of Deng Ai and a special commission of Sima Zhao brought Deng Ai higher rank the title of lordship was given to his son Deng ZhongAt this time the style of the reign in Wei was changed from Right Origin the third year to Gentle Dew the first year Sima Zhao commanded all the military forces and made himself Empire CommanderinChief He assumed great pomp and whenever he moved outside his palace he was escorted by three thousand mailclad guards beside squadrons of cavalryAll power lay in his hands and he decided all questions so that the court was rather in his palace than in that of the Emperor Plans for taking the final step constantly occupied his thoughtsThe question of mounting the throne was openly mooted by Jia Chong a confidant who was a son of Commander Jia KuiJia Chong said Sir all real authority is in your hands and the country is not tranquilThe only remedy is for you to become actual ruler and you should find out who are your supporters Sima Zhao replied This has been in my thoughts a long timeYou might be my emissary to the east to find out the feeling there You can pretend you go to thank the soldiers who took part in the late campaignThat would be a good pretext Accordingly Jia Chong traveled into the South of River Huai where he saw Zhuge Dan General Who Guards the EastThis officer was from Nanyang and a cousin of the late Lord of Wuxiang Zhuge LiangZhuge Dan had gone to Wei for employment but had received no significant office while Zhuge Liang was the Prime minister of Shu After Zhuge Liangs death Zhuge Dans promotion was rapid He was now Lord of Gaoping and Commander of the south and east of River HuaiJia Chong went to Zhuge Dan to ask him to convey to the army the appreciation of the soldiers servicesJia Chong was received courteously and at a banquet when host and guest were both mellow with wine Jia Chong set himself to discover Zhuge Dans feelings Jia Chong said Lately in Luoyang there has been much talk of the weakness and lack of ability of the Emperor and his unfitness to ruleNow General Sima Zhao comes of a family noted for state service for three generations His own services and virtues are high as the heavens and he is the man best fitted to take the rulership of WeiIs this not your opinion But Zhuge Dan did not favor the suggestionOn the contrary he broke out angrily You are a son of Jia Kui of Yuzhou and your family have received the bounty of WeiYet you dare speak of rebellion Jia Chong said I only repeat what people have said Zhuge Dan said If the state is in difficulty then one ought to stand up for it even to the death Jia Chong said no moreHe soon returned and told Sima Zhao what had been saidThe rat cried Sima Zhao angrilyZhuge Dan is exceedingly popular there in the South of River Huai and if he is left too long he will do harm Sima Zhao began to take measuresHe wrote privately to Yue Chen Imperial Protector of Yangzhou and sent a messenger to Zhuge Dan with an edict making him Minister of Works This meant that Zhuge Dan had to come to the capitalBut Zhuge Dan knew that Jia Chong had done him mischief and he interrogated the messenger who told him that Yue Chen knew all about the matterHow does he know General Sima Zhao sent him a private letter The messenger was condemned to death Then Zhuge Dan placed himself at the head of his personal guard and marched to YangzhouThe city gates were closed and the drawbridge raisedHe summoned the gate but no one answeredHow dare this fellow Yue Chen treat me thus cried Zhuge DanHe ordered his troops to force the gate Ten of his bold generals dismounted crossed the moat and climbed the ramparts where they slew all who opposed them and opened the gate The others entered set fire to the houses and began to fight their way toward the state residenceThe Imperial Protector sought refuge in a tower but Zhuge Dan made his way up and reproached his enemy crying Your father Yue Jin enjoyed the bounty of Wei yet you have not sought to repay the kindness of the Ruling House but you want to help the rebel Sima Zhao Before Yue Chen was able to answer Zhuge Dan slew himThen he sent to Luoyang a memorial detailing Sima Yis many faults and made preparations for warHe called up all the militia of the south and east of River Huai to the total of one hundred thousand and took over the forty thousand troops who had surrendered on the fall of Yue Chen and gathered suppliesHe also sent Adviser Wu Gang to Wu for aid offering his son Zhuge Jing as a hostage for his good faithAt this time Sun Jun had died and his brother Sun Chen was Prime MinisterSun Chen was a man of cruel and violent temper and had put many officers to death on his way to power among them were Grand Commander Teng Yin General Lu Ju and Minister Wang Chun The Ruler of Wu Sun Liang although intelligent was helpless in his hands The messenger Wu Gang conducted Zhuge Jing to the residence of Sun Chen in Shidou who asked what he had come forWu Gang explained Zhuge Dan is a cousin of the Lord of Wuxiang in ShuZhuge Dan had been in service of Wei and seeing Sima Zhao depose the his prince and oppress good people he wants to punish the tyrantBut his force is not enough and he asks for your helpTo show his sincerity he sends his son Zhuge Jing as a token of good faith Wu Gangs request was received favorably and Sun Chen sent seventy thousand troops with a full complement of officersQuan Yi and Quan Duan as Commander Yu Quan as Rear Guard Tang Zi and Zhu Yi as Leaders of the Van Wen Qin as Military Guide They marched in three directions to attack WeiWu Gang returned to Shouchun report successZhuge Dan thought all was going well and prepared the army for a general attackIn Luoyang Zhuge Dans memorial angered Sima Zhao who wished to set out to revenge the attack at once but Jia Chong preached cautionMy lord you derived your power from your father and brother and people have not had time to discover your own virtue If you leave the court and there be a revulsion of feeling against you you will lose allRather request the Empress Dowager and the Son of Heaven to go with you in the expedition and nothing is to be feared said Jia ChongThat is an excellent plan Sima Zhao went into the Palace and proposed it to Her Majesty saying Zhuge Dan is in revolt and I and my colleagues intend to punish himI beg that you will accompany the expedition as the late Emperor would have done The Empress was afraid but dared not refuse and the next day was requested to set out with the Ruler of Wei Cao MaoCao Mao said General you command all the armies and dispose them as you will why do you ask me to go Sima Zhao replied Your Majesty is wrong to hesitate Your ancestors traveled over the empire and wished to unite the whole under one ruler Wherever there was a worthy opponent they went to face himYour Majesty should follow their example and sweep the land clean Why fear Cao Mao fearing his ministers terrible power consented and an edict was issued for the commands to mobilize two hundred sixty thousand troops of two capitalsWang Ji General Who Corrects the South was in command of the van and Chen Qian General Who Pacifies the East was second in command of the vanShi Bao Army Inspector and Zhou Tai Imperial Protector of Yangzhou led the imperial escort The army moved into the South of River Huai like a great floodZhu Yi the Leader of the Van of Wu encountered them and both sides drew up for battleZhu Yi rode out and took the challenge but was overcome by Wang Ji in the third bout and he fled Tang Zi also rode out but was also beaten in the third encounter by Wang JiThen Wang Ji ordered a full attack The troops of Wu were broken and retired fifteen miles and camped Thence they sent tidings of their illsuccess to ShouchunZhuge Dan in Shouchun led out his bold and strong soldiers to join forces with Wen Qin and his two sons Wen Yang and Wen Hu Then they set out against Sima ZhaoNow here is a check to the armies of Wu And Weis gallant men advanceThe next chapter will tell how went victory CHAPTER  Rescuing Shouchun Yu Quan Dies Nobly Attacking Changcheng Jiang Wei Mobilizes Hearing of this threatened attack Sima Zhao sought advice from two of his officers Advisers Pei Xiu and Zhong HuiZhong Hui said The Wu army is helping our enemies for the sake of profit and hence we can seduce them with an offer of greater profit Sima Zhao agreed in this opinion and resolved accordingly As part of his plan he sent Shi Bao and Zhou Tai to lay ambushes in different places near ShidouAs ordered by Sima Zhao Wang Ji and Chen Qian commanded an army of veterans on the rear Cheng Zu led thirty thousand troops out to bring on a battle while Chen Jun got together many wagons herds of oxen droves of horses donkeys and mules and heaps of military supplies all of which he crowded together in the midst of the army This stuff was meant to be abandoned as soon as the fight began so that the enemy might be tempted to plunderThat day Zhuge Dan led the central army while Zhu Yi and Wen Qin commanded the left and right armiesThe armies being drawn up Zhuge Dan looked across at his opponents and saw that the center of the Wei army was taken up by a disorderly mass of transport Presently he led on his troops to attack and Cheng Zu as bidden to do gave way and fled leaving a large amount of spoil When the soldiers of Wu saw such huge quantities of booty theirs for the taking they lost all desire to fight and scattered to gather the spoilWhile thus occupied suddenly a bomb exploded and from left and right down came Shi Bao and Zhou Tai and the army of Wei upon the spoilers Zhuge Dan attempted to draw off but other forces under Wang Ji and Chen Qian appeared and he was heavily smittenThen came on Sima Zhao with his army and Zhuge Dan fled to Shouchun where he entered and shut the gatesThe army of Wei set down to the siege of the city and the army of Wu retired into camp at Anfeng The Ruler of Wei Cao Mao was lodging at this time in XiangchengThen said Zhong Hui Zhuge Dan has been worsted but the city wherein he has taken refuge is well supplied and his allies the troops of Wu are not distant His position is strongOur soldiers are besieging the city all round which means that those within will hold out for a long time or they will make a desperate sortieTheir allies also may fall upon us at the same time and it would go hard with usTherefore I advise that the attack be made only on three sides leaving the south gate open for them if they wish to fleeIf they flee we can fall on the fugitivesThe troops of Wu cannot have supplies for very long and if we sent some light cavalry round by their rear we might stay their fighting power without a battle You are my Zhang Liang said Sima Zhao stroking the back of his adviserYour advice is excellent So Wang Ji who was on the south of the city was ordered to withdrawBut in the Wu camp at Anfeng was much sadness at the want of success Sun Chen said to his general Zhu Yi If we cannot succor Shouchun how can we hope to overrun the Middle Land Now and here you have to win a victory or die for another defeat will mean death Zhu Yi went back to his camp and talked with Yu QuanYu Quan said The south gate of Shouchun is free and I will lead therein some of our troops to help Zhuge DanThen you challenge the Wei army on one side and we will come out from the city and attack on the other side Zhu Yi thought the plan good and Quan Yi Quan Duan and Wen Qin were willing to go into the city and share in the attackThey were allowed to march in without hindrance as the Wei generals had no orders to stop themWhen this was reported to Sima Zhao he said This is a plan to defeat our army by making a front and rear attack So he called Wang Ji and Chen Qian and told them to take five thousand troops to keep the road along which Zhu Yi would come and strike him in rearZhu Yi was advancing toward the city when he heard a shouting in the rear and soon the attack began from two sides by Wang Ji and Chen Qian His army was worsted and returned to AnfengWhen Sun Chen heard of this new defeat he was very angryWhat is the use of leaders who always lose cried heHe sentenced Zhu Yi to death and upbraided Quan I son of Quan Duan and said If you do not drive off this army of Wei let me never again see your face nor that of your father Then Sun Chen returned to JianyeWhen this was known in the Wei camp Zhong Hui said to his chief Now the city of Shouchun may be attacked for Sun Chen has gone away and there is no hope of succor for the besieged A vigorous assault beganQuan I tried to cut his way through and get into the city but when he saw Shouchun quite surrounded by the enemy and no hope of success he gave in and went over to Sima Zhao by whom he was well received and given the rank of GeneralDeeply affected by this kindness Quan I wrote to his father Quan Duan and uncle Quan Yi advising them to follow his example He tied the letter to an arrow and shot it over the wallsQuan Yi found the letter and he and Quan Duan with their several thousand troops came out and yieldedWithin the city Zhuge Dan was very sad Two advisers Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi came to him and said The food in the city is short and the soldiers are many this can not last long General you should let the Wu troops to go out and make a decisive fight with the Wei army Zhuge Dan turned on them angrilyWhy do you tell me to fight when I am set on holding out to the very lastIf you say that again you shall die as traitors He is lost said they going awayWe can do no other than surrender or we shall die too That night Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi slipped over the wall and surrendered Both were given employmentOf those left in the city some were for fighting but no one dared say soMeanwhile Zhuge Dan saw the Wei troops build earth walls to anticipate the expected floods of River Huai This flood had been the only hope of Zhuge Dan who had trusted to be able to smite the besiegers when it came to destroy the earth wallHowever that autumn was dry and the river did not swellWithin the besieged city the food diminished rapidly and soon starvation stared them in the face Wen Qin and his sons were defending the citadel and they saw their soldiers sinking one by one for lack of food till the sight became unbearable Wen Qin went to Zhuge Dan with a proposal saying The northern troops should be sent away in order to save food His suggestion called forth an outburst of fierce wrath of Zhuge DanDo you want to kill me that you propose to send the northern soldiers away Wen Qin suffered death His two sons Wen Yang and Wen Hu ran amok with rageArmed with short swords they attacked all they met and slew many scores in their desperate anger The fit over they dropped down the wall and deserted to the Wei campHowever Sima Zhao had not forgotten that Wen Yang had defied and held at bay his whole army once At first Sima Zhao thought to put Wen Yang to death but Zhong Hui interposedThe real offender was his father Wen Qin said Zhong Hui but he is dead and these two come to you in desperation and if you slay those who surrender you will strengthen the obstinacy of those who remain in the city There was reason in this and so their submission was acceptedThey were led to Sima Zhaos tent and he soothed them with kind words and gave them gifts and lordships and made them GeneralsAfter expressing their gratitude they rode about the city on the horses he had given them shouting We have received great kindness at the hands of Sima Zhao who not only has pardoned us but given us gifts Why do you not all yield When their companions heard this they said one to anotherThis Wen Yang was an enemy and yet he has been well received how much more may we expect generous treatment The desire to surrender possessed them allWhen Zhuge Dan heard it he was incensed and went round the posts night and day on the watch for any who seemed inclined to goHe put many to death in these efforts to retain his authorityZhong Hui heard how things were going in the city and went in to Sima Zhao to say the moment to attack had come Sima Zhao was only too pleasedHe stimulated his troops and they flocked to the ramparts and assaulted vigorouslyThen the commander of the north gate Zeng Xuan treacherously opened the gate and let in the Wei soldiersWhen Zhuge Dan heard that the enemy were in the city he called his guards and tried to escape He took his way along the smaller streets to the gate but on the drawbridge he met Hu Fen who cut him downHis followers were made prisoners Wang Ji fought his way to the west gate where he fell in with the Wu general Yu QuanWhy do you not yield shouted Wang JiWhere is the principle for yielding when I have my orders to rescue the city and so far have not succeeded Throwing off his helmet he cried The happiest death a man can die is on the battlefield Whirling his sword about Yu Quan dashed among his enemies and fought till he fell under many woundsMany were they who yielded at Shouchun Bowing their heads in the dust before Sima ZhaoWu had produced its heroes Yet none were faithful to the death like Yu QuanWhen Sima Zhao entered the city he put to death the whole family of Zhuge DanSome of his guards fell into the hands of Sima Zhao alive and he offered them their lives if they would yieldThey all refused saying We would rather share the fate of our leader They were sent out of the city to be beheaded but orders were given to offer each one his life at the last momentThus before a person was about to receive the fatal blow that one was asked to yieldNot one accepted and they all diedIn admiration for their fortitude they were honorably interred by order of Sima Zhao The loyal servant flees not in the day of disaster Such were they who followed Zhuge Dan to the shades Ever and again begins the Song of Lifes Brevity Faithful unto death were they even as Tian Hengs people As has been said many of the troops of Wu surrendered Then said Pei Xiu The parents and children of these soldiers are living all over River Huai and if you spare them and they return home they will foment rebellion by and byThe best way is to bury them But Zhong Hui said No When the ancients made war their policy was to maintain the state as a whole and so they only put to death the originators of troubleIt would be inhumane to slay allRather let them return home as witnesses to your liberal policy That is better advice said Sima ZhaoSo the soldiers of Wu were released and allowed to return homeTang Zi dared not return to his own place in Wu for fear of the cruel Sun Chen so he went over to Wei taking his company with himHe was well received and his people were employed over the counties of the three riversThe country about River Huai being now quiet Sima Zhao decided to march homewardJust then the news came that Jiang Wei the Shu General was attacking Changcheng and interfering with the supplies and so a council was called to discuss this matterAt this time in Shu the reign style was changed from Long Enjoyment the twentieth year to Wonderful Sight the first year In Hanzhong Jiang Wei had recruited two generals Fu Qian and Jiang Shu both of whom he loved greatly and set them to train the army horse and foot Then came the newsZhuge Dan has set out to destroy Sima Zhao Sun Chen of Wu has supported him with a large army and Sima Zhao has led the army himself bringing with him the Empress Dowager and the Ruler of Wei Jiang Wei said The great opportunity has come at last So he asked the Latter Rulers authority to make another expeditionBut Qiao Zhou heard this with grief for internal affairs were not well Said he The court is sunk in dissipation and the Emperors confidence is given to that eunuch Huang Hao state affairs are neglected for pleasure which is the Emperors sole aimJiang Wei has led many expeditions and wasted the lives of many soldiers so that the state is falling Qiao Zhou then wrote an essay on Enemy Kingdoms which he sent to Jiang WeiWhen one asks by what means the weak overcame the strong in past times the answer is that those responsible for the strong state made no struggle against general laxity while those in power in a weak state took careful steps for improvementConfusion followed upon laxity and efficiency grew out of diligence as is the universal ruleKing Wen of Zhou devoted himself to the welfare of his people and with a small number achieved great results Gou Jian sympathized with all and with a weak force overcame a powerful opponentThese were their methodsOne may recall that in the past Chu was strong and Han weak when the empire was divided by agreement at the Great Canal Then seeing that his people were satisfied and settled in their minds Zhang Liang went in pursuit of Xiang Yu and destroyed himBut is it necessary to act like King Wen and Gou Jian Listen to the replyIn the days of Shang and Zhou when imperial ranks had long existed and the relations between prince and minister were firmly established even such as the Founder of the Hans could not have carved his way to a throneBut when the dynasty of Qin had suppressed the feudal nobles and set up mere representatives of its own power and the people were weak and enslaved the empire was rived asunder and there succeeded a time of contention when every bold soul strove with his neighborBut we are now in other times Since there is not the state of confusion that waited on the end of Qin but a state of things more nearly like that of the period of the Warring States in which six kingdoms contended for the mastery therefore one may play the part of King Wen If one would found a dynasty then must that one wait upon time and favorable destinyWith these in his favor the consummation will follow forthwith as the armies of Kings Tang and Wu fought but one battle Therefore have real compassion for the people and wait on opportunityIf wars are constant and a mishap come even the wisest will be unable to show the way of safety An effusion from the pen of a rotten pedant cried Jiang Wei wrathfully as he finished reading and he dashed the essay on the ground in contemptThe protest was disregarded and the army marchedIn your opinion where should we begin asked he of Fu QianFu Qian replied The great storehouse of Wei is at Changcheng and we ought to burn their grain and forageLet us go out by the Luo Valley and cross the Shen Ridge After the capture of Changcheng we can go on to Qinchuan and the conquest of the Middle Land will be near What you say just fits in with my secret plans replied Jiang WeiSo the army marched to the Luo Valley and crossed the Shen RidgeThe Commander in Changcheng was Sima Wang a cousin of Sima ZhaoHuge stores of grain were in the city but its defenses were weakSo when Sima Wang heard of the approach of the Shu army he and his two leaders Wang Zhen and Li Peng made a camp seven miles from the walls to keep any attack at a distanceWhen the enemy came up Sima Wang and his two generals went forth from the ranks to meet themJiang Wei stood in the front of his army and said Sima Zhao has forced his prince to go with him to war which plainly indicates that he intends to emulate the deeds of Li Jue and Guo Si My government has commanded me to punish this faultWherefore I say to you yield at once for if you persist in the way of error you and yours shall all be put to death Sima Wang shouted back You and yours are wholly strangers to any feeling of rectitudeYou have repeatedly invaded a superior states territory and if you do not at once retire I will see to it that not even a breastplate returns With these words General Wang Zhen rode out his spear set ready to thrustFrom the host of Shu came Fu Qian to take the challenge and the two champions engaged After a few encounters Fu Qian tempted his opponent by feigning weakness Wang Zhen thrust at the opening he gave Fu Qian evaded the blow snatched Wang Zhen out of the saddle and bore him offSeeing this his colleague Li Peng whirled up his sword and went pounding down toward the captorFu Qian went but slowly thus luring Li Peng into rash pursuit When Li Peng was near enough Fu Qian dashed his prisoner with all his strength to the earth took a firm grip on his fouredged brand and smote Li Peng full in the faceThe blow knocked out an eye and Li Peng fell deadWang Zhen had been already killed by the Shu troops as he lay on the groundBoth generals being dead the troops of Wei fled into the city and barred the gatesJiang Wei gave orders for the army to rest that night and take the city on the morrow with all vigorNext day at dawn the assault began The soldiers fresh from their rest vied with each other who should be first on the wallThey shot over the ramparts firearrows and firebombs and burned all the buildings on the wallThey next brought up brushwood and piled it against the rampart and set it alight so that the flames rose highWhen the city seemed about to fall the defenders set up a howling and a lamentation that could be heard all aroundBut suddenly a great rolling of drums diverted the attention of the assailants from the city and they turned their faces to see a great host of Wei soldiers marching up in all the glory of waving bannersJiang Wei faced about to meet this attack and took his place beneath the great standardPresently Jiang Wei made out a youthfullooking leader riding in advance with his spear ready to thrust He looked scarcely more than twenty years of age his face was smooth as if powdered and his lips were crimson But from them came fierce words Do you recognize General Deng cried heSo this is Deng Ai thought Jiang WeiThereupon Jiang Wei set his spear and rode outBoth were adepts in arms and neither gave the other an opening so that at the end of near half a hundred bouts neither could claim advantageThe youth wielded his spear with perfect skillIf I cannot gain the advantage by some ruse how shall I win thought Jiang WeiSo he turned aside his steed and dashed along a certain road that led to the hillsThe youth followed Presently Jiang Wei slung his spear laid hands upon his bow chose with care a feathered arrow and laid it on the stringBut the youth was quick of eye and as the bowstring sang he bent his head over the saddle and the arrow passed harmlessly byThe next time Jiang Wei turned he saw his pursuer close upon him and already the spear was threatening his lifeBut as the youth thrust Jiang Wei evaded the blow and caught the shaft under his armThus deprived of his weapon the young man made for his own arrayWhat a pity What a great pity cried Jiang Wei turning to pursueHe followed the young general close up to the standard but just as he came near a warrior came to the front shouting Jiang Wei you fool do not pursue my son when I Deng Ai am here Jiang Wei was taken aback so he had only been contending with Deng Zhong the son of his real opponent Although he was astonished at the skill and vigor of the youth he now knew that a heavier task lay before him and feared lest his steed was then too far spent for the contestSo he said to Deng Ai Seeing things are so let us both hold off our troops till the morrow when we will fight Deng Ai glancing around saw that the place was illsuited for him so he agreed to wait saying Let us lead off our armies then and whoever shall take any secret advantage is a base fellow Both sides retired into camp Deng Ai on the bank of River Wei and Jiang Wei on the hillsDeng Ai saw that the army of Shu had the advantage of position so he wrote off at once to Sima Wang saying General we should not give battle but wait for reinforcementsMeanwhile the soldiers of Shu will be consuming their supply of grain and we will attack on three sides when they begin to be hungryI send my son Deng Zhong to you for further help in the defense of the city Jiang Wei sent a messenger to the Wei camp to deliver a letter of battle the contest to take place the next day Deng Ai openly acceptedBut when morning came and Jiang Wei had arrayed his troops his enemy had not appeared on the fieldNor was there any sign of giving battle no display of flags or rolling of drums all dayAt nightfall the army of Shu returned to camp and Jiang Wei sent a letter reproaching his opponent with his failure to keep his wordDeng Ai treated the bearer of the letter with great courtesy and explained that he had been indisposed that day but would certainly fight on the morrowBut the next day passed also without any move on the part of Wei and the same thing went on for five daysThen said Fu Qian to his chief There is some knavery afoot and we must be on our guard They must be waiting for reinforcements that they may attack on three sides said Jiang WeiBut now will I send into Wu and get Sun Chen to strike at the same time as I Just then scouts came to give the news of the rout of the army of WuSima Zhao has defeated Shouchun and killed Zhuge DanMany in the Wu army have gone over to Wei Sima Zhao has gone to Luoyang and is planning to march an army to attack Changcheng So our attack on Wei is but a sham said Jiang Wei bitterlyIt is only a picture of a cake Four times he missed He hailed The fifth occasion joyfully and failed The next chapter will tell the story of the retreat CHAPTER Ding Feng Makes A Plan To Slay Sun Chen Jiang Wei Arrays A Battle To Defeat Deng Ai Fearing lest reinforcements would strengthen his enemy beyond his own power of resistance Jiang Wei decided to retreat while he could He sent all his stores and baggage away first with the footmen and kept the cavalry to cover the retirementThe spies reported his movements to Deng Ai who said He has gone because he knew that the main army would soon be upon him Let him go and do not followIf we pursue he will play us some evil trick Scouts were sent to keep in touch with the retreating army and when they returned they reported that preparations of dry woods and straws had been made in the Luo Valley to check any pursuit with fireThe officers praised the prescience of Deng Ai General your calculation is superhuman When Deng Ai reported these matters to the capital Sima Zhao was very pleased and confer more rewardsThe Prime Minister of Wu Sun Chen was greatly angered by the desertion of so many of his soldiers and officers to Wei and revenged himself by putting their families to deathThe Ruler of Wu Sun Liang disapproved of these acts of cruelty but he was powerless The young Emperor was of an ingenious turn of mindOne day he went to the West Park to eat of the newly ripened plums He bade one of the eunuchs bring some honeyIt was brought but there were mouse droppings in it The Ruler of Wu called the storekeeper and blamed him for carelessnessThe storekeeper said We are very careful to keep the stores in good order and the honey cannot not possibly have been fouled in the storehouse Has any one asked you for honey lately asked the Ruler of WuOne of the eunuchs asked for some a few days agoI refused him The Ruler of Wu called the named eunuch and said You defiled the honey out of spite The man denied itIt is very easy to tell said the Ruler of WuIf the dirt has been lying in the honey for some time it will be wet all through Then the Ruler of Wu ordered them to cut one of the lumps and it was quite dry insideThe eunuch then confessed This shows the Ruler of Wu was quickwitted But clever as he was he could not control his Prime Minister whose relatives were in command of all the garrisons and armies so that he was unassailable His four brothers all had high officesSun Jun was General Who Terrifies Distant Regions and Commander of Imperial Guards Sun En General Who Shows Prowess Sun Gan Imperial Commander and Sun Kai Commander of ChangshuiOne day the Ruler of Wu musing over his sorrows and feeling very miserable began to weep The officer in charge of the eunuchs who was an Imperial BrotherinLaw stood bySun Chen holds all real power and does as he wishes while I am despised said the Ruler of WuSomething must be done Quan Ji said I would think no sacrifice too great if Your Majesty would make use of me If you could muster the Palace Guards and help General Liu Cheng to keep the gates I would go and murder that ruffian But you must not let anyone know for if you tell your noble mother who is a sister of Sun Chen she will tell her brother and that would be very serious for me Will Your Majesty give me a command that I may have authority to act when the time comes said Quan JiAt the critical moment I could show the edict and hold back Sun Chens supporters The command was given and Quan Ji went homeBut he could not keep his secret and confided the plan to his father Quan ShangHis father told his wife Sun Chen will be got rid of in three days Oh he deserves that said sheAlthough she seemed to approve with her tongue she sent a secret messenger with a letter to the proposed victim That same night Sun Chen called in his four leader brothers and the Palace was surroundedThe conspirators were seized with Liu Cheng and Quan Shang and all their familiesAbout dawn the Ruler of Wu was disturbed by a commotion at the gates and a servant told him Sun Chen with his army has surrounded the Inner Palace Sun Liang knew that he had been betrayed He turned on Empress Quan who was of the Quan house and reproached herYour father and brother have upset all my plans Drawing his sword he was dashing out when his Consort and her people clung to his clothing and held him back After putting to death Liu Chengs and Quan Shangs parties Sun Chen assembled the officers in the court and addressed them thus The Emperor is vicious and weak depraved and foolish and unfit for his high officeWherefore he must be deposedAny of you who oppose will be punished as for conspiracy Only one of those present dared to say a word of protestIt was High Minister Huan Yi who said How dare you utter such wordsOur Emperor is very intelligent and I will not support you I would rather die Sun Chen wrathfully drew his sword and slew Huan Yi Then Sun Chen went into the Palace and said to Sun Liang O unrighteous and unenlightened Highness your death would be the only fitting reparation to make to the empire but out of consideration for your ancestors you are only deposed and degraded to princely rank as Prince of KuaijiI will select a worthy successor Minister Li Zong was ordered to bring in the royal seal which was delivered to Deng ChengThe deposed ruler retired weepingThe sage example of the wise Yi Yin Perverted now to traitors use we see And Huo Guangs faithful services are made A cloak to cover vilest treacheryEven able princes are but toys of fate And need our pity fallen from high estateSun Chen then sent two ministers of the court Sun Kai and Dong Chao went as envoys to Hulin to request Sun Xiu Prince of Langye the sixth son of Sun Quan to ascend the throneThe Emperorelect had had some premonition of the high honor to which he was now called for in a dream he saw he ascended into the skies seated on a dragon Only the dragon seemed to have no tail He woke up in a fright and the next day brought the Imperial Envoys Sun Kai and Dong ChaoSun Xiu set outAt Que his carriage was stopped by a venerable old man who claimed to be Gan Xiu and offered felicitations Your Majesty should move faster for things may change swiftly said the aged oneSun Xiu thanked the old manAt Busai Pavilion awaited Sun En with a chariot but Sun Xius modesty would not allow him to mount itHe remained in his own simple carriage and therein traveled to the PalaceOfficials lined the road to salute him and he dismounted to return their salutationsThen Sun Chen stood forth and bade them take the newlyelected Emperor by the arm and lead him into the Great Hall where after thrice refusing the honor he at last took his seat in the Dragon Throne and received the jade seal passed from one ruler to anotherWhen all the officers had made obeisance there were the usual amnesties promotions and honors and Eternal Tranquillity the first year  was the name of the new reignSun Chen was confirmed as Prime Minister with the Protectorship of JingzhouMoreover Sun Hao the son of his elder brother was created Lord of WuchengSun Chen with five persons in his family holding lordships and the whole army under their command was immensely powerful able to set up and pull down at willThe new Ruler of Wu Sun Xiu secretly feared him and although outwardly he showed Sun Chen great favor yet he kept careful watch over Sun Chen whose arrogance knew no boundsIn the winter Sun Chen sent into the Palace presents of oxen and wine as birthday gifts The Ruler of Wu declined them Sun Chen was very annoyed and took the presents to Zhang Bus residence where they two dined together Zhang Bu was the General of the Left ArmyWhen warmed with wine Sun Chen said When I deposed the present Prince of Kuaiji many people urged me to take the throne myselfBut I acted magnanimously and set up this present EmperorNow I suffer the mortification of seeing my presents rejectedYou will see what will come of this slight Zhang Bu showed sympathy but the next day he secretly told the Ruler of Wu and Sun Xius fears increased so that he could not restShortly after this Sun Chen sent a large body of troops under the command of Minister Meng Zong into camp at Wuchang and Sun Chen armed them from the state arsenalsWhereupon General Wei Miao and Imperial Guard Shi Shuo secretly memorialized the Ruler of Wu Sun Chen has moved the troops outside and provided them with state armsThis action points to rebellion Sun Xiu was shocked and called in Zhang Bu to consult and he said The Veteran General Ding Feng is an able and trustworthy officerHe should be consulted So Ding Feng was called and taken into the Emperors confidenceHave no anxiety said Ding FengI will find some way of ridding the state of this evil What do you propose When the winter court is held and all the officers are assembled spread a great banquet and invite Sun ChenI shall be ready to act Wei Miao and Shi Shuo were taken into the plot and were to do what was possible outside the palace and Zhang Bu saw to arrangements withinOne night a heavy storm came on to blow which tore up great trees by the rootsHowever by daylight it had abated and that morning an Emperors messenger arrived bearing an invitation to a banquet in the royal palaceSun Chen rose from his couch and as he did so fell flat on the ground as though he had been pushed from behind This accident troubled him and he felt apprehensive so he called half a score of his trusty guards to act as his escort to the palaceAs he was leaving home his family besought him not to go out saying The storm last night and the fall this morning are fearful omensYou should not go to that banquet However he made light of their fears and said My brothers are holding the army who will dare come near me But if there is anything amiss you just give a fire signal from the Prime Ministers residence So Sun Chen took his seat and the carriage set outWhen he reached the Palace the Ruler of Wu rose from his place to welcome him and at table Sun Chen sat in the seat of honor The banquet proceededThere is a fire outside what does that mean said a guest presentlySun Chen rose to go out but the Ruler of Wu said There is no danger and there are plenty of soldiers outside to take care of that Just at that moment Zhang Bu entered at the head of three hundred armed guards He rushed up the banquet chamber shouting I hold a command to slay the rebel Sun Chen Instantly the Prime Minister was seized He fell prostrate before the Ruler of Wu knocking his head on the ground and crying Spare my lifeExile me to Jiaozhou where I will do plow work Did you exile any of your victimsTeng Yin Lu Ju Wang Chun and others said the Ruler of Wu angrilyThe order went forth to carry out the execution and Sun Chen was hustled out and put to deathNo single person of his servants raised a hand to help himThen Zhang Bu read an edictSun Chen is the only culprit and no other will be questioned Then at Zhang Bus request the Ruler of Wu went up on the Tower of the Five PhoenixesZhang Bu Wei Miao and Shi Shuo brought the brothers of the Prime Minister before Sun Xiu and he condemned them to deathAfter this their families were slain so that many hundreds suffered death Not content with all these things the tomb of Sun Jun was broken open and his corpse beheadedMagnificent tombs were raised to his victimsZhuge Ke Teng Yin Lu Ju Wang Chun and othersThus at last loyalty was rewarded and the banished were permitted to return home with full pardonThe conspirators were rewardedNews of this revolution was sent into Chengdu and the Latter Ruler sent an envoy into Wu with felicitationsIn return the Ruler of Wu sent Xue Xu as his envoy to ShuWhen Xue Xu returned the Ruler of Wu questioned about affairs in the west and Xue Xu said All affairs of state are in the hands of a certain eunuch named Huang Hao and all the courtiers look up to him as to a fatherAt court plain truth is never heard and the country people look sallow and starved The whole country appears on the verge of destructionThe birds on the roof do not know that the building is about to be burned Ah If only Zhuge Liang the Martial Lord was still alive how different all would be said Sun Xiu with a sighLetters were prepared saying that beyond doubt Sima Zhao intended usurpation and when that came about in Wei both Wu and Shu would be invaded Wherefore both should be readyOn the arrival of these letters Jiang Wei hastened to seek permission to attempt another expeditionConsent being given a large army marched into Hanzhong in the winter of the first year of Wonderful Sight  Liao Hua and Zhang Yi were appointed Leaders of the Van Wang Han and Jiang Bin as Commanders of the Left and Jiang Shu and Fu Qian as Commanders of the Right while Jiang Wei and Xiahou Ba led the main columnAsked what he thought should be the first objective Xiahou Ba replied There is no better fighting ground than Qishan as the tactics of the late Prime Minister made evident and it is the only good exit So thither three armies marched and they made three camps at the entrance to the valleyAt this time Deng Ai had a training camp at Qishan drilling the Longyou troopsThe scouts told him of the coming of the western army and he ascended a hill to see and verify their reports He seemed pleased when he saw the enemy camp They have just done as I foresaw said Deng AiNow Deng Ai had carefully considered the pulse of the countryside and so had not interfered with the Shu army when it was on the march or settling into campMoreover he had excavated a subterranean road to the spot where he had thought they would halt and their left camp had been pitched just on itWang Han and Jiang Bin commanded in that campDeng Ai called his son Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan and sent them with ten thousand troops each to attack the left camp one on each flankThen he sent Zheng Lun and five hundred troops into the underground road which opened in rear of the camp of Wang Han and Jiang BinAs the newly made camp was not yet well fortified Wang Han and Jiang Bin exercised great care and kept their troops under arms all night watching with vigilance So when the alarm was given they had but to seize their weapons and go outBut as the two leaders were mounting their steeds Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan had attacked from without and Zheng Lun from withinThus attacked from three sides soon Wang Han and Jiang Bin found the position untenable and fledWhen Jiang Wei saw that his left camp had been attacked on three sides he mounted and took his position in front of the center camp Let no one move on pain of death he shoutedStand still and when the enemy approaches shoot The right camp was ordered to stand fast His defense was effectiveA dozen of times the troops of Wei came forward only to be driven back before the arrows and bolts of the defendersDaylight found the Shu camps still firm and the Wei troops drew offJiang Wei has indeed learned of Zhuge Liang said Deng AiHis soldiers stood the night attack without flinching and the leaders took the chances of battle quite calmlyHe is able Next day when Wang Han and Jiang Bin went to confess their fault Jiang Wei said It was less your fault than mine for I did not clearly recognize the nature of the terrain So no penalty was inflictedThe camp was made stronger and the subterranean passage was filled with the bodies of the slainA challenge to battle for the following day was sent to Deng Ai who accepted it joyfullyNext day the two armies were arrayed in front of the Qishan MountainsThe troops of Shu arrayed according to the Eight Formations designed by Zhuge Liang which are called Heaven Earth Wind Cloud Bird Serpent Dragon and TigerWhile the maneuver was in progress Deng Ai recognized it as the Eight Gates Formation and placed his troops accordinglyJiang Wei then gripped his spear and rode out saying You have made a good imitation of my eight but can you work variations You call these yours Did you think that you alone held the secretSince I have made it of course I know the variations Deng Ai reentered his ranks gave the signal officers certain orders and the eight gates were evolved in rapid succession into sixtyfour gatesThen he rode to the front again What of my evolution asked Deng AiNot so bad would you like to try a surrounding move with me replied Jiang WeiWhy not The two armies moved in orderly ranksDeng Ai stood in the midst of his army giving the necessary ordersThen the clash came but his tactics did not gripThen Jiang Wei waved a certain signal flag and his force suddenly assumed the form of a serpent coiled on the ground with Deng Ai in the centerShouts arose all about him and Deng Ai could not understand what had happened and began to feel afraidGradually the troops of Shu closed in upon him and he saw no way of escapeDeng Ai you must surrender cried the soldiersIndeed a moment of pride had led me into the trap of Jiang Wei he sighedSuddenly from the northwest a cohort dashed in To Deng Ais great joy they were soldiers of Wei and they forced over the battle array and released him The leader was Sima WangBut although Deng Ai had been rescued his nine camps were seized by his enemy and he had to retireHe led his army to the south of River Wei and made a campHow did you know exactly where to strike in that maze asked Deng Ai of his rescuerSima Wang replied In my youth I studied tactics and was friendly with Shi Guangyuan and Cui Zhouping They explained that formation to meJiang Wei used what is known as The Serpent Coil and the only way to break it is to attack the head which I saw was in the northwest Deng Ai replied Although I have studied formations I do not know all the modificationsBut since you know about this we may be able to recover our camps I fear the little I have learned will not be enough to overcome Jiang Wei Tomorrow you shall contend with him and while his attention is engaged I will attack the rear of Qishan and we will recover our camps So a force was prepared to attack on the morrow and Deng Ai sent a letter of challenge to a contest in tactics for the same dayJiang Wei marked in to accept Jiang Wei said to his officers In the secret book that I received from the Prime Minister the variations of the formation are three hundred and sixtyfive corresponding to the circuit of the heavensThis challenge from them is as one going to teach hewing to the God of Carpenters I think some ruse lies behind thisCan you guess what it is Liao Hua replied While they engage your attention in this competition they intend to attack our rear Just so that is my opinion replied Jiang WeiSo he prepared a counterstroke by sending Liao Hua and Zhang Yi to lie in wait at the back of the hills with ten thousand troopsNext day Jiang Wei led all the troops from the nine camps out and drawn up in front of the hillsSima Wang came out on the other side and presently rode to the front to parleyYou have challenged me to a contest now draw up your army for me to see said Jiang WeiSima Wang did so and arrayed the eight diagrams Octagon That is what we know as the Octagon said Jiang WeiBut it is nothing wonderful only a sort of array fit for a brigands raid You also have only stolen another mans tactics replied his adversaryHow many modifications of this are there asked Jiang WeiSince I have arranged this naturally I know the variations of which there are nine nines making eightyone Try them Sima Wang returned to his array and evolved many finally riding out and asking his opponent if he recognized themMy formation admits of three hundred and sixtyfive variationsYou are but a frog in a well and know nothing of the deeper mysteries Now Sima Wang knew that so many variations were possible but had not studied them However he put on a bold air and said contemptuously I do not believe youProve it Go and call Deng Ai replied Jiang WeiI will display them to him General Deng Ai has excellent plans and does not think much of such tactics What plansI suppose you mean a plan to keep me here while he tries a surprise attack in the rear Sima Wang was aghast He made a sudden dash forward and a melee beganJiang Wei made a signal with his whip and his force poured in from both wings The troops of Wei were seized with sudden panic threw down their weapons and fledNow Deng Ai had hurried on Zheng Lun to make the first attackAs Zheng Lun turned the corner of the hill a bomb exploded At once the drums rolled and an ambush discovered itselfLiao Hua was in command Neither side stayed to parley and the leaders engaged in single combat In the first encounter Liao Hua cut Zheng Lun down Deng Ai had not expected such preparation and he hastened to withdraw Then Zhang Yi came forth and attacked on the other sideThe army of Wei was worstedDeng Ai fought his way out but he bore four arrow wounds upon his bodyHe got to the river where he found Sima Wang and they discussed how to get away But Sima Wang proposed another form of attackRecently the Ruler of Shu has had a favorite Eunuch Huang Hao in whom he places all his trust and with whom he spends his time in one round of pleasureLet us use the eunuch to sow distrust between the Emperor and his general and so get Jiang Wei recalledIn that way we shall retrieve our defeat So Deng Ai assembled his advisers and asked who could go into Shu and get into communication with Huang HaoDang Jun volunteered at onceDeng Ai entrusted gold and pearls and precious things to him and sent him into Shu to win the treacherous alliance of the eunuch As Dang Jun went he also disseminated reports that Jiang Wei was angry and intended to go over to Wei These rumors became the common talk in Chengdu and everyone believed themHuang Hao carried them to the Emperor and a messenger was sent to call the general to the capitalMeanwhile Jiang Wei tried every day to bring the enemy to give battle but they remained obstinately behind their defensesJiang Wei began to think some evil scheme was afoot when suddenly he was recalled by Imperial EdictAlthough ignorant of the reason he could not disobey and when he began the retreat Deng Ai and Sima Wang knew that their plot had succeededThey broke camp and set out to attack the retreating army Because of court intrigues Yue Yi and Yue Fei failedHow matters went will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER Driving To The South Gate Cao Mao Plunges Into Death Abandoning Stores Jiang Wei Defeats The Wei ArmyWhen the order to retreat was given Liao Hua said A leader in the field is independent and need not obey even the command of his prince Zhang Yi said The country begins to resent these many years of war rather take the occasion of the victory you have just won to return and pacify the people It is good said Jiang WeiA systematic and orderly retirement beganThe army of Wei loth to forgo an opportunity followed but the absence of the least confusion gave them no chanceAs he saw his enemy disappearing in perfect order Deng Ai sighed Jiang Wei is a worthy inheritor of the warlike methods of Zhuge Liang Deng Ai did not pursue but returned to his camp on QishanOn his return to Chengdu Jiang Wei had audience with the Latter Ruler whereat he inquired why he had been commanded to returnThe Latter Ruler replied Because you have been so long on the frontier noble Sir I thought the soldiers must be wearyThere was no other reason Your Majesty thy servant had got his camps on Qishan and was on the eve of complete success To leave off thus in the middle just played into the hands of our enemiesSurely Deng Ai found means of sowing distrust in me The Latter Ruler sat lost in thought and silentJiang Wei continued I am pledged to destroy those rebels and prove my devotion to my countryYour Majesty should not listen to the babble of mean persons till distrust grows in your heart I do not distrust you said the Latter Ruler after a long pauseYou may return into Hanzhong and await the next favorable opportunity Jiang Wei left the court and betook himself into Hanzhong to the armyDang Jun went back to the Qishan camp and reported his success Deng Ai and Sima Wang rejoiced saying In the Lands of Rivers trouble is not far off when the ruler and his servants do not live in harmony They sent Dang Jun to Luoyang to tell his own story to Sima Zhao who also rejoiced for he ardently desired to subdue ShuOn this matter he consulted Jia Chong Commander of the Central Guard What do you think of an attack upon Shu Not to be considered said Jia ChongThe Emperor does not trust you and your departure would be the beginning of trouble for youLast year when a yellow dragon was seen in the well and all the officers were felicitating the Emperor upon such a very auspicious occurrence the Emperor said It is not auspicious just the reverseThe dragon symbolizes the ruler To be neither in heaven nor on earth among the people but to be in a well is a dark portent and bodes evil He wrote some verses and one stanza undoubtedly points to you my lordIt reads The dragon like a prisoner is No longer leaps he in the abyssHe soars not to the Milky Way Nor can he in the meadows play But coiled within a dismal well With slimy creatures he must dwell Must close his jaws his claws retract Alas Quite like myself in fact The recital of the poem annoyed Sima ZhaoThis fellow is very like Cao Fang and if I do not remove him he will hurt me said heI will see to it for you said Jia Chong In the fifth year of Sweet Dew in Wei calendar  during the fourth month in summer Sima Zhao had the effrontery to go to court armed However the Ruler of Wei received him with exaggerated courtesyThe courtiers said The services of the Regent Marshal are so magnificent and his virtue so high that he should be rewarded with the title Duke of Jin and the Nine Gifts of Honors Cao Mao hung his head and kept silentAnd Sima Zhao himself said discontentedly My father and my brother have all given great services to Wei and yet I deserves not being a mere Duke of Jin Should I dare not do what you requested said Cao MaoThat poem about the Lurking Dragon called us slimy creatures what sort of politeness is that said Sima ZhaoThe Ruler of Wei had nothing to say and the haughty minister left the chamber smiling cruellyCao Mao retired taking with him Ministers Wang Shen Wang Jing and Wang Ye and they went to a privy chamber to consult Cao Mao was very sadHe said There is no doubt that Sima Zhao intends to usurp the throne everybody knows thatBut I will not sit thereon patiently awaiting the indignity of being pushed off Cannot you gentlemen help me to kill him He may not be slain said Wang JingThat will not doIn the old state of Lu King Zhao could not bear with the Ji family and ran away thus losing his countryBut this Sima Zhao and his family have been in power very long and have innumerable supporters many of whom are quite independent of any act of his whether loyal or disloyalThey support him under any conditions Your Majestys guards are few and weak and incapable not the ones for any desperate effortIt would be most lamentable if Your Majesty could not bear this trialThe correct course is to wait and not act hastily If I can bear this what cannot I bear said Cao MaoBut I will do something and if I die what matters He went into the private apartments and spoke to the Empress DowagerWang Shen Wang Jing and Wang Ye sat outside talkingThis matter is coming to a head and unless we want to be put to death and all our loved ones with us we would better go and warn Sima Zhao said Wang ShenThis advice angered Wang Jing and he said The princes sorrow is the ministers shame and a shamed minister diesDare you contemplate treachery Wang Jing would have nothing to do with this visit to Sima Zhao but the other two went to the Prime Ministers palace to betray their princeShortly after Cao Mao appeared called the officer of the guard Jiao Bo and bade him muster his force as many as he could Jiao Bo got together about three hundred and this little force marched out to the beating of a drum as escort to a small carriage in which sat the Ruler of Wei gripping his swordThey proceeded south Wang Jing stepped to the front and prayed Cao Mao to stay his steps and not goTo go against Sima Zhao with such a force is driving the sheep into the tigers jawsTo die such a death is a vain sacrifice You can do nothing said Wang Jing Do not hinder meI have made up my mind replied the Ruler of Wei heading toward the Dragon Gate Presently Jia Chong came in sight He was armed and mounted on a fine horse Beside him rode two generals Cheng Zu and Cheng Ji and behind him followed a body of mailclad guards who shouted one to another as they rodeThen Cao Mao held up his sword and cried I am the Son of God Who are you thus breaking into the forbidden precinctsAre you come to murder your lawful ruler The soldiers suddenly stopped for they were palace guardsThen Jia Chong shouted to Cheng Ji saying What did Duke Sima Zhao train you for if not for this days work Cheng Ji took his halberd and turned to Jia Chong saying Death or capture Duke Sima Zhao said the man had to die replied Jia ChongCheng Ji rushed toward the carriageHow dare you cried the Ruler of WeiBut the shout was cut short by a thrust from the halberd full in the breast another thrust and the point came out at the back so that Cao Mao lay there dead beside his carriageJiao Bo coming up to strike a blow in defense was also slain and the little escort scatteredWang Jing who had followed upbraided Jia Chong shouting Rebel and traitor How dare you kill the Emperor Jia Chong got angry and bade his lictors arrest Wang Jing and stop his tongueWhen they told Sima Zhao he went into the Palace but the Emperor was dead He assumed an air of being greatly shocked and beat his head against the carriage weeping and lamenting the while He sent to tell all the officials of high rankWhen Imperial Guardian Sima Fu saw the dead body of the Emperor he threw himself beside it his head resting thereon and wept saying It is my fault that they slew Your Majesty Sima Fu had a coffin brought and the remains were laid therein and borne to the west side hallTherein Sima Zhao entered and summoned the chief officers to a councilThey came all but Minister Chen TaiSima Zhao noticed his absence and sent the Chair of the Secretariat Xun Yi his uncle to call himChen Tai wept aloud saying Gossips often class me and my uncle togetherYet today is my uncle less virtuous than I However Chen Tai obeyed the summons and came dressed in the coarse white cloth of mourning and prostrated himself before the bier Sima Zhao feigned to be grieved alsoHow can this days work be judged said Sima ZhaoIf only Jia Chong be put to death that will only be a slight atonement to satisfy the empire replied Chen TaiSima Zhao was silent and thought long before he spokeThen he said How about a little less severe That is only the beginning I know not other punishments less severe Cheng Ji is the ungodly rebel and actual criminal he should suffer the death of shame and his family too said Sima ZhaoThereupon Cheng Ji broke out into abuse of Sima Zhao and reviled him saying It was not my crime it was Jia Chong who passed on your own orders Sima Zhao bade them cut out his tongue and put him to deathThey did so and Cheng Ji and his brother Cheng Zu were both put to death in the market place and their families were exterminatedThe Emperor must die thus spoke Sima Zhao full plain In Jia Chongs hearing and the Emperor was slainAlthough they killed Cheng Ji who dealt the blow The author of the crime we all well knowWang Jings whole household were imprisonedHe himself was standing in the courthouse when he saw his mother Lady Zhao being brought up a prisonerHe knocked his head on the ground and wept saying O unfilial son to bring distress upon a gentle mother But his mother laughed Who does not die cried sheThe only thing to be feared is not dying the proper deathWho would regret dying like this When next day the family were led out to execution both mother and son smiled as they went pastBut the whole city wept tears of sorrowMother Yuan was famous at the rise of Han Mother Zhao was distinguished at the end of Wei With purest virtue and unfaltering heart With resolution stern she played her partHer fortitude was great as Taishan Mountains Her life but as the floating down did count Like mother like son their fame never will die So long as shall endure the earth and skyImperial Guardian Sima Fu proposed that the body of the late Emperor should receive a royal funeral and Sima Zhao consentedJia Chong and those of his party urged Sima Zhao to assume the Throne and replace Wei but he refusedFormerly King Wen had twothirds of the empire and yet he supported and served the state of Yin to its endWherefore Confucius called him Complete of Virtue Emperor Cao of Wei would not replace the Hans nor will I accept an abdication of Wei Those who heard this felt that in these words was an implication that he intended to place his own son Sima Yan on the throne and they ceased to urge him to actIn the sixth month of that year Cao Huang Duke of Changdao was raised to the throne as Emperor the periodstyle being changed to Wonderful Beginning the first year Cao Huang was a son of Cao Yu Prince of Yan and a grandson of Cao CaoSima Zhao was made Prime Minister and Duke of Jin  Beside he received gifts of one hundred thousand gold coins and ten thousand rolls of silkAll the officers were promoted or received honors When these doings in Wei were told in Shu Jiang Wei seized upon them as pretext for another war to punish Wei for the deposition of its rulerSo letters were written calling upon Wu to help and a memorial was sent to the ThroneThe army raised was one hundred fifty thousand and there were many carts with boxes made to fit them Liao Hua and Zhang Yi were the Leaders of the Van Liao Hua was to march to the Ziwu Valley and Zhang Yi to the Luo Valley while Jiang Wei took the Xie Valley roadThey marched at the same time and hastened toward QishanDeng Ai was still on the Qishan Mountains training the Wei soldiers when he heard that the Shu armies were once more on the war path He called his officers togetherAnd Military Adviser Wang Guan said I have a plan to propose but I will not tell it openly However I have written it down for your consideration Deng Ai took the envelop opened and read itThough excellent I fear it is not enough to beguile the leader of Shu said Deng Ai as he finished readingI am willing to stake my life on it said Wang Guan and I will lead the way Since you have such confidence you may tryYou ought certainly to succeed So five thousand troops were put under the leadership of Wang Guan and they set out for the Xie Valley where they fell in with the scouts of Jiang Weis forceSeeing these their leader Wang Guan shouted We are deserterstell your leader So the scouts told Jiang Wei who replied Hold up the soldiers letting their leader only come to me Wang Guan went forward and kneeled before Jiang Wei saying I am a nephew of Wang Jing and I hate Sima Zhao for what he has done to the Emperor and my family and I wish to join you and my five thousand soldiers with meI also desire to be sent against the rebel crew that I may avenge my uncle Then said Jiang Wei Since you are sincere in your desertion I must be sincere in my treatment of youThe one thing my army needs is grainThere is plenty at the border of the Lands of Rivers and if you can transport it to Qishan I can go straightway and take the Qishan camps of Deng Ai This reply rejoiced Wang Guan who saw that Jiang Wei was just going to walk into the trap So he agreed at onceBut you will not need five thousand troops to see after the transportTake three thousand and leave two thousand as guides for me Wang Guan thinking that suspicions would be raised if he refused took the three thousand of his troops and marched away and the other two thousand were attached to the army of ShuThen Xiahou Ba was announced and when he was come in he said O Commander why have you believed the tale of this Wang GuanIn Wei I never heard that Wang Guan was related to Wang Jing though it is true I never made particular inquiriesYou should look to it for there is much pretense in his story I know Wang Guan is false said Jiang Wei with a smileThat is why I have taken away many of his forceI am meeting trick with trick How do you know for certain he is a false Sima Zhao is as crafty as Cao Cao If he slew all Wang Jings family would he have left a nephew and sent that nephew to the pass beyond his own reach with soldiersYou saw this as did I So Jiang Wei did not go out by the Xie Valley but he set an ambush there ready for any move of Wang GuanAnd indeed within ten days the ambush caught a man with a letter from Wang Guan to Deng Ai telling him what had come aboutFrom the letter and the bearer thereof Jiang Wei learned that Wang Guan would divert a convoy of grain to the Wei camps on the twentieth and Deng Ai was to send troops to Yunshan Valley to help Jiang Wei beheaded the courierThen he sent another letter to Deng Ai by a man dressed as a Wei soldier the date being altered to the fifteenth instead of the twentiethAs a preparation Jiang Wei ordered many wagons to be emptied of their grain and laden with inflammables covered with green cloth The two thousand Wei soldiers were ordered to show flags belonging to the Shu transport corpsThen Jiang Wei and Xiahou Ba went into the valleys in ambush while Jiang Shu was ordered to march to the Xie Valley and Liao Hua and Zhang Yi were sent to capture QishanThe letter apparently from Wang Guan was sufficient for Deng Ai and he wrote back to say it was agreedSo on the fifteenth day Deng Ai led out fifty thousand veteran troops and moved in sight near Yunshan Valley And the scouts saw endless carts of grain and fodder in the distance zigzagging through the mountains When Deng Ai got closer he distinguished the uniforms of WeiHis staff urged him saying It is getting dark O General hurry to help Wang Guan escort the convoy out of the valley The mountains ahead are hazardous said the generalIf by any chance an ambush has been laid we could hardly escapeWe will wait here But just then two horsemen came up at a gallop and said Just as General Wang Guan was crossing the frontier with the convoy he was pursued and reinforcements are urgently needed Deng Ai realizing the importance of the request gave orders to press onwardIt was the first watch and a full moon was shining as bright as day Shouting was heard behind the hills and he could only conclude it was the noise of the battle in which Wang Guan was engaged So Deng Ai dashed over the hillsBut suddenly a body of troops came out from the shelter of a grove of trees and at their head rode the Shu leader Fu Qian Deng Ai you are stupidYou have just fallen into the trap set for you by our generalDismount and prepare for death Deng Ai halted and turned to fleeThen the wagons burst into flame That flame was a signal and down came the army of ShuHe heard shouts all round him A thousand ounces of gold for anyone who captures Deng Ai and a lordship of ten thousand households as well Terrified Deng Ai dropped his arms threw aside his armor slipped from his steed mingled with the footmen and with them scrambled up the hillsThe generals of Shu only looked for him among the mounted leaders never guessing that he had got away among the common soldiers So he was not capturedJiang Wei gathered in his victorious army and went to meet Wang Guan and his convoyHaving made all arrangements as he thought complete Wang Guan was patiently awaiting the development of his scheme when a trusted subordinate came and told him that the ruse had been discovered and Deng Ai had already suffered defeat Wang Guan sent out some scouts and the report was confirmed with the addition that the Shu armies were coming against him Moreover clouds of dust were risingThere was no way of escape so Wang Guan ordered his troops to set fire to the convoy and soon huge flames were rising high into the air The case is desperate cried Wang GuanIt is a fight to the death He led his force westward but the army of Shu came in pursuitJiang Wei thought Wang Guan would try at all costs to get back to his own side but instead Wang Guan went on toward Hanzhong and as his troops were too few to risk a battle Wang Guan ordered them to burn and destroy all military stations and even the Plank Trail as he wentFearing the loss of Hanzhong Jiang Wei made all haste along the byroads after Wang GuanSurrounded on all sides Wang Guan jumped into the Black Dragon River and so diedThose of his soldiers who survived were slain by Jiang WeiThough a victory had been won and Wang Guan killed it was costly Many wagons and much grain had been lost and the Plank Trail had been destroyed Jiang Wei led his army into HanzhongDeng Ai made his way back to Qishan From there he reported his defeat to the Ruler of Wei and asked for degradation as a penaltyHowever Sima Zhao saw that Deng Ai had rendered good services so he did not degrade the general but on the other hand sent him magnificent gifts which Deng Ai distributed to the families of the soldiers who had been killedSima Zhao also sent him fifty thousand troops as reinforcement lest Shu should attack againJiang Wei set about the restoration of the Plank Trail ready for the next expeditionRepair the roads for marching feet to tread The strife will only cease when all are dead The next chapter will tell who wonCHAPTER  Listening To Slander The Latter Ruler Recalls His Army Living In Farms Jiang Wei Avoids DisasterIn the autumn of the fifth year of Wonderful Sight in ShuHan calendar  Jiang Wei was occupied with preparations for the renewal of an attack mending the hill roads gathering stores and mobilizing his boats on the waterways of Hanzhong These things done he memorized the Throne asking permission to go again to the attackAlthough I have not been wholly victorious nor accomplished great things yet I have put fear into the hearts of the Wei armiesOur soldiers have been long under training and they must now be used or the army will go to pieces for lack of exerciseThe soldiers are ready to die the officers prepared for all risks and I am determined to conquer or perish The Latter Ruler did not consent at onceAs he was hesitating Qiao Zhou stood forth and said I have observed the heavensI have seen the leader stars in Shu dull and obscuredThis expedition will be disastrous and I hope Your Majesty will not approve The Latter Ruler replied Let us see the results of this campaign if it fails then the war shall cease Qiao Zhou resented the rejection of his advice withdrew to his home and retired on the pretext of illnessAs the final preparations were being made Jiang Wei said to Liao Hua We are pledged to get through to the Middle Land this time what do you advise to start with I dare not presume to advise you GeneralFor years we have been fighting and giving the people no restIn Deng Ai we find a most formidable and resourceful opponent and an extraordinarily capable man so that you must exert yourself to the very utmost Jiang Wei was annoyedSaid he The late Prime Minister made six attempts all for the stateI have attacked eight times Was any one of those attacks to serve my private endsThis time I go to attack Taoyang and no one shall say me nayI will punish opposition with death Jiang Wei left Liao Hua in charge of the base in Hanzhong and marched with three hundred thousand troops to TaoyangHis movements were reported in the Qishan camps and Deng Ais spies confirmed the newsIt happened that Sima Wang was with Deng Ai discussing military matters and the former when he heard it said That move is a blind he does not mean itWhat he really intends is an attack on Qishan However he has really gone to Taoyang said Deng Ai How can you know Formerly Jiang Wei has always opened with a march to those parts of the country where we have stored supplies Taoyang has no stores so he thinks we shall not have taken care for its defense as we shall concentrate our efforts on QishanBut if he can take that place he can collect stores there and get into touch with the Qiang tribespeople and finally work out some grand plan Supposing this true what should we do I advise the abandonment of this place and a march in two bodies toward TaoyangI know a small town called Houxia eight miles from Taoyang which is the throat of the placeYou go to Taoyang hide your force and open the gates Then act as I shall tell you presently I will lie in wait at HouxiaWe shall score a victory Deng Ai gave Shi Zuan the command of the camps in Qishan when the main body leftMeanwhile Xiahou Ba led the van of the Shu army toward Taoyang As he drew near he noticed the place seemed to have no defenses not a flag staff reared its head The gates stood wide openHe was too wary to go straight in however and said Is there any ruse in there His generals said We think the city was deserted when they heard your army comingA few people were running away along the southern road Xiahou Ba rode south and saw there that the northwest road at a little distance from the city was crowded with fugitivesThe city is really empty said Xiahou BaHe led the way in all ready to fight and the troops followedAs they came near to the curtain wall however a bomb exploded At this sound the drums beat trumpets blared and flags suddenly appeared At the same moment the drawbridge rose Caught said Xiahou BaAs he turned to retire the arrows and stones flew down in clouds and under these Xiahou Ba and many of his soldiers lost their livesMost able strategist and brave Xiahou Ba outwitted here By Deng Ai more prudent still and slain Deserves a pitying tearThe flights of arrows from the ramparts was followed by a sortie which broke up the force of Shu entirely and the troops fledHowever Jiang Wei came up and drove Sima Wang back into the city The army of Shu camped beside the wallsJiang Wei was very grieved at the loss of Xiahou BaThat night Deng Ai came up secretly and attacked the Shu camp At the same time the defenders within the city made a sortieJiang Wei could not resist the double attack and left the field He marched some seven miles and campedTwice beaten the soldiers of Shu were very downcastJiang Wei tried to console them saying Loss or gain is the platitude of war but I am not worried yet about our recent defeats for a total victory will surely come in this expedition if all of you strive your bestBut remember no mutinyHe who talks of retreat will suffer death Then Zhang Yi said With so many troops of Wei here their camp at Qishan must be undefendedI propose General that while you continue the contest here with Deng Ai I go to try to capture the nine campsIf I succeed Changan will be at our mercy The second division of the army was detached to march on Qishan and Jiang Wei went down to Houxia to provoke Deng Ai into fightingThe challenge this time was accepted forthwithDeng Ai led his troops out and engaged with Jiang Wei in a fight but after thirty bouts without a decision both retired to their campsFor days after this Jiang Wei challenged again and again but Deng Ai declined and would not fightThe Shu soldiers howled abuse and hurled insults at their opponents but all without effect Then Deng Ai thought within him There must be some reason for this persistenceI think they have sent an army to try to seize Qishan while they hold me hereShi Zuan and the force there are insufficient and I shall have to go to the rescue Deng Ai called his son Deng Zhong and said Hold this place most carefully Let them challenge as they may do not go outTonight I go to the help of Qishan It was night and Jiang Wei was in his tent intent upon his plans when he was disturbed by a great shouting and drumming They told him Deng Ai had suddenly appearedThe generals asked leave to go out to fight Let no one move said Jiang WeiThe fact was Deng Ai had only made a demonstration at the camp of Shu on his way to reinforce QishanThen Jiang Wei said to his officers The attack of Deng Ai was a feint he has certainly gone to relieve Qishan So Jiang Wei decided to go to the aid of Zhang YiHe left Fu Qian to guard the camp and he marched away with three thousand troops Zhang Yi was then actually attacking the Wei position on QishanShi Zuan had few troops and it looked as though the defenders must soon give in when the sudden appearance of Deng Ai made all the difference The onslaught of Deng Ais force drove off Zhang Yi and he was forced to take refuge behind the hills No road was open to himWhen things looked worst he saw the Wei soldiers suddenly falling back in confusionGeneral Jiang Wei has come they told him Zhang Yi took the opportunity to return to the attack and the tables were turnedDeng Ai lost the fight and retired into his camp which Jiang Wei surrounded and attacked vigorouslyIn Chengdu the Latter Ruler fell daily more and more under the malign influence of Huang Hao who encouraged him in every form of selfindulgence and ministered to every desire for luxury and dissipation Government was left to look after itselfAt that time High Minister Liu Yan had a very beautiful wife Lady HuOne day she went into the Palace to visit the Empress who kept her there a whole month Liu Yan was not without suspecting an intrigue with the Latter Ruler and took a brutal revengeHe bound Lady Hu and made five hundred of his soldiers shame her to the last degree by beating her on the face with their boots She swooned many timesThe story got to the ears of the Latter Ruler and he ordered the officials concerned to investigate and decide the crime and its punishment The judges found thatSoldiers are not proper persons to administer a punishment to a woman and the face is not a portion of the body to be mortified the author of this crime ought to be put to death Wherefore Liu Yan was beheadedAs time went on the Latter Ruler indulged in unbridled sensuality and gradually all good people left the government giving place to the meanest who soon swarmed thereAmong the sycophants of Huang Hao was Yan Yu General of the Right Army whose lack of merit had not stood in the way of prefermentHearing of Jiang Weis defeats at Qishan Yan Yu got his friend Huang Hao to propose to the Latter Ruler saying Jiang Wei should be recalled as he has not been able to score a decisive victoryYan Yu can be sent to replace him The Latter Ruler agreed and the edict was issuedOne day as Jiang Wei was working out his plan of attack on the camps of Wei three edicts came all to the same effect recalling him to the capitalDisobedience being out of the question Jiang Wei ceased all operations and sent the Taoyang force back first Then gradually he withdrew the othersDeng Ai in his camp wondered at the rolling of drums one night but next day he heard that the Shu camps were emptyHowever he suspected some ruse and did not pursueArrived in Hanzhong the army halted and Jiang Wei went on to the capital in company with the messenger who had brought his ordersHere he waited ten days and still the Latter Ruler held no courtHe began to suspect mischiefOne day near the palace gate he met Secretary General Xi Zheng and asked Do you know the reason for my recall What General Do you not knowHuang Hao wanted to push Yan Yu into favor so he intrigued for your recallNow they have found out Deng Ai is too clever to be tackled and so they are not fighting any more I shall certainly have to put this eunuch fellow out of the way said Jiang WeiYou are the successor of the Martial Lord Zhuge Liang the man to whom he bequeathed his unfinished task You are too important to act hastily or indiscreetlyIf the Emperor withdrew his support it would go ill with you Sir what you say is true replied Jiang WeiHowever soon after this Jiang Wei with a small party got into the Palace The Latter Ruler was enjoying himself with Huang Hao in the gardensThey told Huang Hao who at once hid himselfJiang Wei approached his master and prostrated himself saying Why did Your Majesty recall me I had the enemy in my power at Qishan when the triple edict came The Latter Ruler hummed and hawed but made no reply Then Jiang Wei began his real grievance This Huang Hao is wicked and artful and seems to have the last say in everythingThe times of the Emperor Ling and the Ten Regular Attendants have returnedYour Majesty may recall Zhang Rang recently or Zhao Gao in the old time but if you will only slay this man the court will be purified and you may return gloriously to the home of your fathers The Latter Ruler smiled saying Huang Hao is but a minor servant one who runs errands for me If he tried to do as you say he could notI always wondered why Dong Yun seemed to hate poor Huang Hao so much Now you are the sameI pray you noble Sir take no notice of him Unless Your Majesty gets rid of him evil is very close said Jiang Wei beating his head upon the groundThe Latter Ruler replied If you love anyone you want him to live if you dislike him you desire his death can you not bear with my one poor eunuch The Latter Ruler bade one of the attendants go and call Huang HaoWhen Huang Hao approached the pavilion the Latter Ruler told him to ask pardon of Jiang Wei Huang Hao prostrated himself and wept saying I am always in attendance upon the Sacred One that is all I do I never meddle in state affairsI pray you General pay no heed to what people sayIf you desire my death I am in your hands but pity me And tears ran down his cheeksJiang Wei went away in ill humor Outside he sought his friend Xi Zheng and told him what had happenedGeneral you are in grave danger said Xi ZhengAnd if you fall the country falls with you Can you advise me said Jiang WeiHow can I secure the state and myself Xi Zheng replied There is a place of refuge for you in Longxi and that is TazhongIt is a rich country and you can make a cantonment there like the Martial Lord did Request the Emperor to let you go thitherYou can gather in corn and wheat for your armies you can secure all the west of Longyou you can keep Wei from troubling Hanzhong you will retain your military authority so that no one will dare intrigue against you and you will be safe Thus you can ensure the safety of the state and yourselfYou should lose no time Your speech is gold and jewels said Jiang Wei gratefullyWithout loss of time Jiang Wei memorialized the Throne and obtained the Latter Rulers consentThen he returned to Hanzhong assembled his officers and told them his plans Our many expeditions have failed to achieve success owing to lack of suppliesNow I am about to take eighty thousand troops to Tazhong to form a cantonment and grow wheat and corn ready for the next expeditionYou are spent with much fighting and may now repose while collecting grain and guarding HanzhongThe armies of Wei are from home and have to drag their grain over the mountainsThey will be worn out with the labor and must soon retireThat will he the time to smite them and success must be ours Hu Ji was set over Hanshou Wang Han over Yuecheng Jiang Bin over Hancheng and Jiang Shu and Fu Qian went to guard the passesAfter these arrangements had been made Jiang Wei went off to Tazhong to grow grain and mature his plansDeng Ai heard of these dispositions and discovered that the armies of Shu were distributed in fortyeight camps each connected with the next like the joints of a huge serpentHe sent out his spies to survey the country and they made a map which was sent to the capitalBut when the Duke of Jin Sima Zhao saw the memorial and the map he was very angry This Jiang Wei has invaded our country many times and we have been unable to destroy himHe is the one sorrow of my heart Said Jia Chong He has carried on the work of Zhuge Liang only too thoroughly and it is hard to force him backWhat you need is some crafty brave to assassinate him so remove this constant menace of war But Adviser Xun Xu said That is not the wayLiu Shan the Ruler of Shu is steeped in dissipation and has given all his confidence to one favorite the eunuch Huang HaoThe higher officers of state are concerned solely with their own safety and Jiang Wei has gone to Tazhong only that he may save his life If you send an able leader and a strong army victory is certainWhere is the need for an assassins dagger These are excellent words said Sima Zhao with a laugh but if I would attack Shu where is the leader Deng Ai is the ablest leader of the day said Xun XuGive him Zhong Hui as his second and the thing is done Exactly what I think said Sima ZhaoSo he summoned Zhong Hui and said to him I desire to send you as leader against Wu can you go My lords design is not against Wu but Shu was his replyHow well you know my inmost thought said Sima ZhaoBut how would you conduct an expedition against Shu Thinking that my lord would desire to attack Shu I have already prepared plansHere they are He laid out his maps and thereon were shown the camps and storehouses and roads all complete Sima Zhao was highly pleasedYou are an excellent leader said heWhat say you to going with Deng Ai The Lands of Rivers is large and there is space for more than one set of operationsDeng Ai can be sent along another line Zhong Hui was given the title of General Who Conquers the West and the insignia of a CommanderinChief over the forces within the pass and control of the armies of Qingzhou Xuzhou Yanzhou Yuzhou Jingzhou and YangzhouAt the same time a commission with authority flag was sent to Deng Ai giving him command of the forces without the pass with the title of General Who Conquers the West And the time for an attack on Shu was settledWhen Sima Zhao was settling the plans in the court General Deng Dun said Why are you sending our armies into a distant and dangerous country and thus inviting trouble Jiang Wei has invaded this country many times and the wars have cost us many livesWe should rather seek safety in defense I am sending a righteous army against an unrighteous ruler how dare you oppose my designs Sima Zhao ordered the executioners to put Deng Dun to death forthwith and they soon returned to lay his head at the foot of the stepsThis frightened all those present and they turned paleSima Zhao said It is six years since I conquered the east and the six years have been spent in preparation I have long intended to reduce both Wu and Shu Now I will destroy Shu and then like a flood I will descend upon Wu and conquer thatThat is the method destroy Guo to capture Yu I can tell very nearly what forces they have in Shu There are eighty or ninety thousand troops in the garrison of Capital Chengdu forty or fifty thousand on the frontier while Jiang Wei has about sixty thousand in his cantonmentsAgainst them we can pit one hundred thousand troops under Deng Ai enough to hold Jiang Wei and keep him from moving east and Zhong Hui has two or three hundred thousand veteransAnd they will go in three divisions straight into HanzhongLiu Shan the Ruler of Shu is a blind fool with his frontier cities in ruins his courtiers and women quaking with fear He will not last long The assembly praised this perspicacityZhong Hui marched as soon as he received his seal of officeLest his real object should be known he gave out that his force was directed against Wu and to give color to the pretense he had many large ships built in Qingzhou Yanzhou Yuzhou Jingzhou and YangzhouHe also sent Tang Zi along the coastal regions of Dengzhou and Laizhou to collect vesselsEven his chief Sima Zhao was deceived and called him to ask why he was collecting shipsZhong Hui replied If Shu hears that we intend to attack the west they will ask assistance from WuSo I pretend to attack Wu and Wu will not dare to move under a year When Shu is beaten the ships will be ready and useful for an expedition into the East Sima Zhao was pleasedThe day chosen for the march was the third day of the seventh mouth in the fourth year of Wonderful Beginning in Wei calendar Sima Zhao escorted his leader out of the city for three miles and then took his leave Shao Ti Minister of the Western Affairs whispered a word of warningMy lord has sent Zhong Hui with a large army against ShuI think he is too ambitious to be trusted with such powers Think you I do not know said Sima ZhaoThen why have you sent him alone and without a colleague Sima Zhao said a few words to Shao Ti which put his doubts at restZhong Hui went alone although his master knew Occasion serving he would be untrueThe next chapter will tell the reader what Shao Ti heardCHAPTER  On Hanzhong Roads Zhong Hui Divides The Army In Dingjun Mountain The Martial Lord Shows His Apparition The words whispered in the ear of Shao Ti proved Sima Zhaos subtlety Said he This morning the officers all maintained that Shu should not be attacked because they are timidIf I let them lead the army they would surely be defeatedYou saw Zhong Hui was set upon his plan and he is not afraidShu must therefore be beaten and then the Shu peoples hearts will be tornBeaten leaders cannot boast and the officers of a broken state are no fit guardians of its welfareWhen Zhong Hui turns against us the people of Shu cannot support him and our troops being victors they will wish to return home and will not follow their leader into revolt Hence there is nothing to be fearedI know this as you do but it must remain our secret Shao Ti understoodIn his camp just prior to his march Zhong Hui assembled his officers among them were Military Inspector Wei Guan Marching General Hu Lie Generals Tian Xu Tian Zhang Yuan Xing Qiu Jian Xiahou Xian Wang Mai Huangfu Kai Gou An and others some eighty of themFirstly I want a Leader of the Van said Zhong HuiHe must be skilled in making roads and repairing bridges I will take that post said a voice and the speaker was Xu Yi son of the Tiger Leader Xu Chu Nobody is fitter cried all present You shall have the seal said Zhong HuiYou are lithe and strong and have the renown of your father to maintain Beside all your colleagues recommend youYour force shall be five thousand of cavalry and a thousand of footmenYou are to march into Hanzhong in three divisions the center you will lead through the Xie Valley the other two passing through the Luo and Ziwu ValleysYou must level and repair the roads put the bridges in order bore tunnels and break away rocksUse all diligence for any delay will entail punishment Xu Yi was told to set out immediately and his chief would follow with one hundred thousand troopsIn Longxi as soon as Deng Ai received his orders to attack Shu he sent Sima Wang to keep the Qiangs in check Next he summoned Zhuge Xu Imperial Protector of Yongzhou Wang Qi Governor of Tianshui Qian Hong Governor of Longxi and Yang Xin Governor of Jincheng and soon soldiers gathered in Longxi like cloudsOne night Deng Ai dreamed a dream wherein he was climbing a lofty mountain on the way into Hanzhong Suddenly a spring of water gushed out at his feet and boiled up with great force so that he was alarmed He awoke all in a sweat and did not sleep again but sat awaiting the dawnAt daybreak he summoned his guard Shao Yuan who was skilled in the Book of Changes told him the dream and asked the interpretationShao Yuan replied According to the book water on a mountain signifies the diagram Jian whereunder we find that the southwest augurs well but the northeast is unpropitiousConfucius said of Jian that it meant advantage in the southwest ie success but the northeast spelt failure ie there was no roadIn this expedition General you will overcome Shu but you will not have a road to return Deng Ai listened growing more and more sad as the interpretation of his dream was unfoldedJust then came dispatches from Zhong Hui asking him to advance into Hanzhong togetherDeng Ai at once sent Zhuge Xu with fifteen thousand troops to cut off Jiang Weis retreat and Wang Qi was to lead fifteen thousand troops to attack Tazhong from the left Qian Hong was to march fifteen thousand troops to attack Tazhong from the right and Yang Xin with fifteen thousand troops was to block Jiang Wei at GansongDeng Ai took command of a force to go to and fro and reinforce whatever body needed helpMeanwhile in the camp of Zhong Hui all the officials came out to see him depart It was a grand sight the gay banners shutting out the sun breastplates and helmets glittering The soldiers were fit and the horses in good conditionThey all felicitated the leader All save one for Liu Shi was silent He smiled grimlyThen Commander Wang Xiang made his way through the crowd and said Do you think these twoZhong Hui and Deng Aiwill overcome Shu Said Liu Shi They will overcome Shu certainly only I think neither will ever come back Why do you say that But Liu Shi did not reply he only smiledAnd the question was not repeatedThe armies of Wei were on the march when Jiang Wei heard of the intended attack He at once sent up a memorial asking that certain defensive arrangements be madeZhang Yi Left Commander of the Flying Cavalry was to guard the Yangping Pass and Liao Hua Right Commander of the Flying Cavalry was to command at the Yinping Bridge in Yinping which were the two most important points upon which depended the security of HanzhongHe also sent to engage the help of Wu and gathered soldiers in Tazhong ready for the marchThat year in Shu the reignstyle had been changed from Wonderful Sight the fifth year to Joyful Prosperity the first year  When the memorial of Jiang Wei came to the Latter Ruler it found him as usual amusing himself with his favorite Huang HaoHe read the document and said to the eunuch Here Jiang Wei says that the Wei armies under Deng Ai and Zhong Hui are on the way against us What shall we do There is nothing of the sortJiang Wei only wants to get a name for himself and so he says thisYour Majesty need feel no alarm for we can find out the truth from a certain wise woman I knowShe is a real prophetess May I call her The Latter Ruler consented and a room was fitted up for the seance They prepared therein incense flowers paper candles sacrificial articles and so on and then Huang Hao went with a chariot to beg the wise woman to attend upon the Latter Ruler She came and was seated on the Dragon CouchAfter the Latter Ruler had kindled the incense and repeated the prayer the wise woman suddenly let down her hair dropped her slippers and capered about barefoot After several rounds of this she coiled herself up on a tableHuang Hao then said The spirit has now descendedSend everyone away and pray to her So the attendants were dismissed and the Latter Ruler entreated the wise womanSuddenly she cried out I am the guardian spirit of the Western Land of RiversYour Majesty rejoices in tranquillity why do you inquire about other mattersWithin a few years the land of Wei shall come under you wherefore you need not be sorrowful She then fell to the ground as in a swoon and it was some time before she revivedThe Latter Ruler was well satisfied with her prophesy and gave her large presents Further he thereafter believed all she told himThe immediate result was that Jiang Weis memorial remained unanswered and as the Latter Ruler was wholly given to pleasure it was easy for Huang Hao to intercept all urgent memorials from the generalMeanwhile Zhong Hui was hastening toward HanzhongThe VanLeader Xu Yi was anxious to perform some startling exploit and so he led his force to NanzhengHe said to his officers If we can take this pass then we can march directly into Hanzhong the defense is weak A dash was made for the fort each one vying with the rest to be firstBut the commander of Nanzheng was Lu Xun and he had had early information of the coming of his enemies So on both sides of the bridge he posted soldiers armed with multiple bows and crossbowsAs soon as the attacking force appeared the signal was given by a clapper and a terrific discharge of arrows and bolts openedMany troops of Wei fell and the army of Xu Yi was defeatedXu Yi returned and reported his misfortuneZhong Hui himself went with a hundred armored horsemen to see the conditions Again the machine bows let fly clouds of missiles and Zhong Hui turned to fleeBut Lu Xun led out five hundred troops to pursue and as Zhong Hui crossed the bridge at a gallop the roadway gave and his horses hoof went through so that he was nearly thrownThe horse could not free its hoof and Zhong Hui slipped from his back and fled on footAs he ran down the slope of the bridge Lu Xun came at him with a spear but one of Zhong Huis followers Xun Kai by name shot an arrow at Lu Xun and brought him to the earth Seeing this lucky hit Zhong Hui turned back and signaled to his force to make an attackThey came on with a dash the defenders were afraid to shoot as their own troops were mingled with the enemy and soon Zhong Hui crushed the defense and possessed the pass The defenders scatteredThe pass being captured Xun Kai was well rewarded for the shot that had saved his generals life He was promoted to the guards and received presents of a horse and a suit of armorXu Yi was called to the tent and Zhong Hui blamed him for the lack of care in his task saying You were appointed Leader of the Van to see that the roads were put in repair and your special duty was to see that the bridges were in good conditionYet on the bridge just now my horses hoof was caught and I nearly fellHappily Xun Kai was by or I had been slainYou have been disobedient and must bear the penalty The delinquent was sentenced to deathThe other generals tried to beg him off pleading His father is Xu Chu who had rendered good services to the state How can discipline be maintained if the laws are not enforced said Zhong HuiThe sentence was carried out and the unhappy Xu Yis head was exposed as a warningThis severity put fear into the hearts of the officersOn the side of Shu Wang Han commanded at Yuecheng and Jiang Bin was in Hancheng As the enemy came in great force they dared not go out to meet them but stood on the defensive with the gates of the cities closedZhong Hui issued an order Speed is the soul of war no halts Li Fu was ordered to lay siege to Yuecheng and Xun Kai was to surround Hancheng The main army under Zhong Hui would capture the Yangping Pass The Shu General Fu Qian commanded at the pass He discussed plans with Jiang Shu his second in command and Jiang Shu was wholly in favor of defense saying The enemy is too strong to think of any other course I do not agree replied Fu QianThey are now fatigued with marching and we need not fear themUnless we go out and attack the two cities will fall Jiang Shu made no replySoon the enemy arrived and both officers went up to the wall and looked outAs soon as Zhong Hui saw them he shouted We have here a host of one hundred thousand If you yield you shall have higher rank than you hold now but if you persist in holding out then when we take the pass you shall all perishJewels and pebbles will share the same destruction This threat angered Fu QianHe bade Jiang Shu guard the walls and he went down to give battle taking three thousand troopsHe attacked and Zhong Hui retreatedFu Qian pursued But soon the army of Wei closed up their ranks and counterattackedFu Qian turned to retire but when he reached his own defenses he saw they flew the flags of Wei the banners of Shu had goneI have yielded cried Jiang Shu from the ramparts Fu Qian shouted angrily Ungrateful and treacherous rogue How can you ever face the world again But that did no goodFu Qian turned to go once more into the battle He was soon surroundedHe fought desperately but could not win clearHis troops fell one by one and when they were reduced to one out of ten he cried Alive I have been a servant of Shu dead I will be one of their spirits Fu Qian forced his way into the thickest of the fightThen his steed fell and as he was grievously wounded he put an end to his own lifeThe loyalty Fu Qian showed in stressful days Won him a thousand autumns noble praise The base Jiang Shu lived on a life disgraced One would prefer the death that Fu Qian facedWith the Yangping Pass falling into the hands of Zhong Hui were great booty of grain and weaponsHe feasted the army and that night they rested in the city of YanganHowever the night was disturbed by sounds as of people shouting so that Zhong Hui got up and went out thinking there must be an attack But the sounds ceased and he returned to his couchHowever he and his army could not sleepNext night the same thing happened shoutings in the southwestAs soon as day dawned scouts went out to search but they came back to say they had gone three miles and found no sign of any Shu soldierZhong Hui did not feel satisfied so he took a hundred cavalrymen and rode in the same direction to explorePresently they happened upon a hill of sinister aspect overhung by angry clouds while the summit was wreathed in mistWhat hill is that asked Zhong Hui pulling up to question the guidesIt is known as the Dingjun Mountain was the replyIt is where Xiahou Yuan met his death This did not sound cheering at all and Zhong Hui turned back to camp greatly depressedRounding the curve of a hill he came full into a violent gust of wind and there suddenly appeared a large body of horse coming down the wind as if to attackThe whole party galloped off panicstricken Zhong Hui leading the wayMany generals fell from their steedsYet when they arrived at the pass not a man was missing although there were many with bruises and cuts from the falls and many had lost helmetsEveryone had seen phantom horsemen who did no harm when they came near but melted away in the windZhong Hui called the surrendered general Jiang Shu and asked Is there any temple to any supernatural being on the Dingjun Mountain No replied he there is nothing but the tomb of Zhuge Liang Then this must have been a manifestation of Zhuge Liang said Zhong HuiI ought to sacrifice to him So he prepared presents and slew an ox and offered sacrifice at the tomb and when the sacrifice had been completed the wind calmed and the dark clouds dispersedThere followed a cool breeze and a gentle shower and the sky clearedPleased with the evidence of the acceptance of their offerings the sacrificial party returned to campThat night Zhong Hui fell asleep in his tent with his head resting on a small table Suddenly a cool breeze began to blow and he saw a figure approaching clad in Taoist garb turban feather fan white robe of Taoist cut bound with a black girdle The countenance of the figure was as refined as jade the lips a deep red and the eyes clear The figure moved with the calm serenity of a godWho are you Sir asked Zhong Hui rising Out of gratitude for your kindly visit this morning I would make a communicationThough the Hans have declined and the mandate of the Eternal cannot be disobeyed yet the people of the west exposed to the inevitable miseries of war are to be pitiedAfter you have passed the frontier do not slay ruthlessly Then the figure disappeared with a flick of the sleeves of its robe nor would it stay to answer any questionsZhong Hui awoke and knew that he had been dreaming but he felt that the spirit of Zhuge Liang the Martial Lord had visited him and he was astonishedHe issued an order that the leading division of his army should bear a white flag with four words plainly written thereon Secure state comfort people so that all might know that no violence was to be fearedIf anyone was slain wantonly then the offender should pay with his own lifeThis tender care was greatly appreciated so that the invaders were welcomed in every step Zhong Hui soothed the people and they suffered no injuryThose phantom armies circling in the gleam Moved Zhong Hui to sacrifice at Zhuge Liangs tomb For Lius had Zhuge Liang wrought unto the end Though dead he would the Han people still defendJiang Wei at Tazhong heard of the invasion and wrote to his three generalsZhang Yi Liao Hua and Dong Jueto march against the enemy while he prepared to repulse them if they came to his station Soon they came and he went out to encounter themTheir leader was Wang Qi Governor of TianshuiWhen near enough Wang Qi shouted Our forces are numbered by millions our generals by thousands Two hundred thousand are marching against you and Chengdu has already fallenIn spite of this you do not yield wherefore it is evident you do not recognize the divine command Jiang Wei cut short this tirade by galloping out with his spear setWang Qi stood three bouts and then fled Jiang Wei pursued but seven miles away he met a cohort drawn up across the road On the banner he read that the leader was Qian Hong Governor of Longxi Dead ratNo match for me said Jiang Wei smilingDespising this antagonist he led his army straight on and the enemy fell back He drove them before him for three more miles and then came upon Deng AiA battle at once began and the lust of battle held out in the breast of Jiang Wei for a score of bouts But neither could overbear the other Then in the Shu rear arose the clang of gongs and other signs of coming foesJiang Wei retired the way he had come and presently one came to report The Governor of Jincheng Yang Xin has destroyed the camps at Gansong This was evil tidingsHe bade his generals keep his own standard flying and hold Deng Ai while he went to try to recover the campsOn the way he met Yang Xin but Yang Xin had no stomach for a fight with Jiang Wei and made for the hillsJiang Wei followed till he came to a precipice down which the enemy were hurling boulders and logs of wood so that he could not passJiang Wei turned to go back to the battlefield he had just left but on the way he met the army of Wei for Deng Ai had crushed his generalsJiang Wei was surrounded but presently got clear with a sudden rush and hastened to the great camp Next came the newsZhong Hui has defeated the Yangping Pass Jiang Shu has surrendered while Fu Qian has fallen in the fieldHanzhong is now in the possession of Wei Wang Han of Yuecheng and Jiang Bin of Hancheng has also opened their gates and yielded to the invaders at the loss of HanzhongHu Ji has gone to Chengdu for help This greatly troubled Jiang Wei so he broke camp and set out for HanzhongThat night the Shu army reached the Frontier River Pass An army under Yang Xin barred his way and again Jiang Wei was forced to fightHe rode out in a great rage and as Yang Xin fled he shot at him thrice but his arrows missedThrowing aside his bow he gripped his spear and set off in pursuit but his horse tripped and fell and Jiang Wei lay on the groundYang Xin turned to slay his enemy now that he was on foot but Jiang Wei thrust Yang Xins horse in the headOther Wei troops came up rescued Yang XinMounting another steed of his follower Jiang Wei was just setting out again in pursuit when they reported that Deng Ai was coming against his rearRealizing that he could not cope with this new force Jiang Wei collected his troops in order to retreat into Hanzhong However the scouts reportedZhuge Xu Imperial Protector of Yongzhou is holding Yinping Bridge our retreat path So Jiang Wei halted and made a camp in the mountainsAdvance and retreat seemed equally impossible and he cried in anguish Heaven is destroying me Then said Ning Sui one of his generals If our enemies are blocking Yinping Bridge they can only have left a weak force in Yongzhou We can make believe to be going thither through the Konghan Valley and so force them to abandon the bridge in order to protect the cityWhen the bridge is clear you can make a dash for Saber Pass and plan for a recapture of Hanzhong This plan seemed to promise success so Jiang Wei ordered them to march into the Konghan Valley making as though they would go to YongzhouWhen Zhuge Xu who was at the Yinping Bridge heard this he said in great shock Yongzhou is my own city and headquarters if it would be lost I would be punished So Zhuge Xu set off to its relief by the south roadHe left only a small force at the bridge Jiang Wei marched along the north road for ten miles till he guessed that Zhuge Xu had abandoned the bridge when he reversed his course making the rearguard the van He dispersed the small force left at the bridge head and burned their campZhuge Xu as he marched saw the flames and he turned back to the bridge but he arrived too late The army of Shu had already crossed and he dared not pursueSoon after Jiang Wei crossed the bridge he saw another force but this was led by his own generals Liao Hua and Zhang YiThey told him Huang Hao firm in his faith in the wise woman would not send help to defend the frontiersWe heard Hanzhong was threatened and thus marched there to its rescue but then Zhong Hui had taken the Yangping PassWe also heard you were surrounded here so we came to your help The two armies amalgamated and marched togetherLiao Hua said We are attacked all round and the grain transportation is blockedIt seems to me wisest to retire on the Saber Pass and plan other designs But Jiang Wei was doubtfulThen they heard that Deng Ai and Zhong Hui were approaching in ten divisionsJiang Wei was disposed to stand but Liao Hua said This country of White Water is too narrow and difficult to fight in with any hope of success It would better to retreat to the Saber PassIf we loss that pass all paths will be closed to us At last Jiang Wei consented and the march beganBut as they neared the pass they heard drums rolling and saw flags fluttering which told them that the pass was heldHanzhong that strong defense is lost And storm clouds gather round Saber PassWhat force was at the pass will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER  Deng Ai Gets Through The Yinping Mountains Zhuge Zhan Falls In The Battlefield Of MianzhuWhen Dong Jue General Who Upholds the State heard of the invasion of Wei in ten divisions he brought to the frontier twenty thousand troops to Saber PassAnd when the dust showed an approaching army Dong Jue thought it wise to go to the Pass lest the coming armies should be enemies to be stoppedBut Dong Jue found that the newcomers were Jiang Wei Liao Hua and Zhang Yi he let them pass through and gave them the news from the capital bad news of the deeds of both the Latter Ruler and Huang HaoBut do not grieve said Jiang Wei so long as I live I will not allow Wei to come and conquer Shu They kept good guard at Saber Pass while they discussed future plansThough we are holding this pass yet Chengdu is wellnigh empty of soldiers said Dong JueIf it was attacked it would go crack Jiang Wei replied The natural defenses of Chengdu are excellent it is hard to cross over the mountains and climb the steep roads No one need fear Soon after this Zhuge Xu appeared at the pass challenging the defenders Jiang Wei forthwith placed himself at the head of five thousand troops and went down to meet the Wei armyHe gained an easy victory slaying many of the enemy and taking much spoil in horses and weaponsWhile Jiang Wei went back to the pass the defeated Zhuge Xu made his way to Zhong Huis camp seven miles away to confess his failure His general was very angryMy orders to you were to hold Yinping Bridge so as to stop Jiang Wei and you lost itNow without any orders you attack and are defeated Jiang Wei played so many deceitful tricksHe pretended to be going to take Yongzhou and I thought that was very important so I sent troops to rescue it Then he meanly got awayI followed to the pass but never thought he would come out and defeat my troops Zhuge Xu pleaded thus but he was sentenced to dieNow Wei Guan Army Inspector said Zhuge Xu is really a subordinate of Deng Ai and admitting that he is in fault his punishment should not have been pronounced by you O Commander But Zhong Hui swaggeringly replied I have a command from the Emperor and orders from the Prime Minister to attack Shu if Deng Ai himself offended I would behead him However other leaders interceded for Zhuge Xu and Zhong Hui did not put him to death but sent him a caged prisoner to the capital to be judgedThe surviving soldiers were added to Zhong Huis army This insolent speech of Zhong Hui was duly repeated to Deng Ai who was angry in his turn and said His rank and mine are the sameI have held a frontier post for years and sustained many fatigues in the countrys service Who is he that he gives himself such airs His son Deng Zhong endeavored to appease his wrathFather if you cannot suffer small things you may upset the grand policy of the stateUnfriendliness with him may do great harm so I hope you will bear with him Deng Ai saw his son was right and said no more but he nourished anger in his heart With a small escort he went to call upon his colleagueWhen his coming was announced Zhong Hui asked his staff How many soldiers are following Deng Ai He has only some twenty horsemen they replied Zhong Hui had a large body of guards drawn up about his tent and then gave orders that his visitor should be led inDeng Ai dismounted and the two men saluted each other But the visitor did not like the look on the faces of his hosts guards He decided to find out what Zhong Hui was thinking The capture of Hanzhong is a piece of excellent fortune for the state said Deng AiThe capture of Saber Pass can now be accomplished easily What is your own idea General asked Zhong HuiDeng Ai tried to evade answering the question but could not Zhong Hui pressed him to reply Finally he said In my simple opinion one might proceed by byroads from the pass through the Yinping Mountains to Deyang in Hanzhong and thence make a surprise march to ChengduJiang Wei must go to its defense and you General can take the Saber Pass A very good plan said Zhong HuiYou may start forthwith and I will wait here till I hear news of your success They drank and Deng Ai took his leave Zhong Hui went back to his own tent filled with contempt for Deng Ais plan which he thought impracticableThey say Deng Ai is able I think he is of most ordinary capacity said he to his officersBut why said they Because the byroads by Yinping Mountains are impassable nothing but lofty cliffs and steep hillsA hundred defenders at a critical point could cut all communications and Deng Ais army would starve to deathI shall go by the direct road and there is no fear about the resultI shall overcome Shu So he prepared scaling ladders and stonethrowing machines and set himself to besiege Saber Pass Deng Ai went out to the main gate of the courtWhile mounting he said to his followers What did Zhong Hui think of me He looked as though he held a poor opinion of what you had said General and disagreed with you although his words were fair enough He thinks I cannot take Chengdu and so I will take it He was received at his own camp by Shi Zuan and his son Deng Zhong and a party of others of his generals and they asked what the conversation had been aboutI told Zhong Hui simple truth but he thinks I am just a common person of no ability to speak ofHe regards the capture of Hanzhong as an incomparable feat of armsWhere would he have been if I had not held up Jiang WeiBut I think the capture of Chengdu will beat that of Hanzhong That night the camp was broken up and they set out upon a long march along the mountainous paths At a distance from Saber Pass they were to make a campZhong Hui laughed at the attemptFrom his camp Deng Ai sent a letter to Sima Zhao Then he called his officers to his tent and asked them saying I am going to make a dash for Chengdu while it is still undefended and success will mean unfading glory for us all Will you follow me We will follow you and obey your orders cried they allSo the final dispositions were made Deng Zhong and three thousand troops went first to improve the road His troops wore no armor but they had axes and boring tools They were to level roads and build bridgesNext went thirty thousand troops furnished with dry grain and ropesAt every one hundred miles they were to make a post of three thousandIn autumn of that year they left Yinping and in the tenth month they were in most precipitous country of the Yinping Mountains They had taken twentyseven days to travel two hundred and fifty miles They were in an uninhabited countryAfter garrisoning the various posts on the way they had only two thousand soldiers leftBefore them stood a range named Heaven Cliffs which no horse could ascend Deng Ai climbed up on foot to see his son and the troops with him opening up a road They were exhausted with fatigue and weepingDeng Ai asked why they were so sad and his son replied We have found an impassable precipice away to the northwest which we cannot get throughAll our labor has been in vain Deng Ai said We have got over two hundred and fifty miles and just beyond is Jiangyou We cannot go backHow can one get tiger cubs except by going into tiger cavesHere we are and it will be a very great feat to capture Chengdu They all said they would go on So they came to the precipiceFirst they threw over their weapons then the leader wrapped himself in blankets and rolled over the edge next the generals followed him also wrapped in blanketsThose who had not blankets were let down by cords round the waist and others clinging to trees followed one after another till all had descended and the Heaven Cliffs was passedThen they retook their armor and weapons and went on their way They came across a stone by the roadside It bore a mysterious inscription translated literally it read This stone is a message of Zhuge Liang the Prime MinisterTwo fires were just founded armies pass by here Two soldiers compete both soon die Two Lius were just founded armies pass by hereDeng Ai and Zhong Hui compete both soon die Deng Ai was astonished Presently he bowed before the stone and prayed to the spirit of Zhuge LiangO Martial Lord immortalI grieve that I am not thy worthy disciple The rugged lofty mountain peaks Of Yinping pierce the sky The somber crane with wearied wing Can scarcely over them flyIntrepid Deng Ai in blankets wrapped Rolled down the craggy steep His feat Zhuge Liang prophesied By insight wondrous deep Having crossed this great range of mountains without discovery Deng Ai marched forward Presently he came to a roomy camp empty and desertedHe was told that while Zhuge Liang lived a thousand troops had been kept in garrison at this point of danger but the Latter Ruler had withdrawn them Deng Ai sighed at the thoughtHe said to his troops Now retreat is impossible there is no road backBefore you lies Jiangyou with stores in abundance Advance and you live retreat and you dieYou must fight with all your strength We will fight to the death they criedThe leader was now afoot doing double marches with his two thousand troops toward Jiangyou The commander at Jiangyou was Ma MiaoHe heard the Eastern Land of Rivers had fallen into the hands of the enemy Though some thing prepared for defense yet his post had a wide area to cover and guard and he trusted Jiang Wei would defend the Saber PassSo he did not take his military duties very seriously just maintaining the daily drills and then going home to his wife to cuddle up to the stove and drink His wife was of the Li familyWhen she heard of the state of things on the frontier she said to her husband If there is so great danger on the borders how is it you are so unaffected The affair is in Jiang Weis hands and is not my concern replied heNevertheless you finally have to guard the capital and that is a heavy responsibility O wellThe Emperor trusts his favorite Huang Hao entirely and is sunk in vice and pleasureDisaster is very near and if the Wei armies get here I shall yield It is no good taking it seriously You call yourself a man Have you such a disloyal and treacherous heart Is it nothing to have held office and taken pay for yearsHow can I bear to look upon your face Ma Miao was too ashamed to attempt to replyJust then his house servants came to tell him that Deng Ai with his two thousand troops had found their way along some road and had already broken into the city Ma Miao was now frightened and hastily went out to find the leader and offer his formal submissionHe went to the Town Hall and bowed on the steps crying I have long desired to come over to WeiNow I yield myself and my army and all the town Deng Ai accepted his surrender and incorporated his army with his own forceHe took Ma Miao into his service as guide Then came a servant with the newsLady Li has hanged herself Deng Ai why she had done it and Ma Miao told himDeng Ai admiring her rectitude gave orders for an honorable burial He also went in person to sacrificeEveryone extolled her conductWhen the Ruler of Shu had wandered from the way And the House of Han fell lower Heaven sent Deng Ai to smite the land Then did a woman show herself most noble So noble in conduct That no leader equaled herAs soon as Jiangyou was taken the posts along the road by which the army had come were withdrawn and there was a general rendezvous at this point This done they marched toward FuchengGeneral Tian Xu remonstrated saying We have just finished a long and perilous march and are weary and worn out We ought to repose for a few days to recover Deng Ai angrily replied Speed is the one important matter in war do not encourage any discontentI will not have it Tian Xu was sentenced to death but as many officers interceded for him he was pardonedThe army pressed on toward FuchengAs soon as they arrived the officers yielded as if they thought Deng Ai had fallen from the heavensSome took the news to the capital and the Latter Ruler began to feel alarmedHe hastily called for Huang Hao who at once denied the reportThat is just false rumorThe spirits would not deceive Your Majesty said Huang HaoThe Latter Ruler summoned the wise woman to the Palace but the messengers said she had gone no one knew whitherAnd now urgent memorials and letters fell in from every side like a snow storm and messengers went to and fro in constant streamsThe Latter Ruler called a court to discuss the danger but no one had any plan or suggestion to offer The courtiers just looked blankly into each others facesFinally Xi Zheng spoke out In this extremity Your Majesty should call in the help of the son of the Martial Lord This son of Zhuge Liang was named Zhuge ZhanHis mother was born of the Huang family and a daughter of Huang ChenyanShe was singularly plain and extraordinarily talented She had studied everything even books of strategy and magicZhuge Liang in Nanyang had married her because of her goodness and she had shared his studies She had survived her husband but a short time and her last words to her son had been be loyal and filialZhuge Zhan had been known as a clever lad and had married a daughter of the Latter Ruler so that he was an Imperial SoninLawHis fathers rank Lord of Wuxiang had descended to himIn the fourth year of Wonderful Sight  Zhuge Zhan received the General rank in the guards as wellBut he had retired when Huang Hao the eunuch as first favorite began to direct state affairsAs suggested the Latter Ruler summoned Zhuge Zhan to court and he said weeping Deng Ai has defeated Fucheng and the capital is seriously threatenedYou must think of your father and rescue me My father and I owe too much to the First Rulers and Your Majestys kindness for me to think any sacrifice too great to make for Your MajestyI pray that you give me command of the troops in the capital and I will fight a decisive battle So the soldiers seventy thousand were placed under Zhuge Zhans commandWhen he had gathered all together he said Who dares be Leader of the Van His son Zhuge Shang then nineteen offered himself saying Since my father commands the army I volunteer to lead the van Zhuge Shang had studied military books and made himself an adept in the various exercisesSo he was appointed and the army marched to find the enemyIn the meantime the surrender general Ma Miao had given Deng Ai a very complete map of the country showing the whole sixty miles of road to Chengdu However Deng Ai was dismayed when he saw the difficulties ahead of himIf they defend the hills in front I shall fail for if I am delayed Jiang Wei will come up and my army will be in great dangerThe army must press on He called Shi Zuan and his son Deng Zhong and said Lead one army straight to Mianzhu to keep back any Shu soldiers sent to stop our marchI will follow as soon as I canBut hasten for if you let the enemy forestall you I will put you to death They wentNearing Mianzhu they met the army under Zhuge ZhanBoth sides prepared for battleThe Shu armies adopted the Eight Diagrams formation and presently after the usual triple roll of drums Shi Zuan and Deng Zhong saw their opponents ranks open in the center and therefrom emerge a light carriage in which sat a figure looking exactly as Zhuge Liang used to look when he appeared on the battlefield Everybody knew the Taoist robes and the feather fan The standard bore his name and titlesThe Han Prime Minister Zhuge Liang The sight was too much for Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan The cold sweat of terror poured down them and they stammered outIf Zhuge Liang is still alive that is the end of us They led their army to fleeThe troops of Shu came on and the army of Wei was driven away in defeat and chased a distance of seven milesThen the pursuers sighted Deng Ai and they turned and retiredWhen Deng Ai had camped he called the two leaders before him and reproached them for retreating without fightingWe saw Zhuge Liang leading the enemy said Deng Zhong So we ran away Why should we fear even if they bring Zhuge Liang to life againYou ran away without cause and we have lostYou ought both to be put to death However they did not die for their fellows pleaded for them and Deng Ais wrath was mollifiedThen the scouts came in to say that the leader of the army was a son of Zhuge Liang and they had set up on the carriage a wooden image of the late strategistDeng Ai however said to Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan This is the critical stage and if you lose the next battle you will certainly lose your lives with it At the head of ten thousand troops they went out to battle once more This time they met the vanguard led by Zhuge Shang who rode out alone boldly offering to repulse the leaders of WeiAt Zhuge Zhans signal the two wings advanced and threw themselves against the Wei line The center portion of the Wei line met them and the battle went to and fro many times till at length the force of Wei after great losses had to give wayBoth Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan being badly wounded they fled and the army of Shu pursued and drove the invaders into their campShi Zuan and Deng Zhong had to acknowledge a new defeat but when Deng Ai saw both were severely wounded he forbore to blame them or decree any penalty To his officers Deng Ai said This Zhuge Zhan well continues the paternal tradition Twice they have beaten us and slain great numbersWe must defeat them and that quickly or we are lost Then Military Inspector Qiu Ben said Why not persuade their leader with a letter Deng Ai agreed and wrote a letter which he sent by the hand of a messengerThe warden of the Shu camp gate led the messenger in to see Zhuge Zhan who opened the letter and readDeng Ai General Who Conquers the West writes to Zhuge Zhan General of the Guard and Leader of the army in the field Now having carefully observed your talent in attack I see you are not equal to your most honored fatherFrom the moment of his emergence from his retreat he said that the country was to be in tripod division He conquered Jingzhou and Yiazhou and thus established a positionFew have been his equal in all history He made six expeditions from Qishan and if he failed it was not that be lacked skill it was the will of HeavenBut now this Latter Ruler is dull and weak and his kingly aura is already exhausted I have a command from the Son of Heaven to smite Shu with severity and I already possess the landYour capital must quickly fall Why then do you not bow to the will of Heaven and fall in with the desires of people by acting rightly and coming over to our sideI will obtain the rank of Prince of Langye for you whereby your ancestors will be rendered illustrious These are no vain words if happily you will consider them The letter made Zhuge Zhan furiously angry He tore it to fragments and ordered the bearer thereof to be put to death immediately He also ordered the escort to bear the head of the messenger to the camp of Wei and lay it before Deng AiDeng Ai was very angry at this insult and wished to go forth at once to battle But Qiu Ben dissuaded himDo not go out to battle said he rather overcome him by some unexpected stroke So Deng Ai laid his plansHe sent Wang Qi Governor of Tianshui and Qian Hong Governor of Longxi to lie in wait in the rear while he led the main bodyZhuge Zhan happened to be close at hand seeking battle and when he heard the enemy was near he led out his army eagerly and rushed into the midst of the invadersThen Deng Ai fled as though worsted so luring on Zhuge ZhanBut when the pursuit had lasted some time the pursuers were attacked by those who lay in wait and the Shu troops were defeatedThey ran away into MianzhuTherefore Deng Ai besieged Mianzhu and the troops of Wei shouted about the city and watched the ramparts thus keeping the defenders close shut in as if held in an iron barrel Zhuge Zhan was desperate seeing no way of escape without help from outsideWherefore he wrote a letter to East Wu begging for assistance and he gave this letter to Peng He to bear through the besiegersPeng He fought his way through and reached Wu where he saw the Ruler of Wu Sun Xiu And he presented the letter showing the wretched plight of Zhuge Zhan and his urgent needThen the Ruler of Wu assembled his officers and said to them The land of Shu being in danger I cannot sit and look on unconcerned He therefore decided to send fifty thousand troops over whom he set the Veteran General Ding Feng with two able assistantsSun Yi and Ding FungHaving received his edict Ding Feng sent away his commanders with twenty thousand troops to Mianzhu and he himself went with thirty thousand troops toward Shouchun The army marched in three divisions In the city of Mianzhu Zhuge Zhan waited for the rescue which never cameWeary of the hopeless delay he said to his generals This long defense is useless I will fight Leaving his son Zhuge Shang and Adviser Zhang Zun  in the city Zhuge Zhan put on his armor and led out three thousand troops through three gates to fight in the openSeeing the defenders making a sortie Deng Ai drew off and Zhuge Zhan pursued him vigorously thinking Deng Ai really fled before his forceBut there was an ambush and falling therein he was quickly surrounded as is the kernel of a nut by the shellIn vain he thrust right and shoved left he only lost his troops in the raining arrows and boltsThe troops of Wei poured in more flights of arrows so that his army were all shatteredBefore long Zhuge Zhan was wounded and fell I am done cried he But in my death I will do my duty He drew his sword and slew himselfFrom the city walls his son Zhuge Shang saw the death of his father Girding on his armor he made to go out to fightBut Zhang Zun told him Young general do not go out immediately Cried Zhuge Shang My father and I and all our family have received favors from the stateMy father has died in battle against our enemies and can I live He whipped his horse and dashed out into the thick of the fight where he died A poem has been written extolling the conduct of both father and sonIn skill he was found wanting not in loyalty But the Lords word had gone forth That the Ruler of Shu was to be cut off Noble were Zhuge Liangs descendantsIn commiseration of their loyalty Deng Ai had both father and son buried fittingly Then he began attacking the city vigorouslyZhang Zun Huang Chong and Li Qiu the defenders however held the city desperately but to no avail for their numbers being small and the three leaders were slainThis was the end of the defense and Deng Ai then entered as conquerorHaving rewarded his army he set out for ChengduThe closing days of the Latter Ruler were full of pain and sorrow As had been those of Liu Zhang The next chapter will tell of the defense of Chengdu CHAPTER Weeping At The Ancestral Temple A Filial Prince Dies Marching To The Western Land Of Rivers Two Leaders Competes The news of the fall of Mianzhu and the deaths in battle of Zhuge Zhan and Zhuge Shang father and son brought home to the Latter Ruler that danger was very near and he summoned a councilThen the officials said Panic has seized upon the people and they are leaving the city in crowds Their cries shake the very sky Sorely he felt his helplessnessSoon they reported the enemy were actually near the city and many courtiers advised flight We do not have enough troops to protect the capitalLeave the city and flee south to the Southern Land said they The country is difficult and easily defendedWe can get the Mangs to come and help us But High Minister Qiao Zhou opposed saying No no that will not doThe Mangs are old rebels ungentle to go to them would be a calamity Then some proposed seeking refuge in WuThe people of Wu are our sworn allies and this is a moment of extreme danger let us go thither But Qiao Zhou also opposed this saying In the whole course of past ages no Emperor has ever gone to another stateSo far as I can see Wei will presently absorb Wu and certainly Wu will never overcome WeiImagine the disgrace of becoming a minister of Wu and then having to style yourself minister of Wei It would double the mortificationDo neither Surrender to Wei and Wei will give Your Majesty a strip of land where the ancestral temple can be preserved and the people will be saved from sufferingI desire Your Majesty to reflect well upon this The distracted Latter Ruler retired from the council without having come to any decisionNext day confusion had become still worseQiao Zhou saw that matters were very urgent and presented a written memorialThe Latter Ruler accepted it and decided to yieldBut from behind a screen stepped out one of the Emperors sons Liu Chan Prince of Beidi who shouted at Qiao Zhou You corrupt pedant unfit to live among people How dare you offer such mad advice in a matter concerning the existence of a dynasty Has any emperor ever yielded to the enemy The Latter Ruler had seven sons in all but the ablest and the only one above the common level of people was this Liu ChanThe Latter Ruler turned feebly to his son and said The ministers have decided otherwise they advise surrenderYou are the only one who thinks that boldness may avail and would you drench the city in blood The Prince said While the First Ruler lived this Qiao Zhou had no voice in state affairsNow he gives this wild advice and talks the most subversive languageThere is no reason at all in what he says for we have in the city many legions of soldiers and Jiang Wei is undefeated in Saber PassHe will come to our rescue as soon as he knows our straits and we can help him to fight We shall surely succeedWhy listen to the words of this dryasdust Why abandon thus lightly the work of our great forerunner The Latter Ruler became angry at this harangue and turned to his son saying Be silentYou are too young to understand Liu Chan beat his head upon the ground and implored his father to make an effortIf we have done our best and defeat yet comes if father and son prince and minister have set their backs to the wall and died in one final effort to preserve the dynasty then in the shades of the Nine Golden Springs we shall be able to look the First Ruler in the face unashamedBut what if we surrender The appeal left the Latter Ruler unmovedThe Prince cried Is it not shameful in one day to throw down all that our ancestors built up with so great laborI would rather die The Latter Ruler now very angry bade the courtiers thrust the young man out of the Palace Then he ordered Qiao Zhou to prepare the formal Act of Surrender When it was written three officersAdviser Zhang Shao Imperial SoninLaw Deng Liang and High Minister Qiao Zhouwere sent with it and the Hereditary Seal to the camp of Deng Ai to offer submissionEvery day Deng Ais horsemen rode to the city to see what was afootIt was a glad day when they returned reporting the hoisting of the flag of surrender The general had not long to waitThe three messengers soon arrived and presented the letter announcing surrender and the seal therewithDeng Ai read the letter with great exultation and took possession of the sealHe treated the envoys courteously and by their hands sent back a letter to allay any anxiety among the peopleIn due time they reentered the city and bore this missive to the Latter Ruler who read it with much satisfaction Then he sent Minister Jiang Xian to order Jiang Wei to surrender Li Hu Chair of the Secretariat carried to the victorious Deng Ai the statistical documents of the resources of the kingdom  households  souls  armed soldiers of all ranks and  civil employees Besides there were granaries with  carts of grain treasuries with  pounds of gold and silver and  rolls of silks of many qualities and many unenumerated but precious things in the various storehousesLi Hu arranged that the ceremony of surrender should take place on the first day of the twelfth monthThe wrath of Prince Liu Chan swelled high as heaven when he heard that his father had actually arranged the date of his abdicationGirding on his sword he was setting out for the Palace when his Consort Lady Cui stopped him saying My Prince why does your face bear this look of terrible anger He replied The army of Wei is at the gates and my father has made his Act of Surrender Tomorrow he and all his ministers are going out of the city to submit formally and the dynasty will endBut rather than bow the knee to another I will die and go into the presence of the First Ruler in the realms below How worthy how worthy replied sheAnd if my lord must die I thy handmaid prays that she may die firstThen may my Prince depart But why should you die The Prince dies for his father and the handmaid for her husbandOne eternal principle guides us all Thereupon she dashed herself against a pillar and so she diedThen Liu Chan slew his three sons and cut off the head of his Consort that he might sever all ties to life lest he be tempted to live Bearing the head of the princess in his hand he went to the Temple of the First Ruler where he bowed his head saying Thy servant is ashamed at seeing the kingdom pass to another Therefore has he slain his Consort and his sons that nothing should induce him to live and forego death This announcement recited he made yet another to his ancestorsMy ancestors if you have spiritual intelligence yon know the feelings of your descendant Then he wept sore till his eyes ran blood and he committed suicideThe people of Shu grieved deeply for him and a poet has praised his noble deedBoth king and courtiers willing bowed the knee One son alone was grieved and would not liveThe western kingdom fell to rise no more A noble prince stood forth for aye renowned As one who died to save his forbears shameWith grievous mien and falling tears he bowed His head declaring his intent to dieWhile such a memory lingers none may say That Han has perishedWhen the Latter Ruler knew of the death of his son he sent people to bury himSoon the main body of the Wei army cameThe Latter Ruler and all his courtiers to the number of sixty went out three miles from the north gate to bow their heads in submission the Latter Ruler binding himself with cord and taking a coffin with himBut Deng Ai with his own hands loosened the bonds raised the Latter Ruler from the ground The coffin was burned Then the victorious leader and the vanquished Emperor returned into the city side by sideWeis legions entered Shu And the ruler thereof saved his life At the price of his honor and his throneHuang Haos vicious counsels had brought disaster Against which Jiang Weis efforts were vainHow bright shone the loyalty of the faithful one How noble was the fortitude of the prince grandson of the First Ruler It led him into the way of sorrow And the plans of the First Ruler Excellent and farreachingWhereby he laid the foundations of a mighty state Were brought to nought in one dayThe common people rejoiced at the magnanimity of Deng Ai and met the returning cavalcade with burning incense and flowersThe title of General of the Flying Cavalry was given to the Latter Ruler and other ranks were given to the ministers who had surrenderedDeng Ai requested the Latter Ruler to issue one more proclamation from the Palace to reassure the people and then the conquerors took formal possession of the state and its granaries and storehousesTwo officers Governor of Yiazhou Zhang Shao and Minister Zhang Junwere sent into the counties and territories to explain the new situation and pacify malcontents and another messenger was sent to exhort Jiang Wei to yield peaceablyA report of the success was sent to LuoyangHuang Hao the eunuch whose evil counsels had wrought such ruin to his master was looked upon as a danger and Deng Ai decided to put him to deathHowever Huang Hao was rich and by means of bribes he escaped the death penaltyThus perished the House of HanReflecting on its end a poet recalled the exploits of Zhuge Liang the Martial Lord and he wrote a poem The denizens of treetops apes and birds Most lawless of crested things yet knew And feared his mordant pen The clouds and winds Conspired to aid him to defend his lordBut nought awaited the leaders precepts wise To save with base content the erstwhile king Too soon surrendered yielding all but lifeIn gifts Zhuge Liang was peer with Guan Zhong and Yue Yi His hapless death compared with Zhang Feis and Guan Yus Sad sight his temple on the rivers brink It wrings the heart more than the tearful verse Of the Liangfu songs he most lovedIn due time Jiang Xian reached the Saber Pass and gave Jiang Wei the Latter Rulers command to surrender to the invadersJiang Wei was dumb with amazement at the order his officers ground their teeth with rage and mortification Their hair stood on end with anger they drew their swords and slashed at stones in their wrath shouting While we are fighting to our death the Latter Ruler has yielded The roar of their angry lamentation was heard for milesBut Jiang Wei soothed them with kindly words saying Generals grieve not even yet I can restore the House of Han How cried they And he whispered low in their ears The flag of surrender fluttered over the ramparts of Saber Pass and a messenger went to Zhong Huis campWhen Jiang Wei and his generals drew near Zhong Hui went out to meet themWhy have you been so long in coming said Zhong HuiJiang Wei looked him straight in the face and said without a tremor but through falling tears The whole armies of the state are under me and I am here far too soon Zhong Hui wondered about this firm remark and said nothing moreThe two saluted each other and took their seats Jiang Wei being placed in the seat of honorJiang Wei said I hear that every detail of your plans from the time you left the South of River Huai till now has been accomplishedThe good fortune of the Sima family is owing to you and so I am the more content to bow my head and yield to youHad it been Deng Ai I should have fought to the death for I would not have surrendered to him Then Zhong Hui broke an arrow in twain and they two swore close brotherhood Their friendship became closeknitJiang Wei was continued in command of his own army at which he secretly rejoiced And Jiang Xian went back to ChengduAs conqueror Deng Ai arranged for the administration of the newlygained territory He made Shi Zuan Imperial Protector of Yiazhou and appointed Qian Hong Yang Xin and many others to various postsHe also built a tower in Mianzhu in commemoration of his conquest At a great banquet where most of the guests were people of the newlyconquered land Deng Ai drank too freely and in his cups became garrulousWith a patronizing wave of his hand he said to his guests You are lucky in that you have had to do with meThings might well have been otherwise and you might all have been put to death if you surrender to other leader The guests rose in a body and expressed their gratitudeJust at that moment Jiang Xian arrived from his visit to Jiang Wei to say that Jiang Wei and his army had surrendered to Zhong HuiDeng Ai thereupon conceived a great hatred for Zhong Hui and soon after he wrote to Luoyang a letter something like this I would venture to remark that misleading rumors of war should precede actual attackNow that Shu has been overcome the manifest next move is against Wu and in present circumstances victory would easily follow an attackBut after a great effort both leaders and led are weary and unfit for immediate serviceTherefore of this army twenty thousand Wei troops should be left west of Longyou and with them twenty thousand Shu troops to be employed in boiling salt so as to improve the finances Moreover ships should be built ready for an expedition down the riverWhen these preparations shall be complete then send an envoy into Wu to lay before its rulers the truth about its position It is possible that matters may be settled without any fightingFurther generous treatment of Liu Shan will tend to weaken Sun Xiu but if Liu Shan be removed to Luoyang the people of Wu will be perplexed and doubtful about what may happen to them and they will not be amenable Therefore it seems the most fitting to leave the late Ruler of Shu hereNext year in the winter season he might be removed to the capitalFor the present I would recommend that he be created Prince of Fufeng and granted a sufficient revenue and suitable attendants His sons also should receive ducal rank In this way would be demonstrated that favorable treatment follows upon submission Such a course would inspire fear of the might of Wei and respect for its virtue and the result will be all that could be desired Reading this memorial the thought entered the mind of Sima Zhao that Deng Ai was exaggerating his own importance wherefore he first wrote a private letter and sent it by the hand of Wei Guan to Deng Ai and then caused the Ruler of Wei to issue an edict promoting Deng Ai The edict ran thusGeneral Deng Ai has performed a glorious exploit penetrating deeply into a hostile country and reducing to submission a usurping potentateThis task has been quickly performed the clouds of war have already rolled away and peace reigns throughout Ba and ShuThe merits of Deng Ai surpass those of Bai Qi who subdued the mighty state of Chu and Han Xin who conquered the state of ZhaoDeng Ai is created Grand Commander and we confer upon him a fief of twenty thousand homesteads and his two sons are ennobled each with a fief of one thousand homesteads After the edict had been received with full ceremonies Wei Guan produced the private letter which said that Deng Ais proposals would have suitable consideration in due timeThen said Deng Ai A general in the field may decline to obey even the orders of his princeMy commission was to conquer the west why are my plans hindered So he wrote a reply and sent it to the capital by the hand of the envoyAt that time it was common talk at court that Deng Ai intended to rebel and when Sima Zhao read the letter his suspicions turned to certainty and he fearedThis was the letterDeng Ai General Who Conquers the West has reduced the chief of the revolt to submission and must have authority to act according as he sees best in order to settle the early stages of administration of the new territoryTo await government orders for every step means long delays According to the Spring and Autumn Annals a high officer when abroad has authority to follow his own judgment for the safety of the Throne and the advantage of the stateNow seeing that Wu is still unsubdued all interest centers upon this country and schemes of settlement should not be nullified by strict adherence to rules and formalitiesIn war advances are made without thought of reputation retreats without consideration of avoiding punishmentThough I do not possess the fortitude of the ancients I shall not be deterred from acting for the benefit of the state by craven and selfish fears for my own reputation In his perplexity Sima Zhao turned to Jia Chong for advice Said he Deng Ai presumes upon his services to be haughty and imperious his recalcitrance is very evidentWhat shall I do Why not order Zhong Hui to reduce him to obedience replied Jia Chong Sima Zhao accepted the suggestion and issued an edict raising Zhong Hui to Minister of the InteriorAfter this the Inspector of the Forces Wei Guan was set over both armies with special orders to keep a watch upon Deng Ai and guard against any attempt at insubordination The edict sent to Zhong Hui ran as followsZhong Hui General Who Conquers the West against whose might none can stand before whom no one is strong whose virtue conquers every city whose wide net no one escapes to whom the valiant army of Shu humbly submitted whose plans never fail whose every undertaking succeeds is hereby made Minister of the Interior and raised to the rank of lordship of a fief of ten thousand familiesHis two sons also have similar rank with a fief of one thousand families When this edict reached Zhong Hui he called in Jiang Wei and said to him Deng Ai has been rewarded more richly than I and is a Grand CommanderBut Sima Zhao suspects him of rebellion and has ordered Wei Guan and myself to keep him in orderWhat does my friend Jiang Wei think ought to be done Jiang Wei replied They say Deng Ais origin was ignoble and in his youth he was a farmer and breeder of cattle However he had good luck and has won a great reputation in this expeditionBut this is due not to his able plans but to the good fortune of the stateIf you had not been compelled to hold me in check at Saber Pass he could not have succeededNow he wishes the late Ruler of Shu to be created Prince of Fufeng whereby he hopes to win the goodwill of the people of Shu But to me it seems that perfidy lies thereinThe Duke of Jin suspects him it is evident Zhong Hui complimented himJiang Wei continued If you will send away your people I have something to say to you in private When this had been done and they two were alone Jiang Wei drew a map from his sleeve and spread it before Zhong Hui saying Long ago before he had left his humble cot Zhuge Liang gave this to the First Ruler and told him of the riches of Yiazhou and how well it was fitted for an independent stateWhereupon Chengdu was seized as a first step towards attaining itNow that Deng Ai has got to the same point it is small wonder that he has lost his balance Zhong Hui asked many questions about the details of the features of the map and Jiang Wei explained in fullToward the end he asked how Deng Ai could be got rid ofBy making use of the Duke of Jins suspicions replied Jiang Wei Send up a memorial to say that it looks as if Deng Ai really contemplated rebellion You will receive direct orders to check the revolt So a memorial was sent to LuoyangIt said that Deng Ai aimed at independence nourished base designs was making friends with the vanquished and was about to revoltAt this news the court was much disturbedThen to support his charges Zhong Huis soldiers intercepted Deng Ais letters and rewrote them in arrogant and rebellious termsSima Zhao was greatly angered and sent Jia Chong to lead an expedition into the Xie Valley he ordered Zhong Hui to arrest Deng Ai and he himself directing a great march under the leadership of the Ruler of Wei Cao Huang whom he compelled to go with himThen said Shao Ti Zhong Huis army outnumbers that of Deng Ai by six to oneYou need not go you need only order Zhong Hui to arrest Deng Ai Have you forgotten said Sima Zhao smiling You said Zhong Hui was a danger I am not really going against Deng Ai but against the other I feared lest you had forgotten said Shao TiI ventured to remind you but the matter must be kept secret The expedition set outBy this time Zhong Huis attitude had aroused Jia Chongs suspicions and he spoke of it to Sima Zhao who replied Had I sent you I should have felt doubts tooHowever come to Changan and you will understand The dispatch of the army under Sima Zhao was reported to Zhong Hui who wondered what it might meanHe at once called in Jiang Wei to consult about the seizure of Deng Ai He is victor here a king must yield And there a threatening army takes the fieldThe next chapter will relate the plan to arrest Deng Ai CHAPTER  The False Surrender A Wit Scheme Becomes A Vain Plan The Abdication Later Seeds Learns From The AncientAsked to say what was the best plan to secure the arrest of Deng Ai Jiang Wei said Send Wei GuanIf Deng Ai tries to kill Wei Guan he will manifest the desire of his heartThen you can destroy him as a traitor Hence Wei Guan was sent with some thirty men to effect the arrestWei Guans own people saw the danger of the enterprise and urged him not to go saying Zhong Hui clearly wants Deng Ai to kill you to prove his point But Wei Guan said Do not worryI have a scheme prepared Wei Guan first wrote a score or two of letters all in the same terms sayingWei Guan has orders to arrest Deng Ai but no other persons will be dealt with providing they submit quickly Rewards await those who obey the Imperial CommandHowever the punishment for laggards and those who are contumacious will be death to the whole family Wei Guan sent these letters to various officers who were serving under Deng AiHe also prepared two cage carts Wei Guan and his small party reached Chengdu about cockcrow and found waiting for him most of the officers to whom he had written They at once yielded Deng Ai was still asleep when the party reached his palace but Wei Guan entered and forced his way into Deng Ais chamber He roared outI serve the Son of Heavens command to arrest Deng Ai and his son The noise awakened the sleeper who tumbled off his couch in alarmBut before Deng Ai could do anything to defend himself he was seized securely bound and huddled into one of the cartsDeng Ais son Deng Zhong rushed in at the noise but was also made prisoner and thrust into the other cartMany generals and attendants in the Palace want to attempt a rescue but before they had prepared they saw dust arose outside and Zhong Hui with an army was close at hand thus they scattered Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei dismounted at the Palace gates and enteredThe former seeing both the Dengs prisoners struck the elder about the head and face with his whip and insulted him saying Vile cattle breeder How dare you have your own scheme Nor was Jiang Wei backwardYou fool See what your good luck has brought you today cried heAnd Deng Ai replied in kind Zhong Hui at once sent off both the prisoners to Luoyang and then entered Chengdu in stateHe added all Deng Ais army to his own forces so that he became very formidableToday I have attained the one desire of my life cried Zhong HuiJiang Wei replied At the beginning of Han Han Xin hearkened not to Kuai Tong to establish his own kingdom and so blundered into trouble at the Weiyang Palace where he met his fate In Yue High Minister Wen Zhong would not follow Fan Li into retirement on the lakes and so fell victim to a swordNo one would say these twoHan Xin and Wen Zhongwere not brilliant but they did not scent danger early enoughNow Sir your merit is great and your prestige overwhelming that of your prince but why do you risk future dangers Why not sail off in a boat leaving no trace of your going Why not go to Mount Omi and wander free with Master RedPine Zhong Hui smiled I do not think your advice much to the pointI am a young man not forty yet and think rather of going on than halting I could not take up a donothing hermits life If you do not then take heed and prepare for dangersThink out a careful course as you are well able to doYou need not trouble any old fool for advice Zhong Hui laughed loud and rubbed his hands together with glee How well you know my thoughts my friend said heThey two became absorbed in the plans for their grand schemeBut Jiang Wei wrote a secret letter to the Latter Ruler saying I pray Your Majesty be patient and put up with humiliations for a season for Jiang Wei your humble servant will have the country restored in good time The sun and moon are all the more glorious when they burst through the dark cloudsThe House of Han is not yet done While Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei were planning how best to outwit each other but both being against Wei there suddenly arrived a letter from Sima Zhao saying I am at Changan with an army lest there should be any difficulty in disposing of Deng Ai I need you to come to discuss state affairs Zhong Hui divined the real purport at once He suspects said Zhong HuiHe knows quite well that my army outnumbers that of Deng Ai many times and I could do what he wishes easily There is more than that in his coming He consulted Jiang Wei who said When the prince suspects a minister that minister diesHave we not seen Deng Ai This decides me replied Zhong HuiSuccess and the empire is mine failure and I go west into Shu to be another Liu Bei but without his mistakes Jiang Wei said Empress Guo of Wei has just diedYou can pretend she left you a command to destroy Sima Zhao the real murderer of the EmperorYour talents are quite sufficient to conquer the empire Will you lead the van said Zhong HuiWhen success is ours we will share the spoil The little I can do I will do most willingly said Jiang WeiBut I am not sure of the support of all our subordinates Tomorrow is the Feast of Lanterns and we can gather in the Palace for the congratulations There will be grand illuminations and we will prepare a banquet for the officers whereat we can kill all those who will not follow us At this the heart of Jiang Wei leapt with joyInvitations were sent out in the joint names of the two conspirators and the feast beganAfter several courses suddenly Zhong Hui lifted his cup and broke into wailing Everyone asked what was the cause of this grief and Zhong Hui replied The Empress has just died but before her death she gave me an edict which is here recounting the crimes of Sima Zhao and charging him with aiming at the ThroneI am commissioned to destroy him and you all must join me in the task The guests stared at each other in amazement but no one uttered a wordThen the host suddenly drew his sword crying Here is death for those who oppose Not one was bold enough to refuse and one by one they all signed a promise to helpAs further security they were all kept prisoners in the Palace under careful guardThey are not really with us said Jiang WeiI venture to request you to bury them A great pit has been already dug replied his brother hostAnd I have a lot of clubs readyWe can easily club those who disagree and bury them in the pit As Jiang Wei and Zhong Hui discussed the matter General Qiu Jian a man in the confidence of the conspirators was presentHe had once served under Commander Hu Lie who was one of the imprisoned guests and thus he found means to warn his former chief Hu Lie wept and said My son Hu Yuan is in command of a force outside the cityHe will never suspect Zhong Hui capable of such a crime and I pray you tell himIf I am to die it will be with less regret if my son can be told Kind master have no anxiety only leave it to me replied Qiu JianHe went to Zhong Hui and said Sir you are holding in captivity a large number of officers and they are suffering from lack of food and waterWill you not appoint an officer to supply their needs Zhong Hui was accustomed to yield to the wishes of Qiu Jian and he made no difficulty about thisHe told Qiu Jian to see to it himself only saying I am placing great trust in you and you must be loyalOur secret must be kept My lord you may be quite contentI know how to keep a strict watch when necessary And Qiu Jian allowed to enter into the place of confinement a trusty confidant of Hu Lie who gave him a letter to his son Hu YuanWhen Hu Yuan knew the whole story he was astonished and told his subordinates and they were greatly enraged They came to their commanders tent to sayWe would rather die than follow a rebel So Hu Yuan fixed upon the eighteenth day of the month to attempt the rescueHe enlisted the sympathy of Wei Guan and got his army ready He bade Qiu Jian tell his father what was afootHu Lie then told his fellowcaptives One day Zhong Hui said to Jiang Wei Last night I dreamed a dream that I was bitten by many serpentsCan you expound the vision Jiang Wei replied Dreams of dragons and snakes and scaly creatures are exceedingly auspicious Zhong Hui was only too ready to accept this interpretationThen he told Jiang Wei that all was ready and they would put the crucial question to each captiveI know they are opposed to us and you would do well to slay them all and that right quickly replied Jiang Wei Good replied Zhong HuiHe bade Jiang Wei with several braves kill the Wei leaders among the captivesBut just as Jiang Wei was starting to carry out these instructions he was seized with a sudden spasm of the heart so severe that he fainted He was raised from the earth and in time revivedJust as he came to a tremendous hubbub arose outside the PalaceZhong Hui at once sent to inquire what was afoot but the noise waxed louder and louder sounding like the rush of a multitude The officers must be raging said Zhong HuiWe would best slay them at once But they told himThe outside soldiers are in the Palace Zhong Hui bade them close the doors of the Hall of Audience and he sent his own troops upon the roof to pelt the incoming soldiers with tiles Many were slain on either side in the melee Then a fire broke outThe assailants broke open the doors Zhong Hui faced them and slew a few but others shot at him with flights of arrows and he fell and diedThey hacked off his headJiang Wei ran to and fro slaying all he met till another heart spasm seized himFailed he shrieked But it is the will of Heaven He put an end to his own lifeHe was fiftynineMany hundreds were slain within the precincts of the PalaceWei Guan presently ordered that the soldiers were to be led back to their various camps to await the orders of the Duke of JinThe soldiers of Wei burning for revenge of his many invasions hacked the dead body of Jiang Wei to pieces They found his gall bladder extraordinarily large as large as a hens eggThey also seized and slew all the family of the dead leaderSeeing that Deng Ais two enemies on the spot were both dead his old soldiers bethought themselves of trying to rescue him When Wei Guan who had actually arrested Deng Ai heard this he feared for his lifeIf Deng Ai lives I will die in his hand said Wei GuanFurthermore General Tian Xu said When Deng Ai took Jiangyou he wished to put me to death It was only at the prayer of my friends that he let me off May I not have my revenge now So Wei Guan gave orderAt the head of five hundred cavalry Tian Xu went in pursuit of the cagecarts He came up with them at Mianzhu and found that the two prisoners had just been released from the carts in which they were being carried to LuoyangWhen Deng Ai saw that those coming up were soldiers of his own late command he took no thought for defense Nor did Tian Xu waste time in preliminariesHe went up to where Deng Ai was standing and cut him down His soldiers fell upon the son Deng Zhong and slew him also and thus father and son met death in the same place A poem pitying Deng Ai was writtenWhile yet a boy Deng Ai loved to sketch and plan He was an able leader as a manThe earth could hide no secrets from his eye With equal skill he read the starry skyPast every obstacle his way he won And onward pressed until his task was doneBut foulest murder closed a great career His spirit ranges now a larger sphere A poem was also composed in pity for Zhong HuiOf mother wit Zhong Hui had no scanty share And in due time at court did office bear His subtle plans shook Sima Zhaos hold on power He was well named the Zhang Liang of the hour ShouchunBedford and Saber Pass ramparts straight fell down When he attacked and he won great renown Ambition beckoned he would forward press His spirit homeward wandered bodiless Another poem in pity of Jiang Wei runsTianshui boasts of a hero Talent came forth from Xizhou Lu Wang fathered his spirit Zhuge Liang tutored his mind Valiant he ever pressed forward Nor had a thought of returning Grieved were the soldiers of Han When death rapt his soul from his body And thus died all three leadersMany other generals also perished in the fighting and with them died Zhang Yi and other officersLiu Rui the heir apparent and Guan Yi Lord of Hanshou were also killed by the Wei soldiersFollowed a time of great confusion and bloodshed which endured till Jia Chong arrived and restored confidence and orderJia Chong set Wei Guan over the city of Chengdu and sent the captive Latter Ruler to LuoyangA few officersFan Jian Zhang Shao Qiao Zhou and Xi Zhengaccompanied the deposed emperor on this degrading journeyLiao Hua and Dong Jue made illness an excuse not to go They died of grief soon afterAt this time the yearstyle of Wei was changed from Wonderful Beginning the fifth year to Great Glory the first year  In the third month of this year since nothing could be done to assist Shu to recover its independence the troops of Wu under Ding Feng were withdrawn and returned to their own landNow Secretary Hua Jiao sent up a memorial to Sun Xiu the Ruler of Wu saying Wu and Shu were as close as are ones lips to ones teeth and when the lips are gone the teeth are coldWithout doubt Sima Zhao will now turn his thoughts to attacking us and Your Majesty must realize the danger and prepare to meet it Sun Xiu knew that he spoke truly so he set Lu Kang son of the late leader Lu Xun over the army of Jingzhou and the river ports with the title General Who Guards the East Sun Yi was sent to Nanxu and Ding Feng was ordered to set up several hundred garrisons along the river banksWhen Huo Yi Governor of Jianning heard that Chengdu had been taken he dressed himself in white and wailed during three days facing east toward the capitalNow that the capital has fallen and the Ruler of Shu is a captive it would be well to surrender said his officers Huo Yi replied There is a hindrance I know not how fares our lord whether he is in comfort or in miseryIf his captors treat him generously then will I yieldBut perhaps they will put him to shame and when the prince is shamed the minister dies So certain persons were sent to Luoyang to find out how fared the Latter RulerSoon after the Latter Ruler reached the capital of Wei Sima Zhao returnedSeeing the Latter Ruler at court Sima Zhao upbraided him saying You deserved death for your vicious coursescorrupt morality unchecked selfindulgence contempt of good people and misgovernment which had brought misfortune upon yourself Hearing this the face of the Latter Ruler turned to the color of clay with fear and he was speechlessBut the courtiers said He has lost his kingdom he has surrendered without a struggle and he now deserves pardon Thus the Latter Ruler suffered no injury but was created Duke of AnleMoreover he was assigned a residence and a revenue and he received presents of silk and servants were sent to wait upon him males and females in total one hundredHis son Liu Yao and the officers of ShuFan Jian Qiao Zhou Xi Zheng and otherswere given ranks of nobilityThe Latter Ruler expressed his thanks and leftHuang Hao whose evil influence had brought the kingdom to nought and who had oppressed the people was put to death with ignominy in the public placeWhen Huo Yi heard all these things he came with his officers and yielded submissionNext day the Latter Ruler went to the residence of Sima Zhao to thank him for his bounty and a banquet was preparedAt the banquet they performed the music of Wei with the dances and the hearts of the officers of Shu were sad only the Latter Ruler appeared merryHalf way through the feast Sima Zhao said to Jia Chong The man lacks feeling that is what has ruined himEven if Zhuge Liang had lived he could not have maintained such a manIt is no wonder that Jiang Wei failed Turning to his guest Sima Zhao said Do you never think of Shu With such music as this I forget Shu replied the Latter RulerPresently the Latter Ruler rose and left the table Xi Zheng went over to him and said Why did Your Majesty not say you missed ShuIf Your Majesty are questioned again weep and say that in Shu are the tombs of your forefathers and no day passes that Your Majesty do not grieve to be so far awayThe Duke of Jin may let Your Majesty return The Latter Ruler promised he wouldWhen the wine had gone round several more times Sima Zhao put the same question a second timeDo you never think of Shu The Latter Ruler replied as he had been told He also tried to weep but failed to shed a tear So he shut his eyesIs not that just what Xi Zheng told you to say asked Sima Zhao It is just as you say was the replyThey all laughedBut really Sima Zhao was pleased with the frank answer and felt that nothing was to be feared from himLaughter loving pleasure pursuing Rippling smiles over a merry face Never a thought of his former glory In his callous heart finds placeChildish joy in a change of dwelling That he feels and that alone Manifest now that he was never Worthy to sit on his fathers throneThe courtiers thought that so grand an exploit as the conquest of the west was worthy of high honor so they memorialized the Ruler of Wei Cao Huang to confer the rank Prince of Jin on Sima ZhaoAt that time Cao Huang ruled in name only for he had no authority The whole land was under Sima Zhao whose will the Emperor himself dared not cross And so in due course the Duke of Jin became Prince of Jin After being made Prince of Jin Sima Zhao posthumously created his father Sima Yi the Original Prince and his late elder brother Sima Shi the Wonderful PrinceThe wife of Sima Zhao was the daughter of Wang Su She bore to him two sons the elder of whom was named Sima Yan Sima Yan was huge of frame his flowing hair reached to the ground when he stood up and both hands hung down below his knees He was clever brave and skilled in the use of armsThe second son Sima You was mild of disposition a filial son and a dutiful brother His father loved him dearly As Sima Shi had died without leaving sons this youth Sima You was regarded as his son to continue that line of the family Sima Zhao used to sayThe empire was really my brothers Becoming a prince it was necessary for Sima Zhao to choose his heir and he wished to name his younger son Sima You But Shan Tao remonstratedIt is improper and infelicitous to prefer the younger said Shan Tao And Jia Chong He Zeng and Pei Xiu followed in the same strainThe elder is clever able in war one of the most talented people in the state and popularWith such natural advantages he has a great destiny and was not born to serve Sima Zhao hesitated for he was still unwilling to abandon his desireBut two other officersGrand Commander Wang Xiang and Minister Xun Kaialso remonstrated saying Certain former dynasties have preferred the younger before the elder and rebellion has generally followedWe pray you reflect upon these cases Finally Sima Zhao yielded and named his elder son Sima Yan as his successor Certain officers memorializedThis year a gigantic figure of a man descended from heaven in Xiangwu His height was twenty feet and his footprint measured over three feet He had white hair and a hoary beard He wore an unlined yellow robe and a yellow cape He walked leaning on a blackhandled staffThis extraordinary man preached saying I am the king of the people and now I come to tell you of a change of ruler and the coming of peace He wandered about for three days and then disappearedEvidently this portent refers to yourself Noble Sir and now you should assume the imperial headdress with twelve strings of pearls set up the imperial standard and have the roads cleared when you make a progress You should ride in the goldenshafted chariot with six horses Your consort should be styled Empress and your heir Apparent Sima Zhao was greatly pleasedHe returned to his palace but just as he was sitting down he was suddenly seized with paralysis and lost the use of his tongue He quickly grew worseHis three chief confidants Wang Xiang He Zeng and Xun Kai together with many court officials came to inquire after his health but he could not speak to them He pointed toward the heir apparent Sima Yan and diedIt was the eighth month of that yearThen said He Zeng The care of the empire devolves upon the Prince of Jin let us induct the heirThen we can perform the sacrifices to the late prince Thereupon Sima Yan was set up in his fathers place He gave He Zeng the title of Prime Minister Sima Wang Minister of the Interior Shi Bao Commander of the Flying Cavalry and conferred many other titles and ranks The posthumous title of the Scholar Prince was conferred upon his late father When the obsequies were finished Sima Yan summoned Jia Chong and Pei Xiu into the palace and said Cao Cao said that if the celestial mandate rested upon him he could be no more than King Wen of Zhou who served as a regent only is this really so Jia Chong replied Cao Cao was in the service of Han and feared lest posterity should reproach him with usurpationWherefore he spoke thusNevertheless he cause Cao Pi to become Emperor How did my father compare with Cao Cao asked Sima YanAlthough Cao Cao was universally successful yet the people feared him and credited him with no virtueCao Pis rule was marked by strife and lack of tranquillity No single year was peacefulLater the Original Prince and Wonderful Prince of your line rendered great services and disseminated compassion and virtue so that they were belovedYour late father overcame Shu in the west and was universally renownedComparison with Cao Cao is impossible Still Cao Pi continued the rule of Han can I not in like manner continue that of Wei Jia Chong and Pei Xiu bowed low and said Cao Pis action may be taken as a precedent to continue an older dynasty Wherefore prepare an abdication terrace to make the great declaration Sima Yan resolved to act promptlyNext day he entered the Palace armed with a swordNo court had been held for many days for Cao Huang was ill at ease and full of dread When Sima Yan appeared the Ruler of Wei left his place and advanced to met him Sima Yan sat downBy whose merits did Wei succeed to empire he asked suddenlyCertainly success was due to your forefathers replied Cao HuangSima Yan smiled saying Your Majesty is unskilled in debate inept in war and unfit to ruleWhy not give place to another more able and virtuous Cao Huangs lips refused a replyBut Zhang Jie one of the ministers cried You are wrong to speak thus O PrinceHis Majestys ancestor conquered east and west north and south and won the empire by strenuous effortThe present Emperor is virtuous and without faultWhy should he yield place to another Sima Yan replied angrily The imperial right lay with the Hans and Cao Cao coerced them as he did the noblesIn making himself the Prince of Wei he usurped the throne of HanThree generations of my forefathers upheld the House of Wei so that their power is not the result of their own abilities but of the labor of my houseThis is known to all the world and am I not equal to carrying on the rule of Wei If you do this thing you will be a rebel and an usurper said Zhang JieAnd what shall I be if I avenge the wrongs of Han He bade the lictors take Zhang Jie outside and beat him to death while the Ruler of Wei wept and besought pardon for his faithful counselorSima Yan rose and leftCao Huang turned to Jia Chong and Pei Xiu saying What should I doSome decision must be taken They replied Truth to tell the measure of your fate is accomplished and you cannot oppose the will of Heaven You must prepare to abdicate as did Emperor Xian of the Hans Resign the throne to the Prince of Jin and thereby accord with the design of Heaven and the will of the people Your personal safety need not cause you anxiety Cao Huang could only accept this advice and the terrace was builtThe mouse day of the twelfth month was chosen for the ceremony On that day the Ruler of Wei dressed in full robes of ceremony and bearing the seal in his hand ascended the terrace in the presence of a great assemblyThe House of Wei displaced the House of Han And Jin succeeded Wei so turns fates wheel And none escape its grindingZhang Jie the true Stood in the way and died We pity him Vain hope with one small hand to hide Taishan MountainsThe Emperorelect was requested to ascend the high place and there received the great saluteCao Huang then descended robed himself as a minister and took his place as the first of subjectsSima Yan now stood upon the terrace supported by Jia Chong and Pei Xiu Cao Huang was ordered to prostrate himself while the command was recited and Jia Chong readFortyfive years have elapsed since in the twentyfifth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity the House of Han gave place to the House of Wei But after fortyfive years the favor of Heaven has now left the latter House and reverts to JinThe merits and services of the family of Sima reach to the high heavens and pervade the earth The Prince of Jin is fitted for the high office and to continue the ruleNow His Majesty the Emperor confers upon you the title of Prince of Chenliu you are to proceed to the city of Jinyong where you will reside you are forbidden to come to court unless summoned Sadly Cao Huang withdrewSima Fu Guardian of the Throne wept before the deposed Emperor and promised eternal devotion I have been a servant of Wei and will never turn my back upon the House said heSima Yan did not take this amiss and out of admiration he offered Sima Fu the princedom of AnpingBut Sima Fu declined the offerThe new Emperor was now seated in his place and all the officers made their salutations and felicitated him The very hills rang with Wan shuiO King live forever Thus succeeded Sima Yan and the state was called Great Jin and a new yearstyle was changed from Great Glory the second year to Great Beginning the first year  An amnesty was declared Since then Wei Dynasty endedThe kingdom of Wei had endedThe Founder of the Dynasty of Jin Took Wei as model thus the displaced emperor Was named a prince when on the terrace high His throne he had renounced We grieve when we recall these deedsThe new Emperor conferred posthumous rank upon his grandfather his uncle and his father Sima Yi the Original Emperor Sima Shi the Wonderful Emperor and Sima Zhao the Scholar Emperor Sima Yan built seven temples in honor of his ancestors Sima Jun the Han General Who Conquers the West Sima Juns son Sima Liang Governor of Yuzhang Sima Liangs son Sima Juan Governor of Yingchuan Sima Juans son Sima Fang Governor of Jingzhao Sima Fangs son Sima Yi the Original Emperor and Sima Yis sons Sima Shi the Wonderful Emperor and Sima Zhao the Scholar EmperorAll these things being accomplished courts were held daily and the one subject of discussion was the subjugation of WuThe House of Han has gone for aye And Wu will quickly followThe story of the attack upon Wu will be told nextCHAPTER  Recommending Du Yu An Old General Offers New Plans Capturing Of Sun Hao Three Kingdoms Becomes One When Sun Xiu the Ruler of Wu knew that the House of Wei had fallen before the Jins he also knew that the usurpers next thought would be the conquest of his own land The anxiety made him ill so that he took to his bed and was like to die He then summoned to his bedside his Prime Minister Puyang Xing and his heir Sun Wan But they two came almost too lateThe dying Ruler with his last effort took the Minister by the hand but could only point to his sonThen he diedPuyang Xing left the couch and called a meeting of the officers whereat he proposed to place the heir on his fathers throneThen Wan Yu Left Army Inspector rose and said Prince Sun Wan is too youthful to rule in such troublous timesLet us confer the throne to Sun Hao Lord of Wucheng Zhang Bu General of the Left Army supported his election saying Sun Hao is able and prompt in decisionHe can handle the responsibilities of an emperor However Puyang Xing was doubtful and consulted the Empress Dowager Settle this with the officials she replied I am a widow and know nothing of such matters Finally Sun Hao won the day and in the seventh month he was enthroned as Emperor of Wu and the first year of his reign was Prosperous Beginning Sun Hao was the son of Sun He a former Heir Apparent and grandson of Sun Quan the Great EmperorThe excluded prince Sun Wan was consoled with the title of Prince of YuzhangPosthumous rank was given to his late father Sun He the Scholar Emperor and his mother Lady He the Scholar Empress The Veteran Leader Ding Feng was made Commander of the Right and Left ArmiesHowever the yearstyle was changed to Sweet Dew the very next yearThe new ruler soon proved himself cruel and oppressive and day by day grew more so Sun Hao indulged in every form of vice and chose Eunuch Cen Hun as his confidant and favoriteWhen Prime Minister Puyang Xing and General Zhang Bu ventured upon remonstrance both with all their family were put to deathThereafter none dared to speak the mouth of every courtier was sewn up Another yearstyle Treasured Paramount was adopted the next year  and the responsibility of the Prime Ministers office was shared by two officers Lu Kai the Left and Wan Yu the RightAt this time the imperial residence was in Wuchang The people of Yangzhou shouldered heavy tribute and suffered exceedinglyThere was no limit to the Rulers extravagance the treasury was swept clean and the income of the royal domain exhaustedAt length Lu Kai Left Prime Minister ventured a memorial saying No natural calamity has fallen upon the people yet they starve no public work is in progress yet the treasury is empty I am distressedThe country under the Hans has fallen apart and three states have arisen therefromThose ruled by the Caos and the Lius as the result of their own folly have been lost in JinFoolish I may be but I would protect the state for Your Majesty against the evils we have seen in the other divisionsThis city of Wuchang is not safe as a royal residenceThere is a rhyme concerning it the gist of which is that it is better to drink the water of Jianye than eat the fish of Wuchang better to die in Jianye than to live in WuchangThis shows the regard of the people as well as the will of HeavenNow the public storehouses are nearly empty they contain insufficient for a years useThe officers of all grades vex and distress the people and none pity themIn former times the palace women numbered less than a hundred for years past they have exceeded a thousandThis is an extravagant waste of treasureThe courtiers render no disinterested service but are split into cliques and cabals The honest are injured and the good driven away All these things undermine the state and weaken the peopleI beg Your Majesty to reduce the number of officers and remove grievances to dismiss the palace women and select honest officers to the joy of the people and the tranquillity of the state But the Ruler of Wu was displeased and showed his contempt for the ministers remonstrance by beginning to collect material for the building of a new palace complex to be called the Reflected Light Palace He even made the officers of the court go into the forest to fell trees for the workThe Ruler of Wu called in the soothsayer Shang Guang and bade him take the cast and inquire as to the attainment of empireShang Guang cast a lot and replied All is propitious and in the year of the mouse your blue umbrella will enter Luoyang And Sun Hao was pleasedHe said to Minister Hua Jiao The former rulers listened to your words and sent generals to various points and placed defensive camps along the rivers And over all these was set Ding FengNow my desire is to conquer Han and avenge the wrongs of my brother the Ruler of ShuWhat place should be first conquered Hua Jiao replied Now that Chengdu has fallen and the Throne there been overturned Sima Yan will assuredly desire to absorb this landYour Majesty should display virtue and restore confidence to your peopleThat would be the best plan If you engage in war it will be like throwing on hemp to put out a fire the hemp only adds to the blazeThis is worthy of careful consideration But Sun Hao grew angry and said I desire to take this opportunity to return to my real heritage Why do you employ this illomened languageWere it not for your long service now would I slay you and expose your head as a warning He bade the lictors hustle Minister Hua Jiao from his presence and Hua Jiao left the courtIt is pitiful said Hua Jiao Ere long our silky beautiful country will pass to another So he retiredAnd the Ruler of Wu ordered Lu Kang General Who Guards the East to camp his army at Jiangkou in order to attack XiangyangSpies reported this in Luoyang and it was told the Ruler of JinWhen Sima Yan heard that the army of Wu threatened to invade Xiangyang he called a councilJia Chong stood forth saying I hear the government of Wu under its present ruler Sun Hao is devoid of virtue and the Ruler of Wu has turned aside out of the roadYour Majesty should send Commander Yang Hu to oppose this army and when internal trouble shall arise let him attack and victory will then be easy The Ruler of Jin issued an edict ordering Yang Hu to prepare and so he mustered his troops and set himself to guard the countyYang Hu became very popular in XiangyangAny of the soldiers of Wu who desired to desert to the other side were allowed to come overHe employed only the fewest possible troops on patrol dutyInstead he set his soldiers to till the soil and they cultivated an extensive area whereby the hundred days supplies with which they set out were soon increased to enough for ten yearsYang Hu maintained great simplicity wearing the lightest of garments and no armor His personal escort and servants numbered only about a twentyOne day his officers came to his tent to say that the spies reported great laxity in the enemys camp and they wished to attackBut Yang Hu replied You must not despise Lu Kang for he is able and craftyFormerly his master sent him to attack Xiling and he slew Bu Chan and many of his generals before I could save that city So long as Lu Kang remains in command I shall remain on the defensive I shall not attack till there be trouble and confusion among our enemiesTo be rash and not await the proper moment to attack is to invite defeat They found him wise and said no moreThey only kept the boundariesOne day Yang Hu and his officers went out to hunt and it happened that Lu Kang had chosen the same day to huntYang Hu gave strict orders not to cross the boundary and so each hunted only on his own side Lu Kang was astonished at the enemys scrupulous proprietyHe sighed The soldiers of Yang Hu have so high a discipline that I may not make any invasion now In the evening after both parties had returned Yang Hu ordered an inspection of the slaughtered game and sent over to the other side any that seemed to have been first struck by the soldiers of WuLu Kang was greatly pleased and sent for the bearers of the gameDoes your leader drink wine asked heThey replied Only fine wines does he drink I have some very old wine replied Lu Kang smiling and I will give of it to you to bear to your general as a giftIt is the wine I myself brew and drink on ceremonial occasions and he shall have half in return for todays courtesy They took the wine and leftWhy do you give him wine asked Lu Kangs officersBecause he has shown kindness and I must return courtesy for courtesy When the gift of wine arrived and the bearers told Yang Hu the story of their reception he laughedSo he knows I can drink said Yang HuHe had the jar opened and the wine was poured outOne of his generals Chen Yuan begged him to drink moderately lest there should be some harm come of itLu Kang is no poisoner replied Yang HuAnd he drankThe friendly intercourse thus begun continued and messengers frequently passed from one camp to the otherOne day the messengers said that Lu Kang was unwell and had been ailing for several daysI think he suffers from the same complaint as I said Yang HuI have some remedies ready prepared and will send him some The drugs were taken over to the Wu campBut the sick mans officers were suspicious and said This medicine is surely harmful it comes from the enemy Lu Kang cried What Think you that old Uncle Yang Hu would poison a personDo not doubt He drank the decoctionNext day he was much better and when his staff came to congratulate him he said If our opponents take their stand upon virtue and we take ours upon violence they will drag us after them without fightingSee to it that the boundaries be well kept and that we seek not to gain any unfair advantage Soon after came a special envoy from the Ruler of Wu to urge upon Lu Kang prompt activityOur Emperor sends orders for you to press forward said the envoyYou are not to await a Jin invasion You may return and I will send up a memorial replied Lu KangSo a memorial was written and soon followed the envoy to JianyeWhen the Ruler of Wu Sun Hao read it he found therein many arguments against attacking Jin and exhortations to exercise a virtuous rule instead of engaging in hostilities It angered him They say Lu Kang has come to an understanding with the enemy and now I believe it said the Ruler of WuThereupon he deprived Lu Kang of his command and took away his commission and degraded him into Marching General Sun Ji General of the Left Army was sent to supersede Lu KangAnd none dared to interveneSun Hao became still more arbitrary and of his own will changed the yearstyle once more to the Phoenix  Day by day his life became more wanton and viciousThe soldiers in every camp murmured with anger and resentment and at last three high officersPrime Minister Wan Yu General Liu Ping and Minister of Agriculture Lou Xuanboldly and earnestly remonstrated with the Emperor for his many irregularities They suffered deathWithin ten years more than forty ministers were put to death for doing their dutySun Hao maintained an extravagantly large guard of fifty thousand heavy cavalry and these soldiers were the terror of everyoneNow when Yang Hu on the Jin side of the frontier heard that his opponent Lu Kang had been removed from his command and that the conduct of the Ruler of Wu had become wholly unreasonable he knew that the time was near for him to conquer WuWherefore he presented a memorial Although fate is superior to human yet success depends upon human effortNow as the geographic difficulties of the South Land are not as those of the Lands of Rivers while the ferocity of Sun Hao exceeds that of Liu Shan the misery of the people of Wu exceeds that of the dwellers in ShuOur armies are stronger than ever before and if we miss this opportunity to bring the whole land under one rule but continue to weary our army with continual watching and cause the world to groan under the burden of militarism then our efficiency will decline and we shall not endure When Sima Yan read this he gave orders for the army to moveBut three officersJia Chong Xun Xu and Feng Danopposed it and the orders were withdrawnYang Hu was disappointed and said What a pity it is that of ten affairs in the world one always meets with eight or nine vexations In the fourth year of Universal Tranquillity in Jin calendar  Yang Hu went to court and asked leave to retire on account of ill healthBefore granting him leave to go Sima Yan asked Do you have plans to propose to settle the state Yang Hu replied Sun Hao is a very cruel ruler and could be conquered without fightingIf he were to die and a wise successor sat upon his throne Your Majesty would never be able to gain possession of Wu Suppose your army attacked now what then asked the Ruler of JinI am now too old and too ill for the task replied Yang HuSome other bold and capable leader must be found Yang Hu left the court and retired to his homeToward the end of the year he was nigh unto death and the Ruler of Jin went to visit himThe sight of his master at his bedside brought tears to the eyes of the faithful old leader If I died a myriad times I could never requite Your Majesty said Yang HuSima Yan also wept saying My great grief is that I could not take advantage of your abilities to attack WuWho now is there to carry out your design Hesitatingly the sick man replied I am dying and must be wholly sincere General Du Yu is equal to the task and is the one man to attack Wu Sima Yan said How beautiful it is to bring good people into prominenceBut why did you write a memorial recommending certain people and then burn the draft so that no one knew The dying man answered I bowed before the officials in open court but I did not beseech the kindness of the private attendants So Yang Hu died and Sima Yan wailed for him and then returned to his palaceHe conferred on the dead leader the posthumous rank of Imperial Guardian and Lord of Juping The traders closed their shops out of respect to his memory and all the frontier camps were filled with wailingThe people of Xiangyang recalling that he loved to wander on the Xian Hills built there a temple to him and set up a stone and sacrificed regularly at the four seasonsThe passersby were moved to tears when they read Yang Hus name on the tablet so that it came to be called The Stone of Tears I saw the fragments of a shattered stone One spring time on the hillside when alone I walked to greet the sunThe pines distilled Big drops of dew unceasing sadness filled My heart I knew this was the Stone of Tears The stone of memory of longpast yearsOn the strength of Yang Hus recommendation Du Yu was placed over Jingzhou and the title of General Who Guards the South was conferred upon himHe was a man of great experience untiring in study and devoted to the Zuo Volume the book of commentaries composed by Zuo Qiuming upon the Spring and Autumn Annals In hours of leisure a copy of Zuo Volume was never out of his hand and when he went abroad an attendant rode in front with the beloved bookHe was said to be Zuo mad Du Yu went to Xiangyang and began by being kind to the people and caring for his soldiersBy this time Wu had lost by death both Ding Feng and Lu Kang The conduct of the Ruler of Wu waxed worse and worse He used to give great banquets whereat intoxication was universalHe appointed Rectors of Feasts to observe all the faults committed by guests and after these banquets all offenders were punished some by flaying the face others by gouging out the eyesEvery one went in terror of these RectorsWang Jun Imperial Protector of Yiazhou sent in a memorial advising an attack upon Wu He saidSun Hao is steeped in vice and should be attacked at onceShould he die and be succeeded by a good ruler we might meet with serious oppositionThe ships I built seven years ago lie idle and rotting we can use themI am seventy years of age and must soon die If any one three events happenthe death of Sun Hao the destruction of these ships or my deaththen success will be difficult to ensureI pray Your Majesty not to miss the tide At the next assembly of officers Sima Yan said to them I have decided to act I have received similar advice from Yang Hu and Wang Jun At this arose Minister Wang Hun and said I hear Sun Hao intends to march north to the Middle Land and has his army ready Report says it is formidable and would be hard to defeatI counsel to await another year till that army has lost its first vigor A command to cease warlike preparations was the result of this counselThe Ruler of Jin betook himself to his private chamber where he engaged in a game of chess with Zhang Hua as opponentWhile at the game another memorial arrived it was from Du Yu It readFormerly Yang Hu explained his plans confidentially to Your Majesty but did not lay them before the court The result has been much debate and conflict of opinionIn every project there are pros and cons but in this the arguments are mostly in favor The worst that can happen is failureSince last autumn the proposed attack has become generally known and if we stop now Sun Hao will be frightened and remove the capital to Wuchang repair his fortifications in the South Land and move his threatened people out of danger Then the capital cannot be assaulted nor is there anything left in the countryside to robHence next years attack will also fail Just as the Ruler of Jin finished reading Zhang Hua pushed aside the board rose and drew his hands into his sleeves saying Your Majestys skill in war is almost divine your state is prosperous and the army strong the Ruler of Wu is a tyrant his people are miserable and his country meanNow you can easily conquer him and I pray that there be no further hesitation How could I hesitate after your discourse said Sima Yan Thereupon he returned to the council chamber and issued his commandsDu Yu was made CommanderinChief and with one hundred thousand troops was to attack Jiangling Sima Zhou Prince of Langye and General Who Guards the East was to attack Tuzhong Wang Hun General Who Conquers the East to go up against Hengjiang Wang Rong General Who Exhibits Prowess to move against Wuchang Hu Fen General Who Pacifies the South to attack XiakouAnd all divisions fifty thousand troops each were under the orders of Du YuIn addition to the land forces two large fleets were to operate on the river under Wang Jun General Who Shows Dragon Courage and Tang Bin General Who Possesses Martial Bravery Marines and lands troops amounted to more than two hundred thousandA separate force under Yang Ji General Who Holds the South was sent away to Xiangyang to coordinate all forcesThe Ruler of Wu was greatly alarmed at the news of such armies and fleets and he called to him quickly his Prime Minister Zhang Ti Minister of the Interior He Zhi and Minister of Works Teng Xun to consult how to defend his land Zhang Ti proposedSend Commander of the Flying Cavalry Wu Yan to meet the enemy at Jiangling Commander of the Flying Cavalry Sun Xin to Xiakou I volunteer to take command of a camp at Niuzhu together with the General of the Left Shen Rong and General of the Right Zhuge Xing ready to lend help at any point The Ruler of Wu approved his dispositions and felt satisfied that he was safe by landBut in the privacy of his own apartment he felt miserable for he realized that no preparations had been made against an attack by water under the Wei leader Wang JunThen the favorite eunuch Cen Hun asked the Emperor why he bore a sad countenance and Sun Hao told him of his dread of the enemy navyThe armies of Jin are coming and I have deployed troops for general defenseOnly the water front by which Wang Jun and his several thousand battleships sail east along the tide makes me feel so worried But I have a scheme that will smash all Wang Juns ships cried Cen HunWhat is it asked the Ruler of Wu pleased to hear this Iron is plentiful Make great chains with heavy links and stretch them across the river at various pointsAlso forge many massive hammers and arrange them in the stream so that when the enemys ships sail down before the wind they will collide with the hammers and be wreckedThen they will sail no more Blacksmiths were soon at work on the river bank welding the links and forging the hammers Work went on day and night and soon all were in placeAs has been said Du Yu was to attack Jiangling and he sent General Zhou Zhi with eight hundred sailors to sail secretly along the Great River to capture Yuexiang There they were to make an ambush in the Bashan Mountains and a great show of flags along the bank and among the trees Drums were to be beaten and bombs exploded during the day and many fires lighted at night to give the appearance of a great armySo Zhou Zhi sailed to the Bashan MountainsNext day Du Yu directed the army and the marine forces in a simultaneous advanceBut the navy of Wu under Sun Xin came up and at the first encounter Du Yus army retiredSun Xin landed his marines and pursuedBut in the midst of the pursuit a signal bomb sounded and Sun Xin was attacked on all sides by the Jin troopsHe tried to retire but the army he had been pursuing Du Yus force turned back too and joined in the attackWus losses were very heavy and Sun Xin hastened back to the city But the eight hundred Jin soldiers of Zhou Zhi mingled with the Wu army at the ramparts and so entered the gates The Jin soldiers raised signal fires on the wallsThis maneuver amazed Sun Xin and he said The northern troops had surely flown across the river into the city Sun Xin made an effort to escape but the leader of Jin Zhou Zhi unexpectedly appeared and slew him A fleet of the ships of Wu had accompanied Sun XinThe Admiral Lu Jing saw on the south shore in the Bashan Mountains a great standard bearing the name of Jin Commander Du YuLu Jing became alarmed and landed to try to escape but the Jin General Zhang Shang soon found and slew him At his position at Jiangling Wu Yan heard of these defeats and knew his position was untenable so he fledHowever he was soon captured and led into the presence of the victorious general No use sparing you said Du Yu and he sentenced the prisoner to deathThus Jiangling was captured and all the counties along the River Xiang and River Yuan as far as Huangzhou which surrendered at the first summons Du Yu sent out officers to soothe the people of the conquered counties and they suffered nothing from the soldiery Next he marched toward Wuchang and that city also yielded So the glory of Du Yu became very greatHe then summoned his officers to a council to decide upon attacking JianyeHu Fen said A whole centurys rebellion will not be reduced completelyThe time of the spring rise of waters is near and our position is precariousWe should do well to await the coming spring Du Yu replied In the days of old Yue Yi overcame the powerful state Qi in one battle in JixiOur prestige is now high and success certain easy as the splitting of a bamboo which seems to welcome the knife after the first few joints have been overcomeWe shall meet no great opposition So Du Yu gave orders to the various leaders to move in concert against the city of JianyeNow the Jin leader Wang Jun had gone down the river with his naval force From his scouts he heard of the iron chains and the hammers that had been laid in the river to hinder his progress But he only laughedHe constructed great rafts of timber and placed on them straw effigies of soldiers in armors and sent them down river with the currentThe defenders of Wu took them for real troops and alarmed by their numbers fled in panicThen the great hammers and chains were dragged away as the rafts drifted onMoreover on the rafts they laid great torches many fathoms long and very thick made of straw soaked in linseed oil When the raft was checked by a chain the torches were lighted and the chains exposed to the heat till they melted and broke asunderThus the rafts went down stream conquering wherever they cameThen the Prime Minister of Wu Zhang Ti sent two generals Shen Rong and Zhuge Xing to try to check the advance of the armiesShen Rong said to his colleague The forces above have failed to stop the enemy and the enemy will surely come here We shall have to put forth all our strengthIf haply we can succeed the safety of our South Land is assuredBut suppose we fight and lose the battle then is our country lost Sir you only say what is too true said Zhuge XingJust as they talked of these matters came reports of the approach of their enemies in irresistible forceThe two leaders were seized with panic and went back to see the Prime MinisterOur country is lost cried Zhuge Xing Why not run We all know that the land is doomed replied Zhang Ti but if we make no defense and no one dies for his country shall we not be shamed Zhuge Xing left weeping and Zhang Ti went with Shen Rong to the armyThe invaders soon arrived and the Jin General Zhou Zhi was the first to break into the campZhang Ti resisted stubbornly but was soon slain in a melee and Shen Rong was killed by Zhou ZhiThe army of Wu was defeated and scatteredJins army banners waved on Bashan Mountains And trusty Zhang Ti in Jiangling fighting died He accepted not that the kingly grace was spent He rather chose to die than shame his sideThe armies of Jin conquered at Niuzhu and penetrated deeply into the country of WuFrom his camp Wang Jun sent a report of his victory to Luoyang and Sima Yan was pleasedBut Jia Chong again opposed further fighting saying The armies have been long absent and the soldiers will suffer from the unhealthiness of the southern countryIt would be well to call them home Zhang Hua spoke against this course saying The Jin army has reached the very home and center of the enemy Soon Wu courage will fail and the Ruler of Wu himself will be our prisonerTo recall the army now would be to waste the efforts already made The Ruler of Jin inclined to neither sideJia Chong turned upon Zhang Hua savagely saying You are wholly ignorant and understand nothing you are bent upon winning some sort of glory at the expense of our soldiers lives Death would be too good for you Why wrangle said Sima YanZhang Hua agrees with me and he knows my wishes Just at this moment came a memorial from the leader Du Yu also recommending advance whereupon the Ruler of Jin decided that the army should go onThe royal mandate duly reached the camp of Wang Jun and the Jin navy went out to the attack in great pompThe soldiers of Wu made no defense but surrendered at once When Sun Hao the Ruler of Wu heard his armies had surrendered thus he turned pale and his courtiers said What is to be doneHere the northern army comes nearer every day and our troops just give in But why do they not fight said Sun HaoThe courtiers replied The one evil of today is the eunuch Cen HunSlay him and we ourselves will go out and fight to the death How can a eunuch harm a state cried Sun HaoHave we not seen what Huang Hao did in Shu shouted the courtiers in chorusMoved by sudden fury the courtiers rushed into the Palace found the wretched object of their hate and slew him and even feeding on his palpitating fleshThen Tao Jun said All my ships are small but give me large vessels and I will place thereon twenty thousand marines and go forth to fightI can defeat the enemy His request was granted and the royal guards were sent up the river to join battle while another naval force went down stream led by Leader of the Van Zhang Xiang But a heavy gale came onThe flags were blown down and lay over in the ships and the marines would not embark They scattered leaving their leader with only a few score menWang Jun the leader of Jin set sail and went down the river After passing Three Mountains the sailing master of his ship said the gale was too strong for him to go onHe wished to anchor till the storm had moderated But Wang Jun would not listenDrawing his sword he said I wish to capture Shidou and will not hear of anchoring So he compelled the sailing master to continueOn the way Zhang Xiang one of the leaders of Wu came to offer surrenderIf you are in earnest you will lead the way and help me said Wang JunZhang Xiang consented returned to his own ship and led the squadron When he reached the walls of Shidou he called to the defenders to open the gates and allow the Jin army to enter The gates were openedWhen the Ruler of Wu heard that his enemies had actually entered the city he wished to put an end to his life but his officers prevented thisSecretary Hu Zhong and Minister Xue Rong said Your Majesty why not imitate the conduct of Liu Shan of Shu now Duke of Anle So Sun Hao no longer thought of death but went to offer submissionHe bound himself and took a coffin with him His officers followed him He was graciously received and the Jin General Wang Jun himself loosened the bonds and the coffin was burned The vanquished Ruler was treated with the ceremony due to a prince A poet of the Tang Dynasty wrote a few lines on this surrenderAdown the stream ride storied warships tall With massive chains some seek to stop their way But Jianglings independence fades away And soon We yield is signaled from the wallFull oft I think of bygone days and sigh Along the stream unmoved the old hills rest While I am homeless on the earths broad breast Where grim old forts stand gray beneath the skySo Wu was subdued and ceased to exist as a state its  regions  counties  districts  families  civil officers  soldiers and military officers  inhabitants its stores of grain and over five thousand large ships all fell booty to the victorious Jin Dynasty In the womens quarters of the palace were found more than five thousand personsProclamations were issued treasuries and storehouses were sealedTao Juns army soon melted away without striking a blowWang Jun was greatly elated at his success Sima Zhou Prince of Langye and General Wang Rong also arrived and congratulated each other When Du Yu the CommanderinChief arrived there were great feastings and rewards for the soldiers The granaries were opened and doles of grain issued to the people so that they also were glad of peaceOne city only stood out Jianping under Governor Wu YanHowever he too surrendered when he heard the capital had fallen The tidings of all these successes reached Luoyang just at the celebration of the birthday of the Ruler of Jin and the rejoicings and congratulations were redoubledAt one of the banquets the Ruler of Jin did honor to the memory of the late Yang HuRaising his wine cup and in a voice broken by emotion he said Todays success is the merit of the Imperial GuardianI regret that he is not here to share our rejoicings Sun Xiu General of the Flying Cavalry in Wu went away from the court and wailed facing the southAlas ye blue heavensWhat manner of man is this Sun Hao to yield thus the heritage of his family won by the sword of General Sun Jian the Martially Glorious in the brave days that are past Meantime the victors marched homeward and Sun Hao went to Luoyang to present himself at court and in his capacity of minister he prostrated himself at the feet of the Emperor of the Jin Dynasty in the Hall of AudienceHe was allowed a seat I set that seat for you long since said the Ruler of JinThy servant also set a seat for Your Majesty in the south retorted Sun HaoThe Ruler of Jin laughed loudlyThen Jia Chong turned to Sun Hao and said I hear Sir that when you were in the south they gouged out peoples eyes and flayed their faces what crimes were so punished Murders of princes and malicious speech and disloyal conduct were so punished Jia Chong was silenced for he was ashamedSun Hao was created Lord of Guiming His sons and grandsons received minor ranks and other grades were conferred upon his ministers who had followed him in his surrenderThe sons and grandsons of the late Prime Minister of Wu Zhang Ti who had perished in battle were given ranksThe victorious leader Wang Jun was rewarded with the title General Who Upholds the StateAnd many other ranks were conferred to the Jin officers The three states became one empire under the rule of Sima Yan of the Jin DynastyThat is domains under heaven after a long period of union tends to divide after a long period of division tends to uniteLiu Shan the Emperor of ShuHan passed away in the seventh year of Great

buddhas and bodhisattvas I To those beings who seek the Dharma the Truth as taught in the supreme vehicle he reveals this fivefold interpretation an elegant way to the unexcelled With what means does he create it Without phonemes words and expressions it is impossible to exhibit meaning For whom does he create this ornament How manifold is this ornament he creates The Dharma here disclosed gives the utmost joy like gold handbeaten like a lotus fully bloomed like a delicious feast when famished like good news read in a letter or like a casket of jewels thrown open This verse uses five examples to explain the truth in terms of its fivefold import To understand more concretely the philosophical processes involved we need the help of Vasubandhus and dBal Mangs elucidations Just as a welladorned face of naturally outstanding beauty gives people even more intense delight when they behold it in a mirror so this Dharma always outstanding in its natural brilliance gives a still more distinct satisfaction to the wise when its meaning is critically elucidated What does this teach It is compared to a monarch since it is the cause of power bestowing the sovereignty of the highest excellences such as the superknowledges It is compared to a priceless classic jewel since it is the cause of the enjoyment of the wealth of the noble ones The person of true discrimination here is understood to be a noble saintCHAPTER I Authenticity of the universal vehicle Now some misguided persons think This universal vehicle is not the authentic word of the Buddha so how does it confer any benefit So why should one imagine it is not the word of the buddha Chapter I Because it is selfevident even if the universal vehicle was taught by some enlightened being other  that also proves it to be buddhaword since a buddha is anyone who becomes perfectly enlightened and then teaches such Because it must be since it exists and there would be no such thing if it did not since there is a universal vehicle its very existence proves it to be the word of the buddha since there is no other universal vehicle It is unreasonable to insist that the disciple vehicle is the word of the buddha and the universal vehicle is not for without a buddhavehicle buddhas could not originate Therefore adherence to its literal meaning cannot support the notion that it is not the word of the buddha What does this show Concerning the reason because it must be since it exists and there would be no such thing if it did not one might object that the disciple vehicle itself is a universal vehicle since through it great enlightenment is achieved This disciple vehicle is not called the teaching of the universal vehicle because it is incomplete would be contradictory lacks liberative art and does not give such instructions It is incomplete in instruction on altruistic concerns since altruism is not taught in the disciple vehicle for the disciples are only taught the techniques for their own disillusionment detachment and liberation Nor can individualism become altruism just by being taught to others It would be contradictory since those devoted to their own interest apply themselves only for their own individual benefit and it is contradictory that those striving only for the sake of their own ultimate liberation will realize unexcelled perfect enlightenment Nor can one become a buddha by seeking enlightenment through the disciple vehicle alone even by striving for a long time It does not give such instructions so the disciple vehicle itself cannot become a universal vehicle since one encounters no such instructions therein Through the five contradictions those of aspiration instruction practice support and time In the disciple vehicle aspiration is only for the individuals ultimate liberation instructions are for that purpose only and practice is for that purpose only It has only a limited support of gathered stores of merit and wisdom and its goal is attained in little time even in three lifetimes Thus there is mutual contradiction that individual is just individual and cannot become a universal vehicle There are universal vehicle discourses which specifically present a Discipline for bodhisattvas for example the Bodhisattva vinaya stra of the ratnakta collectionAuthenticity of the Universal Vehicle this Theology is dependent indefinite noncomprehensive superficial tiresome and the resort of the nave It is indefinite because it understands differently at different times It is tiresome because it completely confines the human genius The universal vehicle however is none of these from dependent to tiresome Teaching the magnificence of power makes beings progress in evolution since they strive through their faith in that power Teaching the profound nonconceptual Groundless fear causes people suffering for it has long occasioned the growth of a great mass of evil What is the cause of such fear Having shown the causes of fear the reasons for not fearing the universal vehicle should be shown hence a verse on the reasons not to be afraid There is no other than it The wise do not fear this teaching since they examine it properly In fact all would become buddhas It teaches a variety teaching the variety of the paths of the stores  and not just voidness alone The intention of the Lord is  because the intentions of all buddhas are very deep and hard to understand So we should not fear just because we do not understand it And thus the wise do not fear it for they investigate it properly Without it how can there be a decision or determination that the universal vehicle is not the word of the buddha Neither I nor the Buddha understand the profound Why is that profound not accessible to theology Such a fearful position is irrational It is frightening it would be wrong Or Why is liberation only for those who understand the import of the profound but not for the theologians It is frightening it would be wrong is proven by the fact that those of petty aspiration those of very lowly elements and those surrounded by narrowminded friends do not have faith in this Dharma which teaches magnificence and profundity so well He surround narrowminded friends whose aspiration and elements are similar to his own One rejects the well taught and so suffers a defeat confused by hostility toward the teaching Selfconceited understanding is complacent attachment to ones own view not seeking the import from the wise It leads to the ruin of intelligence due to the loss suffered from failure to attain the intuition attuned with reality Such a one rejects the welltaught explanations of the teaching thereby gaining great demerit and so suffering a defeat Hostility is irrational even when one does not know that their meaning is not literal hence this verse on the inappropriateness of resentment universality commitment attainment and supremacy Because of a substantial distinctiveness with four aspects known as universality commitment attainment and supremacy The meanings of universality commitment attainment and supremacy will be explained below This shows that the determination to go for refuge causes fame because of the distinctiveness of its vows and practices Universality of vehicles is shown by ones skill in the three vehicles Universality of Nirvana is shown by ones equal experience of lifecycle and of peace that is there lifecycle and liberation are not differentiated as evil and good Distinctive attainment is that one becomes the complete equal of all the buddhas by attaining highest perfect enlightenment She has found the peace and infinite great bliss of a buddha Coronated by all buddhas with great rays of light he truly possesses all authority over the teaching he knows how to manifest the Here there is an interesting connection between the Tibetan At the time of realization she accepts all beings as herself and thereby alleviates a great mass ofGoing for Refuge suffering that is she attains the power to alleviate the sufferings of all beings When she can tolerate the nonproduction of all things she attains the bliss of highest insight is supreme because it has the best of all qualities and eternal because it is inexhaustible It is a store of virtues because it is the collection of the excellences of the powers confidences and so on These are the eight aspects of the significance of realization Lordly virtue is inexhaustible through its ceasing of the lifesystems for it is not exhausted even in that Nirvana in which there is no residue of the systems The nature of taking refuge is its comChapter II mitment of the will to attain buddhahood Its result is omniscience which proceeds from it Its activities are tirelessness in giving help bringing happiness and in the performance of difficult deeds Its types are differentiated into coarse and subtle depending on whether refuge is taken conventionally or actually One who goes to this refuge of great import increases the host of excellences beyond measure fills the world with compassionate thoughts and spreads the teaching of the peerless noble ones Altruistic aims are realized spiritually through the diffusion of compassion and practically by the spread of the teaching of the universal vehicle Existence superiority nature marks genetic types dangers benefits and a double comparison fourfold According to the Heap of Faculties Scripture the classes of elements are infinite because of the diversity of beings elements  and the Kosa I p Chapter III elements must be acknowledged the three vehicles differ in spiritual genes Beings are seen to differ in faith Some from the very outset have faith in one vehicle or the other which would be impossible were it not for a difference in spiritual genes Even where faith is brought about by a cause achievement is seen to differ some are successful and some are not which would be impossible were it not for a difference in spiritual genes Results are seen to differ inferior middling and superior enlightenments  which would be impossible were it not for a difference in spiritual genes for the fruit conforms to the seed This shows the spiritual gene to be fourfold existing by nature being developed having the nature of a support and having the nature of the supported respectively It exists as a cause it does not exist as an effect A verse on the analysis of the types In short there are four types of spiritual gene the determined the undetermined the conditionally unalterable and the alterable determined and undetermined respectively unalterable and alterable by causes In brief there are four dangers to the bodhisattvas gene which cause one who is of that genealogy to engage in evil obsession with the mental addictions evil companions lack of what is necessary  and dependence While there his suffering is slight and his anguish spurs the evolution of the beings there should be recognized as like a mine of gold the source of immeasurable beauty of intuition of immaculate  and of powers In the same way the bodhisattvas gene is the source of immeasurable roots of virtue the source of her intuitive wisdom the source of her immunity to mental addictions and the source of the powers such as the superknowledges Here the term lacking in the spiritual gene designates those who lack the destiny for ultimate liberation In brief they are of two kinds Those who temporarily lack the destiny for ultimate liberation are of four types those who are exclusively given over to misconduct those whose roots of virtue have been severed those who lack the roots of virtue conducive to liberation and those whose roots of virtue are feeble and whose stores are incomplete The teaching of the universal vehicle proclaims the magnificent and the profound it was taught at length to bring help to others Although ignorant of the subject matter of the magnificent and profound  if faith is allembracing and one is indefatigable in practice one attains perfection in the end The other two are worldlings and disciples For the growth of the tree of enlightenment with its overabundance of excellences to attain great bliss and the conquest of suffering and for the sake of its fruit which gives help and happiness to self and others that supreme spiritual gene is truly like a wondrous root See BBh p The bodhisattvas conception of the spirit is of four types Four types o bodhicittotpda are taught in the Gayasrsastra Nu ba What is its aspiration What is its faith What is its objective What is its vehicle What is its support What is its danger What is its advantage What is its renunciation What is its termination Its objective is the intuition of  in the form of a quest for that wisdom Its vehicle is zeal for the higher its support is the bodhisattva vow of morality and its impediment is its danger Its advantage is the increase of virtuous qualities consisting of merit and intuition its renunciation lies in constant practice of the transcendences and its termination at each stage results from application to that stage The conception of the spirit from anothers persuasion that is from anothers instruction is called a conventional undertaking It may come about through cultivation of the beautiful from constant study understanding and retention in this life The first verse shows the ultimacy of the conception of the spirit through distinctive instruction practice and realization It is shown to be the cause of an outstanding joy there There is equanimity towards buddhahood due to the understanding that ultimate element is indivisible from oneself birth magnificence enthusiasm purity of aspiration skill in the remainder and renunciation It is magnificent because it accomplishes the ten great vows It is purity of aspiration for it knows the nearness of enlightenment and has found knowledge of the art for reaching it It is skillful in the rest because it is skillful in the other stages Conception of the spirit accompanied by aspiration is like fine gold for the strong aspiration towards help and happiness is not liable to alteration Accompanied by application it resembles the waxing new moon for virtuous qualities increase Accompanied by universal responsibility it is like fire for it attains greater and greater intensity as does a fire fed by special fuel universal responsibility is the aspiration to the intensity of realization Accompanied by the transcendence of generosity it resembles a great storehouse for it satisfies countless beings with material enjoyments and is inexhaustible Accompanied by the transcendence of morality it resembles a mine of precious stones for from it all precious virtues issue forth See XVIConception of the Spirit of Enlightenment resembles an ocean for it is not disturbed by any calamity which might befall it Accompanied by the transcendence of effort it resembles a diamond for it is firm through being unbreakable Accompanied by the transcendence of contemplation it resembles the king of mountains for distraction does not move it Accompanied by the transcendence of wisdom it resembles the king of medicines for it cures the illness of all the addictive and objective obscurations Accompanied by the immeasurables it is like a great friend for in no circumstances is it indifferent to beings Accompanied by the superknowledges it is like a wishfulfilling gem for it gives whatever results are willed Accompanied by the social practices it resembles the sun for it brings a harvest of disciples to evolutionary perfection Accompanied by intellectual knowledges it resembles a gandharvas sweet voice for it teaches the Dharma which inspires disciples Accompanied by the reliances it resembles a great king for it is the cause of nondeprivation Accompanied by the stores of merit and wisdom it resembles a treasury for it is the repository of a great store of merit and wisdom Accompanied by the accessories of enlightenment it resembles a great royal road for on it all the noble ones have gone Accompanied by serenity and insight it is like a vehicle for it easily transports Accompanied by retention and eloquence it resembles a fountain for it retains and pours out without diminution the meaning of the teachings whether Vtryapramit Accompanied by epitomes of the Dharma it resembles a delightful sound for it is delightful for disciples who desire to hear about liberation Accompanied by the path of the unique way it is similar to the current of a river for when tolerance of nonproduction is attained it flows of its own accord Accompanied by skill in liberative art it resembles a cloud for just as all the wealth of the material world comes from the clouds so all accomplishments of the aims of all beings through manifestations such as dwell in the Tusita heaven are based on One should understand that the twenty two similes of the conception of the spirit accord with its inexhaustibility as stated in the Aksayamati Scripture A verse in criticism of not conceiving the spirit of enlightenment As soon as the genius has conceived this supreme spirit her mind is well protected from endless evil ever increasingly virtuous and compassionate she rejoices in happiness and suffering As soon as she has conceived this best spirit a bodhisattvas mind is immune from the evil habits which control infinite numbers of beings Thus she has no fear of hellish rebirths She rejoices at happiness because she is virtuous and she rejoices at suffering when it is occasioned by accomplishing the aims of others because she is compassionate how could one who loves others more than himself to the point of disregarding his own body and life for their sake engage in evil actions for his own sake when harmed by others Understanding that all things are like a magicians illusions and that rebirth is like a garden stroll she fears neither mental addictions in times of prosperity nor suffering in times of adversityChapter IV Since a bodhisattva sees all things as like a magicians illusions he does not fear the addictions in times of prosperity Since he sees rebirth as like taking a stroll in a garden he has no fear of suffering in times of adversity How then could their spirit be reversed Since even Avici hell becomes a realm of delight for one of compassionate nature who exerts herself for the sake of others how in the world could such a one fear sufferings incurred for the sake of others Since he constantly relies upon the teacher of great compassion and his mind is tormented by others sufferings he feels ashamed to be exhorted by others when there is something to be done for others Since it is his nature to always rely on the teacher of great compassion and since his mind is tormented by the sufferings of others when there is something to be done for other beings it is shameful indeed if he must be exhorted by other spiritual friends As the bodhisattva no longer has the karmic factors necessary for rebirth he voluntarily takes birth for the sake of othersConception of the Spirit of Enlightenment  Tightly bound with various bonds her own and others she should put forth a hundredfold initiative For a bodhisattva who has taken the great burden of responsibility for beings on her own head it is unseemly to advance lazily It has a great initiative for it undertakes the aims of self and others It has a great fruitful outcome for its result is the attainment of great enlightenment Therefore it is respectively a great effort because it embraces all beings a great endurance because it endures all sufferings and it does what must be done to carry out the great purpose This means that for her there is no longer any difference between the two A worldly person as merciless as he may be does not inflict torment upon an enemy in the way that a compassionate one inflicts terrible sufferings upon himself for the sake of others Concerning those who live in lowly mediocre and superior realities teaches well attracts  introduces  elucidates the import for them develops them in beauty advises them steadies them and liberates their intellects There are three categories of beings those who live with an inferior middling or superior spiritual gene In this context there are thirteen altruistic for the bodhisattva She elucidates the import for them that is resolves the doubts of those who have been introduced On the eighth stage the prophetic revelation On the tenth stage she anoints them with the wisdom of the transcendent lords Instruction is correctly attuned to the beings endowed with spiritual genes The practice of development in beauty is patient The practice of advising and so on is restrained as without restraint one cannot advise others and so forth The practice birth in the family is farreaching since practice which is not farreaching is unable to exalt by birth in the family and the like Chapter V inexhaustible because the beings embraced by the bodhisattvas are inexhaustible There is great danger in desires for they cause great physical and mental suffering as well as hellish rebirths Aberrant pleasures are unstable and because the delights of the form and formless realms are impermanent and because of the miserable nature of creation they are ultimately suffering Foolish people who always act for the sake of their own pleasure fail to obtain it obtaining only suffering But a bodhisattva who practices for the sake of others accomplishes her own and others aims and attains the bliss of Nirvana In whatever way a bodhisattva becomes involved with the various senserealms such as the visual while engaged in activities manifesting the behaviors  he is motivated in all his actions with relePractice vant and seemly ideals for the benefit of beings as is set forth at length in the Purity of the Realms Scripture Thinking this persons wrong conduct is involuntary his mercy increases A bodhisattva does not pick out the faultiness in a person who never had an independent will by the mental addictions He knows that such a persons wrong conduct is involuntary and his compassion for him increases It has the greatness of triumph because it triumphs over all three realms and five migrations Following the Tibetan yon tan gyi che ba nyid dang I sems can yongs su mi gtong bai che ba nyid ni yon tan gyis phel bapa dang gro ba sdud pai phyir ro I CHAPTER VI Thatness A verse on the analysis of the characteristics of the ultimate The nature of the ultimate is that which is purified though not purified not existent not nonexistent not such and not otherwise not produced and not destroyed not decreased and not increased Ultimate has the meaning of nondual This nondual meaning is illustrated in five ways It is not existent from the point of view of the imagined and relative identities It is not such for there is no oneness of the perfect with regard to the constructed and the relative Neither is it otherwise for it has no otherness from those two It is neither produced nor destroyed for the ultimate realm is not creational It is neither increased nor decreased for it remains as it is amid the cessation and generation of the two tendencies of mental addiction and purification It does not become purified for it is naturally unaddicted Yet it is not the case that it is not purified for it is free of incidental addictions It should be understood then that these five characteristics of the nondual constitute the nature of the ultimate Moreover it should be understood that because there is no self liberation is merely the termination of error and there is no at all who has been liberated Whereas the view of a self being a mental derivative is a relative entity see Sthiramati Thatness How is it that people rely on the view of a self which is nothing but an illusion and do not see that the nature of suffering is always connected to creations They are not intellectually aware of this intrinsic suffering they are experientially aware of suffering They suffer because suffering has not been eliminated but because of the nonexistence of a self which possesses that suffering they do not suffer They are objective since there is no self in persons there are only objects What kind of darkness is this which makes people not see the relationally occurrent which exists and see the self which does not exist Darkness could make it possible for the existent to be unseen but not for the nonexistent to be seen A verse on the viability of both peace and life without a self There is no differentiation whatsoever between the lifecycle and Nirvana for they are equally without self in the ultimate context By well remaining without self birth is terminated and Nirvana obtained Once she has gathered the limitlessly fulfilling stores of merit and wisdom a bodhisattva becomes decisive in her judgment about things thus she realizes that the objective realm is caused by verbalization The second verse shows that once she understands that objects are merely mental verbalizations dwells in mind alone appearing as that Subsequently she realizes the ultimate realm with direct intuition free of the nature of duality the nature of subject and object This is the stage of the path of insight The third verse shows the manner in which realizes that the ultimate realm is manifestly present She then realizes that the mind alone as well does not exist for where there is no apprehended object there is no apprehending subject The fourth verse shows that due to a foundational transmutation in the condition of the path of meditation she experiences the entry into ultimate intuition Well established in the excellent teaching proclaimed by the Buddha the bodhisattva who has entered the intuition of ultimate reality directs his intelligence to the ultimate realm of the root mind which has the quintessential teaching for its object He thereupon realizes all activity of awareness the functions of mindfulness to be mere mental constructions Thus he travels swiftly to the far shore of the ocean of excellences which is buddhahood Knowledge of others lives is the superknowledge of deaths and future lives Knowledge of speech is the clairaudience of the divine ear it is the knowledge of the speech spoken by beings reborn in such and such lives Knowledge of mind is the superknowledge of modalities of mind Knowledge of the past sum of good and evil is the superknowledge of former lives The knowledge of the proper destinations where disciples are situated is the superpower of the domain of telekinesis Knowledge of transcendence is the superknowledge of the termination of contamination being knowledge of the way in which living beings transcend rebirth Such knowledge of those six kinds of objects in all varieties manifestly present without obstruction in all universes constitutes the power of the bodhisattva consisting of his distinctive Prabhva  mthu  shen tung Having reached the full purity of the fourth contemplation through maintaining nonconceptual intuition and conscious attention to the structure of reality  attains the supreme accomplishment of power This shows the fruits of power to be threefold He sees all universes along with their sentient beings evolutions and dissolutions as just like a magicians illusions and having his mastery he manifests such in various forms according to his wish He manifests these to others as he wishes in various forms such as quaking blazing and so on Emitting radiant light rays she causes those who suffer violently in the hellish states to migrate to the heavens and causing the lofty elegant palaces of Mras followers to shake she terrifies the demons These three emanations are identical to the threefold function of the emanation body nirmnakya of a Power A verse on the activity of purifying the land The purification is twofold It is purified by the purification of the material environment for as has mastery of intuitions he creates at will a buddha land made of crystal or of sapphire and so on through the purification of the inhabitant beings for he causes those who have been born in realms where the name buddha does not exist to hear the name buddha Through this they are caused to have faith and to take rebirth in universes where that is not absent ability to develop living beings is like of a bird whose wings are fully grown She receives exceptional praise from the buddhas and her speech is authoritative for beings See below IX The power of the brave one consists of six superknowledges three knowledges eight liberations eight sovereignties ten totalities and innumerable concentrations The good brave roams through his lives just like a lion CHAPTER VIII Evolutionary Maturity A summary verse on the evolutionary maturity of the bodhisattva It should be understood that the bodhisattvas own evolutionary maturity is summarized in these nine aspects Hence there is the chapter on evolutionary maturity The three of the spiritual friend are service to a holy person learning the holy Dharma and the proper thoughtful attitude Intense energy is a boundless energetic initiative Successful accomplishment is lack of doubt about any of the inconceivable sciences This should be understood as the nature of the bodhisattvas maturity as joy in the context of her embrace of the Dharma of the universal vehicle Sthiramati agrees The Chinese translation reads The characteristics of the maturity of faith are a Tathgatas stores of merit and intuition a pure mind which cannot be defiled and swift reception of the intuition the definite result For the Sanskrit adhyabhedat read apy following the Tibetan kyangEvolutionary Maturity mind this is the nature of the true maturity of a victorchild who trusts the teacher Its actuality is imperturbability of mind since faith has been gained through such knowledge For a bodhisattva serenity is dispelling the addictions The nature of maturity as sympathy for others consists of natural compassion sensitivity to the sufferings of others determined rejection of inferior thoughts progress in excellence and birth as foremost in the world A verse on the nature of maturity as tolerance The nature of maturity as tolerance consists of natural steadfastness cultivation of critical discernment constant endurance of the miseries of cold and the like progress in excellence and intense delight in virtue Steadfastness endurance and tolerance are synonyms Its actuality is the endurance of the terrible sufferings of cold and the like Its action is progress in excellence of tolerance and intense delight in virtue Its cause is purity of development consistent with intelligence The actuality of maturity as intelligence is that mindfulness does not forget what was long ago learned considered and contemplated or what was long ago explained and gains insight into the meaning of good explanations and bad explanations Its action is adeptness in generating transcendent intuitive wisdom The cause of such maturity is the growth of the seeds of both merit and intuition Its action consists of the consummation of desires and the achievement of leadership in the world Its action consists of the attainment of excellence and the refutation of all opposing positions The cause of such maturity is the gathering of the roots of virtue And its action consists in her prizing of solitude and her delight in the highest virtues  himself mature in these nine areas gains the ability to bring others to maturity This verse shows the actuality of maturity The maturity of a boil is its readiness to be drained and that of food is its readiness to be enjoyed This shows the subdivisions of maturity Dismaturity is maturity through dissociation from the addictions Ad maturity is maturity in tune with the disciples by teaching the Dharma as adapted to them Ultramaturity is gradually developing higher and higher maturity through not losing the aim These are the eight subdivisions of the evolutionary maturing of others They show the kind of aspiration through which a bodhisattva brings beings to evolutionary maturity The remaining verses show that the perfection of the transcendences is the practice that brings beings to evolutionary maturity He matures others with two types of assistance and is never satisfied with the virtues of equal giving Fulfilled nonviolence is surpassingly nonviolent due to the fulfillment of the ten paths of virtuous actions stated on the second stage Through assistance in this life in enduring injury and through assistance in future lives She the spiritual victorchild relies on highest striving to bring hosts of beings to a superior maturity she does not lose heart in ten million aeons in order to bring about even a single virtuous thought in one other Having become fully decisive about the system of ultimate and intimated meaning he easily dispels the doubts of beings and Bhvrtha A bodhisattva brings about maturity through wisdom which is utterly decisive about the principles of the definitive and interpretable meanings How does it bring to maturity As one will attain enlightenment by maturing the characters of oneself and others there is the chapter on Enlightenment Its main parts are three the structure of the great enlightenment the conduct engaged in practicing it and the reasons to reinforce the motivation to achieve it emerging from expressing the greatness of the great enlightenment Although all things are buddhahood there exists no thing whatsoever it consists of virtuous qualities but they do not define it All things are buddhahood because suchness is without differentiation and because buddhahood manifests through its purity Yet in buddhahood there is no thing whatsoever which exists in terms of the imaginatively constructed reality of things Its effectiveness is like a mine of jewels and like a raincloud because it is the origin of the jewels of the Dharma teaching and the harvests of virtue in the fields of the lives of the disciples Because it is the cause of the production of the jewels of the Dharma so great and vast it is like a jewel mine It is a deliverance from all injuries since through the buddhas power the blind recover sight the deaf hearing the mentally disturbed a healthy mind and the sick a cure and so on It is a deliverance from the individual vehicle for it makes the universal vehicle the inclusive vehicle for those of indeterminate genealogy Supreme buddhahood is accepted as the incomparable refuge Buddhahood is accepted as the best of refuges in this world with a body utterly fulfilled with the buddhaqualities knowing how to guide beings in the holy Dharma transcendent out of mercy towards all beings It is the ultimate success in individualistic aims since its nature is perfect fulfillment with all buddha qualities such as the strengths and fearlessnesses This fifth verse shows in summary for how long a time for how many beings and for what purpose it is a refuge For what purpose Standing there a transcendent lord surveys the world as if he stood upon the great king of mountains As he feels compassion for those who delight in peace what need to speak of other persons who delight in existence the transcendent lords foundational transmutation is a promutation because it mutates for the sake of others It is a nondual mutation as it is unbeatable either in the lifecycle or in liberation created or uncreated It is an equal mutation because it is equal with disciples and hermit buddhas through the commonality of their liberations It is a special mutation because the buddha qualities of the strengths fearlessnesses and so on are uncommon as space is omnipresent in the multitude of forms so this is omnipresent in the multitude of beings Just as the reflection of the moon cannot be seen in a broken water pot so the buddhas reflection is not seen in evil beings Like a fire which blazes in one place but goes out elsewhere so should appearance and disappearance be understood in the case of buddhas Like a fire perfect enlightenment is shown to some and Nirvana to others eternal is the body of the Tathgatas These two verses prove the spontaneity of buddhaactivities by analogy with the sound of an unstruck drum and the luminosity of a jewel Just as activities continually arise and cease in space so also the activities of buddhas arise and cease in the uncontaminated realm It is like the activities of the people in space although they are without interruption some arise and others come to an end Suchness is accepted as buddhahood neither pure nor impure It is not pure because it is not different before and after It is not impure because it is subsequently unspoiled by any obscuration free of any taint In pure voidness buddhas achieve the supreme self of selflessness and realize the spiritual greatness of the self by discovering the pure self Supreme selflessness is completely pure suchness and that is a buddhas self in the sense of intrinsic reality When this is completely pure buddhas attain superior selflessness a pure self Therefore by attaining a pure self buddhas realize the spiritual greatness of self Thus it is with this intention that buddhas are declared to have a supreme self in the uncontaminated realm That j s w hy buddhahood is said neither to exist nor not to exist For that reason buddhahood is not said to exist for suchness is characterized by the nonexistence of persons and things Like the fading of heat in iron and of shadows in vision is in the buddhas mind and intuition it cannot be declared as either existent or nonexistent The fading of heat in iron and shadows in vision is not existent for its characteristic is the nonexistence of heat or shadows yet it is not nonexistent for it exists through its nature of fading In the same way the fading in the mind and intuition of buddhas of attachment and ignorance which correspond to heat and cataracts is not declared to be existent as it manifests as nonexistence and yet is not nonexistent as the liberations of mind and intuition exist through their respective natures of liberation For buddhas in the immaculate realm there is neither unity nor plurality because they are incorporeal like space and yet still accord with their previous bodies In the uncontaminated realm buddhas have no unity due to their accord with their previous bodies nor have they plurality for like space they are incorporeal It is thought to resemble the full moon full of merit and intuition and to resemble a giant sun radiating the light of intuition Countless rays of light merge together in the disc of the sun and always perform a common function and illuminate the world As the world is illumined by the rays from the suns single emission of light so the buddhas intuitions simultaneously illumine all objects Just as clouds and so forth are thought to obscure the rays of sunlight so the deficiencies of beings obscure the buddhas intuitions Just as clouds and so forth obscure the rays of sunlight by not allowing them to shine so the deficiencies of beings obscure the buddhas intuitions those beings not being receptive due to their deficiencies of excessive involvement in the five corruptions Just as it is on account of knotting that coloring is brilliant or faint on variegated cloth so it is on account of evolutionary momentum that intuition is brilliant or faint in liberation Just as it is through a particular knot that color on cloth will be brilliant in one place and faint in another place in the same way it is due to a particular instinctual storing of the strength to carry out a previous aspiration that intuition is brilliant in the liberation of buddhas but faint in the liberations of the disciples and the hermit buddhas The profundity of the buddhas in the immaculate realm has been expressed in terms of characteristic place and actions yet it is like painting the sky with colors The three types of profundity of the buddhas in the uncontaminated realm have been explained as follows four verses on the profundity of characteristics a fifth on the profundity of place due to being unbeatable as a unity or as a diversity and ten verses on the profundity of actions It should be understood that since it is unfabricated the uncontaminated realm is like space and therefore teaching about the varieties of its profundity is like painting the sky with colors There is suchness in all beings without distinction while a transcendent lord has it as his nature in pure form Hence it is said that all living beings have the embryonic essence of a transcendent buddha here manas stands for the klispamanas In the transmutation of discriminative thought highest mastery is attained while all intuitions and actions are unimpeded at all times In the transmutation of the foundation highest mastery is attained which is the unlocated Nirvana in the buddhas uncontaminated realm Thus mastery is considered immeasurable through immeasurable transmutations as it can accomplish inconceivable works in the stainless station of the buddhas Thus from this perspective the transmutations are immeasurable Here it should be understood that the highest mastery is the accomplishment of inconceivable deeds in the buddhas uncontaminated realm This shows the kind of maturing of which is the cause The mature advance to a high degree of perfection Thus does the world constantly progress and yet it never becomes a totality since it is infinite This third verse shows through many doors causes simultaneous implementation of arts for maturing  how and in what place he dwells and that he civilizes beings Buddhas do not consider This being have I matured This one will mature presently mature rather beings advance towards evolutionary maturity without premeditated action through constant universal virtuous practices through the doors of the three Through the doors of the three the three vehicles Just as the sun effortlessly ripens the harvests of crops by universally emitting its bright and profuse rays of light in all directions so the sun of Dharma accomplishes the evolutionary maturity of beings by universally emitting in every direction the light rays of the Dharma which lead to peace This fifth verse shows a simile to illustrate the unpremeditated maturing Just as a single lamp kindles an immeasurable incalculable mass of many other lamps and yet does not become exhausted so a single maturity kindles a measureless incalculable host of many other maturities and yet never becomes exhausted Just as the great ocean neither becomes saturated nor increased through the profusion of clear waters flowing into it so the realm of the buddhas is neither saturated nor increased by a constant continuous flow of pure This seventh verse shows through a comparison with the great ocean that the ultimate realm is never saturated by the entrance of mature into liberation for there is always room nor does it increase for there is nothing greater Its nature is the suchness of all things completely purified of the two obscurations the addictive and the objective The understanding of suchness and its comprehensive meditation total realization whose fruition is inexhaustibility in providing the two to all beings in every possible way Comprehensive means through the doors of all the various formulations of the teaching Its effect is inexhaustibility in providing the two of benefit and happiness to all beings in every way The body of the buddhas is threefold The intrinsic reality body is the body of truth whose nature is the foundational transmutation The reality body is considered equal subtle and integrated with that it is also considered the cause of the mastery of beatitude manifest beatitudes at pleasure The intrinsic reality of all the buddhas is equal because it lacks differentiations It is subtle because it is difficult to understand The emanation body is considered to consist of the innumerable emanations of a buddha the fulfillment of the two aims is grounded in all forms on these two The emanation body of the buddhas consists of the buddha emanations which are of immeasurable variety The body of the buddhas should be understood as consisting of these three bodies these three bodies make manifest the ground and the aims of self and other All of the bodies of the buddhas are subsumed under these three bodies The three bodies of all buddhas are without distinction in three ways respectively in ground for the ultimate realm is undifferentiated in intention for no buddha has any peculiar intention and in action for their deeds are common through continuity because the emanation body manifests emanations again and again even after disappearing The mirroring intuition is unmoving and the three intuitions based upon it move The mirroring intuition appropriates nothing as mine poses no divisions always coheres is without confusion amid all objects and never confronts them As it is the cause of the equalizing and other intuitions in all their forms it is like a great mine of all intuitions And because beatific buddhahood and its intuitions arise in it like reflections it is called the mirroring intuition The equalizing intuition regarding beings is considered immaculate due to the purity of the meditation At the time of direct realization the equalizing intuition towards beings that the bodhisattva acquires from purity of meditation that is just the immersion in the unlocalized Nirvana at the attainment of enlightenment such intuition is called equalizing intuition It is considered always accompanied by great love and compassion and it manifests the buddha image to beings according to their faith It is for this reason that some beings see blue transcendent lords some see yellow transcendent lords and so on The distinguishing intuition is always unobstructed regarding objects and it is just like a treasury of retentions and concentrations quoted in SthiramatiEnlightenment The allaccomplishing intuition fulfills the aims of all beings in all universes through innumerable and inconceivable emanations of various kinds The four intuitions originate from retention equalmindedness elucidation of the authentic teaching and accomplishment of tasks In this verse from retention teachings which have been learned from equalmindedness the equalizing of self and other among all beings and the rest is selfexplanatory Because of different spiritual genes there is no end of beings who have the buddha genealogy For then the other bodhisattvas stores of merit and intuition would be useless as they would not become perfectly enlightened and it is unreasonable they become useless Further the carrying out of the aims of others would be incomplete if there was anyone that the buddha did not establish in buddhahood and this is unreasonable Again there is no such thing as a primordial buddha for without the stores buddhahood is impossible and the stores are impossible without another buddha a plurality also is not accepted for the buddhas body of truth is undifferentiated in the uncontaminated realm Bodhisattvas who consider their own mastery length  sign  and heroic effort  are arrogant and their enlightenment is said to be far away It is said of the nonconceptualizing bodhisattvas who consider what has been mentioned to be mere imaginative construction that enlightenment has been attained w n e n rivers even though they have not gone underground have separate beds and separate waters they have but little water carry out separate tasks and can sustain but few water creatures  But once they enter the ocean they are all together in one place they become a single great water they merge into a single activity and they become a great and constant sustenance for the host of water animals But once they have entered buddhahood they all have a single great ground and a single great realization they merge in united activity and they become a great and constant sustenance for an immense host of beings Because buddhahood is the cause of help and happiness others aims are fulfilled Because it is a mine of irreproachable supreme inexhaustible bliss one comes to dwell in a distinctive bliss It is therefore fitting that the intelligent person should embrace the vow for buddhahood and so take up the magnificent spirit of enlightenment Two verses analyzing the varieties of faith We translate adhimukti here as faith instead of orientation aspiration interest as in other contexts since according to Sthiramati  here adhimukti sraddh and sampratyaya are equivalents Individual is faith in the other vehicle magnificent is in the universal vehicle Firmly engaged is engaged in the stages and farreaching is faith on the remaining stages The hindrance to the not yet arisen is laziness The hindrance to faith on a teachers authority is bad teachers because they lead one to misplace ones faith The hindrance to faith on inner authority is weakness of the roots of virtue The hindrance to unerring faith is improper attitudes because they negate it carelessness little learning complacency with little learning and reflection pride in mere serenity and noncultivation hindrances to faith are nondiscontent discontent obscuration nondedication and nongathering of stores to the individual is lack of discontent with the lifecycle to the unobscured is obscuration The benefits of faith are great merit freedom from regret happiness great joy nondeprivation firmness improvement direct realization of the teaching supreme attainment of the aims of self and other and swift superknowledge The benefits of arisen or present is great merit past faith is freedom from regret because there is no remorse of autonomous is firmness in faith the great is direct realization of the teaching In the greedy is like a dog in meditators it is like a tortoise in the selfpreoccupied it is like a servant and in the altruistic it is like a king like a servant who always proceeds with the posture of terror of his master And for those concerned with the aims of others it is like a king This meaning is exemplified by the next that it leads to faith in the universal vehicle There are three reasons why despair is improper because human beings attain enlightenment because they continually attain it and because infinite numbers attain it When food is given merit is produced since it is related to the aims of others but not if one eats it oneself because that is related to ones own aims Likewise the great outcome of merit spoken of in various scriptures of the universal vehicle is obtained from teaching the Dharma of the universal vehicle which has the aims of others as its basis but not through teaching the Dharma of the disciples vehicle which has the individuals aims as its basis What fruit does she get Again for what reason are the three or the two called baskets It is because they collect things that is because they collect all things to be known Why are they three There are nine reasons Ill Chapter XI The discourse is the remedy for doubt since it teaches a decisive solution to one who has doubt about the meaning The discipline is the remedy for the pursuit of the two extremes since it rejects reproachable enjoyments the extreme of attachment to sense pleasures and since it allows irreproachable enjoyments the extreme of selfmortification The clear science is the remedy for fanaticism about ones ideology since it elucidates unerringly the natures of things The discipline makes possible the accomplishment of the first two supreme morality and supreme mind since one who has morality gradually becomes free of remorse and so achieves meditative concentration The clear science makes possible the accomplishment of supreme wisdom since it analyzes things unerringly Further the discourses expound the teaching and its meaning the discipline brings about the realization of the teaching and its meaning since one who Antadvaya For these nine reasons the collections are accepted as three In summary the discourse  discipline  and clear science abhidharma are considered to have fourfold meaning When he understands them the genius achieves omniscience In brief discourse discipline and clear science are each fourfold in meaning The bodhisattva who understands them attains omniscience How is each one understood to have a fourfold meaning Teaching refers to the systems media elements foods dependent origination and so on Meaning means the intended implication The teaching which clearly confronts Nirvana is the clear science since it is that which teaches the truths the accessories of enlightenment the doors of liberation and so forth The teaching which is clearly repetitive is the clear science because it displays each thing in many ways as formful formless comparable and so on The clearly triumphant is the clear science since it triumphs over opponents criticism and addresses controversial issues and so forth Discipline is so called because of offense origin remission and absolution and also with regard to person proclamation interpretation and determination Offense refers to the five categories of offense Remission comes about from aspiration  and not from punishment The two are discovered srayaparivrtti if a monk or a nun commits an act which is not regarded as an infraction by the rules for both monks and nuns that infraction does not require expiation in the event of a change of sexual organs where that individuals former state would have required such see Sthiramati and LII p The teaching as objective has already been explained In the second there are two investigation of discovery of objective object and investigation of discovery of subjective subject Consider the two objectives inner and outer there is a process of discovering them because they are discovered by the force of discovering the realities of them both The three objects attain the three knowledges purely holding the domain of mental verbalization having clarified the specified meaning the pacified mind only has nameInvestigation oftheDharma systems And this discovery of the threefold objective is based upon the previously mentioned The teaching as objective is discovered by means of the three wisdoms born from learning reflection and meditation Faithful means having a decisive trust To be focused means to discern Consequently the discovery of the above three objectives is based upon the discovery of the teaching as objective This interpretation of the process of generating the three wisdoms is beautifully set forth by dBal Mang They are distinguished by life with the householders life with its bonds or the monks life free from all bonds They are settled in faith accompanied with recollection of the buddhas They are intensely enthusiastic accompanied by confidence in the buddhas With objects combined of five kinds according to whether objects are summarized or taught in discourse epitome verse and anthology with objects dispersed they are of seven kinds according to whether objects are word sentence letter selflessness of persons selflessness of things formful things or formless things formful things being physical objects the formless things being sensual and mental objects The facts to be thoroughly understood are suffering s impermanence pain voidness and selflessness Thorough realization is the path the fruit of thorough realization is liberation intent upon the kinds of meditation whether four or thirtyseven Meditation is of four kinds as it concerns the selflessness of the person selflessness of objects vision or intuition Meditation also has thirtyseven kinds In the case of the four foci of mindfulness one meditates on ugliness suffering impermanence and selflessness In the case of the four realistic abandons one meditates on achievement cultivation elimination and remedy In the case of the five spiritual powers the resistances are abolished by these same five attitudes In the case of the seven factors of enlightenment one cultivates adeptness in enlightenment analytic discernment enthusiasm happiness fitness mental stability and equality In the case of the branches of the path one meditates the certainty of achievement the conservation of the stage of purification the instilling of realization in others the engagement in morality dear to the saints the getting along with a minimum of possessions the cultivation of the path achieved in previous practice the retention of the signs of living by the Dharma and the foundational transmutation which is stability in signlessness The receptive attitude takes the counsels of buddhas and bodhisattvas in the Dharmastream The applicational attitude concerning occurrence observes two types of occurrence the measurable occurrences of letters and the immeasurable occurrences of words and sentences The penetrative applicational attitudes are elevenfold according to whether they penetrate the incidental the signs of discourse the nonapprehension of content the nonapprehension of apprehension the ultimate realm subjective selflessness objective selflessness inferior aspirations aspirations to magnificent greatness Aparikalpamaksaram Masterful attitudes are of three kinds well purified of the addictive obscurations well purified of the addictive and objective obscurations and well purified in the realization of excellence The limited attitude refers to the first purification and the unlimited attitude refers to the last two purifications The reality which is always free from duality is the constructed reality for it is absolutely nonexistent in terms of its subjectobject nature the ground of error is the relative reality since therein imagination constructs Of these  the first  is to be thoroughly understood the second  is to be abandoned the third is both to be purified of incidental defilement and naturally pure For space and so on are not naturally impure nor is their purity not considered the result of the removal of incidental defilements Indeed nothing other than this reality is found in the world and yet the whole world is confused about it How has such an amazing folly overtaken people where the real is completely forsaken and the unreal is persistently maintained Unreal imaginative construction is declared to be just like magical illusion and the error of duality to be just like a magical creation And the form of the imaginatively constructed reality the appearance in that of the unreal construction of subject and object through the error of duality should be understood as like the magicians creations such as the shapes of elephants horses or gold and so on which appear in the magical illusion as if they existed It is accepted that the ultimate reality is like that not existing in that and the superficial reality is like that being perceived in that In the same way once the foundational transmutation one perceives unreal construction as an actual object the error of duality being absent People when no longer deceived act freely in relation to the cause ofthat in the same way upon foundational transmutation the ascetic no longer deluded acts as he pleases When people are no longer deceived they can interact freely independently with such things as sticks of wood as causes Similarly upon foundational transmutation the saint no longer deluded has freedom of action and independence This verse is self evident Therein existence is not exactly nonexistence and nonexistence is not exactly existence the nondistinction between existence and nonexistence is attributed to illusion and so on Existence in this case is not exactly nonexistence inasmuch as there is existence of a certain form it is not nonexistent And the nonexistent is not exactly existent the nonexistence of the elephant and so on is not an existent Chapter XI nonexistence of the elephant and so on and the nonexistence of the elephant and so on is just the existence of such an form And therefore existence and nonexistence are ascribed to forms and so on Therefore existence and nonexistence are attributed to forms and so on which in reality are the unreal construction Therein existence is not exactly nonexistence and nonexistence is not exactly existence the nondistinction between existence and nonexistence is attributed to material things and so on Here existence is not nonexistence inasmuch as there is an appearance of duality Why then is this total unity and nondistinction of existence and nonexistence asserted In fact when one knows that the nonexistent is nonexistent one does not engage in reifications When one knows that the existent is existent one does not engage in repudiations T J c a u s e o f error and error itself are considered to be the idea of matter and the idea of nonmateriality in the absence of one the other would not exist The idea which causes the error of matter is the idea matter which we call matter But the error of matter itself is considered to be the idea of nonmateriality If the idea of matter did not exist the other the idea of nonmateriality would not exist because it would lack a cause Because of the error of perceiving the matter of an illusory elephant duality is mentioned there is no duality there as it seems but there is just the perception of duality Because of the error of perceiving the image of a skeleton duality is mentioned there is no duality there as it seems yet there is just the perception of duality And one who contemplates the image of a skeleton because of the error of cognizing such a thing speaks of duality and so forth as above Here there is the general demonstration of the establishment of the subject as illusory and the detailed explanation Things identifiable as error having the nature of the resistances both exist and do not exist just like illusions They do not exist because they do not exist as such as subject and object They both exist and do not exist because of the indistinguishability of their existence and nonexistence And since the nature of illusion is also like that they are said to be like illusion Practices which serve as remedies are taught to lack intrinsic identity and to be illusory because they do not exist as such do exist as such and do not exist as such The practices which were taught by the Buddha as remedies the foundations of mindfulness and so forth are shown to lack any identity to be illusions because such as these exist as they are apprehended by the naive The Buddhas scriptures do not exist in the mode in which they were taught that is as words names and letters see Sthiramati See previous noteInvestigation of the Dharma having identity without being really discoverable they appear and therefore they are like illusions It is like an illusory king being conquered by an illusory king the victorchildren are without pride concerning all practices The practices which are remedies are like an illusory king because of their power of purification in the process of the elimination of addictions And addictive actions also are like a king because of their power of producing addictions Thus the conquest of addictions by the remedial practices should be seen as like the defeat of an king by an king The supremely enlightened buddhas proclaimed again and again that created things are like illusions dreams mirages mirrorimages shadows echoes watermoons and magical incarnations six  six  both  again the pair of six six  and the three each to one The things like illusions are the six internal media in the absence of any real self or soul they appear Things like dreams are the six external media because truly the sense objects do not exist Two things are like mirages the mind and the mental functions because they produce error Furthermore six things are like mirrorimages the six internal media because The Sanskrit reads ninnara for nirmna Six are like shadows these are the external media because they are the shadows of the internal media produced under their control Like echoes are the phenomena of teaching Like the watermoonimages are the phenomena based upon concentration concentration resembles water in its clarity The entire objective reality is experienced as unreal imaginative construction as neither real nor unreal as nonconceptual and as neither conceptual nor nonconceptual Neither real nor unreal is that which does conform to  such as the aids to penetrative insight Neither conceptual nor nonconceptual is the mundane intuition attained in the aftermath of transcendental intuition Discriminative constructions evolve from their own realm with a dualistic appearance functioning with addictions and misknowledge they are devoid of any substantial duality enter the reality where nonduality appears attaining the special objective through cultivation of stability in their own realm it is like the hide and the arrow Through cultivation of stability in their own realm refers to the suchness of discriminative thoughts which is their own realm they stand therein when the mind is focused on name Cultivation is selfconditioning by the path of meditation Like the hide and the arrow hide loses its hardness and becomes supple and an arrow is heated in the fire to become straight In the same way when one who has achieved the foundational transmutation arrives at the liberation of intellect and wisdom by the meditation of serenity and insight his discriminative thoughts no longer function with an appearance of duality Thus purification should be investigated Two verses on the quest of informationonly It is mind which is asserted as appearance of duality and likewise appearance of lust and so on and appearance of faith and so on there is no afflicted or pure thing other than it Vijnaptimtrat The doctrine of mindonly see Siddhi pp Views then are mental functions Changelessness is the uncreated such as space since it permanently functions according to its informative concept Such are in summary the five categories of the identified however in detail its categories are beyond measure In brief there are five things which are identified if one were to explain them extensively they would be limitless Corresponding to name and referent means according to name and referent When the object is perceived according to the name or the name perceived according to the object that is the object of unreal mental construction which is the imaginatively constructed identity Having a threefold threefold appearance with the nature of subject and object unreal mental construction is the relative identity The threefold appearance is the appearance of word meaning and objective referent Nonexistence existence existence and nonexistence in equality peaceless peace and freedom from discriminative construction this is the perfect identity The perfect reality is suchness It is peaceless because of the incidental minor addictions and it is peace since it is naturally purified Thus also the threefold identity has been expressed The ground is the spontaneous Dharma realized by the Buddha and taught by him as the spontaneous result of his realization The mirror is the fixing of the mind on the element also called meditative concentration which was defined above as fixing it upon name Illumination is the transcendent wisdom that sees objects as existent and nonexistent it sees precisely the existence of the real and the nonexistence of the unreal One arrives here at equality since the spiritual gene of noble beings is immaculate equal distinguished without excess or deficiency this is accepted as the process of identification It is equal due to its equality in liberation with the disciples and hermit sages From the total transmutation of the seed there is the transmutation of the appearance of places objects and bodies this is the uncontaminated realm and it has a universal basis The transmutation of the seed is the transmutation of the fundamental consciousness transmutations of consciousnesses which appear as places objects and bodies This is the uncontaminated realm that is liberation It has a universal basis it holds sway for the disciples the hermit buddhas and the buddhas Through the mutation of mentality perceptivity and discriminative construction there is a fourfold mastery over the nonconceptual the land intuition and action The four masteries exist on the three stages the immovable and so on two in one stage one in each other respectively Investigation of the Dharma This fourfold mastery exists in the three stages from the immovable and so on Another instruction on liberation Having recognized the two kinds of selflessness which are found in the three worlds and having known this twofold selflessness as being equal by virtue of the nonexistence of the constructed person and the constructed thing but not by virtue of total nonexistence the bodhisattva enters into reality which is sheer information through subjectivity which means this is sheer subjectivity Seeing nameonly refers to simple verbal expression devoid of sense Name is the four The Tibetan reads vasit again in this sentence in the commentaryChapter XI systems apart from form This absence of perception is liberation It is tied up by the two types of visions of a self and consequently is susceptible to negative conditioning But this is stopped by fixing the mind within that is by fixing the mind in mind itself since there is no longer any perception of objects Realitylessness is advocated because do not exist as selves or with their intrinsic natures do not endure in intrinsic objectivity and do not exist as they are perceived Because they do not exist by themselves things lack intrinsic reality but depend on conditions Such should be understood as the three kinds of intrinsic realitylessness which accompany the three characteristics of created things They lack intrinsic reality since they do not exist as they are perceived Do not exist means do not intrinsically exist tad sva It is like nave persons perceptions of intrinsic reality as permanence happiness purity self or else as some otherwise imaginatively constructed nature there is no such intrinsic reality and therefore the intrinsic realitylessness of things is accepted What is not produced is unceased What is unceased is in a state of primordial peace What is in primordial peace is in a state of natural liberation Thus by these realitylessnesses each serving as basis of the succeeding intrinsic realitylessness nonproduction and so on Tolerance of the nonproduction of things is a tolerance in terms of the eight nonproductions In terms of the origin of cyclic life it is without original production In terms of sameness or otherness in prior and later things in cyclic life things previously produced are not produced as the same since once produced they do not reproduce themselves from their intrinsic realities nor is there production of other things as things are not produced in unprecedented forms In terms of abandonment of addictive processes because those who have attained the knowledge of termination of contamination do not see any production of addictions In terms of distinction  since any distinctions between the truth bodies of the buddhas are not produced This explains the tolerance of the nonproduction of things in terms of these things There is uniqueness of vehicle because of the sameness of reality selflessness and liberations because of the differences of spiritual genes because of the attainment of two aspirations because of emanated incarnations and because of culmination Sameness of reality means that there is one vehicle since the disciples and so on do not have different ultimate realms because vehicle means destination ytavyam Sameness of selflessness means there is one vehicle since the disciples and so on hold in common that the self does not exist because vehicle means goer Sameness of liberation means there is one vehicle since vehicle means going Attainment of the two aspirations means that there is one vehicle since the buddhas discover their own aspiration in all beings and because even disciples are determinate in spiritual gene who have in previous lives gathered the stores of enlightenment attain the buddhaaspiration by the power of the Buddha through gaining the faith that their lives are not alienated  through their gaining their portion of the excellence of the grace of the Transcendent Lord Finally culmination means that there is one vehicle since vehicle means whence there is no higher destination Buddhahood has only the one vehicle and it is thus that one should understand the statements in such and such discourses that there is one as having such and such intended implications But it is not the case that there are not three vehicles The buddhas have taught the one vehicle for the sake of those who are not determined to attract some and to hold the others Those who have realized the goal are said to be of two types Those two through the dedication to existences of one who has attained the noble path become endowed with a life of inconceivable dedication By dedication to the noble path acquired they reincarnate in the worlds with an inconceivable dedication that is why inconceivable dedication Both are considered very slow to progress because they delight in Nirvana and because their habitual mind is again and again given to selfindulgence Not having accomplished her purpose and born in a time without a buddha she strives to achieve the contemplations longing to become an emanation Relying upon such an emanation she gradually attains supreme enlightenment Hinting at these three stages the Lord said in the Snml Stra Having been a disciple he becomes a hermit buddha and finally a buddha as in the example of fire This verse shows that the bodhisattva should pursue all in general in order to attain omniscience In specific he should investigate logic and linguistics in order to criticize those who have no faith in that the science of medicine and the artistic sciences in order to care for others who have need of them He should investigate the inner science for his own omniscience There is the conscientious attitude of prayerful devotion which undertakes to seek occasions for the full perfection of those The conscientious attitude of enthusiasm is fourfold to gain power in giving gifts and so on sixfold from generous generosity up to wise generosity likewise in the case of the sixfold morality and the rest to worship which means worship by the giving of goods and honor and worship by practicing the other transcendences The conscientious attitude of shame comes from the working of conscience in the cases of giving and so forth which one failed to do or did incompletely or incorrectly In perfect enlightenment there is selfreliance upon such generosity and not upon such as God the awareness of ability to rise above the seven kinds of false habits four kinds of surprising ideas and four kinds of unsurprising ideas The remedies taught for these are the three concentrations on voidness and so on and the four epitomes of the Dharma The conscientious attitude of hope comes from hoping for three states of the transcendences among living beings the culmination of the bodhisattva stages the culmination of the buddha stage and the accomplishment of the aims of beings A bodhisattva must necessarily practice generosity and so forth wherever she goes The attitude of observation of equality in generosity and so on is the wish always to accomplish the transcendences together with other bodhisattvas The meaning is selfevident There are thirteen types of investigation of the teaching The unincorporated is created from hearing and reflection and still lacks the body of truth The lightly incorporated refers to seven stages With much pride refers to the stage of action out of faith With slight pride refers to the first seven stages With no pride refers to the last three stages In the form  the Dharma is the cause of the auspicious marks In the formless  it is the cause of health because it cures the sicknesses of the addictions Endowed with four ideas the bodhisattvas investigate the teaching The marks are like jewels because they beautify from such causality comes the idea of the teaching as like a jewel There is the idea of it as medicine since it is the cause of health There is the idea of it as wealth since it is the cause for the power through the superknowledges There is the idea of it as Nirvana because it is the cause of inexhaustibility To remedy the discrimination of nonexistence it is said in the Transcendent Wisdom Scripture Here the bodhisattva exists as merely a bodhisattva To remedy the discrimination of existence it is said He does not see any bodhisattva at all To remedy the discrimination of reification it is said Sriputra form is empty with respect to intrinsic reality Investigation of the Dharma To remedy the discrimination of unity it is said Voidness of matter is not matter To remedy the discrimination of diversity it is said Apart from voidness there is no matter matter is voidness voidness is matter To remedy the discrimination of intrinsic identity it is said Matter is merely a name To remedy the discrimination of qualification it is said Matter has neither production nor destruction neither addiction nor purification To remedy the discrimination of addiction to nave realism it is said So is there any need to mention the magnificent Dharma which always helps beings in every way which is not hard won and which is inexhaustible when freely given even increasing more Out of compassion for suffering beings the bodhisattvas constantly give with a magnificent abandon lives and fortunes which although hard to obtain are insubstantial because perishable So what need to mention the Dharma which is neither hard to get nor perishable when freely given even increasing all the more The Lord Buddha did not in fact teach the Dharma since it is individually realized within Still the compassionate ones like huge boaconstrictors attract people toward their own reality with their reasonable teachings like the boas paralyzing saliva and make them fall into the gaping mouth of their own peace which is perfectly pure universal and inexhaustible It is universal to all buddhas and inexhaustible because of its eternality If the import were understood through study alone meditation would be useless and if one were to engage in meditative practice without study teaching would be useless The bodhisattvas great spiritual heroes share the great gift of the Dharma themselves in possession of four qualifications Second doubts are dispelled from their great wisdom since it resolves others doubts Third it is fit for acceptance since their deeds are irreproachable And fourth they can teach thatness in a twofold way both realities both the reality characterized as addictional and the reality characterized as liberational Gentle means attractive Eloquent means distinct because the syllables are wellarticulated Sensible means understandable because it is sensibly expressed Appropriate means worthy of hearing because it is attuned to the disciples It is nonexploitive because it is not aiming toward wealth honor or fame Measured means not disagreeable because measured speech never becomes boring Expansive means unconstricted teach explain are adapted to the vehicles soothe make sense are appropriate liberate and favor They explain in detail by means of compositions that do not contradict the summary teachings They adapt to the vehicles by interpretations uncontradicted by the three vehicles They soothe by apt words free of harshness They are appropriate by being suitably adapted to the disciples They liberate through their reverence as they always aim for Nirvana And they favor containing the eight elements of cultured intellects as they conform to the holy eightfold path of learners These in sum are recognized as the perfection of the syllables of these best heroes but the speech of the blisslords is infinite and inconceivable with its sixty elements Inconceivable with its sixty elements refers to the sixty aspects of a buddhas speech explained in the Teaching of the Lord of Secrets Sutra It is kindly because it encourages the roots of virtue of the beings It is gentle because its encounter brings immediate happiness It is beautiful because of its excellent content It is appealing because of its excellent expression It is pure because it conveys the aftermath of unexcelled transcendence It is stainless because it is dissociated from all addictions bad habits and instincts It is luminous because the words and phrases are lucid It is attractive because it has the excellence of the power to dissolve the convictions of evilminded fanatics It is worth hearing because it leads to transcendence through practice It is disciplined because it is the remedy for passion and so on It is without harshness because it has the art of pleasantly announcing the precepts It is without severity because it shows the means of deliverance from transgressing those It is pleasant to the ear because it is the remedy for distraction It is gladdening to the heart because it resolves all doubts It is creative of joy and bliss because it releases from false certainties It is not disturbing because there is no regret about its practice It is eminently understandable because it supports the perfect learned wisdom It is to be realized because it supports the perfect reflective wisdom It is transparent because it reveals the teaching without the teachers closed fist It is lovable because it is loved by those who through it attain their goal It is delightful because it is instills enthusiasm in those who have not yet attained their goal It is authoritative because it truly reveals the inconceivable Dharma It is informative because it truly teaches the inconceivable Dharma It is appropriate because it teaches appropriately for the disciples It is energetic as the lions roar because it terrifies all religious fanatics It is sounding like an elephants trumpeting because of its magnificence It is sounding like the crash of thunder because of its profundity It is like the voice of the dragonking because it is agreeable It is like the kinnaras song because of its sweetness It is like the kalaviñkas song because it is penetrating and always changing It is like Brahmas cry because it spreads afar It is sweet as the voice of  the king of the gods because it is unsurpassable It is like the sound of the drum because it heralds victory over all demons and rivals It is not haughty because it is unaffected by praise It is grammatically impeccable because it never errs due to any lapse of memory It is never fragmented because it attends to the needs of the disciple at all times It is undaunted because it is unconcerned with wealth and honor It is joyful because it is indefatigable It is comprehensive because it exhibits skill in all the sciences It is holistic because it brings about the simultaneous accomplishment of all the aims of beings It is continuous because its flow is not cut off It is playful because it employs many kinds of expressions to bring out a point It is satisfying to the faculties of all beings because it causes one meaning to convey multiple meanings It is irreproachable because it keeps its promises It is unwavering because it is presented without haste It resounds through all audiences because it is heard equally in audiences far and near It is endowed with the best of all forms because it transforms all worldly matters into illustrations is given expression through speech With exposition analysis and resolution of doubts respectively it sets the subject forth analyses it and explains it Teaching uses frequent repetition and opens up the subject setting it forth distinctly in order to develop a strong certainty It is taught in summary to those who understand through concise statements and it is fully elucidated for those who understand through detailed explanations Furthermore it should be recognized as exempt from the eight faults Since the buddhas teaching is free of them it is unexcelled This teaching is virtue because it causes devotion joy and intelligence it has a twofold meaning is easy to understand and expounds the religious life which has four excellences Intelligence is the intuition of reality by means of the concentrated mind Easy to understand refers to its verbal expression which is good because its words and phrases are sensible it is unique having nothing in common with others it is fulfilling because it fulfills the abandonment of the addictions of the three realms it is completely pure because of its natural purity free from contamination and it is completely purified having completely purified all taints since the processes of those who have terminated contaminations are completely pure The introductory ulterior implicative considers the disciples in order to introduce them to the teaching and not to frighten them  the existence of form and so on is taught The natural implicative considers the three realities the imaginatively constructed and so on teaching that all things are devoid of intrinsic reality and are unproduced Teaching the Dharma The therapeutic implicative refers to the control of faults as will be explained below in the two verses which explain and recommend the supreme vehicle as having the remedies for the eight obscurations The transformative implicative refers to the profundity of expressions for example Wellestablished in the reverse refers to being established in the opposite of permanence happiness purity and self that is in impermanence and so forth wellestablished meaning not ruined Well afflicted by addictions means greatly afflicted by the stress and strain of austerities over a long time The intentional hint should be understood as fourfold intending equality another meaning another time and personal disposition There is the hint of equality such as that in It was I myself who was at that time the perfect Buddha Vipasyin hinting that the Dharmabody is undifferentiated There is the hint of another meaning such as that in All things are unreal and unproduced and so on as this hints at another nonliteral meaning There is the hint of another time such as that in Those who aspire to Sukhvat will be born there hinting at another time And there is the hint of personal disposition as for example when the same root of virtue is praised in some and yet disparaged in others in the complacent with merely minimal These two verses condense the extensive scriptures of the universal vehicle and have the benefits It was I myself who was at that time the perfect Buddha Vipasyin A statement which remedies the complacency obscuration is such as when the Lord disparages a gift and so on which he praised at another time A statement which remedies the passionate behavior obscuration is such as when the Lord praises the magnificence of the buddhaverses A statement which remedies the proud behavior obscuration is such as when the Lord praised the surpassing excellence of some buddha A statement which remedies the obscuration which is the deviance of the uncommitted is such as the prophecies that the great disciples will become buddhas or such as the teaching of the universal vehicle Two types of these benefits apply to the present life and eight types to future lives it should be understood that one gradually attains to higher and higher excellence Excellence of a philosopher has five causes and its benefit is sunlike brilliance as such a person is greatly admired for his inspiring of the world Understanding the import and understanding the teaching he practices the Dharma and cultivates the corresponding realizations practicing the harmonious he lives by the corresponding realizations Sthiramati remarks that this twofoldness of intuition here applies to both types of selflessness That is the person is realized as selfless as object as well as subject and things are realized as selfless as subject as well as object These three mundane concentrations are not false in that they lead to transcendent intuition and they are not authentic because they are not transcendent Thus a knower of import knows that all the teachings the discourses and so forth are like boats Having penetrated the two selflessnesses as previously explained with the alienated individuals twofold intuition of meaning and teaching practices in order to perfect his intuitive knowledge dBal Mang states that this verse concerns the bodhisattva who practices on the application path and Sthiramati remarks that this verse comments on the phrase knows the teaching in the quote from stra given in comment to the first verse The idea is that knowing the teachings as like boats the bodhisattva uses it in the accumulation path to gain learning and wisdom born of learning  but then moves on to apply this learning in thought and meditation Anudharma Then she attains transcendent unexcelled intuition because there is no vehicle more excellent equal to all bodhisattvas on the first stage the stage of the joyous who have such a nature being on that stage Thus she practices harmoniously because she is equal to the bodhisattvas ofthat stage Having accomplished the total termination of the insightabandoned addictions he applies himself to meditation in order to abandon the objective obscurations The meaning of the verse is selfevident By means of the situational and nonconceptual intuition in the situation of the stages and to the nonconceptual intuition Cultivation of harmonious realizations has been shown in these two verses This verse describes residence in a favorable place It should be in a good neighborhood so that evil people such as thieves do not dwell there Cakra  lit The fourth shows how merit previously gathered has a fivefold causal impact This verse shows the intended Ksanopapatti There is no element of passion apart from the ultimate realm thus do the buddhas say that passion drives out passion and so on with the others Since no thing is found apart from the ultimate realm that is there is no thing apart from reality the reality of passion and so on is therefore called passion and also transcendence of passion Since no thing is found outside of the ultimate realm the geniuses consider just that as the intended implication of the teaching of the addictive reality It is in properly engaging with passions and so on that one is liberated from them Even when dwelling in the hells for the sake of beings the most terrible suffering is not harmful in the least to the victorchildren In the Chinese padas c and d are thus as it is said addiction is enlightenment Of these two verses the second proves the first It is like a magical illusion or the sky When water is muddy and then clears its clarity is not produced by that but is just the removal of the taint The principle is just the same in the purification of ones own mind It is accepted that the mind which is always naturally luminous is flawed by accidental faults and it is decreed that there is no other mind apart from the mind of reality which is naturally luminous Just as water is naturally pure but polluted by accidental pollutants mind is accepted as naturally luminous but flawed by accidental faults It is decreed that apart from the realitymind there is no other mind of a relative nature which has natural luminosity Therefore mind is to be understood here as the suchness of mind The bodhisattva has in her very marrow as great a love for beings as towards an only child She is therefore accepted as always beneficial The love of the bodhisattva for beings is here implied to be passionate but any offenses are impossible for them because causes them to work for the benefit of beings The example of the pigeon is due to great passion its extremely intense love for its young For a compassionate bodhisattva it is impossible to be angry at corporeal beings Bodhisattvas as they are loving work for the welfare of beings through being loving towards Following the TibetanPractice them pacifying their malice bringing about their benefit and producing their happiness Like a sick man with good medicine engages in the lifecycle and like a doctor with the sick he engages in practice with living beings He practices with himself as with an untrained servant and he engages his own desires in practice like a merchant with his wares He engages in action like a clothes dyer clothes like a father with his infant son he practices nonviolence with beings His practice is as continual as the rubbing of fire sticks together by one wishing fire like a trustworthy person he engages in practice to fulfill his universal responsibility He practices with wisdom about the facts as a magician In whatever way and wherever there is practice it is all accepted as the bodhisattvas Like a sick person and so on with good medicine and so on In the lifecycle and so on because he frequents the lifecycle having understood it by means of analytical The purification of the three spheres should be understood as the nondiscernment of practitioner tobepracticed and actual practice through the nonconceptual intuition of the selflessness of things An example of transcendent energy emerges in one incalculable eon and increasing faith she is as full of virtuous qualities as the ocean is full of water Thus provided with the stores  the victors spiritual child primordially pure with fine intellect and good will applies himself to the meditative practice  Engagement in Practice taught selfbenefit Then she obtains from the buddhas extensive instruction in the Dharmastream in order to attain extensive serenity and intuition basic thought discursive thought analytic thought ascertaining thought synthetic thought and finally willful thought Discursive thought is that with which one follows the details of the text of those teachings stras and so on which have been taken as objects by names Synthetic thought is for example concentrating the meaning analyzed into the basic thought  to a total synthesis Willful thought is the willpower associated in function with whatever object one apprehends be it the object of meditative concentration of its fulfillment of the fruition of asceticism of entrance to the stages or of distinctive attainments the attitude whose function is preventive the attitude whose function is pacifying and the attitude whose function is equalizing When he has focused the mind on the objective he should not let its continuity waver The intelligent should repeatedly draw the mind within away from external objects Seeing the fault of distraction he should cease any distaste for concentration and in the same way quell avarice anxiety and so forth when they arise The ascetic should then obtain freeflowing in his mind with volitional effort and then from its repeated practice without volitional effort Through the attainment of rhe superknowledges she travels to the universes in order to worship and listen to buddhas beyond measure Then he obtains the five benefits the precursors of purity The entire mass of negative conditioning is dissolved every moment and body and mind are totally filled with fluency He fully recognizes the unannihilated appearances of things he discerns the nonconstructed signs of total purity In this way the genius always and everywhere accomplishes the embrace of the cause for the fulfillment and purification of the body of truth Then he obtains the five benefits which are the precursors of purity In for the fulfillment and purification of the body of truth fulfillment is the tenth bodhisattva stage purification the buddha stage Having become such the bodhisattva in meditative concentration does not perceive any objects separate from her mental discourse When the bodhisattvas mind is in such a concentration she does not perceive any thing apart from her inner mental discourse This is her condition of tolerance because the distraction of subjectivity is abandoned immediately afterwards and so the states of heat and so on should be recognized in their due order Free from the perception of duality means that it is free from the perception of subject and object Unexcelled means that there is no higher intuition Taintless means that the insightabandoned addictions are eliminated It is said that this intuition is free from dust and stain This her foundational transmutation is accepted as the first stage Only after innumerable aeons does she proceed to perfect purity Then when he fully realizes the equality of the realm of truth he attains the constant awareness of the sameness of himself and all beings sameness in selflessness and sameness in suffering since there is no difference between the selflessness and suffering of the processes of self and others the sameness of duties since he and others have the same need to eliminate suffering the sameness of not expecting rewards since he has no more eagerness for rewards from others than from himself and the sameness with other bodhisattvas since his realizations are like their realizations Nondualistic means that it is not divided into subject and object By seeing the realm of truth as a state beyond subject and object she realizes freedom from those addictions abandoned Also the voidness of existence is the relative reality which does not exist in the way it is imagined but does exist through its intrinsic identity It is accepted that the victoroffspring always obtain all the various accessories of enlightenment simultaneously with the path of insight It should be understood that simultaneously with the path of insight all the various accessory qualities of enlightenment of the bodhisattva such as the foci of mindfulness are obtained Having realized intellectually that beings are mere creations selfless and a mere expanse of suffering and having abandoned the view of the useless self discovers the view of the great self which has the great goal She has here a view of self without a view of self intense suffering without any suffering and she accomplishes the goals of all expecting no reward just as one accomplishes ones own benefit oneself The view of the great self which has the great goal is the view of the self which has attained the awareness of the sameness of self and beings Free in mind means free from the abandoned by insight With supreme freedom means thanks to the supreme vehicle Bound by long and heavy chains means chains which come from the continua of all beings Although she does not see the end of suffering because the realms of beings are infinite like space she applies herself to make an end to the sufferings of beings The bodhisattva is the opposite means that she is able to bear the combined sufferings of all living beings for as long as the world lasts This meditative cultivation reaches transcendence after two incalculable aeons attaining the final meditation the bodhisattva receives anointment He arrives at the diamondlike meditative concentration unbroken by conceptualization and obtains the final foundational transmutation untainted by any obscurations And he obtains universal omniscience which is the unexcelled exaltation from which he accomplishes the welfare of all beings Thus always sees the rarely visible muni  and feels intensely satisfied in mind by the force of faith derived from the matchless learning how could she fail to give it the greatest value Ever urged by the always present transcendent lords to stand in the doorway of the Dharma dragged from the abyss of faults as if pulled by the hair is forcefully established in enlightenment Having entirely overcome the whole world everywhere by completely purified insight and nonconceptual understanding and having dispersed the great darkness she illuminates the world far and wide like a great sun Thus ever full of the store of beauty the foremost heroes who always obtain the personal precepts from the ascetic buddhas attain the very expansive meditative concentration of mind and proceed to the far shore of the ocean of excellence Chapter XV This verse shows liberative art as originative because all kinds of virtue such as transcendent generosity and the accessories of enlightenment originate from the three action Here in this world great ordeals of various kinds over many aeons do not overcome the physical verbal and mental actions of the enterprising spiritual children of the victor Action associated with the individual vehicles is compared to poison and so on because it leads to the development of the inferior dedication of that vehicle severs virtuous roots on the universal vehicle fails to produce future virtuous roots destroys the crop of virtuous roots already produced and hinders the attainment of the perfection of buddhahood The threefold discrimination between agent objective and action is never apprehended thus from such an incorporation of liberative art the actions of become perfectly pure infinite and transcendent This fourth verse shows the purificative liberative art purifying action by purifying the three spheres as neither agent object nor action is apprehended Infinite means inexhaustible The fifth gives freedom from the power of the addictions since contemplation conquers addictions The sixth gives unerringness in duties through thorough knowledge of the reality of all undertakings He accomplishes his own aims in all ways through three  with the basic  with mental stability and with liberation Others aims become own aims on account of nondepletion nonviolence tolerance of violence indefatigability in action charisma and eloquence Through giving and so on all the bodhisattvas become exclusively altruistic aims since respectively he is not depleted by his possessions to others is nonviolent is tolerant of others violence is tireless in his works of friendliness  is charismatic through his powers of magic and so on and is eloquent in teaching as cuts through doubts Therefore altruistic aims become the bodhisattvas own aims because others duties as his own duties and thus attains great enlightenment Thus the transcendences are six in terms of the exclusive altruism of aims The bodhisattva takes no delight in pleasures having no regard for them in his giving Through tolerance and effort he is unwearying in suffering caused by beings and by nature and in his intense dedication to virtue Thus the transcendences are six with respect to their epitomizing the universal vehicle Generosity is a path of nonattachment to objects because the repeated practice of generosity frees one from such attachments Morality is a path oP the control of distractions from attaining ones aim  one who takes the monks vow in order to attain his goal thereby prevents all distractions arising from evolutionary works Tolerance is a path of not forsaking beings because one is not revulsed by any suffering or any sort of harm Effort is a path of the increase of virtue because virtue increases for one who initiates effort Thus the transcendences are six with respect to the path in all its forms The victors expound the six transcendences considering the three educations the first includes three  the other two the last two  and the one all three This is the sixth through giving disregards her property undertake morality and then she can preserve that undertaking through tolerance by not responding aggressively to aggression and so on The one transcendence of effort is included in all three educations because effort accompanies all of them It goes with nonconceptual intuition because it applies to the realization of the selflessness of things It develops beings in three ways since attracting beings through generosity the involves them in the three vehicles according to their destinies morality and so forth develop beings by attracting them and developing them in the three vehicles They are taught in their order because the latter arises dependent on the former they have progressively superior status and they grow progressively subtle One who disregards property is concerned with morality the moral person becomes tolerant the tolerant person exerts his effort an energetic person produces meditative concentration and a concentrated person intuitively understands the real They progress from inferior to superior Generosity is inferior and morality superior and so on up to contemplation is inferior and wisdom superior Generosity is coarse easy to enter and easy to practice while morality is more subtle harder to enter and practice and so on up to coarser contemplation and subtler wisdom poverty is removed coolness is obtained anger is destroyed there is dedication to excellence the mind is held firm and there is intuitive knowledge of the ultimate As it takes away poverty it is called generosity As it confers coolness it is called morality since one who has it is not burned by the addictions of involvement with objects As it is the destruction of anger it is called tolerance as it terminates anger As it holds the mind within it is called contemplation Based on the strength of analytical discernment it is the repeated practice of the transcendences on the strength of wisdom There are four types of realization of the transcendences based on conscientious attitudes the attitude of faith is faith in the scriptures which treat all the transcendences The realization of the transcendences based on aspiration is sixfold The bodhisattva has an insatiable aspiration for generosity She would bestow on even one being in only one instant universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges filled with the seven jewels lives as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and likewise also eons as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in every instant Just as she gives to the one single being so she should give by the same amount to Bhavana translated realization to preserve the double sense of mental focus in awareness and actually bring into beingmake realThe Transcendences all the many realms full of beings who are to be fully matured for unexcelled truly perfect enlightenment The bodhisattva does not neglect that process of giving even for a single moment he does not discontinue it until he sits on the seat of enlightenment Such an aspiration is the bodhisattvas expansive aspiration for generosity The bodhisattva who cares for beings with her giving becomes more happy not that the beings so cared for by her generosity When the bodhisattva thus gives to those beings he truly regards those he helps as being more helpful to him than he himself because they serve as the very foundation of unexcelled perfect enlightenment Such an aspiration is the bodhisattvas helpful aspiration for generosity A bodhisattva who has amassed such vast merit from generosity has no desire for reward or for evolutionary development Such an aspiration is the bodhisattvas unsullied aspiration for the realization of the transcendence of generosity The bodhisattva rejoices in the evolutionary development resulting from such a vast mass of giving to beings and not to herself Taking all beings as common  she develops them towards unexcelled perfect enlightenment in bodies as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in lives as long as eons as numerous as the sands of the Ganges the bodhisattva even though always deprived of possessions should manifest the four behaviors in the great billion world universe filled with fire By the same means he should realize a mass of morality up to a mass of wisdom through which unexcelled perfect enlightenment is realized because the bodhisattvas aspiration for the realization of the transcendence of morality up to the realization of the transcendence of wisdom is insatiable Such an aspiration is the bodhisattvas insatiable aspiration for the realization of the transcendence of morality up to the insatiable aspiration for the realization of the transcendence of wisdom So long as the bodhisattva does not sit on the seat of enlightenment she does not relax the process of the realization of the transcendence of morality up to the Chapter XVI process of the realization of the transcendence of wisdom she does not discontinue it The bodhisattva in helping through the realization of transcendent morality up to the realization of the transcendence of wisdom becomes happier than those beings he helps Such an aspiration is the bodhisattvas joyous aspiration for the realization of the transcendence of morality up to the realization of the transcendence of wisdom The bodhisattva regards beings as more helpful than herself for she thinks they are helpful in such realization of the transcendence of morality up to the realization of the transcendence of wisdom and I am not because they are the very foundation of unexcelled perfect enlightenment Such an aspiration is the bodhisattvas helpful aspiration for the realization of the transcendence of morality up to the realization of the transcendence of wisdom A bodhisattva who has amassed vast merit from the realization of the transcendence of morality up to the realization of the transcendence of wisdom has no desire for reward or evolutionary progress Such an aspiration is the bodhisattvas unsullied aspiration toward the realization of the transcendence of morality up to the realization of the transcendence of wisdom The bodhisattva rejoices in the evolutionary progress of beings and not of himself from the mass of merit coming from the realization of transcendent morality up to the realization of the transcendence of wisdom Regarding all beings in common he develops them towards unexcelled perfect enlightenment The realization based on liberative art has three types By nonconceptual intuition she discerns the purification of the three spheres Such is the liberative art for perfecting all conscientious attitudes Mastery over the body should be recognized in the two bodies of a transcendent lord the intrinsic reality and the beatific Mastery over conduct is to be recognized in the emanation body by which he shows conduct that corresponds in all its aspects to all beings Mastery over teaching is the irresistibility in the teaching of the six transcendences in all their formsThe Transcendences There are twelve verses summarizing the analysis The presentation of gifts to those who receive them is the reality of generosity It is caused by the volition that naturally emerges from freedom from greed and so on It results in perfection of wealth and embodiment which includes length of life as in the Scripture on the Five Points Its activity is assistance to self and other and completion of the stores of great enlightenment Its endowment with freedom from avarice is present among those who are not avaricious The wise person should practice morality having understood it thus The six elements are from living morally up to she disciplines herself in her commitments to the precepts Aimed at the realization of serenity indicates its cause because one takes it up with the ambition for Nirvana Granting good lives and stability indicates its result because by morality one goes to good migrations and because the mind becomes stabilized through freedom from discontent and so on respectively Morality is the basis of all virtue is peace pacifying the burning of the addictions and is fearlessness because fear sin and enmity based on killing and so forth are not produced Its endowment is the store of merit because one always preserves the activities of body speech and mind as patience endurance and knowledge from compassion and the support of the teaching as taught to have five benefits as accomplishing the aims of both as universally supreme asceticism and as considered threefold on the part of those the tolerance which is patient with harm here patience means being patient the tolerance which endures suffering and the tolerance which embodies the teaching respectively Taught to have five benefits indicates its result as it is stated in scripture There are five benefits of tolerance not much enmity not much divisiveness abundance of happiness and joy ability to face death without regret and rebirth in exalted heavens after the loss of the body As it is stated He who accomplishes the aims of both self and others is the one who while aware of others anger immediately controls his own Considered threefold indicates the analysis of its function as already stated in the threefold analysis of tolerance as true enthusiasm for virtue as based on faith and will as increaser of excellences such as mindfulness as remedy of addictive tendencies as endowed with virtues such as nongreed and as sevenfold among those Based on faith and will indicates its cause for a confident and purposeful person engages her effort Increaser of excellences such as mindfulness shows its result since excellences such as mindfulness and meditative concentration are produced in one whose effort is engaged As remedy for addictive tendencies shows its activity as it is said The enterprising person dwells in happiness unperturbed by sinful nonvirtuous habits Endowed with virtues such as nongreed shows its endowment as the inner stability of mind as established in mindfulness and effort as source of happiness as mastery of superknowledges and stations as the foremost practice as threefold found among those Inner stability of mind indicates its reality Established in mindfulness and effort indicates its cause as trance is achieved when the objective is not forgotten and effort is exerted Source of happiness shows its result since the result of contemplation is the development of immunity from harm Among those shows that the ground of its function is among contemplatives and threefold shows the analysis of its function as it functions with both consideration and analysis without consideration and with analysis alone and without either consideration or analysis as true discernment of objects as based on meditative concentration as good liberator from addiction as the life of wisdom and excellence in teaching as supreme among practices and as threefold found among those True discernment of objects indicates its reality true means objects which are not false and excludes authentic discernment of mundane duties Based on meditative concentration shows its cause as the concentrated mind intuitively understands reality Liberator from addiction shows its result since there is liberation from addictions through discernment mundane slightly transcendent and greatly transcendent Life of wisdom and excellence in teaching shows its activity since it enables one to live as unexcelled among those who live for wisdom and to teach the authentic teaching Supreme among things shows endowment with supremacy as it is said Wisdom is the supreme of all things Threefold as found among those indicates its function as it functions among the wise with a threefold differentiation into mundane slightly transcendental and greatly transcendental So are stated the analyses of generosity and so on each with a sixfold analysis All good practices are the practices of generosity and so on Distracted includes the first two transcendences because both generosity and resolutely engaged morality are not meditatively concentrated Concentrated includes the last two because of the stability of contemplation and the wisdom that accords with reality The resistant tendency to generosity consists of seven types of attachment attachment to wealth attachment to relaxation attachment to easy complacency attachment to reward attachment to evolutionary progress attachment to resistance due to the failure to overcome the instinctual habit attached to the resistance and attachment to distraction Attachment to distraction is of two kinds attitudinal distraction from interest in the individual vehicle and discriminative distraction from discriminating between giver recipient and gift Thus since it is free from the sevenfold attachment the nonattachment of generosity has been repeated seven times Attachment to resistances results from not overcoming their instinctual propensities Discriminative distraction results from discriminatively discerning the three spheres in various situations appropriate Out of compassion the buddhaoffspring when they meet a suppliant always give up even their own lives without desiring any reward from others and without interest in any desired result The buddhaoffspring always take up the triple morality consisting of restraint and exertion The buddhaoffspring undergo great austerities and all the injuries inflicted by people not for the sake of heaven not from inability not from fear and not from desire for benefit The buddhaoffspring exert incomparable effort by nature defensive and progressive in order to slaughter the army of the addictions of themselves and others and to attain the holy enlightenment It endowed with many meditative concentrations because it incorporates the limitless concentrations of the bodhisattvas The Tibetan reads nirvrtau as nirvanau and samvrtau as samsarau which makes the verse more explicit and may have been the reading of the Sanskrit text the Tibetan translators used The summarized meaning of these six verses is taught by a seventh verse In sum magnificence nonexploitiveness greatness of aim and inexhaustibility should be understood as the four excellences of generosity and so forth But that is always outdone by the bodhisattva  who is even more happy to encounter the petitioner and to fulfill his wishes and is even more unhappy not to encounter him and not to fulfill his wishes This shows the excellence of his morality opposed to the three evil physical actions Moved by compassion she has no concern  is evenminded fearless and totally generous How could such a holy person speak falsely in order to harm another Or else for the sake of others out of love for a dear person or out of fear such as fear of a king the bodhisattva has no concern for her own body and life She is fearless because she has transcended the five fears He desires to help equally is kindly terrified of making others suffer and is devoted to educating beings very far from the three faults of speech The bodhisattva desires to help all beings equally how could he engage in slander for the purpose of creating dissensions between friends He is kind as his motive is to dispel others suffering and he is terrified of making others suffer how could he indulge in harsh speech for the purpose of making others suffer Allgiving compassionate and expert in the arising of things in relativity how could she endure any form of mental addictionThe Transcendences Greed aggression and false convictions respectively This should be recognized as the excellence of the bodhisattvas purity of morality through its association with the special qualities which remedy immorality The compassionate always considers it a help when he is harmed and always finds pleasure in suffering that helps others so what is there to tolerate for such a person When an injury must be tolerated the bodhisattva will be able to consider it a help since it causes his development of tolerance When suffering must be endured the bodhisattva will be able to find pleasure even in that suffering as it serves as cause of helping others For such a person in whom the notions injury and suffering do not arise what is there to tolerate The compassionate person is the bodhisattva Whatever difficult tasks for the sake of others her effort is both not difficult and very difficult because free from considering others as other and because she loves others more than herself at all times For three  contemplation is considered slight happiness or selfish happiness to be suppressed perishable exhausting and quite delusive for the bodhisattvas it is the reverse His contemplation gives great happiness such happiness being both selfgratifying and altruistic It is irrepressible not perishable not exhausting and free from delusion The three knowledges are like groping about in the darkness or like a lamp under cover But the knowledge of the compassionate is unrivalled just like the rays of the sun Groping about with the hand in the dark knowledge whose object is small in scope not immediate and unclear such is the knowledge of alienated individuals A lamp in a cave knowledge which is limited immediate and yet not very impeccable such is the knowledge of the disciples and hermit buddhas The rays of the sun knowledge which is totally immediate and extremely impeccable such is the knowledge of the bodhisattvas The embodiment is the bodhisattva The process is compassion The dedication is the ambition for the fruition of great enlightenment through such The cause consists of the instincts developed by repeated practice of transcendent generosity in former lives The intuition is the nonconceptual intuition with which one gives gifts in complete purity of the three sectors  free of discrimination of giver gift and recipient Its field is fivefold consisting of the petitioner the sufferer the protectorless the evildoer and the virtuous Its reliance relying on which gifts are given is threefold consisting of conviction conscientious attitude and meditative concentration Conviction is the attitude of faith as described in the context of the analysis of meditative realization Meditative concentration for example skytreasury and so forth is like the mastery taught in the same place Thus it is that generosity is supreme because of the supremacy of embodiment and so forth The supreme substance of morality is the bodhisattvas vow of tolerance is the deprivation of life by inferior or weak persons of contemplation is the bodhisattvas meditative concentrations of wisdom is suchness The field of all the rest such as morality is the universal vehicle Though he himself were hurt for many eons the bodhisattva would love generosity if it made even one being happy what need to mention the opposite case If the generosity of the bodhisattva were to give happiness to only one being although he himself were harmed for many eons he would yet love it because of his distinctive compassion How much more if many beings are made happy and he himself is benefited for many eons If his mind does not suffer even when giving up the body itself what can one say concerning things of small value But when he is made happy by that suffering it is even more transcendent it is transcendent of transcendent A petitioner is not happy even when he receives absolutely all that he desires but the genius is still happier by giving all she has in this world for the happiness of the petitioner Even when laden with wealth a petitioner does not consider himself wealthy but the genius impoverished by having given away all his wealth believes himself all the more wealthy Yet none other than the bodhisattva is rich with the delight in giving Effort is the best among the host of virtues teaches that it is the principal of all virtuous practices For later attainment relies upon it teaches that it is the principal cause since relying upon effort all virtuous qualities are attained This is the analysis of its types In the context of the authentic abandonments effort has decrease and increase in the decrease of unvirtuous phenomena inThe Transcendences two  and in the increase of virtuous phenomena in two In the context of the branches of enlightenment effort enters into reality because they are classed in the path of insight In the context of the branches of the path it is transforming because it is the ground for foundational transmutation in the path of meditative realization Again effort is inferior mediocre and outstanding with respect to its embodiment which is the person engaged in the three vehicles This embodiment is the person engaged in the three vehicles and for those persons effort is to be understood as inferior mediocre and outstanding respectively Motivation and intellect are feeble for those engaged in the two individual vehicles because they are governed solely by their own aims They are extremely magnificent for those engaged in the great vehicle because they are governed by the aims of others This analyzes as the remedies of the four obstructions The obstructions to generosity and so forth are fourfold preventing one from engaging in generosity and so forth Effort is to be known as fourfold according to such analysis of its resistances Ascertainment from mutual inclusion The giving of fearlessness includes morality and tolerance for it is by means of those two that gives fearlessness The giving of the teaching includes meditation and wisdom for it is by means of those two that one gives the teaching Both include effort and thus one gives both Thus the mutual inclusion of tolerance and so forth are also to be worked out appropriately generosity is sixfold generositygenerosity moralitygenerosity and so on up to wisdomgenerosity because of the adherence of morality and so on in the processes of others Their ascertainment by means of the teaching should be understood as the mutual inclusion of whatever scriptures are seen to relate to the topics of generosity and so forth and whatever references to generosity and so forth appear in the scriptures Their ascertainment by means of causal process is as follows Also morality is the causal process for giving and so forth because those ordained in the vow of a monk renounce all they own and because when they stand in morality they develop tolerance and so forth In a parallel way one should work out how each of the other transcendences such as tolerance mutually serve as each others causal processes Generosity is accepted as the same as the transcendence Consistency of behavior refers to practicing oneself what one has recommended to others Why are these considered the four social practices A beneficial art a means of holding an impeller and likewise an example these are to be known as the four social practices Generosity is a beneficial art because by giving beings worldly goods physical benefit arises Pleasant speech is a means of holding because it enables the uneducated to understand a perplexing notion Fulfilling aims is an impeller because it impels towards virtue Through pleasant words one comes to have faith in the teaching because ones doubts are resolved and the meaning made clear Through fulfilling beings aims one practices according to the teaching The four social practices are considered to be included in two groups worldly goods and to the teaching Furthermore the teaching has three types The bodhisattvas association is to be understood as inferior mediocre and superior among those who are engaged in the three vehicles respectively And it is totally successful on the eighth stage and above because necessarily fulfills the aims of beings It serves to fulfill all aims of all and the buddhas have praised it thus as an art of happiness This shows that for the evolutionary progress of beings in the three realms the four social practices are the path of the one vehicle for there is no other path This shows how the bodhisattva when she stands in the six transcendences as they have been taught employs the social practices for she achieves her individual and altruistic aims respectively through the transcendences and the social practicesCHAPTER XVII Worship Service and the Immeasurables Seven verses on the analysis of the worship of buddhas As must wish to fulfill his own aim with the six transcendences and must not weary in the social practices in order to fulfill the aims of others there are the methods of making those two powerful there is the worship of the Three Jewels as the remedy of miserliness the reliance on the spiritual teacher as the remedy of false morality and the contemplation of the immeasurables as the remedy of the disciples false practices Worship is elucidated in terms of object materials causal process dedication cause intuition field and resources The materials are robes and so on The causal process is the mind endowed with profound clarity The dedication is to the completion of the stores of merit and intuition The field is immeasurable beings by the development of beings refers to the process of planting in them by the performance of that Sympathy is for living beings Facing facts is the proper attitude towards things which does not distort reality Realization of things is the realization of reality on the path of insight when the realistic view is produced In this context past is a cause and present an effect Present is a cause future an effect Thus one should understand past present and future in terms of cause and effect Personal is internal By others is external wealth and devotion is gross with practice subtle Again accompanied by pride is inferior without pride superior because of the latters nondiscrimination of the three sectors to be performed at another time is distant in the present near When is interrupted for lives it is distant uninterrupted  it is near Again the worship which is vowed in the future is distant that which one vows to perform is near If one asks It has five modes Service is shown in terms of ground material process dedication cause intuition field and resource One should serve a friend who is disciplined tranquil serene outstanding in good qualities energetic rich in scripture awakened to reality skilled in speech compassionate and indefatigable Disciplined means that the senses are restrained due to moral discipline Tranquil means that the mind is internally quieted by discipline in meditative concentration Serene means the instinctual addictions are eradicated by the discipline of wisdom Energetic means that he is not indifferent to the welfare of others Rich in scripture means that his learning is not inferior Awakened to reality means that he understands reality Compassionate means that his mind is free from the desire for material possessions Indefatigable means that he teaches the Dharma continuously and reverently These are the materials of service The cause of service is practice in accordance with what has been taught because that is what pleases the mind of such Having attained intellectual skill in the three vehicles one should strive in the accomplishment of ones own vehicle Intuitive wisdom comes from skill in the three vehicles immeasurable beings and a thoroughly pure buddhaverse since having learned the Dharma one instills it in those and one stands in that Learning is gross whereas reflection and meditation applications in mind are subtle Perseverance with and without pride differentiates between inferior and superior The sublime stations are the four immeasurables love compassion joy and equanimity And what kind of object is the objectless When their object is beings they function for those who seek happiness and so on up to for those beings who are addicted Love has the mode that beings be happy compassion has the mode that be free from suffering joy has the mode that not be separated from happiness and equanimity has the mode of causing beings to become free from addictions in the midst of experiences They are objectless because  the are nonconceptual as if objectless The sublime stations are fourfold They are mutable or susceptible to loss when they are liable to destruction They are immutable or capable of duration and intensification when they are not subject to destruction By the sentimental refers to those whose minds are not expansive who long for the pleasure The bodhisattvas take their stand in those immutable and free of attachments Not in those which are mutable or overappreciated She is born in the desire realm among its beings refers to the evolutionary effect Four other verses classify virtues and faults The bodhisattva who is malicious violent unhappy and addicted to malice and lust undergoes many kinds of troubles The first three phrases show the troubles which he suffers of injury to himself injury to others and injury to both The six phrases damaged and so on show the increase of the disagreeable in the present life Word of his evil reputation spreads in all the directions The three remaining phrases show respectively the increase of the disagreeable in the immediate future and in the future life and that he experiences mental suffering generated by that and despair This shows the intensity of the love and so forth of the bodhisattvas Enflamed under the power of enemies oppressed by suffering enveloped in darkness traveling a difficult road bound with great chains enflamed by attachment to pleasure devoted to sensepleasure under the power of enemies impeded by the deeds of devils even when engaged in virtue They are enveloped in darkness when as butchers and the like they are wholly given over to evil conduct due to ignorance of the evolutionary consequences of their actions Traveling a difficult road refers to those who miss the principle of final liberation because they do not radically sever the continuum of the cyclic life Bound with great chains refers to those heterodox fundamentalists fixed on liberation because they are bound with the tight chains of various wrong views Greatly fond of food mixed with poison refers to those who are addicted to the pleasure of meditative absorption for them the pleasure of meditative absorption is addicted like delicious food mixed with poison and should be shunned accordingly Strayed from the path refers to those arrogant persons who have wandered from the path of liberation Remaining on the wrong path refers to those of uncertain genealogy who set out on the individual vehicle Of little strength refers to those bodhisattvas whose stores are incomplete These ten types of living beings are the objects of the bodhisattvas compassion Prevents violence refers to the disjunctive result  because its resistance violence is destroyed Causes the desirable refers to the evolutionary result Naturally imparts itself refers to the homogeneous result because it gives the result of distinctive compassion in the future When one relies upon such fivefold compassion buddhahood should be understood as not far off at all The compassionate best genius understands that everything included in the lifecycle is naturally both suffering and also selfless and so neither becomes disgusted nor damaged by any faults She suffers means that she feels compassion She knows what it is means that she knows suffering just as it is and the means to avoid suffering means that she knows that by which it is destroyed Thus knowing the suffering of the cyclic life just as it is and the means of renouncing it the bodhisattva does not become exhausted thanks to her distinctive compassion This should be understood as proceeding respectively from the excellence of the spiritual gene from an analysis of virtues and faults from its cultivation in former lives and from the attainment of detachment When its resistant tendency violence is abandoned purity is attained that is detachment is attainedChapter XVII equal towards happy and so on being aware that whatever is experienced in this life is misery constant because it is not exhausted in the remainderless Nirvana It is from universal responsibility for those who enter the stages and attain the resolve to the equality of self and others It is from practice because it functions to deliver from suffering It is from nonperception when the tolerance of things nonproduction is attained Compassion tolerance ambition resolution life and the full evolution of living beings this is the great tree of compassion beginning with the root and ending with the superior fruit The tree of compassion should be known in its root trunk branches leaves flowers and fruits Its root is compassion tolerance its trunk ambition for the sake of beings its branches resolutions for beautiful lives its leaves beautiful life its flower and the evolutionary fulfillment of beings its fruit One should recognize that love is the watering of compassion its broad growth comes from joyous willingness to undergo suffering and the vast spread of its branches comes from fitting conscientious attitudes Then from the suffering produced in the bodhisattva compassionately devoted to the aims of beings happiness arises which causes the broad growth that is the growth of tolerance which is called the trunk and the trunk is broad From success in the personal objective that is the development of ones own continuum life is like a fertile flower Who would not be compassionate toward beings who are the source of the virtue of universal mercy There is a matchless happiness even in that suffering which mercy for them generates The second half of the verse shows the virtue of great compassion All people are fond of worldly happiness and of their own lives and the mentality of disciples and hermit buddhas who are not attached  still rests in Nirvana where all suffering is quieted But the mentality of bodhisattvas does not resort even to Nirvana because they are permeated with compassion How much less then will they be fond of both The love of such as father and mother is made of craving and so is liable to reproach those who dwell in mundane compassion though irreproachable is still mundane But the love of bodhisattvas is made of compassion and is both irreproachable and transcendent The world stands upon the great flood of suffering in the great darkness of ignorance how could the art of saving it indeed fail to be irreproachable One should construe the great flood with suffering and the great darkness with ignorance One verse on the significance of terror and delight When they have no suffering suffering brought to the bodhisattvas by mercy terrifies them at first but once it is experienced causes them extreme delight When they have no suffering refers to an absence of suffering The suffering of bodhisattvas which is brought them by their mercy for beings terrifies them at first on the stage of action through faith because they do not have experience of what suffering is like in the equality of self and others Merciful suffering surpasses every mundane happiness and is missed even by one who has accomplished his own aim what could be more supremely wondrous There is nothing more wondrous than this that the bodhisattvas suffering born from compassion becomes happiness and surpasses all mundane happiness The happiness from enjoyments in the three realms does not approach that happiness does not touch a portion of that happiness Through mercy for the sake of beings he does not forsake the lifecycle made of suffering what suffering will the compassionate bodhisattvas not embrace in order to accomplish the benefit of others Chapter XVII All suffering in fact is included in the suffering of the lifecycle Compassion generosity and fortune always increase for the merciful and therefrom come the happinesses born of love helpfulness and powerful ability And from these three three happinesses come forth as results happiness born of love due to compassion happiness born of helpfulness due to generosity and happiness born of the ability to act to assist beings with that fortune I increase I cause increase I fully develop  I gladden I attract and I lead it is as if compassion encourages those weak in generosity It is as if compassion uses six virtues to encourage bodhisattvas weak in generosity It increases naturally it increases by fortune it brings it brings beings to evolutionary maturity with generosity it produces happiness in the giver it attracts the stores of great enlightenment and it leads one close to great enlightenment One verse on the experience of happiness due to the happiness of others How could one who from mercy suffers in the presence of suffering become happy without making happy Thus the merciful makes himself happy by making others happy Due to compassion the bodhisattva suffers with the sufferings of others How could he become happy if he does not create happiness in beings Thus it should be known that the bodhisattva makes himself happy by giving happiness to others The compassionate one uninterested in her own happiness instructs as it were her own generosity Make others happy with gifts of wealth otherwise I also will have no happiness as indistinguishable The compassionate one in fact is not happy apart from the happiness of others The giver though he hates wealth keeps getting wealth even more abundant and beautiful but I do not think of that as happiness because for me there is just more continuity in giving I desire uninterrupted generosity not happiness In this way the bodhisattva instructs generosity I will not delight in generosity if I do not relinquish any fruit I get You do not give fruits to one who does not because you expect reward you are not my equal You give fruits to whomsoever practices you thus you are not my equal regarding rewards because I For the spiritual offspring of the victors compassionate generosity is irreproachable pure in basis beneficial protective unsolicited and unsullied It is pure in its basis giving appropriate objects excluding poison weapons and intoxicants It is beneficial since what is gathered through generosity is applied to virtue It is unsolicited since evenWorship Service and the Immeasurables without being requested one gives of ones own accord once one has understood needy or deprived and since the honorable do not solicit For the spiritual offspring of the victors compassionate generosity is total vast excellent continual joyous nonexploitive and pure inclined towards enlightenment and virtue It is total because it gives internal and external objects It is vast giving things in abundance It is excellent giving the best things It is continual giving continually It is joyous giving cheerfully without deliberation It is inclined towards enlightenment because it tends towards great enlightenment A voluptuary does not obtain any satisfaction in enjoyments like the satisfaction which comes to a compassionate one from renunciation her mind satiated with the three pleasures The three pleasures are the pleasure of generosity the pleasure of helping others and the pleasure of gathering the stores The violent are the immoral who do harm to others The disturbed are the angry The reckless are the lazy Those dependent on senseobjects are those whose minds are distracted by sense objects Those who are addicted to falsehood are those with false wisdom such as the fanatics and so forth The first half shows the objective condition of compassion Compassion is born from three kinds of suffering in taking the three types of sensation as objects The sensation without happiness or suffering is linked to happiness and suffering because it leads to them once again It is equal because whichever of the three kinds of sensations he experiences he knows that all sensation is suffering The superior meditative practice of love and so forth comes from ones own mind from faith in the teaching from resolve from mastery from nonconceptualization and from onenessWorship Service and the Immeasumbles One should understand the meaning according to the explanation given above This shows the four characteristics of the bodhisattvas conscience through the perfection of nature association objective and activity In the first there are the sense of shame in the restraining morality the bravery in the morality accomplishing beings aims and the indefatigability in the morality that gathers virtue Perhaps the vehicle difference individual versus universal orientation comes into play since the bodhisattvas conscience will not let him or her rest from practicing the altruistic transcendences When resistances to the six transcendences increase and their remedies decrease the bodhisattvas guilty conscience becomes intolerable The brave feel a guilty conscience when they are lazy in the practice of the six transcendences and energetic in actions attuned with the addictions Conscience is inferior when its nature is unconcentrated when it is feeble or mediocre when it is on a lower stage when it has inferior aspiration and when it is filled with pride This conscience as weak and strong This shows that she experiences suffering derived from that and the associated mental functions such as anxiety None of these faults adhere to the buddhaoffspring who have conscience Such an enlightened person is always born among gods and humans These are disjunctive and homogeneous effects that is freedom from resistances and endowment with the remedies respectively But the victorchild who is clothed with conscience is free of any taint of fault no matter if he is quite naked Even one who is clothed in other garments is tainted with faults if he lacks conscience and even one who is naked is impeccable if he has conscience Chapter XVIII One adorned with conscience shines in the company of victorchildren The bodhisattvas conscientiousness towards disciples is like the tenderness of a mother Conscience is a defense against all the faults of the lifecycle It serves like an army of elephants horses and so on The similes of clothing and so on show conscience to be a remedy against passions while at rest a remedy against mundane concerns while in motion conducive to association with spiritual friends conducive to the evolutionary development of living beings and conducive to unaddicted migration through the lifecycle This shows the four signs left by the conscience of a conscientious person The courage of bodhisattvas excels all others by its nature varieties and firmness Courage is considered to consist of effort concentration wisdom heroism and endurance Thereby the bodhisattva proceeds fearlessly by the three Therefore the word courage is to be known as comprising three spontaneous qualities effort and so on Abandon is to be understood as disregard of body and life on the part of one intent upon his own interests The heroine is not shaken by wicked friends sufferings or the hearing of the profound just as Mt This shows the firmness of the bodhisattvas courage The indefatigability of the bodhisattvas is peerless in three things Sthiramati explains that when the bodhisattva is born into the lifecycle for the sake of beings he is uncorrupted by the addictions Its concern is to accomplish the aims of self and others Its function in the first  is ones own practice and its communication to others Having heard them they are successfully retained rehearsed their meaning is examined with a clear mind their faults and virtues are understood in due order and good and bad elucidations are ascertained Chapter XVIII It is inexhaustible because it is not terminated in any remainderless Nirvana Successful fruition is ontological and phenomenological omniscience The bodhisattvas knowledge of sciences is contained in the doors of concentration and retention How by body Its cessation proceeds from two  the fact of cessation and the fact of path corresponding to what ceases and the means by which Therefore one who knows them is said to know the world because she is endowed with the knowledge of the creation and cessation of the world This indicates the function of knowledge of the world Inarticulable attainment is the transmundane intuition of realization because it is inexpressible Here is taught the refutation of any critic of the literal expression of its false understanding and of its verbalized attainment The second refutes the literal sense but not the intended sense The bodhisattvas four spiritual intellectual knowledges are considered peerless due to their knowledge of formulation nature language and knowledge The second of nature is that of knowing the name corresponding to the referent The third of language is that of knowing the language spoken in each of the countries The fourth of knowledge is ones own inspired eloquence This is the definition of the spiritual intellectual knowledges It is necessary for one who is engaged in the teaching of what the teaching and by what Teaching and meaning By speech and by knowledge Teaching by knowledge is for the refutation of objections It is called spiritually intellectual knowledge pratisamvid because it is the experiential realization that follows arrival at spiritual ipratvtmarii equanimity  and to destroy all doubts Through transmundane intuition one arrives within the inner mind at the equality of all things in their suchness and later on ones experiential realization through aftermath intuition is called spiritual intellectual knowledge The bodhisattvas store consisting of merit and wisdom is unequalled one leading to ascendance in the cycle of life the other to unaddicted living The store of wisdom leads to unaddicted living Generosity and morality constitute the store of merit wisdom wisdom three others both  and five constitute the store of wisdom The first two transcendences are the store of merit as generosity produces wealth and morality produces human and divine lives Moreover all five transcendences pertain to the store of wisdom because they are conducive to the development of intuition Sam means continuous bh being dedicated to practice and rah repeated achievement On the first six stages they lead to the seventh stage the signless where signs no longer operate On the seventh stage they lead to the effortless which includes the next two stages On those two the stores lead to the consecration which constitutes the tenth stage And on that stage the stores lead to the culmination which is the buddha stage The bodhisattvas meditative practice of the foci of mindfulness is distinctively outstanding in these fourteen respects He knows them as they are in the system of the disciples vehicle according to their exposition in the Bh Compare the Chinese versionThe Accessories of Enlightenment remedial power because it enters into the objective selflessness of such things as the body by using the concepts of impurity suffering impermanence and selflessness as remedies against the four mistaken notions entry because the four foci of mindfulness cause self and others to enter into the facts of suffering origin cessation and path respectively as taught in the Analysis of Center and Extremes objective because it takes the bodies and so on of all beings as its objects L conscientious attitude because the body and so on is not perceived attainment because it leads neither to severance nor nonseverance from the body and so on conformity because it conforms to the transcendences which remedy its resistances SeeAMVllallbChapter XVIII its thorough knowledge that sensation is like a dream it is experienced as false Through its thorough knowledge of the natural luminosity of the mind as like open space And through its thorough knowledge of the coincidentality of things  just as minor blemishes such as dust smoke clouds and mist are coincidental in the sky life because in voluntary rebirth in the world as a universal monarch and so on body experience and the rest are especially excellent because they are totally free of addictions practice as such perfect practice does not come to an end even in the remainderless Nirvana And culmination because it succeeds on the ten stages and in buddhahood Sthiramati explains that resonating and harmonizing practice refers to eighth stage bodhisattvas where mindfulness is perfected realistic exertion to remedy the resistances that flaw the abovementioned practice of the foci of mindfulness The five hindrances according to AS p With associated processes indicates meditation accompanied by the processes of serenity control and equanimity How does one exert efforts Attaining equality one concentrates in equanimity Mindfulness and alertness are determination  because by the former the mind does not diffuse itself among objects and by the latter the diffusion is easily recognized Motivation and equanimity are remedial arts because they are remedies of the affects of depression and excitement and of the addictions Vision is the fivefold eye physical eye divine eye the holy wisdom eye the Dharma eye and the buddha eye Instruction is the six superknowledges because their employment gives knowledge respectively of speech thought whence one comes and where one goes which is powerfully instructive of renunciation Mastery indicates the ten masteries described in that same text Attainment of qualities indicates the attainment of the powers fearlessnesses and qualities exclusive to a buddha Bodhisattva practice is the basis of the faculty of effort The scheme of the factors of enlightenment is set forth for one who has entered the stages based upon her understanding of the equality of all things and beings In the condition of being on the stages one understands the equality of all things and of all beings through objective selflessness and the equality of self and others respectively The bodhisattva endowed with such virtues is like the universal monarch always surrounded by the factors of enlightenment which are like the seven precious jewels In the Chinese translation this verse appears in prose immediately after Lvi vs The Accessories of Enlightenment This concludes the comparison of the factors of enlightenment with the seven jewels This shows the factors of enlightenment and in what way they are factors Mindfulness is the basic factor because everything functions in dependence upon it Effort is the transcendence factor because its continuity is unbroken as long as enlightenment is not attained Joy is the benefit factor because it is the happiness of mind Adeptness concentration and equanimity constitute the factors of nonaddiction The addictionless factor is known as threefold analyzed into cause effect and actuality Sthiramati explains that the bodhisattva practices the seven factors of enlightenment on the insight path during the first bodhisattva stage abandoning the affective and cognitive obscurations on that level Beyond that then refers to the practice from the second to the tenth bodhisattva stages during which the eight branches of the holy path are mobilizedChapter XVIII Beyond the factors of enlightenment the realistic view is attunement to the realistic understanding Purification of the three actions constitutes realistic speech realistic action and realistic livelihood since include both verbal and physical actions Realistic effort tirelessly cultivates for a long time the remedies for objective obscurations Realistic mindfulness cultivates the remedy for the obscurations of dedication to the path by the exclusion of depression and excitement from the processes of serenity control and equanimity Such is the arrangement of the path in its eight branches This is the definition of serenity and insight The monk having said O may I be free from desire and so on at length that monk must practice just these two teachings mental serenity and transcendent insight They have both parts when one cultivates them both in integration Renunciation applies as far as the sixth stage because by those  renounces involvement with the signful Signlessness is the seventh stage The uncreated consists of the three other stages because they arise without volition In these three stages the buddhaland is totally purified and buddhahood is attained which are respectively purification and purity BBh pp In these five liberative arts on the five stages the bodhisattvas have a skill unequalled by others When great further they are of three types Bodhisattvas repeatedly relying on such retentions illuminate the holy Dharma and uphold it always In bodhisattvas it accomplishes goals of self and others until the perfect enlightenment Mind associated with will is its intrinsic nature It serves as a cause because it has an immediate result from the will and in the future also accomplishes the desired aim That is has an immediate result from will is to be understood from the achievement of the desired aim from the will alone May I be such and such great in the ten great vows of the bodhisattva who has entered the stages It is purified in the evertranscending stages since purity is always of a higher and higher quality until enlightenment The twofold selflessness the basis of the selfhabits and their permanent eradication should be understood as the sphere of the three concentrations The sphere of the three concentrations should be understood as threefold The selflessness of persons and things constitutes the sphere of the concentration upon voidness The concentrations which are the subjectivities of the threefold objective sphere are the concentrations on voidness and the rest wishlessness is eliminates the basis of selfhabits signlessness is at all times associated with pleasure in the eradicating of such a basis It is well known that the concentrations upon voidness and so forth have three aims thorough knowledge abandonment and realization From the desire to benefit beings four epitomes of the teaching have been taught to bodhisattvas as the causal basis of the concentrations What is meant by impermanent up to peace For the geniuses those four have thus the meanings of unreality un discrimination imaginative construction and the eradication of discriminative construction Chapter XVIII For bodhisattvas the meaning of impermanent is unreal Whatever is not permanent is impermanent and for them that is the imaginatively constructed identity The meaning of suffering is discriminative construction of the unreal and such is the relative identity The meaning of peace is eradication of discrimination it is the absolutely perfect identity which is Nirvana Also the meaning of impermanent is to be understood as momentary annihilation which refers to the relative identity In order to establish that ten verses analyzing momentariness However if continuous activity is taken to mean a prior cessation and a subsequent production with an interval of duration there could be no function immediately after  because of discontinuity as it is not reasonable that what has arisen should exist for an interval without continuity If what has already come into existence were to exist at a later time it must indubitably exist through a cause because without a cause it would not have come into existence to begin with Through what does it become extinct later on It is because origination and cessation are contraries and contraries are not seen to have the same cause as for example light and shade or heat and cold From the discourses for the Lord has said O monks creations are like illusions they arise and pass away they are temporary their existence is fleeting When they consider the arising and passing away of creations they see their cessation moment by moment otherwise they would not have the revulsion freedom from attachment or liberation as others do who see cessation at the time of death and so on Why is it not able to subsist forever Again one might object saying that things subsist even without a cause of subsistence because there is no cause of destruction but that when the cause of destruction obtains they are subsequently destroyed as darkness is by fire To say that darkness is destroyed by fire unproven but its capacity to generate a dissimilar entity is proven The water which is boiled through contact with fire gradually diminishes until it becomes so much reduced that finally it is apprehended as never having originated at all but it does not instantly cease to exist upon contact with fire The Lord has taught that the impermanence of a created entity is its nature its uniform If it were not destroyed as soon as it arose it would not be impermanent at any other time and it would follow that its nature of impermanence would not be uniform Again one might object saying that as production is new every moment there could be no recognition This is just that Through cessation for whatever remains exactly the same will never cease forever since it would never differ from its first moment and that is why one cannot assert this is exactly that Change means becoming different and if it did not commence at the very outset then one would never perceive a change at the conclusion in either internal or external things Its cause consists of other creations the eye and so forth Therefore it has been proven that they also are momentary However it is impossible for what is momentary to come into existence from what is not momentary as in the case of the impermanent from the permanent Further all creations are the effects of mind Mind is the master of creations as the Lord said The world is led by mind drawn by mind it is at the mercy of each thought as it is born In the same way it is said Name and form are conditioned by consciousness they are therefore the effect of mind As it is said The monk absorbed in contemplation endowed with magic powers attains mastery over the mind and if he believes that the forest of wood is gold it will be so for him Therefore created entities are the effect of the mind It is unreasonable that the momentary should have an effect which is not momentary since conforms to All creations are initial developed down to all creations are momentary Initial is the first manifestation of selfexistence Sustained is subsequent to the first moment of birth Growing comes about through the nourishment of food sleep continence and absorption Embodied refers to the birth of visual consciousness and so on through the support of the eyes and so on Changeable refers to the changes in complexion and so forth brought about by desire and so forth Relocated refers to death in one place and birth in another Seminal refers to except the final body of the saint Regarding these fourteen kinds of life of internal creations they are understood as momentary on the basis of the reasons because of their distinctive cause and size and so on If that life did not have a distinctive cause one would not subsequently apprehend greater and greater differences in the function of future creations because its cause would not be distinctive and when it is distinctive momentariness is proven because it becomes different from those that follow Growth is the basis Without momentariness it would be impossible because it would remain as it is If the embodiment stood still it would be unreasonable for the embodied not to stand still just as it would be unreasonable for the rider of a stopped chariot not to also stay stopped otherwise embodiment would be impossible Because duration would be impossible and because there would be no ultimate change without initial destruction apply to changeable life and evolutionary  for if something were to remain as it is it would be impossible for it to change through desire and so on and there could be no evolution into other states because where there is no initial destruction there will be no ultimate change Momentariness obtains in the case of luminous and nonluminous lives in the same way If it is created then as there would be no development in its progress it would just be still and progress would be implausible If it is uncreated there is no progress and progression would be implausible If one imagines that such action applies to a creation stationary in that migration it is implausible because a stationary thing does not go to another place Or if one imagines that such applies to a creation standing in another migration it is also implausible as would not have gotten there without action An action is not perceived separate from the creation in one place or another And because such is absent momentariness is established It comes about by the power of mind as in the occasion of walking about and so on It comes about by the force of projection just as an arrow is shot It comes about by the force of connection like the progress of riders of chariots or ferry boats It comes about by flexibility like grasses moved by the wind It comes about by magic power as some things are moved by the power of spells and drugs iron by the power of a magnet other things by the power of a magician In the case of seminal and nonseminal lives momentariness is to be understood by the implausibility of duration and that of conclusion for without a causal entity at every moment it is impossible for what remains as it is to become a seed at another time and it will not cease to be a seed at the last moment just as it is implausible for it to be a seed at a prior moment and not a seed at the final moment Momentariness due to conformity with mind should be understood in the case of reflectionlike life both because of conformity to mind and because at every moment it is born from the power of mind Why is this declared What is at rest cannot move by nature due to lack of motion this has already been established And it cannot increase or diminish because it remains as it is Earth because of origin from them and because of four transmutations The word them indicates water and wind In the period of cosmic evolution earth is formed by water and wind together therefore because it is an effect it should be understood as momentary And four transmutations of earth are perceived Such transmutations are impossible without momentariness because a cause of destruction does not exist As for the momentariness of color odor taste and tangibility it is to understood by similar reasons as in the case of earth and so on Fire is momentary because it arises in dependence upon fuel When fire is produced the fuel produced along with it does not remain as it is and that fire cannot remain which has burnt up the fuel One cannot say at the end that without Vs are summarized in the Chinese TSL ffi Chapter XVIII fuel it remains as it was As for the sound of bells and so on for example its momentariness is known by the perception of variation because without momentariness its variation from moment to moment could not be perceived Mentalmediumform is momentary as proven by its conformity to mind according to the previous explanation Therefore it is established that the external is momentary If he answers Because change is not apprehended every moment this must be said to him Why do you not accept the momentariness of things which are well known to be momentary such as lamps flames and so on inasmuch as things are never perceived in a state of nonmotion If it is a natural difference of which you speak the example is unsuitable because the nature of a thing cannot be employed as an example of it like fire of fire and cow of cow But if it is a difference in function the example of a lampflame is suitable because it is well known that it follows as a consequence of momentariness Then one should further inquire Do you accept that when a chariot is standing at rest a man mounted in the chariot is in motion But in the case of a lampflame which depends on a wick is not the wick seen to remain at rest when the lampflame is in continual motion It is not seen because a change is continually being produced in the wick at every moment If there is momentariness then why is the momentariness of creations not established as in the case of the lampflame vsThe Accessories of Enlightenment should be said to him Because of a fundamental mistake their momentariness is not known because their function persists in a coordinated series Since each instance exists one after the other one mistakenly thinks that it is one and the same Otherwise there would be no erroneous idea that the impermanent is permanent This inquiry resulting from the refutation of objections established the momentariness of all creations To explain The person should be said to exist designatively and not substantially Thus adopting a nonsimplistic position one does not incur the faults of absolutism or nihilism It is known by its nonperception It is not perceived as a substance like matter and so on The Lord said that To think that the selfless is a self is mistaken By means of its addictedness which is the addictedness whose nature is the addiction of the materialistic views of I and mine it being impossible for the unmistaken to be addictive How is it to be known that it is addicted Passion and the other addictions are generated with it as cause As for the fact called matter with respect to which person is designated should it be said that the person is the same or different To explain it is said that Therefore it should not be said to be either the same or different Therefore it is right not to speak of the person except for its existing as a convention as a consequence of which it is established that is an impredicable matter If it were substantial its inexpressible necessity would have to be expressed An unnecessary  inexpressible as either the same as or different from  is quite implausible Here they may object that it is just by this example that we ought to accept the inexpressibility of the person as for example fire cannot be said to be either the same as or different from fuel By definition by common consensus and according to the sciences it is unreasonable to insist upon the inexpressibility of fire and fuel since they are perceived dualistically With regard to sameness and difference fire is the fire element and fuel consists of the remaining elements Their natures are different and thus fire is different from fuel In worldly they are established as different since wood and so forth the fuel is seen without fire and fire without fuel It is not right to say that in the sciences the Lord did not say anywhere that nothing could be said of fire and fuel If one were to say that in this case the wind is the fuel it is by that very reason that the Chapter XVIII difference of fire and fuel is established Because there is perception of both That proves it Two things are perceived there the fire and the wind as fuel If it is the owner then it would not engage in the impermanent pleasure consciousness and the disagreeable pain consciousness If it existed as a substance then its activity would be apprehended just like for example the character of vision and pure form and so forth as regards the eye If its existence as a substance were accepted then the Lord Buddhas threefold perfect enlightenment would be prevented the profound perfect enlightenment the distinctive perfect enlightenment and the transcendent perfect enlightenment By the clear understanding of a person there would be no profound perfect enlightenment whatsoever it would not be distinctive from that of the heterodox and it would not transcend the world If the person is the beholder up to the knower then in beholding and so on it must either have a function or not have a function If it has a function that function is either selforiginated or brought about by chance or by its cause The persons function in seeing is not selforiginated because of three faults If with reThe Accessories of Enlightenment spect to beholding and so forth there is accidental function from which there is beholding and so forth then the person is their agent If the function is permanent the fault will arise that the functioning of beholding and so forth will be simultaneous and eternal Its conditionality is implausible because of the prior absence of the enduring because of the impermanence of the destroyed and because of the lack of a third alternative If one suggests that function has the person as its cause it is impossible that that which remains as it is be a cause because of prior absence Because the function will not have prior existence at the time when it will not have arisen and it is impossible that what has been destroyed should be a cause as it would follow that the person is impermanent Nor is there a third alternative for that does not exist which neither endures nor is destroyed It is thus implausible that the person is the cause of function Understanding is purification Without the designation person who understands or is the bearer of the burden it would be impossible to teach the degrees of engagement and of their continuity The accessories of enlightenment are of many types when divided according to the paths of application vision meditation and culmination Neither is it for its habituation because if the habituation to the view of a self were conducive to liberation then all would be liberated without effort inasmuch as the view of a self is present in all who have not seen the truths It is just as if one previously has not taken suffering for suffering he will not apprehend it later on One remains afterward as before and so there will be no subsequent liberation If a person were to exist there would be no avoiding the I and mine the craving for self and the addictions which have them for their cause Thus bodhisattvas always endowed with such virtues both do not neglect their own aims and do accomplish the aims of others Sthiramati explains that the bodhisattva path has been completely taught in the accessories of enlightenment chapter so now it is relevant to explain the excellences achieved by the bodhisattva through the practice of that path Having achieved detachment dedication to generosity is not a wonder nor having achieved compassion is morality and tolerance wondrous In the Chinese the commentary relates the four fruits to the four stages of the disciple so should be recognized the bodhisattvas equanimity of conOne verse is on equality of concern for beings and two on the transcendences Beings love for themselves and so on is neither evenminded nor constant therefore they sometimes even kill themselves But the bodhisattvas for all beings is both equalminded and constant In terms of the transcendences equality of regard in generosity and so on since they are impartial toward suppliants in morality since not ever violate it even in the slightest way great in effort to achieve all aims of beings since they are equal in their dedication to the aims of self and others and to the aim of all that is virtuous These two verses describe the manner of the bodhisattvas helpfulness through the six transcendences By generosity they establish beings as vessels of virtuous activities By meditation they engage them by means of their endowment with distinctive power they always sustain beings with an equal attitude they give them birth in a holy place they cause them to grow with virtues they protect them against harm and they educate them in what must be learned A mother renders five types of assistance to her children she bears them in her womb gives them birth nurses them nourishes them and raises them protects them from harm and teaches them to speak Likewise bodhisattvas are to be known as a friend to beings through five activities Mundane perfection is happiness because one experiences happiness through it Transcendent is health because it is the remedy to the illness of the addictions The five activities of the bodhisattva should be understood through this example The five activities of the bodhisattva should be understood through this example Beings who appropriately requite the kindness of the bodhisattvas are those who engage in the six transcendences being Pratikara  Ian duphan dogspa Appropriately means in accordance with the assistance rendered to them by the bodhisattvas Because they are endowed with gratitude in tolerance In fact out of gratitude for the bodhisattvas assistance they become lovers of tolerance Bodhisattvas always expect five conditions The victors spiritual offspring are always effective in eliminating fear in authentic spiritual conception in the resolution of doubts and in giving instruction on practice The bodhisattvas practice should be recognized as effective in accomplishing the aims of beings in four ways By giving without expectation of evolutionary benefit and so on On the contrary the bodhisattvas firm in tendencies remedial to those are endowed with the qualities conducive to excellence Sacchidratvarh  meaning having gaps or tears or holes in ones moral armorExcellences  Boasting pretending faking a loving expression acting with a temporary show of diligence calming body and speech and being well skilled in eloquent speech while devoid of real practice these are taught as counterfeit for bodhisattvas while the opposite are taught as genuine for those really engaged in practice With reference to the six transcendences boasting and so on are understood as counterfeit bodhisattva qualities By their practices of generosity and so on on all stages the geniuses discipline the six kinds of resistant tendencies of beings The genius receive prophecies of two kinds varying according to time and person and also in relation to enlightenment and prophecy itself A transcendent lord of suchandsuch name or suchandsuch time will prophecy thus There is another the great prophecy which occurs on the eighth stage when one has attained tolerance of the noncreation of things having overcome the pride which says I will become a buddha as well as all reifying strivings having become one with all buddhas and bodhisattvas by no longer experiencing any difference between their processes and ones own Becoming predetermined is shown to be sixfold based upon the six transcendences One becomes predetermined in terms of success because one always gains the success of extensive wealth One becomes predetermined in terms of life because one always embraces life according to ones desire One becomes predetermined in terms of indefatigability because one is never wearied by the suffering of the lifecycle One becomes predetermined in terms of perpetual realization because meditative realization never ceases One becomes predetermined in terms of unremitting meditation and accomplishment of duties because one never abandons meditation and one always accomplishes the duties of beings The six involuntary duties are based upon the six transcendences Six things must always be done in order to accomplish the six transcendences Compare BBh p Statyakarantya In this context purity of morality refers to the morality cherished by the holy ones The classification of truths is sevenfold based on suchness Vehicles are accepted as threefold on the basis of differences in aspiration teaching application preparation and achievement Nominal classification is fourfold through differences in nominal classification of teaching truth reason and vehicle Excellences The nominal classification of reasons is fourfold relational reason functional reason logically established reason and reality reason The functional reason is the realistic view together with its cause and effect The teaching of the Dharma is superior according to aspiration and according to desire The four reasonings yukti are taught in SamdhinirXJ and briefly treated in AS p Compare BBh p The four investigations and the four thorough knowledges of reality make up the four aids to penetrative insight nirvedhabhagya the first two being paryesana and the last two yathbhtaparijnna see Siddhi pp Investigating the name as incidental to the referent is to be understood as investigating the name Investigating the referent as incidental to the name is to be understood as investigating the thing The thorough knowledge of reality is fourfold as endowed with the thorough investigations of names referents ascriptive designations and descriptive designations And it should be recognized from the nonperception of all things names and so forth Support enjoyment and seed are the causes of bondage minds and mental functions with their foundations and seeds are bound here The supporting cause is the material world the enjoyment cause consists of the five objects the visible and so forth The seed cause is their seed which is the fundamental consciousness The causal process which stands on its own is that which is perceived naturally it is not expressly imaginatively constructed If one destroys the causal processes of all things one attains the great enlightenment This elucidates how thorough knowledge of reality realizes the nature of bondage and culminates in liberation Intuitive wisdom which has suchness for its object abandons the perception of duality the intuitive experience of the body of negative conditioning is accepted by the genius to effect the termination of such This shows that thorough knowledge of the three realities as they are leads to the termination of the relative reality The actual perception of suchness leads to the thorough knowledge of the perfect reality This leads to the termination of the body of negative conditioning as the fundamental consciousness itself Meditating the intuitive wisdom which has suchness for its object without any aspect of differentiation there is direct experience of what exists and what does not exist such is called the master of discrimination One meditates without differentiation because no difference is seen between causal process and suchness Those see signs and signlessness as different they do not attend on signs but attend on the realm of signlessness and thus absorb themselves in signlessness But bodhisattvas experience even signs as signlessness by not seeing any sign apart from suchness Therefore their intuitive wisdom of is meditated without differentiation They intuitively experience what exists that is suchness and what does not exist that is causal signs and they attain mastery over discrimination in the sense that they can succeed in all their goals according to their discriminating discernment and therefore they are called masters of discrimination Similarly it is the real itself which naturally appears to bodhisattvas and not the unreal With the termination of their instinctual propensities liberation is attained see Sthiramati Because acts as she wishes Being independent at that time she has the power over her own mind for she naturally does not indulge in causal processes These are the five immeasurable things for bodhisattvas Chapter XIX lessness the individual immaculate eye the termination of the contaminations the long duration of the holy Dharma education resolution and enjoyment The fruit of the bodhisattva dedicated to teaching is recognized as eightfold among his students some conceive the spirit of enlightenment some obtain tolerance of the noncreation of things some generate the stainless immaculate truthvision of things which is included in the individual vehicle Some attain the termination of the contaminations By maintaining the tradition the holy Dharma becomes longlasting Those who are uneducated become educated about things Those who doubt have their doubts resolved And those who have attained certainty enjoy the irreproachable joyful savor of the feast of holy Dharma The universal vehicle is so called because it is endowed with the seven types of universality of creative initiative because dedicated to constant devotion for three incalculable eons for a different set of seven greatnesses Gene faith spirit action entering development purity superior enlightenment Sthiramati enumerates a total of eight things counting Nirvana and enlightenment as one The eighth ninth and tenth bodhisattva stages Practices through signs from the second stage up to the sixth Through signlessness on the seventh stage This shows the character of the bodhisattva through the practice of the six transcendences and the vow for the great enlightenment One is truly a bodhisattva who wishes to help who does not notice injury who tolerates harm from others is brave vigilant very learned and dedicated to the interests of others Brave means energetic in effort because she is not battered down by suffering Vigilant means she is not attached to the bliss of meditation One is truly a bodhisattva who understands suffering is not attached to ones own property and wealth is without hidden enmity is a yogi skilled in signs is without wrong views and is inwardly composed Skilled in signs being skillful in the three signs of mental serenity and other One is truly a bodhisattva who is loving lives in excellence of conscience willingly endures suffering is not attached to ones own happiness who holds mindfulness most dear whose self is well concentrated and who does not change vehicle Holding mindfulness most dear is possession of meditation through the power of mindfulness because the mind has been placed in equipoise One is truly a bodhisattva who clears away suffering who does not cause suffering who willingly endures suffering who does not fear suffering who is free from suffering who has no notion of suffering and who accepts suffering Free from suffering means she is endowed with meditation having renounced the desire realm she is free from the suffering of suffering She accepts suffering because she accepts the cycle of life He dislikes things since he dislikes intolerance Here the word dharma is written dharama for metrical reasons Mindful about protection means being tolerant because he protects the minds of self and other Ashamed of contempt means he does not despise any suppliant Ashamed of slight faults means he sees danger even in the slightest transgression Ashamed of narrow views means he has experiential insight into objective selflessness All these verses illustrate the nature of the bodhisattva with various formulations from the perspectives of the practice of the six transcendences and the great vow for enlightenment He engages in helping beings through generosity in this life and through morality in the future life thereby attaining a distinctive rebirth Through moti Sthiramati has sbyin med ngo tsha instead of ma gus ngo tsha which appears in both the verses and the commentary This teaches that the bodhisattva acts according to what helps beings by means of the six transcendences and the great vow for enlightenment These are the sixteen general corresponding names of bodhisattvas One is called a bodhisattva for a distinctive reason One is called bodhisattva because of the five types of special understanding that is for understanding the self for understanding subtle views for recognizing the These same sixteen designations of the bodhisattva are found in BBh p through the understanding of mind mentality and consciousness and through the understanding of their unreal construction the understanding of misknowledge the understanding of knowledge and the understanding of the three realities such as the imaginatively constructed The nonobjective the real object zhen yt the totally nonexistent the fulfilled the inconceivable five knowledges is called a bodhisattva One is called bodhisattva for this reason Understanding the station enables to enter the station of Tusita Understanding the womb enables her to enter the mothers womb Understanding the display of the procession enables her to emerge from the womb to enjoy sensual pleasures to renounce the world to perform austerities and to achieve perfect enlightenment Understanding the powerful resolution of doubts enables her to turn the wheel of the Dharma in order to resolve the doubts of living beings Here bodhisattva is elucidated by means of eleven types of understanding concerning the past and so on Accomplished unaccomplished and present intellects relate to the understandings of the past future and present respectively Realization is from his own inner understanding and understanding indicates understanding which comes from another that is internal and external understandings Totality refers to all superficial realities the realm of speech and thought Proud and pridefree indicate the inferior and the excellent Spiritually immature and mature refers to being far and near to enlightenmentCHAPTER XX Practice Two verses analyzing the marks the loving sensitivity to adopt beings with the spirit of enlightenment gentle speech to cause beings to gain faith in the teaching of the buddha courage not to be exhausted by difficulties such as ordeals These same five inga form the subject matter of the Bodhisattvaliñgapatala of the BBh pp Bodhisattvas always become universal monarchs and as householders accomplish the aims of beings in all their lives On all the stages the geniuses transcendent renunciation is achieved by taking or by reality or it is an instructional performance The first verse shows that the bodhisattva accomplishes the aims of beings while playing the role of a householder the second in playing the role of a mendicant Messianic resolve for happiness is the desire for pleasant results in future lives Messianic resolve for benefit is the desire to engage in virtue in this life The bodhisattvas adoption of beings is fourfold They adopt with equanimity of mind because at the time of realization they experience the sameness of self and others The birth of bodhisattvas is fourfold For those in the stage of action in faith who are born in the happy realms it is by the power of evolution For those who have entered the stages who are born in the lower realms such as those of animals it Parigraha Compare the Parigrahapapala of the BBh pp For those who are born in the desire realm after leaving the contemplation  it is by the power of meditative concentration Those emanations manifest birth in places such as Tusita heaven by the power of their lordliness The defining criterion on the first stage is the realization of supreme Following the Tibetan sdom gyi tshigs su bead pa On the second the criterion is the persistence without neglect of evolution because she knows the paths of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions and their results On the third it is that having dwelt in the intensely blissful bodhisattva contemplations she takes birth in the desire realm without any loss of those On the fourth it is that even having long dwelt in the enlightenment accessories she dedicates those accessories to the lifecycle On the fifth the defining criterion is that having long dwelt in the four noble truths he can create various arts and sciences in order to develop beings without addicting his own mind On the sixth it is that having long dwelt in dependent origination he can take voluntary rebirth while preserving the passions On the seventh it is that the path of exclusive predetermination for signlessness combining it with the eighth station which is the arrival on the path of the single procedure where all are totally merged together On the eighth the defining criterion is that because she stands in the signless without volitional effort effortlessly dwell in signlessness and purify the buddhaverse On the ninth it is that by the power of intuition the evolution of beings is achieved because she is able to develop beings of all forms buddhabhmiChapter XX tenth purify the door of the meditative concentrations and the door of the retentions On the eleventh the buddha stage the defining criterion is that due to the elimination of every type of objective obscuration perfect her enlightenment Two verses on the analysis of the person on the stages The bodhisattva has Ten bodhisattvas are described as being on the ten stages On the second his ethics are very pure as his behavior does not transgress into even the slightest sin On the third he has equanimity having obtained unwavering contemplation and concentration On the fourth he is free of Dharma pride having eliminated pride about the variety of the teachings of the scriptures and so forth On the fifth he is free of pride in his spiritual process having arrived at the equality of all processes through the ten equalities of mind and aspiration On the sixth due to natural purity she is free of pride from differentiating addiction and purification since by long stability in the suchness of dependent origination she no longer perceives addiction and purification in the suchness of good and evil On the seventh by the power of stability in signlessness since she practices the thirtyseven accessories of enlightenment in a single instant she attains the instantaneous understanding On the eighth since she stands in signlessness sponta Compare with BBh pp on the aspects  marks  and signs of the bodhisattvas on the various stations Practice neously and her practice is inextricably merged with bodhisattvas on the stage of nonregression she has equanimity and purification of the buddhaverse On the tenth bodhisattva stage having attained great psychic powers a bodhisattva is established as having great power The same station without volitional effort involving the purification of the land is accepted as the second result Having understood reality on the first stage is educated in supreme morality on the second on the third in supreme mind on the fourth fifth and sixth in supreme wisdom On the other s from the seventh up to the buddha stage there is purification of both liberation and intuition of liberation Liberation is to be understood from the hindrance of the fourfold result On the buddha stage from the obstruction of impenetrability since while the intuitions of others are obstructed by objects the buddhas because they are liberated from that have an intuition which finds no obstruction anywhere Achievement should be understood through a systematically trained attitude through knowing it as construction and through its nondiscrimination In this context the stage of action in faith is unachieved and the others are achieved Among those achieved seven are also not achieved the others are achieved because their process is effortless The stage of the joyous has been previously explained as achieved which achievement involves a mental process systematically trained for the stage When the stage system is understood as mere construction and he no longer makes conceptual discriminations about that mere construction then as he has attained the wisdom of the nondiscrimination of subject and object it is said that the stage is fully achieved In addition both the meditative practice and the achievement of the stages are inconceivable on all stages since they are to be individually intuited by the bodhisattvas and are the object of the buddhas and of no one else The signs of a bodhisattva who has entered the stages are to be known as tenfold on all stages Thus these ten signs are fulfilled on each stage equalminded toward herself and all beings unexcited by praise or blame and without attachment even to the excellences of such as universal monarchs skilled in liberative art because having attained ultimate nonperception she knows the liberative art of buddhahood When born she is always born in the circles of the buddhas These are the other signs of the bodhisattvas on the stages This shows the sixteen signs of the bodhisattva who has achieved the ten transcendences These sixteen signs are He never lacks the will to attain the transcendences He is always free of the resistance to each of the six transcendences Here love the remedy for malice is the ambition to bring happiness Compassion the remedy for violence is the ambition to eradicate suffering When the transcendences have been achieved the bodhisattvas have all kinds of benefits which should be understood to be fivefold on all stages She enjoys the pleasure of the Dharma free from notions of plurality She recognizes the light of the Dharma which is everywhere indivisible as well as immeasurable In order to perfect the fulfillment of the truthbody she creates an assemblage of causes which always increases from ultimate to more ultimate Because it is free from the stain of immorality and beyond the stain of concern for other vehicles it is called the stainless Because it produces the great light of Dharma is called the illuminating Wisdom by nature the accessories of enlightenment comes close to burning up almost all two Because it is related to the unique path is called the fargoing is not shaken by ideas with signs ideas without signs  the unshakeable stage Because it has benevolent intellectual knowledge this stage is called benevolent intelligence Dharmaraincloud because it is like a raincloud in the sky of the Dharma pervading both Because it is pervading both means that because the Dharma permeating the foundational  and attained by means of the doors of concentrations and retentions is like a raincloud the skylike  it is called the raincloud of Dharma The bodhisattva stages are considered stations because always stand joyously on them for the sake of the various accomplishments of virtue The bodhisattva stages are called stations because always stand joyously on them in order to accomplish all manner of good The stations are also called stages because strive to ascend higher and higher in those immeasurable  in order that beings without number may become free of fear The stages are attained in four ways by faith by engagement in practice by penetrating realization and by fulfillment The attainment of the stages is fourfold Attainment by faith is by the faith already described as pertaining to the stage of action in faith And attainment by fulfillment occurs at the time of attaining the stage of nonregression CHAPTER XXI Epilogue Culmination There are a number of verses on the analysis of the qualities of a buddha love which wants to unite with happiness compassion which wants to free them from suffering joy which wants not to be deprived of happiness and equanimity which wills the benefit This should be recognized as the mark of a will totally pure of addiction His distinctive sphere of sovereignty by his sovereignty over all the world since due to his sovereignty over his own mind he has mental power over things emanations and transmutations He has a distinctive sphere of totality because there is no impediment to his intuition of all knowables Compassionate to the impassionate Total tamer of all passions of all beings Passionconqueror Homage to You Here the distinctive immunity of the Lord is shown through his compassion for impassionate beings because for all beings he tames the addictive passions  and activates the remedies of those addictive passions already arisen Effortless and unattached You are unobstructed Ever balanced in concentration You resolve all questions Homage to You A Aran Others who attain wisdom from a vow do not directly realize intuitively through their vow as it lacks effortless spontaneity In this context two things are taught the Dharma which is the ground and the meaning grounded upon it It is taught in two ways by speech and intuition Best of Teachers indicates their activities When all beings see You They recognize a Holy Being You create faith from just a glimpse Homage to You This shows that the mere glimpse of the Lords body with its auspicious signs and marks creates great faith in others due to their confidence in his Holy Being such is their function O You who have gained mastery Of assuming enduring and abandoning  Of emanating and transforming  And of contemplative concentration and wisdom Homage to You Here the four universal purifications are explained by the four masteries of the Lord purification of the foundation by his mastery in assuming maintaining and abandoning the body purification of objects by his mastery of incarnation and transmutation purification of the mind by his mastery of all aspects of contemplative concentration and purification of wisdom by his mastery of omniscience Who crushes the devils who deceive beings About methods refuges purification And about transcendence in the universal vehicle Homage to You Here the devils who deceive beings in four areas are crushed by the Lord deceives about the methods of going to a good rebirth and avoiding a bad rebirth and so on about refuges one deceives by refuge in worldly gods and so forth about purification one deceives by a contaminated purification and one deceives about transcendence in the universal vehicle In the second he crushes the devil by the power of knowledge of the fruition of evolutionary actions In the third context he crushes the devil by the power of knowledge of contemplation liberation concentration and entrancement And in the fourth he crushes the devil by the power of his knowledge of superior and inferior faculties because he eliminates the inferior faculties and so forth and puts in touch with superior faculties Since rival religious teachers the fanatics do not disturb him the fourfold fearlessness of the Lord is manifested in due order Moving or at rest everywhere and always You have no nonomniscient action O Omniscient One Your aim is reality Homage to You While moving or at rest always and everywhere the Lord has no action which is not that of an omniscient being One who is not omniscient although his addictions be destroyed since he has not conquered their instincts still performs actions which are not that of an omniscient being such as encountering a mad elephant or a runaway chariot and so forth You survey the whole world Six times in a day and a night You are endowed with great compassion You have the good heart Homage to You Here the great compassion of the Buddha is explained in its nature and activity With great compassion the Lord surveys the world six times each day and night seeing who is deteriorating and who is developing and so forth See XVII The Transcendent Lords intuitive wisdom is not impeded or obstructed about anything in the past present and future these are the three included in wisdom You attained the universal great enlightenment By means of the three bodies You resolved the doubts of all beings everywhere Homage to You This explains the Lords omniscience since universal enlightenment is realized with the three bodies by means of the omniscience about all knowable objects The three bodies are the natural body the beatific body and the emanation body The omniscience of all knowables is shown here as an activity which consists in resolving all the doubts of all beings such as gods and humans You do not take You are free of faults Free of disturbance You do not stand According to BBh p It should be understood that he does not take because he has no interest in wealth He has no fault as his physical activities and so forth are immaculate He is undisturbed as neither worldly concerns nor suffering disturb his mind He does not stand since he does not dwell in small or trifling understanding The transcending through all the bodhisattva stages is the cause The achievement of supremacy over all beings is the result The liberation of all beings is the activity He is seen in the various world systems by means of the emanation body and in the circles of assemblies by means of the beatific body Thus his function has this threefold distinction The Mahynastrlamkravykhy is concluded The colophon of the Tibetan verse version continues In the Abhidharmamahāyānasūtra in the presence of the Bhagavat in order to show the greatness of the Great Vehicle the bodhisattva Greatly Practiced in the Great Vehicle  said In relation to to the Great Vehicle the speech of the Buddha Bhagavats is distinguished by ten superiorities Bh b bh ba U ac ubb This paragraph has been translated according to H the versions differ slightly The Mahāyānasaṃgraha is the doctrine of the Abhidharma and the Mahāyānasūtras In the presence of the Bhagavat in order to show that the Great Vehicle possesses excellent qualities and concerning the Great Vehicle the Bodhisattvamahasattva Practiced in the Texts and Meaning of the Great Vehicle said The three baskets are Sūtra Vinaya and Abhidharma These three baskets divided into the Lesser Vehicle and the Greater Vehicle  which make up the basket of the rāvaka and the basket of the Bodhisattva Regardless of whether they are three or two why are they called baskets it should be understood that they contain everything to be understood Why are there three baskets For nine reasons The Vinaya is antidote to habitual tendencies that constitute the two extremes By prohibiting culpable pleasures  it remedies loose habitual patterns by authorizing innocent pleasures it remedies austerity The Abhidharma is remedy for heretical views  because it clarifies the true nature of dharmas higher morality and higher mind  because the ethical person  going beyond regret  attains meditative stabilization The Abhidharma executes the third ie higher wisdom  because it analyzes true things The Vinaya accomplishes the texts and theses because the person who has disciplined their afflictions penetrates the former and the latter The Abhidharma excels in cutting through arguments about the texts and theses For these nine reasons they are enumerated as three baskets Furthermore they have as their purpose liberation from saṃsāra How then do they liberate They liberate by predisposition  intellection  pacification and penetration By hearing  the mind is predisposed by reflection  one understands by cultivating tranquility  one becomes peaceful by discernment  one penetrates Furthermore in brief  Sūtra Vinaya and Abhidharma each has a fourfold etymology by the understanding of which the bodhisattva acquires omniscience as for the śrāvaka by understanding the meaning of a simple stanza he acquires the destruction of his defilements In what way does each have a fourfold etymology The entities are the aggregates  the bases of consciousness the elements  dependent origination  sustenance  the trances  the immeasurables  the eight liberations  the spheres of mastery  the spheres of totality  the factors favorable to enlightenment  the emancipated special knowledges  etc iv The purpose is application The Dharma that leads to nirvāṇa is the Abhidharma because it teaches the truths  the factors favorable to enlightenment  the doors of liberation  etc The Dharma of repetition is the Abhidharma because it supplies much detailed information for each dharma  eg etymology  specific nature  shared nature  etc It has supremacy hence its name Abhidharma because it triumphs over opposing theses by treating controversial points Wrongdoing consists of five categories Elimination of wrongdoing comes from intention  eg acceptance of a discipline and not of punishment ṅes par ḥbyuṅ ba ni rnam pa

and the least wrongdoings this is establishing in each case whether or not there is wrongdoing For parāvṛtti in general and āśrayaparavṛtti in particular see below Notes and References This passage of the sūtra shows that the Great Vehicle is the speech of the Buddha that which can be known is called the knowable namely the defiled dharmas and the pure dharmas also the three natures Support has the meaning of cause  The natures of the knowable namely the three natures imaginary  dependent and absolute entry into ConceptOnly has as cause at the time of preparation  the mundane virtues of generosity etc  as fruition it has at the time of realization  the supramundane virtues of generosity etc Cultivation is repeated practice these are the ten stages Superior discipline contained in these various cultivations in the ten stages training in the matter of discipline is called higher discipline this is the discipline of the bodhisattvas who have not even a thought of wrongdoing Superior wisdom the practice of full understanding or observance in the matter of wisdom is called superior wisdom this is nonconceptual knowledge Superiority of cessation superiority  classification or intuition cut off the obstacle of the afflictions and the obstacle to knowledge this is the nonabiding nirvāṇa Superiority of knowledge knowledge without obstacle this is consonant with nonconceptual knowledge The Buddhas knowledge is free of any trace of obstacle It is a nonconceptual knowledge par excellence According to this passage ten topics of which there is no mention in the Vehicle of the rāvakas are treated in the Great Vehicle i The storeconsciousness is called support of the knowable ii The three natures dependent nature  imaginary nature and absolute nature  are the natures of the knowable iii ConceptOnly is the entry into the natures of the knowable iv The six virtues are the cause and the result of this entry v The ten stages of the bodhisattva are the various cultivations of the cause and result of this entry vi The discipline of the bodhisattvas is the superior discipline contained in these various cultivations viii Nonceptual knowledge is the superior wisdom contained in these various disciplines ix The nonabiding nirvāṇa is the cessation which is the result of these three observances x The three bodies of the Buddha  namely essence body  enjoyment body and apparitional body  are the knowledge of the result of these three trainings The ten topics mentioned here show that the Great Vehicle is distinct from the Vehicle of the rāvakas The Bhagavat reserves the preaching of it for bodhisattvas Therefore relative to the Great Vehicle alone the speech of the Buddha Bhagavats is distinguished by ten superiorities Bh ab bh ba U za u ba iv The six virtues are the cause and the result of this entry After having entered into the stages these same virtues of generosity etc become supramundane and are called result of purity the ten stages of the bodhisattva are the various cultivations of the two ie of the cause and of the result which are the aforementioned virtues this concerns the cessation which is the fruition of the three trainings  namely the cessation of the obstacle of the afflictions and the obstacle to knowledge If there were no essencebody  the Dharma body would not exist as in the case of the eye If there were no Dharma body the body of enjoyment would not exist as in the case of the visual consciousness Here the supporter and the support should be thought of as equal If the enjoyment body did not exist after having entered into the higher stages the bodhisattvas would have no pleasure in enjoying the Dharma Without this pleasure the accumulations of enlightenment would not be complete  as in the case of color If there were no body of appearance  the bodhisattvas on the stage of application of faith and the śrāvakas of lesser faith would fail in their undertaking That is why it is necessary that there be three bodies The ten topics mentioned here show that the Great Vehicle is distinct from the Vehicle of the rāvakas since they are not treated in the Vehicle of the rāvakas Because the speech of the Tathāgata is characterized by ten superiorities  why is it asserted that the Great Vehicle is truly the speech of the Buddha and why is it denied that the Vehicle of the rāvakas is mingled with the Great Vehicle Actually the ten topics in question are not treated in the Vehicle of the rāvakas but are dealt with in the Great Vehicle These ten topics confirm great enlightenment and are fully justified by  consonant with and noncontradictory to the attainment of omniscience Here are the verses these are the superiorities of the Great Vehicle b Such topics are not seen elsewhere Because it is the cause of higher enlightenment  the conclusion is that the Great Vehicle is the word of the Buddha Because it explains the ten subjects it is superior These ten topics assure great enlightenment they are the cause capable of producing great enlightenment in the levels  they do not constitute a cause of disturbance in the path taught by the Buddha they do not bring the disturbances of thievery  etc or again they are not in variance with either saṃsāra or nirvāṇa Why are the ten tpics treated in this sequence i From the very start  by their skill in the cause of dharmas  bodhisattvas must acquire skill in dependent origination ii Next in order to succeed in suppressing the extremes which are the faults of superimposition and negation  they must acquire skill in the natures of dependently produced dharmas iii Bodhisattvas trained in this way must penetrate the natures that they have understood in that way they will liberate their minds from obstacles iv Next after having understood the natures of the knowable  and by depending on the six virtues previously practiced  they must acquire purity of the highest intention v Next having spread the six virtues contained in the purity of highest intention over the ten levels  they must practice them for three incalculabl periods viviii Next they must fulfill the three trainings of the bodhisattva to perfection ixx Having fulfilled them they must reach the nirvāṇa which is their result and attain complete and perfect enlightenment That is why these ten topics are treated in this order In this explanation the entire Greater Vehicle is completed ii They must acquire skill in the natures of dependently produced dharmas Suppression of these two extreme defects consitutes skillfulness in the natures of the dharmas iv Then having entered into ConceptOnly they must bring to perfection by way of the absolute the six mundane conventional virtues and integrate them into the highest pure intention v Then in the ten levels   they must practice these virtues for three incalculable great periods This is different from the śrāvakas who practice the remedy for three lifetimes and then arrive at deliverance viviii Then in the course of this cultivation  they must completely fulfill the three trainings of higher morality  etc ixx Finally they must realize nirvāṇa which is the fruit of the three trainings the cessation of the afflictions supreme perfect enlightenment and the three bodies of the Buddha NOTES  Superiority of the Mahāyana over the Hīnayāna bhūmi p  which refers to Bodh First of all  at the very beginning  it was said that the storeconsciousness is the support of the knowable The Bhagavat has spoken of the storeconsciousness Where did he speak of the storeconsciousness In the Abhidharmasūtra Bhagavat spoke this verse anādikāliko dhātuḥ sarvadharmasamāśrayaḥ tasmin sati gatiḥsarvā nirvāṇādhigamo pi ca It is the beginningless element it is the common support of all dharmas Given this consciousness there exists every destiny and entry into nirvāṇa Bh ab bh b U a u ba cause or seed This storeconsciousness is also the common basis of all dharmas in the capacity of support and not as cause In the same sūtra  it is said The consciousness which supplied with all the seeds  underlies every dharma is called root fundamental receptacle store I have revealed it to the virtuous ones ie to the great bodhisattvas Why is this consciousness called storeconsciousness It is a store consciousness because all defiled dharmas of those who are born are lodged within it as fruit  and it itself is lodged in the dharmas as cause Defiled dharmas in order to exclude pure dharmas On this subject an āgama the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra V  says ādānavijñāna gabhīrasūkṣmo ogho tathā vartati sarvabījo bālāna eṣo mayi na prakāśi ma haiva ātmā parikalpayeyuḥ Like a violent current the profound and subtle storeconsciousness proceeds with all its seeds For this reason the Budha does not reveal this consciousness to the ṣrāvakas etc becaue the latter do not aim at subtle omniscience  Like a violent current it proceeds along with all the seeds the series of its moments is never interrupted it is like the current of a river I have not revealed it to those who embrace the view of a self  fearing lest they imagine that it is a self Because it appropriates all the material organs and because it is the support of the grasping of all the existences Furthermore at the moment of reincarnation  because it grasps their production  this consciousness appropriates the states of existence The version of H is the most satisfactory and that is the one I translate The material organs the eye etc appropriated by the appropriating consciousness do not undergo the state of decomposition of a corpse But the moment of death having come this consciousness abandons them and thus these organs fall into decomposition Therefore it is known with certainty that this consciousness appropriates the organs and for this reason until the end of life they do not perish It is the support of grasping of all the states of existences The phrase furthermore at the moment of reincarnation gives the explanation This consciousness is the seriesconsciousness this is why at the moment of reincarnation it grasps the Cheng The states of existence of a given lifespan  likewise are grasped by this consciousness because the seeds of these ekāvadhyātmabhāva reside in this appropriating consciousness This consciousness is also called mind Thus the Bhagavat said Mind  manas and consciousness ii The second is the afflicted manas  always associated with the four afflictions  ie wrong view of the self  pride of the self  attachment to the self and ignorance It is the support of the defilements of the consciousnesses The consciousnesses arise because of the first manas as support the second one is defilement Because it cognizes the object  the manas is a consciousness as antecedent  as thinking  the manas is of two kinds In relation to the mental consciousness which immediately follows it the consciousness that has just passed is the immediately preceding condition and support of arising it is called the first manas ii The second is the afflicted manas because it is afflicted by four passions First wrong view of the self is erroneous clinging to me and mine Under its influence there comes pride of self when one depends on me and mine one becomes proud These three afflictions all have ignorance as cause Ignorance is notknowing  the opposite of knowingness As it gives up its place to the mental consciousness it is called the first manas as it brings defilement through belief in a self  it is called the second manas How do we know the existence of the defiled manas If it did not exist i unmixed ignorance would not exist and this would be a fault ii There would be no similarity between the mental consciousness and the five other consciousnesses  and this would be a fault Indeed the five groups of consciousnesses have the eye etc for their simultaneous support and the mental consciousness likewise must have a simultaneous support which is the manas iv There would be no difference between the absorption of nonidentification and the absorption of cessation  and this would be a fault Indeed whereas the absorption of nonidentification is characterized by a defiled manas the absorption of cessation is not v Among those beings without conceptuality  there would be neither belief in a self nor pride in a self for the entire duration of their nonconceptualizing existence they would not be afflicted vi Because in states of mind that are wholesome  unwholesome or indeterminate  we notice that belief in a self is always present Otherwise if the defiled manas did not exist the affliction called pride of self would be present by association with unwholesome states of mind alone whilst it would not exist in wholesome or indeterminate states Here are some stanzas Unmixed ignorance similarity with the five difference between the concentrations and the etymology would be lacking and this would be a fault During nonconceptualizing existence belief in a self would be absent and this would be a fault If the defiled manas did not exist two things unmixed ignorance and similarity with the five would be lacking and three things etymology difference between the concentrations and the presence of belief in a self among the nonconceptualizing beings would be icompatible If it did not exist belief in a self would not be universal But the unmixed ignorance ever present always creates an obstacle to the mind i If the existence of the defiled manas is denied there would not be any unmixed ignorance Neither does it reside in the afflicted mental consciousness  because ignorance there would be associated with the other afflictions and consequently would not merit its name of unmixed If it is claimed that the mental consciousness is afflicted as a consequence of this affliction which is ignorance it must be accepted that it is absolutely afflicted in its nature which is false If it is claimed that passionignorance exists with wholesome states of mind it would necessarily be associated with wholesome states of mind and the other states of mind would not exist But if it is claimed that various wholesome states of mind capable of bringing the remedy for ignorance exist with the manas if it is claimed that when the remedy arises that which is remedied ie the Manas and its ignorance disappears then the reasoning is correct The similarity between the five consciousnesses visual consciousness etc and the mental consciousness ie that they arise from two conditions would be contradicted if the afflicted manas did not exist for the mental consciousness would not have an empowering condition as simultaneous support from its own side cogitat ergo vocatur cogitans if the manas did not exist to what would this etymology apply These six consciousnesses cannot be the support for the consciousness that follows them immediately because they have already been destroyed when the former succeeds them v Moreover among the gods having no conceptualizing  for the entire duration of an existence there would be no belief in a self If these gods did not have afflicted manas they would be free of belief in a self during the course of their existence Indeed belief in a self perishes at the same time as its support and its projection has no other support than the mental consciousness that appears at the moment of its arising vi Without the manas the persistence in all situations of the belief in a self could not be explained if the existence of the manas is denied the truth of the ongoing peristence is no longer confirmed The four afflictions associated with the manas constitute an obstacle on the the path they are therefore defiled There would be no third category called mind outside of the storeconsciousness Thus it is proved that the storeconsciousness is of the category mind The manas and the consciousnesses arise from the mind provided with all the seeds Why is the storeconsciousness also called mind the dharmas that result from active consciousnesses of various categories The predispositionseeds are the special potentialities belonging to the perfumed  to the storeconsciousness perfumed by the active consciousnesses Why is this mind not called storeconsciousness or appropriating consciousness in the Vehicle of the rāvakas Because it pertains to the subtle object the śrāvakas are not instructed to recognize all phenomena Although someone preaches the storeconsciousness to them they succeed in knowledge that is why they are not taught the storeconsciousness But the bodhisattvas are instructed to recognize all phenomena that is why the storeconsciousness is taught to them Without this knowledge it would not be easy for them to acquire omniscience Bh c bh a U ac u ba But all these things are sought by the bodhisattvas this is why they are taught the storeconsciousness In the Vehicle of the rāvakas also the storeconsciousness is mentioned by synonyms In order to destroy the ultimate basis when someone preaches the Dharma to them they wish to hear it and lend an ear to it they seek perfect knowledge and are in possession of the path of truth When the Tathagata appeared in the world  this marvelous extraordinary Dharma appeared in the world ii In the āgama of the Mahāsāṃghikas also it is called the rootconsciousness it is mentioned by this synonym also Thus the tree depends upon its root In the same way that the tree depends on its root the storeconsciousness is the root cause of all the consciousnesses In the same way the trees root is the cause of the leaves etc and without the root the leaves would not exist iii In the gama of the Mahīśasakas Therefore it is synonymous with storeconsciousness actually the other aggregates of which we are going to speak do not last for all of saṃsāra In the formless world  all matter is interrupted among the gods without identification and in the two meditative attainments  every mind is interrupted By contrast the seeds of matter and of mind contained in the storeconsciousness can never be interrupted as long as the path that counteracts them does not arise Thus this support of the knowable called storeconsciousness  appropriating consciousness  mind  ultimate basis  no The great path that is the storeconsciousness is praised by all these names we have noted that manas and vijñāna are two different things thus citta also is a separate thing According to the interpretations current in the Vehicle of the rāvakas these interpretations of the name of the ālaya do not hold Why is this preferable The five elements of grasping are impediments for those born into very painful destinies Pleasant feeling joined with desire does not exist in and beyond the fourth dhyāna It would be absurd that beings who experience it would take it to be ultimate basis because it annoys them Wrong view of self also is an impediment for Buddhists who believe in the nonexistence of self That is why it would be absurd for them to take it as ultimate basis Beings born in the fourth dyāna or beyond are opposed to pleasant feeling joined with desire But the storeconsciousness is always dear to beings since they confuse it with their ātman In brief  its natures are three in number ie selfnature  nature of being cause and nature of being fruit by virtue of the predispositions of all the afflictive dharmas that perfume it the storeconsciousness is the generating cause of these dharmas since it has the ability to contain the seeds this storeconsciousness furnished with all its seeds is always present as the cause of these afflictive dharmas Arising and ceasing with these dharmas that perfume it the storeconsciousness becomes seed As a result of this perfuming it contains the seeds of the dharmas Joined with these seeds it can give birth to the dharmas The pradhāna etc does not have this power to contain the seeds neither do the immediatelypreceding conditions That which by simultaneous birth and destruction of the dharma is the generating cause of this particular dharma is what is called propensity Thus sesame seeds perfumed by a flower sesame seeds and flower arise and perish at the same time but the sesame seeds arise as the cause reproducing the scent of the flower In this way also among desirous people  the propensity of desire arises and perishes at the same time as the desire but their state of mind arises as the cause engendering this desire Finally among the sages  the propensity to knowledge also is born and perishes at the same time as the act of reflecting on what has been heard  but their state of mind arises as the cause engendering discourse The same reasoning applies to the storeconsciousness That which by simultaneous birth and destruction of the dharma is the generating cause of this particular dharma that which is perfumed arises and perishes at the same time as that which perfumes Do the seeds of afflictive dharmas contained in the storeconsciousness constitute a category substantially different or nondifferent from this consciousness If they were different from the storeconsciousness the seeds would differ part by part By the power of the wholesome or unwholesome propensities  the seeds would be wholesome or unwholesome But it is accepted that they are indeterminate If they were not different how could there be a number of them Furnished with these potentialities it is called consciousness endowed with all the seeds The wheat seed  because it has the power to give rise to the shoot  has the nature of seed After having undergone the action of time or fire the wheat loses is germinative power its nature of being wheat subsists just as at the beginning but since its strength is exhausted it no longer has the nature of seed It has powers giving rise to afflictive dharmas endowed with these powers it is called consciousness endowed with all the seeds It is like the case of a lamp the arising of the flame and the combustion of the wick are mutual and simultaneous Or like two bundles of reeds which simultaneously leaning on each other do not fall down the storeconsciousness is the cause of the defiled dharmas in the same way the defiled dharmas are the cause of the storeconsciousness That is the true definition of the causal condition because another causal condition does not exist Let us take a lamp for example at a given moment the lamps wick gives rise to the flame and the lamps flame consumes the wick they are mutually cause and result Similarly the storeconsciousness and the active consciousnesses are simultaneously and mutually cause and fruit How can the nondifferent and nonvariable propensities be the cause of different and variable dharmas when it is coated it does not show any variation but when it is dipped into the dyebath  then many different rainbowhued colors appear at the moment of impregnation it is not varied but when it is dipped into the dyebath which is the arising of the fruit  a crowd of various dharmas manifests The arising of the fruit being its dyebath the author speaks of the dyebath of the arising of the fruit It penetrates it when it is seized by the conditions At the time of impregnation it shows no difference or variety but when it has reached the stage of retribution  it appears as the very cause of multiple dharmas Here in the Greater Vehicle there is dependent origination which is subtle and very profound i The production of dharmas by virtue of the storeconsciousness is the pratītyasamutpada that which apportions the selfnatures since it is the same condition of the distribution the various selfnatures the twelve members beginning with ignorance  by apportioning the different kinds of existences  pleasant and unpleassant  into wholesome and unwholesome destinies operates as principal condition in rebirth Here those who are mistaken about the first dependent origination ie storeconsciousness think that the origin of things is to be sought in selfnature  or in previous actions  or in a transformation of the creator  or in the Self or else they think that there is neither cause nor condition Those who are mistaken about the second dependent origination imagine a self that is actor and enjoyer Let us suppose there is a group of people who are blind from birth  who have never seen an elephant and who one day are presented with an elephant The first blind person touches the trunk of the elephant the second its tusks  the third its ears  the fourth its feet  the fifth its tail  the sixth its side Someone asks them what is the elephant like and the first answers that it is like a plow  the second like a wooden leg  the third like a winnowing basket  the fourth like a pillar  the fifth like a broom and the sixth like a rock In the same way here those who are ignorant about these two dependent originations blinded by ignorance are ignorant about the storeconsciousness which here is comparable to the elephant are ignorant about its selfnature  its nature as cause and its nature as result They think that the cause of things is the selfnature or previous actions or a creator or a Self or else that there is production without any cause In short  the selfnature of the storeconsciousness is that of being a retributionconsciousness furnished with all the seeds All the existences of the threefold world and all the destinies are the result of this consciousness The outer seed is the wheat  etc the inner seed is the storeconsciousness this is a matter of the outer seed and the inner seed or of the fruit and the cause The conventional seed is the external seed wheat etc because it is just a development of the storeconsciousness All the seeds have six characteristics They are momentary the two kinds of seeds perish as soon as they are born It is impossible that an eternal dharma could be seed because its nature remains unchanged from what it was at the beginning Because the fruit is born at the precise moment when the seed exists The storeconsciousness lasts up until its obstruction arises the seeds of outer dharmas last until the formation of the root or until maturity Anything does not give rise to anything whatsoever but at given times and given places when the seeds encounter their proper conditions at these places and times their fruit takes birth a given seed produces only the fruit appropriate to it Thus the storeconsciousness produces only the storeconsciousness and wheat seed produces only the wheat fruit Thus substances of neutral odor can be perfumed but not odoriferous substances like agallochum or malodorous substances like garlic  etc Gold stone etc are not perfumable because their parts are not in mutual cohesion In order to be perfumed it is necessary not only to be perfumable but also to be in strict relationship with the perfumer The relationship is the fact of never being separated Their respective three natures are in opposition each of them functions with a special support  a special object and a special act of attention The Dārṣṭāntikas claim that the earlier moment perfumes the later moment there are no two moments that exist at the same time It is the simultaneous arising and cessation that constitutes propensity The organs  eye etc being of the same type of rūpaprasāda  should also be mutually perfumed in the sense that the two organs eye and ear together having a subtle characteristic  should be mutually perfumed despite the characteristic of consciousness common to them how could they perfume one another The two seeds in question ie the outer seed and the inner seed are both generating cause and projecting cause First the outer seed is generating cause until the ripening of the fruit the inner seed is generating cause until the end of life The outer seed projects the shoots after the tree has rotted away The inner seed projects the corpse after death It is thanks to the projecting cause that the shoots and the corpse last long enough If the two seeds were generating cause only as soon as the cause disappears the fruit would perish and would not last for even an instant If the moments followed one another if the subsequent moment arose because of the previous moment there would never be a final term That is why the projecting cause necessarily exists These two seeds are cause in the same way that the string that is released and the bow that is bent cause the arrow not to fall but to travel a long distance That is why the outer seed does not exist aside from the inner seed As for the other consciousnesses the active consciousnesses  they are enjoyers throughout all the existences and destinies ekaṃ pratyayavijñānaṃ dvitīyam aupabhogikam upabhogaparicchedaprerakās tatra caitasāḥ The first consciousness is the conditionconsciousness the second is the enjoyer It is there that the mental events act as enjoyer discriminating and stimulating A verse of the Abhidharmasūtra says The storeconsciousness and all dharmas are always mutually cause and result they arise from one another At the moment when the storeconsciousness is the cause of dharmas at that very moment the latter are its result at the moment when the storeconsciousness is the result of dharmas at that very moment the latter dharmas are its cause If in the first dependent production  these two consciousnesses are mutually conditional cause  of which condition is it a question in the second conditioned production Of the dominant condition Of how many conditions are the six active consciousnesses the outcome They are the outcome of the dominant condition the object condition and the condition as equal and immediate antecedent The three dependent productions saṃsāra pleasant or unpleasant destinies and complete enjoyment  include these four conditions In the first dependent production ie in that which apportions the selfnatures  if these two consciousnesses are mutually causal condition this is about to be explained of which condition is it a question in the second dependent production ie in the one which apportions approval or disapproval The six consciousnesses come from three conditions Thus concerning the visual consciousness the eye is the dominant condition color is the object condition the consciousness that has just disappeared is the antecedent condition Here the storeconsciousness is studied under its names and characteristics How does one know that these names and characteristics apply exclusively to the storeconsciousness and not to the active consciousnesses Without a storeconsciousness defined in this way defilement and purification are impossible passionaffliction  actionaffliction and birthaffliction are impossible mundane purification and supramundane purification are impossible Bh c bh b U a u a If the names and natures in question are applied to something other than the storeconsciousness affliction and purification are impossible Why would the passiondefilement be impossible Because the nature consisting of being the seed the nature realized by the perfuming of the afflictions and subafflictions does not belong to the six groups of active consciousnesses i Indeed let us suppose a visual consciousness arising and perishing with the afflictions and subafflictions lust etc It is this visual consciousness perfumed by the propensity of lust etc that must be the seed of lust and not another consciousness auditory consciousness etc But when the visual consciousness perfumed by lust is destroyed and replaced by another consciousness auditory consciousness etc there is no longer the propensity of lust and the support of this propensity namely the visual consciousness does not exist It is impossible that from this visual consciousness previouely destroyed there could arise a second visual consciousness provided with the aforesaid lust  etc In the same way from a past action presently without selfnature there cannot arise a retributive result ii Furthermore the propensity does not reside in the first visual consciousness arising with the lust Moreover  the propensity seed of the second visual consciousness does not reside in the lust because the lust depends on the visual consciousness and is not stable iii Neither does the propensity reside in the other consciousnesses auditory consciousness etc because the organs that support these consciousnesses are distinct for these consciousnesses do not arise do not perish together iv Finally the propensity does not reside in the visual consciousness itself because two consciousnesses of the same nature do not arise do not perish together This is why the visual consciousness cannot be perfumed by impregnation by afflictions and subafflictions lust etc One consciousness cannot be perfumed by another The same reasoning that is valid here for the visual consciousness will be applicable mutatis mutandis to the other active consciousnesses like the Sautrāntika masters that the past is without selfnature  and that the retributive result is projected by an propensity presently existing But the Vaibhāṣika masters believe that the retributive result arises from a past action that is impossible Therefore he accepts that that the visual consciousness arising with the lust etc may be perfumed by the lust But he denies that another consciousness a later visual consciousness arises with the passion If there cannot be impregnation in the visual consciousness that arises with lust etc how could there be impregnation in what arises later than this visual consciousness In other words the lust can perfume the consciousness on which it depends but the consciousness cannot perfume the lust which it supports iii Neither does the propensity reside in the other consciousnesses the impregnation cannot reside in the auditory consciousness etc Because the supports of these consciousnesses are distinct Since their supports are distinct none of them can arise and perish together Indeed the visual consciousness depends on the eye the auditory consciousness depends on the ear and so on up to the mental consciousness which depends on the manas Since the supports are separate  it is impossible that the impregnation of one of them be found in the other iv Finally the impregnation does not reside in the visual consciousness itself the visual consciousness likewise cannot perfume the visual consciousness because two consciousnesses cannot arise at the same time Since there are not two simultaneous birth and destruction definitely does not occur The visual consciousness does not return to perfume the visual consciousness because the perfumer and the perfumed  the agent and the action  would be confused Furthermore amongst those who fall from a higher level the ones without identification  etc and are reborn here in the realm of desire the first consciousness  which is afflicted by the afflictions and subafflictions of the realm of desire and which appears at the very beginning of the reincarnation pratisaṃdhi will be reborn without seed Lacking a storeconsciousness it would then be born without seed When the consciousness that counteracts the afflictions is born all the other mundane consciousnesses are destroyed Thus lacking a storeconsciousness it is impossible that this counteracting consciousness would contain the seeds of the afflictions and subafflictions because it is free in nature  for it does not arise and does not perish with the afflictions and subafflictions If the storeconsciousness did not exist when a mundane consciousness arises later it arises without seed for the propensity of passion and its supportconsciousness are past and have long ago ceased to exist Consequently if the storeconsciousness did not exist the passiondefilement would be impossible when in the rya who possesses the fruit of streamentry the path counteracting the afflictions that are to be cut by seeing arises for the first time all the other consciousnesses the mundane consciousnesses are immediately destroyed This shows that the counteracting consciousness cannot be the seed of the afflictions When later when the path of meditation follows the path of seeing  were a mundane consciousness to arise it arises without seed because the propensities of the afflictions and its supportconsciousness are past and have not existed for a long time ii Because lacking a storeconsciousness existence conditioned by grasping is impossible Indeed at the moment of rebirth  the mental factors meritorious  unmeritorious and invariable  have long ago been destroyed and the consciousness of rebirth cannot arise from mental factors long since destroyed the rebirth consciousness is not morally indeterminate  as it is eqipped with attraction and repulsion  ii Lacking a storeconsciousness existence conditioned by grasping is impossible there would be no upādānapratyaya bhavaḥ Given the consciousness perfumed by the aforesaid mental factors it is by the power of grasping that the propensities develop and give existence Because then the connection of rebirth is impossible This afflicted mental consciousness perishes in the intermediary existence and a vijñāna becomes coagulated as embryo in the mothers womb i If it was the mental consciousness of the intermediary existence that became coagulated there would be in the mothers womb a second mental consciousness depending on the coagulated mental consciousness Thus two mental consciousnesses would exist simultaneously in the mothers womb ii Furthemore the coagulated vijñāna cannot be a mental consciousness because the mental consciousness always has a defiled support since if it were the coagulated vijñāna it would never be interrupted and would have an imperceptible object iii Supposing that the coagulated vijñāna is a mental consciousness then either it is the coagulated mental consciousness that is equipped with all the seeds  or it is another mental consciousness arisen in dependence on this coagulated vijñāna that is equipped with all the seeds If it is the coagulated mental consciousness that is equipped with all the seeds then what we call mental consciousness is in reality synonymous with storeconsciousness If on the other hand it is the mental consciousness dependent on the coagulated vijñāna that is equipped with all the seeds then the support causal consciousness would not be equipped with all the seeds whereas the supported fruitional consciousness would be equipped with all the seeds which is completely impossible Consequemtly it is proved that the coagulated vijñāna is not a mental consciousness but a retributive consciousness equipped with all the seeds the realm of desire dependent on the active mind in the intermediate existence between death and birth  an afflicted mental consciousness This afflicted mental consciousness because it has birth as object  perishes in the intermediary existence a mental consciousness retributive in essence the primary substance of the being  existing independently of the effort of the moment and morally indeterminate and a mental consciousness having an object and an aspect quite distinct  associated with pleasant unpleasant etc feelings These two mental consciousnesses would exist simultaneously in the same body ii Furthermore the coagulated vijñāna cannot be a mental consciousness The mental consciousness has the manas defiled by the afflictions  lust  etc as support  for it has birth as object Since it has something that is afflicted as support we say that it has an afflicted support But here the retributive vijñāna does not have an afflicted support because this vijñāna is indeterminate Because then if the mental consciousness were the coagulated vijñāna it would have an imperceptible object The object of the mental consciousness is perceptible  ie the dharmas But the coagulated vijñāna does not have a perceptible object of this kind That is why the coagulated vijñāna cannot be a mental consciousness In those who are reborn the grasping of the material organs is impossible without a retributive conscousness  for the consciousnesses other than this last one have their specific support and are not stable Indeed the other consciousnesses the active consciousnesses  are unable to appropriate the material organs Because these consciousnesses have their particular support this shows that lacking a storeconsciousness the six organs eye etc would not have a single dharma to appropriate all at once Indeed the visual consciousness depends only on the eye the auditory consciousness depends only on the ear and so on Then lacking a storeconsciousness the eye and the other organs deprived of an appropriator would perish Consciousness and nameandform which function supported by each other like two sheaves of reeds  cannot be explained without a storeconsciousness The Bhagavat said Nameandform has vijñāna as condition By name here is meant the four nonmaterial aggregates by form here is meant the embryo If by name the active consciousnesses was already understood then what is meant by vijñāna if not the storeconsciousness the support of existence  it functions uninterruptedly That is why it is said that it is condition for nameandform With the exception of the retributive consciousness  no other consciousness can be the nutrimentconsciousness of which the Bhagavat speaks for beings already born Indeed we do not see any one of the six active consciousnesses forming a nutriment for beings born in the three worlds According to the Bhagavat there are four nutriments the nutriment which consists of foodbythemouthfuls contact mental activity and consciousness thus when one sees water in the distance even though one may be thirsty one does not die nutriment of consciousness is appropriation because by this appropriation the body subsists for a long time In this list nutriment of contact refers to the six active consciousnesses nutriment of mental activity refers to the greedy manas Moreover in the states deprived of mind sleep  swoon blackout  the absorption of cessation the six groups of consciousnesses are destroyed What then is this other consciousness except the storeconsciousness that appropriates the body so that it does not decompose Abandoned by the storeconsciousness the body would perish When after having died here  one is reborn in an absorbed level  a nonabsorbed and afflicted mental consciousness forms the bond of rebirth But in regard to the nonabsorbed and afflicted mind of the higher levels nothing other than the retributive consciousness can constitute a seed which in the past had been realized in the course of earlier existences is not a seed because there was no other consciousness to undergo the perfuming A storeconsciousness therefore must necessarily be accepted in which resides the eternal propensity of the mind returning from of the higher realms Among beings born in the formless realm  when there is an afflictedwholesome mind  without a retributive consciousness furnished with all the seeds  it too would be born without seed and without base In beings born in the formless realm having gone beyond form  the afflictedwholesome mind This mind has come from its own seed contained in the storeconsciousness In this same realm when the supramundane mind appears  the other minds the mundane minds  disappear Thus the destiny in this realm would be annihilated Some beings born in the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification produce a supramundane mind of the sphere of nothingness Indeed this supramundane consciousness cannot have as support either destiny in the naivasaṃjñānāyatana or destiny in the akiṃcanyāyatana or destiny in nirvāṇa The supramundane mind cannot have either the first sphere or the second sphere as destinysupport because these two spheres are mundane Furthermore produced as the mind of ākiṃcanyāyatana by beings belonging to another sphere  it cannot have two destinysupports simultaneously Finally this supramundane mind cannot have nirvāṇa as destinysupport because it has another support namely sopadhiśeṣanirvāṇadhātu At the moment of death  beings who have accomplished good actions and beings who have committed bad actions experience a gradual cold feeling in the lower or the upper part respectively of the body which without a storeconsciousness would be impossible Consequently the birth affliction also lacking a retributive consciousness furnished with all the seeds would be impossible At the moment of death  those who have carried out good actions experience a gradual cooling in the lower part of their body those who have committed bad actions experience it in the opposite part  because those who have carried out good actions must rise whereas those who have committed bad actions must descend Without a storeconsciousness capable of appropriating the body how could the body gradually become cold That is why when it abandons it the body becomes cold in the lower part or the upper part according to the case i Those who have not rejected the lust of the desire realm and who have not yet acquired the mind of the form realm endeavor to liberate themselves from the lust of the desire realm by a good mind of the desire realm But this mind of effort belonging to the desire realm is not born does not perish with the mind of the desire realm thus it is not perfumed by the latter and cannot be the seed ii The preceding mind of the form realm is a past mind in the course of numerous earlier existences  it has been separated by other minds it no longer exists As a result it cannot be the seed of the absorbed mind  ie of the mind of the form realm that occupies us Consequently the retributive consciousness furnished with all the seeds which proceeds in a continuous series is the causal condition of the absorbed mind in the form realm whereas the good mind of effort is its dominant condition Thia is what has been proved The same reasoning may be applied mutatis mutandis to all realms exempt from lust He will now show that mundane purification is impossible as well ii The good mind of the form realm already obtained in the course of other existences in eternal saṃsāra is not the seed of the present good mind of the form realm because it is past and for many existences has been replaced by many minds belonging to the desire realm iii The storeconsciousness contains the seed of this mind and the actual mind of the form realm is born from its own seed contained in the storeconsciousness But the good mind of effort is not without efficacy it is only a dominant condition and not a causal condition It is from the power of its dominance that the mind of the form realm is born Why would the supramundane purification be impossible The Bhagavat said The words of others and correct inner reflection are the causes of correct seeing Words of others and correct reflection perfume either the auditory consciousness or the mental consciousness or both together However at the time of correct mental reflection on the texts  the auditory consciousness does not arise and similarly the mental consciousness is replaced by other consciousnesses distracted consciousnesses At the moment when the supramundane mind associated with correct reflection  ie correct seeing  arises the mental consciousness perfumed by the propensity of hearing together with the propensity of hearing is destroyed  past  finished long ago Not existing any longer how could it be the seed able to give birth subsequently to the supramundane mind associated with correct reflection The mundane mind associated with correct reflection does not arise does not perish with the supramundane mind associated with correct seeing thus it is not perfumed by the latter not being perfumed by it it cannot be the seed Consequently the supramundane purification also would be impossible in he absence of a retributive consciousness furnished with all the seeds How can the retributive consciousness furnished with all the seeds  the cause of affliction  be the seed of the supramundane mind that counteracts this affliction The supramundane mind is foreign thus its propensity does not yet exist Not having a propensity from what seed could it be said to arise Answer It comes from the seed that is the propensity of hearing  issuing from the very pure dharmadhātu The retributive consciousness the cause of that which is counteracted  ie the affliction cannot be the cause of the antidote  ie purity the pure mind has not yet been realized how could it arise without an appropriated cause It is the propensity of hearing issuing from the very pure dharmadhātu The teachings  ie the sūtras etc which result from this very pure dharmadhātu are called the result of the very pure dharmadhātu The propensity coming from this hearing is called propensity of hearing or again the hearing itself constitutes propensity hence the expression propensityhearing This propensityseries residing as an foreign principle in the storeconsciousness is the cause capable of producing the supramundane mind Is the hearing propensity the same as the storeconsciousness or is it not the same as the storeconsciousness If it is identical with the storeconsciousness how is it the seed producing the antidote to this consciousness If it is not identical with the storeconsciousness where could a support to this hearing propensity seed be found Until the enlightenment of the buddhas is attained  this hearing propensity according to whether it resides in any place of functioning whatsoever that serves it as support  resides temporarily in the retributive consciousness  becomes united with it functions with it like water and milk However it is not the storeconsciousness because it is its seed Bh a bh a U c u ba If the hearing propensity is identical with the storeconsciousness how could it be the seed of the antidote to the storeconsciousness If it is not identical with the storeconsciousness it must have a support distinct from the storeconsciousness until one acquires the supreme enlightenment acquired by the Buddhas  until one acquires the destiny that serves as support for stainless emancipated wisdom  this hearing propensity From the small propensity is derived the medium propensity  from the medium propensity is derived the great propensity indeed hearing  contemplating and meditating comprise a progression Issuing from the supramundane and very pure dharmadhātu even though it is worldly  it is the seed of the supramundane mind Even before the supramundane mind arises it counteracts the explosion of the afflictions it counteracts the hell destinies it is the antidote that supresses all bad actions It favors meeting with the Buddhas and bodhisattvas Although worldly it pertains to the dharmakāya of the beginning bodhisattvas it also comes out of the vimuktikāya of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas It counteracts the explosion of the passions it is a cause capable of cutting through the excessive activity of sensual desire  etc It is the cause that suppresses these actionstobeexperiencedlater as a result of which one is reborn in the bad destinies In summary  it is the counteragent of all bad conduct  past  future and present once freed he comes once more into possession of his prerogatives sovereignty and fortune It is said that although it is furnished with all the seeds it becomes deprived of seeds because these seeds are completely cut As in the example of water and milk  the hearing propensity which is not the storeconsciousness and the storeconsciousness itself exist together in the same place It is like the milk drunk from water by a goose In the same way when the mundane attachment is eliminated the propensity of the nonabsorbed levels decresases little by little whereas the propensity of the absorbed levels develops little by little and thus one arrives at the transformation of the basis Let us return to the example given above of water and milk mixed when geese drink this mixture the milk disappears and the water reamins The production of the nirodhasamāpatti does not counteract this retributive consciousness but it does counteract all the other consciousnesses The writer has proved the existence of the storeconsciousness by showing that without it affliction and purification are impossible to show this the Bhagavat said that amongst them the vijñāna does not leave the body How does he know this Indeed when the retributive consciousness has been interrupted  it does not rearise  except in being reborn This is not true because on leaving the absorption the vijñāna is not produced anew This vijñāna which is fruit of retribution  does not rearise once it is interrupted except to be reborn and take on a new existence Some think that the absorption of cessation is provided with mind because it contains a mental consciousness But even from their point of view such a mind is impossible Indeed i Nirodhasamāpatti would be impossible iii Since the mental consciousness cannot be described here as an unwholesome or morally indeterminate consciousness it would be associated with the roots of good iii The vijñāna of this absorption is definitely not a mental consciousness because this mental consciousness would be associated with the roots of good The mind of entry into this absorption is definitely neither unwholesome nor morally indeterminate But without the roots of good nonattachment  etc this wholsome mind would not exist But if these roots of good exist how would the two mental factors concept and senation not be present it is tobesensed pleasantly or tobesensed indifferently  whence the presence of a sensation simultaneously with contact Thus in the nonconceptual absorption  by virtue of a preparatory practice  there is this power of suppression characteristic of samādhi The nirodhasamāpatti would be reduced to a simple destruction of concept if the suppression of conceptualization was characteristic of nirodha alone The absorption of nonconcept primarily and only in suppressing conceptualization would be merely the destruction of conceptualization in the absorption of nonconcept and not a distinct absorption If this mind contained in the nirodhasamāpatti were not destroyed volition faith and the other roots of good would be present In order to avoid all the kinds of difficulties enumnerated above and to avoid contradicting the āgamas some scholars are content to exclude the mental factors That also is impossible i Because it is impossible to separate the things supported from their support the support is the mind the things supported are the mental factors Support and things supported ie mind and mental factors have been inseparable from one another since beginningless saṃsāra because they mutually attract one another This is why if the absorption of cessation is equipped with a mind it will necessarily bring along nonattraction and the other roots of good inseparable from the mind Objection But you may say the absorption and the means of absorption are in opposition to nonattachment and the other roots of good Therefore in this absorption the roots of good do not exist and the wholesome mind alone exists Answer Such a dissociation has never been seen elsewhere If at the time of its cause the absorption is associated with these mental factors it would remain associated with them at the time of the fruition of result ii Neither does it hold because there are examples The Bhagavat has said In those who dwell in the absorption of cessation the factors of the body  speech and mind are destroyed Here the factors of the body are the inbreath and the outbreath the factors of speech are examination and judgment the factors of mind are volition  conceptualization  etc If examination and judgment were destroyed speech could not arise It is the same for the mind if the factors are destroyed it does not arise Objection But you may say if the factors of the body perish when one enters into absorption the body persists and does not perish the mental factors are destroyed but the mind persists and does not perish The Bhagavat has said When the body factors are suppressed there is still another cause for the susbsistence of the body food  drink  the vital organ  consciousness  etc Thanks to these although the inbreath and outbreath may have disappeared the body persists But it is not the same for the mind If the mental factors are suppressed there is no further particular cause supporting the mind so that it can subsist Thus since the absorption of cessation would not have a mental consciousness it would be necessary to call it absorption without mind But since the retributive consciousness remains in this absorption the Bhagavat has stated that the vijñāna does not leave the body and it is from this vijnāna supplied with all the seeds that coming out of absorption  the active consciousnesses arise This is why the storeconsciousness necessarily exists Since it cannot be wholesome  unwholesome or morally indeterminate  this mental consciousness is not in conformity with the absorption of cessation a Neither by association with the roots of good How could contact be separated from the univeral mental factors sensation etc b Nor by reason of its original cause a wholesome mind of effort That contradicts the sūtra for which every mind is wolesome by virtue of an association with the roots of good The theory according to which the continuous production of matter and of mind would be the seed of the dharmas is inadmissible as we have seen above It would be impossible to fall from the formless realm or from the heaven of the nonidentifying ones  and to emerge from the absorptionof cessation The last mind of the arhat would not be explicable unless the earlier mind with respect to the later mind would be an immediately preceding condition and and not a causal condition Bh a bh aa U bc u b According to one theory the authors of which are the Sautrāntikas the continuous production of matter and mind would be the seed of the dharmas would be the generative cause of conditioned dhrmas This theory says the form of the later moment arises immediately from the form of the preceding moment the mind of the later moment and the associated mental dharmas arise immediately from the mind of the preceding moment When one falls from the formless realm and is reborn into the form realm  it is impossible that the earlier form is the generating seed of the actual form because the earlier form has long since been destroyed When the mind falls from the heaven of the nonidentifying ones to be reborn into an identifying world when the mind reappears to leave the absorption of cessation etc it is impossible that the earlier mind could be the generating seed of the later mind because the earlier mind has long since been destroyed If the earlier mind could contain the seed of the later mind without having a birth and cessation simultaneous with the later mind if only the mind of the earlier moment could be the seed that produces the mind of the later immediatelyfollowing moment the last mind of the arhat could not be explained Indeed this ultimate mind would be the seed which as immediately preceding condition  gives rise to another mind the result would be that the sphere of nirvāṇawithoutresidue would never occur i If there was only one good mind among the bodhisattvas ie a mental consciousness that is whollesome but impure  apart from the first five active consciousnesses and distinct from the other mental consciousness the unwholesome impure consciousness  how would this mind transform its support Besides if the counteragent were the cutting cause and result would be indistinguishable iii Perhaps you would admit that this mind loses its seeds  or loses its nature of seed and that that is its transformation i If among the bodhisattvas there were only one good mind the first five consciousnesses visual consciousness etc and distinct from the other from the unwholesome impure and afflicted mental conscousness the author who has already spoken of a good mind adds here that it is distinct from the other with the aim of distinguishing it from the wholesome but impure if you believe in the existence of the storeconsciousness you could call transformation of the support the phenomenon that causes all the seeds of affliction that it contains to lose the quality of seed ii You say that the arising of the counteragent is the transformation But that is impossible The counteragent is the transformation you will say it is the cutting of the afflictions that is called transformation of the support But the counteragent is not this cutting because it is merely the cause of the cutting If it were the cutting itself the cause and the result would not be different The result ie nirvāṇa is the cutting the cause ie the noble path  is the counteragent If the counteragent were the cutting the result and the cause would be one and the same thing and on the arising of the counteragent there would be nirvāṇa You would perhaps admit that the loss of the seeds or the loss of its nature of seed applied to the active consciousness constitutes the transformation of the support The mind in which the numerous seeds of defilement are accumulated would be without seeds and you would consider that to be the transformation of the support or else its nature of seed would disappear and you would consider that to be the transformation of the support then although the afflicted active consciousnesses no longer exist in the state of absorption their seeds reside in the storeconsciousness which can be deprived of seeds or of its nature of seeds by transforming it Since thus your claimed transformation of the support is not explicable in the hypothesis of the existence of only the active consciousnesses it is necessary to believe in the existence of a storeconsciousness i Projection storeconsciousness is the propensity newly arisen by the fact of retribution Without this projecting storeconsciousness the consciousness conditioned by the factors and the existence conditioned by attachment would be impossible Without this retributionconsciousness there would be no seed and as a result the dharmas destined to arise could not arise Without it the belief in a self belonging to the manas would have no object impregnation coming from first speech is called speciesprojection because this projection projects the birth the material organs  eye etc and other entities of retribution would not be able to arise The store consciousness is the object of the view of self and the belief in the self that resides in the afflicted manas If this special storeconsciousness which is object did not exist belief in the self that has as its cause the wrong view of self contained in the afflicted manas would no longer have an object When it is shared  the storeconsciousness is the seed of the worldreceptacle when it is unshared  it is the seed of the individual bases of consciousness Shared it is the seed of the insensate world unshared it is the seed of the sensate world Because the buddhafields are pure  the vision of the Buddhas is pure Shared it is the seed of the insensate world the seed of the bases of the individual and internal consciousness disappears because it is counteracted As weak it is the seed of the defilements and the minor kleśas valid it is the seed of the impure but wholesome dharmas Without this twofold storeconsciousness the distinction between inaptitude and aptitude a distinction that comes from retribution would be impossible As exhausted it is the wholesome or unwholesome seed that once retributed is retributed for the good As nonexhausted it is the seed of propensity of speech  because throughout eternity  it is the seed that engenders the multiplicity of discursiveness Without this  the good or bad actions already accomplished would not be exhausted by giving their result and would become retributed indefintely the production of a new propensity of speech would be impossible iii The storeconsciousness has also a nature of similarity  because the storeconsciousness is like an illusion  a mirage  a dream and an optical illusion  Among those who have rejected the mundane attachments  it is reduced Among the śaikṣas śrāvakas and bodhisattvas it is partially suppressed Among the arhats pratyekabuddhas and Tathagatas it is free of all obstacles of passion Mutatis mutandis  it is the same for freedom from all obstacles of passion and all obstacles to knowledge Without this storeconsciousness the gradual suppression of afflictions would be impossible Why is the storeconsciousness which is the retribution of wholesome and unwholesome dharmas  a nonafflicted and morally indeterminate retribution Because being nonafflicted and indeterminate it opposes neither good nor bad it is the good and the bad that oppose each other If the retribution were good or bad instead of being nonafflicted and indeterminate the disappearance of the afflictions would be impossible As a result the retribution consciousness is nonafflicted and indeterminate Bh c bh ab U bc u ba If the retribution were not nonafflicted and indeterminate the disappearance of the afflictions would be impossible since the good arises from good and the bad from bad the process of saṃsāra would have no end Bhavaṅga extends between birth and death ābhaṃ paṭicca acci paññāyati Santi bhikkhave eke samaṇabrāhamanā evaṃvāino evaṃdiṭṭhino yaṃ kiñcāyaṃ purisapuggalo paṭisaṃvedeti sulhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ

self and other the concept which manifests as good destiny bad destiny death and birth The dependent nature is expressed as wrong imagination deha is the five dhātus eye etc dehin is the kliṣṭamanas bhoktṛ This is the six external elements  color etc This is the six consciousness elements This is noninterruption of the stream of saṃsāra This is the receptacle world As long as the belief in me and mine has not been cut  one believes in me and mine in self and what belongs to self one makes distinctions this is their dependent nature Out of error and miscalculation they manifest as the appearance of an object this is their imaginary nature Their true nature which is characterized as the complete absence of parikalpita in the paratantra consitutes their absolute nature this is its dependent nature Among the concepts listed in  the concept of body of the possessor of the body and of the enjoyer is the six inner elements  eye etc The concept cognized by the preceding ones is the six outer elements  color etc The concept that cognizes the preceding one is the six elements visual consciousness etc These notions are none other than concept only since there is no object What is the example for that The dream  etc can be used as an example Thus in a dream where there is no object  nothing but a bare consciousness  various objects colors  sounds  smells  tastes and tangibles  houses  forests  lands and mountains appear however there is no real object there By this comparison it will be understood how not only in the dream but everywhere else  there is nothing but concept In the phrase the dream etc can be used as example the word etc should be understood as including other examples Let us agree that in the awake state as in the dream state  everything comes down to conceptonly But on emerging from the dream one has the feeling that the dream was just a concept Why does the same feeling not arise equally in the awake state It appears in those who are awakened by means of the knowledge of reality Just as the feeling of the nonobjectivity of the dream visions is lacking during the dream but appears after waking up in the same way the feeling of the nonobjectivity of the visions of the waking state is lacking in those who have not been awakened by the knowledge of reality but does appear in those whom this knowledge has awakened Bh and bh are lacking U a u b How can those who have not yet been awakened by the knowledge of reality understand the existence of concept only by deduction In the Daśabhūmika  the Bhagavat said This threefold world is nothing but mind And in the Saṃdhinirmocana  Maitreya asked Bhagavat are the images perceived during concentration different or not different from the mind that perceives them Maitreya they are not different from the mind I have said that the object of consciousness is formed by concept only thus there is no external object Bhagavat if the images perceived during concentration are not different from the mind how can the mind grasp the mind itself Maitreya no dharma grasps another dharma nevertheless the mind that arises thus from causes and conditions appears thus in the twofold aspect of a mind that is seen and a mind that sees Thus for example given a form in the polished surface of a mirror in which it is reflected one imagines that one sees the form and the image The form and the image that one sees appear as two distinct things  whereas the image is nonexistent Similarly the mind that arises thus from causes and conditions and the images erceived in concentration seem to be different things whereas they are two aspects the one passive the other active of one and the same mind Thus when the mind is in concentration  whatever dharma image  blue  etc is seen it is the mind itself that is seen There is no object blue etc separate from the mind By means of this reasoning the Bodhisattva is able to deduce that at the basis of all notions  there is concept only and not objective reality At the basis of the image blue etc there can be no consciousness of memory because the object perceived in concentration is immediately present Arising from hearing and pondering  the consciousness of memory has the past as object therefore what it sees is concept only There can be no consciousness of memory at the basis of the image blue etc If the image perceived in concentration were the memory of some past day one ought to remember the particular place where the thing had been seen earlier as well as the earlier perception And since the past does not exist the image which it perceives is mere concept for example the memories of childhood Therefore what is remembered by this consciousness is mere concept because the object of the mind in empty Among the eleven concepts  ideas that are like a dream  we understand that the concept of the visual consciousness etc is mere concept  but how do we know that material ideas  eye etc By scripture and by reasoning as above If these are concept only why do they have a material appearance and form homogeneous and solid series Because they are the basis or cause of error and other afflictions Otherwise if these concepts arose without material appearance the error that consists of taking as an object that which is not an object would not occur If the error would not occur the afflictions constituting the obstacle of desire and the obstacle of knowledge would not occur Here is a verse The cause of illusion is the concepts that develop similar to rūpa the illusion itself is the concepts of the nonmaterial development If causeconcepts did not develop in rūpa resultconcepts nionmaterial would not exist because without viṣaya there is no viṣhayin Because they are destined to maintain birth and pleasure Why do concepts vi to xi called concept of time  etc exist How are these concepts established as concept only Briefly  according to a threefold aspect i According to unicity  because they have no object ii They are twofold since they are supplied with image and vision Thus the concept of the eye etc has as image  the concept of color etc  as vision  the concept of visual consciousness  and so on up to the concept of body consciousness iii The concept of manas has as image all the concepts from the concept of eye up to that of dharma as vision it has the concept of mental consciousness  because the mental consciousness is concept and arises similar to all the concepts Here the prose and the verse explain how concept only is established because of three characteristics In one and the same concept  there is one part that is image and a second part that is vision This is why the visual consciousness etc is twofold Because of duality This is a matter of image and vision In one and the same concept the first part develops into various images which the second part grasps in various ways as the case may be The concept of manas has as image all the concepts from the concept of the eye up to that of dharma as vision the concept of mental consciousness This concept of manas is able to grasp all objects simultaneously In this third point relative to the mental consciousness only is there variety because the object which it grasps is not determinate This is why it is enough to show that this consciousness is concept only Since the object does not exist the consciousness that takes it does not exist either since the object to be known does not exist the knower does not exist either arising on any support whatsoever the mental consciousness together with its various aspects takes on a twofold appearance namely the appearance of just an object and the appearance of a concept In the two worlds endowed with form  the mental consciousness relies on the body consequently as the material organs which are different from it and which rely on the body it appears everywhere in the aspect of the tangible One category of bodhisattva gathers everything into one single mental consciousness According to whether it relies on such and such an organ eye etc it takes such and such a name visual consciousness up to mental consciousness at the moment of its arising Beyond the mental consciousness there is no other consciousness of any other kind arising on no matter what support etc that is to say on the eye and the other supportorgans the mental consciousness together with its various aspects takes on a twofold appearance namely the appearance of a cognized object and the appearance of a cognizing subject Just as the eye and the other material organs that rely on the body can do good or evil to the body so the mental consciousness which in the two worlds with form relies on the body is able to register and imagine the body and do good or evil for it By means of three scriptural texts the bodhisattvas show that the mental consciousness cognizes not only its own object but also those of the other five consciousness and that consequently these five consciousnesses are useless When the concept of storeconsciousness is considererd as an objective concept  then it must be recognized that all the other concepts make up its conceptimage  whereas the concept of mental consciousness together with support  make up its conceptvision The conceptimages  being the image generating the vision  appear as object and play the rle of support of arising in regard to vision As the Bhagavat has said When bodhisattvas have four qualities  ie four knowledges they understand the nonobjectivity of all concepts These four knowledges are i Viruddhavijñānanimittatvajñāna Thus hungry ghosts  animals  humans and gods have differing concepts of one and the same thing Thus the past  the future  dream  reflection are perceived in the absence of any object iii Aprayatnāviparītatvajñāna knowledge that there would be neither effort nor error if the object were real If the object existed the consciousnesses bearing on this object would be made effortlessly and without error since one would be cognizing reality iv Trividhajñānānukūlatvajñāna knowledge that the object conforms to the threefold knowledge For bodhisattvas and those in the dhyāna states who have attained mastery of mind  objects appear as they want them by the power of their aspiration For yogins who have attained tranquility and who practice the examinaton of dharmas  objects appear at the precise moment of attention For those who have attained nonconceptual wisdom and who abide there no more objects appear Thus because of the close correspondence of the object with this threefold knowledge and for the other reasons given above it is proved that the object does not exist It is established that consciousnesses bearing on these things have no object If one accepts that objects are really such as they are perceived one would understand the truth and beings would be delivered effortlessly The ecstatics the ones who are in dhyāna are the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas dhyāna is the onepointed fixing of the mind Who have attained mastery of the mind who have attained aptitude of mind amatha and samādhi are synonymous If the object really existed the acquisition of nonceptual knowledge would no longer be explained because the object would be seen as it is from the start i If the dependent nature is the conceptonly basis of the object  how is it dependent and why is it called dependent Because it is incapable of lasting by itself for a single moment after its arising it is called dependent Because it is the generating cause of errors of the mental consciousness of innumerable aspects or imagination  it is imaginary Because it has no nature of its own and is present as a pure imagination  it is called imaginary Because it is the object of the purified mind and the quintessence of all good dharmas  it is rightly called absolute The imaginary nature is the fact that the dependent nature is poorly understood The absolute nature which is defined as the absence of parikalpita in the paratantra is the tathatā the true inalterable nature and the object of the nonerroneous mind An imagination and something imagined are required for an imaginary nature How does the imagination imagine ii The imagined thing is the dependent nature because a part of this dependent nature the eye and the other nimittas is what is fabricated it adheres to its own mark because the grasping of characteristics is conceptualization  and it is in conformity with this conceptualization that it engages itself in speech It speaks by fourfold speech that which is seen etc it speaks by fourfold discourse that which is seen heard felt cognized Are these three natures different or are they the same They are neither different nor the same Insofar as it depends on something else ie the arising of the propensity seeds  In what sense is it imaginary In what sense is it absolute They are not the same because existence and nonexistence do not constitute one and the same thing How many types are there in the dependent nature In brief  there are two dependence in respect to the propensity seeds  and dependence consisting of a fundamental nondifferentiation in regard to defilement and purification It is dependent because of this twofold dependency The imaginary nature also is twofold because it is imagined by the imagination creating a selfnature and by the imagination creating specifications The imagination creating a selfnature is that which seizes broadly the substrate furnished with attributes  the eye etc the imagination creating specifications is that which seizes in detail the various attributes of the thing The absoluteness of selfnature is the stained true nature the absoluteness of purity is the unstained true nature The mental construction belonging to wellendowed beings is that which belongs to beings who are skilled in speech The mental construction belonging to poorlyendowed beings is that which belongs to beings not skillful in speech by starting from the name to imagine the thing ie suchandsuch a word has suchand such a meaning by starting from a name to invent a name the concept which is the modification of that which has the aspect of an object ie the modifications brought about in the nimittābhāsa or the consciousnesses by the preceding modifications the distractionconcept ie the ten concepts of the bodhisattvas Bh ab bh ba U cb u ab The word etc includes sickness and death Modification by pleasant sensation etc because pleasant sensation modifies the body The word etc includes unpleasant sensation and neither pleasant nor unpleasant sensation also Modification by lust etc includes hatred  worry  anger  etc Thus it is said that the body changes under the action of cold Modifications by the hells etc the word etc Modifications by the world of desire etc the word etc includes the form realm because in the formless realm there are no concepts of material appearance They undergo according to circumstances  the modifications of old age etc mentioned above According to whether the eye is healthy or dulled the visual consciousness is clear or blurred this is a vikalpa which has as its cause the meeting with good or bad friends hearing the true or the bad Dharma This vikalpa distracts from nonconceptual wisdom Those are the ten vikalpas of the bodhisattvas i In order to counteract the concept of nonexistence  it is said A bodhisattva being truly a bodhisattva ii In order to counteract the concept of existence  it is said sees no bodhisattva in the absolut sense Because name is empty of selfnature v In order to counteract the concept of identity  it is said The emptiness of form is not form vi In order to counteract the concept of difference  it is said Outside of emptiness there is no form form is emptiness emptiness is form There is no arising no cessation no defilement no purification of selfnature ix In order to counteract the concept that is attached to interpreting the thing according to the name  it is said The name is fabricated If in one sense the dependent nature merges with the three natures  why are these three natures not identical a Since the notion does not exist prior to the name since the name is multiple and indeterminate it is proved that the thing cannot be merged with the name that it is not multiple and that it is not composite ca niḥsaṃkleśaviśuddhitā māyādisadṛśī jñeyā ākāśasadṛī tathā The dharma does not exist but it is seen it has no stain but there is purification If the dependent and the imaginary were identical  it would be necessary that one would have the notion of the thing independently from the name  as for example for the pitcher Consequently it is contradictory that the name and the thing merge Here by name we mean the imaginary nature and by thing we mean the dependent nature Moreover there are several names for a single thing If the name and the thing were identical the thing like the name should be multiple In this case the thing would have several natures But it is impossible that one and the same thing could have several natures Therefore if the two merged a second contradiction would result Finally the name is indeterminate the word puṅgava may be applied to nine different things If it were admitted that the name and the thing are identical it would be that several different things would constitute one and the same nature Thus there would result a third contradiction because it would have to be admitted that very different things  cows etc make up one and the same nature this first part of the stanza is explained to students by the example of magic The magical elephant does not exist as a true elephant nevertheless it is seen they are seen and yet they do not exist It is like space Space is not soiled by fog  etc because it is pure by nature nevertheless when the fog dissipates we say that space is purified It is the same for dharmas They are not stained because they are pure by nature nevertheless when the obstacles and adventitious stains are destroyed we say that the dharmas are purified If the dependent and absolute natures did not exist defilement and purification would be absent But defilement and purification do exist Thus it is wrong that everything would be nonexistent Here is a stanza If the dependent and the absolute did not exist at all defilement and purification would not take place because stains are necessary for there to be purification In the Greater Vehicle the Buddha Bhagavats taught the Vaipulyasūtras in this teaching  it is said i How should the imaginary nature be conceived ii How should the dependent nature be conceived It should be conceived as a magic show  a mirage  a dream  a reflection  an image  an echo  the reflection of the moon in water  a magical creation It should be conceived by proclaiming the fourfold pure dharma The fourfold pure dharma is The essential purity  ie the true nature  emptiness  the utmost point of reality  the signless  the absolute  the fundamental element The stainless purity  ie the same essential purity as being free of all obstacles The purity of the path leading to the essential purity  namely all of the dharmas which are the limbs of enlightenment  the virtues  etc The purity of the object destined to give rise to the path  ie the teaching of the true Dharma of the Greater Vehicle Because this teaching is the cause for purity  it is not imaginary because it is the outflow of the pure fundamental element  it is not dependent All the pure dharmas result from from this fourfold purity māyadideśanā bhūte kalpitān nāstideśanā caturvidhaviśuddhes tu pariniṣpannadeśanā Concerning the product we speak of magic concerning the imaginary we speak of nonexistence but concerning the fourfold purity we speak of the absolute śuddhiḥ prakṛtivaimalyam ālambanaṃ ca mārgatā viśuddhānāṃ hi dharmāṇāṃ caturvidhagṛhītatvam The purities are the essental purity the stainless purity the purity of the path and the purity of the object Indeed the pure dharmas come from these four natures The prakṛtivyavadāna is the true selfnature of ordinary people The tathatā being unchangeable  is the shared nature of all dharmas Why is the dependent nature proclaimed to be like a magic show etc To dispel this hesitation the sūtra compares the dependent nature to a magic show How can the mind and mental factors which have no object arise To dispel this hesitation the sūtra compares the dependent nature to a dream iv They wonder In the absence of an object how can good or bad actions produce a pleasant or unpleasant result To dispel this hesitation the sūtra compares the dependent nature to an image In the absence of an object how can the various rebirths arise In the absence of an object how can the different kinds of speech arise In the absence of an object how can the images perceived during correct concentration be produced To dispel this hesitation the sūtra compares the dependent nature to the reflection of the moon in water In the absence of an object how can the bodhisattvas whose mind is unerring be reborn at will for the service of beings To dispel this hesitation the sūtra compares the dependent nature to a magic show ii Here the mind and mental factors play the rle of mirage and the object plays the role of the water While the mirage does shimmer  there is no real water  and yet the notion of real water is produced In the same way when the mind and mental factors shimmer there is no real object and yet the notion of object is produced iii In the dream there is no real object nevertheless one knows that various pleasant and unpleasant feelings are experienced It is the same here in the awake state iv The image is not a real object it is relatively to the model that one has of the notion of image nevertheless there is no realityimage distinct from the model Although these reflections are seen the reality reflection is nonexistent It is the same for the consciousnesses these are not different things and yet they appear as different things It is the same for superficial speech it is not vii The moons reflection in water is not a real thing and yet thanks to the clearness and clarity of the water it is seen in the water There is yet another meaning to these eight comparisons of the Bhagavat The example of the magic show serves to reject the six inner bases of consciousness  The example of the dream serves to reject the objects of enjoyment color etc The example of the echo serves to reject the result of vocal action  Mental action is threefold nonconcentrated stage  concentrated stage  and the coming from hearing The example of the moon reflected in water serves to reject the result of mental action of the concentrated stages the commentary of Sūtrālaṃkāra XI With what intention did the Bhagavat say in the Brahmaparipṛcchā  that the Tathāgata does not see saṃsāra and does not see nirvāṇa Since the dependent nature is imaginary on the one hand and absolute on the other hand  by expressing himself in this way the Bhagavat had in mind the identity of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa Indeed in its imaginary part  this dependent nature is saṃsāra in its absolute part it is nirvāṇa However here we are talking about complete relativity  nondifference in order to destroy the erroneous adherence of foolish people to a difference in nature between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa In the Abhidharmasūtra the Bhagavat said There are three dharmas that which is part of defilement  that which is included in purity and that which is included in both What did he mean by speaking in this way ii The absolute nature which occurs in the dependent nature falls into the purity part The example of goldbearing clay Thus in goldbearing clay three things are noticed the earth element  the earth and the gold In the earth element the earth which is not there is seen  whereas the gold which is there is not seen When one has burned the earth element by means of fire  the earth does not appear whereas the gold appears The earth element when it appears as earth has a false appearance when it appears as gold it has a true appearance Consequently the earth element falls into both parts Similarly when one has not burned concept by the fire of nonconceptual wisdom the false imaginary nature contained in this concept appears whereas the true absolute nature does not appear When one has burned concept by the fire of nonconceptual wisdom  the true absolute nature contained in this concept appears while the false imaginary nature does not appear Consequently the dependent nature which consists as idea to wrong mental construction is included in both parts and is similar to the earth element in the goldbearing clay The earth element is solidity the earth is form and appearance  respectively ordinary matter and derived matter the gold is the seed of gold In some places  the Bhagavat said that all dharmas are eternal elsewhere he said that they are transitory  and yet elsewhere he said that they are neither eternal nor transitory What was his intention in proclaiming them to be eternal The dependent nature is eternal in its absolute part  transitory in its imaginary part  neither eternal nor transitory in its two parts together happiness  sadness and their advaya goodness  malice and their advaya emptiness  nonemptiness and their advaya the self  the nonself and their advaya tranquility  nontranquility and their advaya the thing with selfnature  the thing without selfnature and their advaya that which arises  the nonarisen and their advaya that which has been destroyed  the nondestroyed and their advaya primordial tranquility  primordial nontranquility and their advaya the essentially nirvanized  the nonessentially nirvanized and their advaya saṃsāra nirvāṇa and their advaya etc In these distinctions  all the enigmas posed by the Bhagavats should be understood in the light of the three selfnatures as the teaching on the eternal noneternal etc Here are some stanzas Since dharmas are nonexistent since they appear in many aspects  there is neither dharma nor adharma Thus nonduality is proclaimed On the one hand  it is proclaimed that they do not exist on the other hand ot os proclaimed that they do exist From both sides it is proclaimed that they are neither existent nor nonexistent They are not such as they appear this is why they are proclaimed to be nonexistent But because nevertheless they do appear for this reason they are proclaimed to be existent svayaṃ svenātmanā bhāvāt svabhāve cānvasthiteḥ grāhavat tadābhāvāc ca niḥsvabhāvatvam iṣyate Because they do not exist in themselves because they do not exist by their selfnature because they do not persist in their selfnature because they are not what they are thought to be the absence of their selfnature is affirmed niḥsvabhāvatayā siddhā uttarottaraniśrayāt anutpādānirodhāḍiśantiprakṛtinirvṛtiḥ The fact results gradually from their absence of selfnature that they have neither arising nor destruction that they are primordially tranquil and essentially nirvanized Since the dharmas are nonexistent there is no dharma since they appear in many aspects there is no adharma it is in this sense that the dharmas exist since there is neither dharma nor adharma nonduality is asserted On the one hand ie from the one extreme  it is asserted that they do not exist that they are without selfnature from the other extreme it is asserted that they do exist that they do have selfnature From both sides it is asserted that they are neither existent nor nonexistent by considering the paratantra that partakes of both natures at the same time  it is asserted that they are neither existent nor nonexistent They are not such as they appear they are not as they are perceived this is why they are asserted to be nonexistent but because it is said that they exist insofar as they are simply appearance  they are asserted to be existent for this reason Because they do not exist in themselves because all dharmas do not arise by themselves  independent of conditions that is the first meaning of the expression without selfnature Because once they are destroyed since the dharmas do not rearise out of their own nature of self  they are without selfnature that is another meaning of the expression without selfnature Because they do not persist in their selfnature Because once arisen they do not have the power to last for a single moment afterwards they are without selfnature These three absences of selfnature of dharmas are shared with the śrāvakas from the fact that all dharmas are without selfnature it results that they are unborn etc indeed that which is without selfnature is unborn that which is unborn is unceasing that which is unborn and unceasing is primordially tranquil that which is primordially tranquil is essentially nirvanized Furthermore all of the Buddhas words should be understood in the light of four purposes and four intentions It was I who at that time was Vipaśvin the perfectly enlightened one aham eva sa tasmin samaye vipaśvi samyaksaṃbuddho bhūvam  ii Kālāntarābhiprāya intention dealing with another time eg when he said By merely invoking the name of the Tathāgata Bahuratna one is predestined to supreme complete enlightenment bahuratnasya tathāgatasya nāmadheyagrahaṇamātreṇa niyato bhavaty anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau When one will have served as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges then one will understand the Greater Vehicle iyato gaṅgānadīvālukāsamānabuddhān paryupāsya mahāyāne vabodha utpadyate iv Pudgalāśayābhiprāya intention dealing with the individuals dispositions eg when he criticized in one person the gift which he had praised in another person yat tad eva dānaṃ kasyacit pudgalasya praśaṃsate kasyacid vigarhate It is the same for discipline and a certain meditation as for gift These are the four intentions When in this way he introduces it into the teaching  that is abhisaṃdhi It is I who at that time was Vipaśvin Similarly when one discovers a resemblance with someone else one says Thats me But it is clear that the Buddha Vipaśvin of the past is not the actual akyamuni Bhagavat By means of a simple vow one will be reborn in the realm of Sukhāvati The doctrine of the Greater Vehicle as understanding is something other than the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle as text When you have served as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges you will understand the Greater Vehicle because the holy Dharma  knowable by ones own intuition  is difficult to understand First the Bhagavat praises the discipline of the undisciplined person  then he criticizes the same displine of the honest person in order to lead the latter to the cultivation of a higher category of good A certain meditation ie worldly meditation In the stanza asāre sāramatayo the word asāra The phrase viparyāse ca susthitāḥ means well settled in the opposite of errors Taking that which is not eternal to be eternal  etc is error taking that which is not eternal to be noneternal is the opposite of error In the phrase kleśena susaṃkliṣṭāḥ kleśa means effort  fatigue He abides in the long kleśa of saṃsāra but only out of great compassion The phrase labhante bodhim uttamām is easy to understand He who wishes to explain the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle in brief must express himself in three points i he must give an explanation of dependent production  ii an explanation of the nature of dharmas resulting from dependence and iii an explanation of the meaning of the discourses i First an explanation of dependent production  by saying for example Indeed the retributive consciousness and the active consciousnesses  being reciprocal conditions  arise from one another this is how the characteristics of the threefold selfnature itself are explained as for example when one says Thus by someone who does not see the truth and by someone who does see it these two natures imaginary and absolute are simultaneously not perceived or perceived as existent and nonexistent respectively With these propensities as cause there arise all the dharmas that have the active consciousnesses as selfnature ii Thus by the one who does not see the truth and by the one who does see the truth it is simultaneously that these two natures etc This idea has been explained in the stanza At the moment when the one who has not seen the truth sees the nonexistence of the pariniṣpanna and the existence of the parikalpita in the paratantrasvabhāva at that same moment the one who has seen the truth sees the nonexistence of the parikalpita and the existence of the pariniṣpanna the Buddhas intellect is very pure has the other phrases as its commentary moving in the absolute sense without obstacle in the knowable nd quality penetrating into the highest purity of the Tathāgata the nature of which is the nonduality of existence and nonexistence uninterruptedly maintaining the spontaneous activity of the Buddha cultivating the antidote to all the obstacles escaping from the attacks of all the heretics while dwelling in the world not being confined by human relationships Establishing the doctrine the bodies of the Buddha extend throughout all the universes Cutting through doubt Cognizing the arising of dharmas to come Attaining the perfection of virtues in an equalized dharmakāya This is not like the virtues in the bodhisattva levels which consist of degrees the Buddha has reached the summit of the unadulterated liberating knowledge of the Tathāgata But it is not by way of its selfnature that it is is without limit In the phrase indestrucutibility etc the word etc Indeed the Buddhas qualities will never be exhausted because the number of beings to be converted will never be exhausted Adorned with these qualities the Buddha has a very pure intellect thus the Bhagavat is distinguished from the śrāvakas pratyakabuddhas and bodhisattvas because of his pure intellect The phrase They have as their lofty predisposition the accomplishing of benefit and happiness for all beings is explained by sixteen actions  which are b Disinterested action defined by the three phrases of no It consists of absence of selfinterested views  absence of fondness for benefactors and aversion for evildoers  continuity in later existences b Action of body and speech conforming to the lofty predisposition defined by the two phrases of no b Action without retreating Their lofty predisposition is to act for the benefit and happiness of all beings They introduce beings into omniscience this is explained by the action of successive effort  like a lamp that transmits the flame to a thousand lamps By virtue of this action the lofty predisposition of working for the benefit and happiness of beings succeeds in manifesting In the following phrases as well this predisposition will be explained in a corresponding manner Some people sometimes have the lofty predisposition of working for the benfit and happiness of beings but it is mistaken that is why they themselves must know what their value really is They have vanquished pride this is explained by the action of personal effort independent of others invitation Their lofty predisposition is solid this is explained by immutable action  because the sufferings of saṃsāra cannot turn them away from the resolutions they have made They express themselves in moderate words with a smiling face this is explained by the twofold action of body and speech conforming to the lofty predisposition of working for the welfare and happiness of all beings Their great compassion is unlimited this is explained by equal action towards unfortunate fortunate and neither fortunate nor unfortunate beings that one has heard this is not a question of hearing just anything at all The doctrine is the points of the teaching explained by these sūtras this is explained by the action of perfected effort and the six phrases of Because this effort leads to perfection it is called perfected effort By dwelling there appropriately without strolling about is to dwell there respectfully they distrust all worldly frivolities singing laughing dancing etc Individual knowledge is called refuge in knowledge this is not the awareness of a simple object  but it is taking refuge in ones own vijñāna Sending away dishonest people and gathering honest people bodhisattvas wish alike to cause them to leave the bad states and introduce them into the good states this is not to abandon them bc and Siddhi p Aprayatnāviparītatvajñāna tadyathākāṣe tārakā timiraṃ dīpo māyāvaśyāya

under the aspect of texts and theses They are like cognizable substances These are states perfumed by the great hearing ie states characteristic of a mental series perfumed by the great hearing of the texts and theses of the Greater Vehicle They are not mingled with the storeconsciousness because these states follow from the very pure fundamental element and counteract the storeconsciousness Who is it who enters into the natures of the knowable The bodhisattva who has perfumed his mental series by means of the great hearing of the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle who has served innumerable Buddha avatars  who with single faith  has fully accumulated the roots of good  and has thus fully accomplished the accumulations of merit and wisdom Bh bc bh ab U c u ba Each agent assumes an activity and a being endowed with activity with the great hearing derived from the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle he has perfumed his series Who has served innumerable Buddha avatars thanks to this series thus perfumed he has been able to meet and serve the avatars of the Buddas For these three reasons ie great hearing of the Greater Vehicle etc he has accumulated innumerable roots of good Thus he is called a bodhisattva endowed with merit and wisdom Amidst this mental discourse furnished with vision that has the appearance of texts and theses and that comes from the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle  the bodhisattva enters into the stage where faith is practiced  into the path of seeing  into the path of meditation or the final path He enters into the adhimukticaryābhūmi because being based on what has been said to him  he adheres to the purely ideational nature of all dharmas Now the author is going to explain the categories and aspects of the entry These mental words have the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle as the cause of their arising ie this doctrine is the cause which gives birth to them Others enter into the path of seeing because they penetrate this word correctly Finally others enter into the final path because they are very pure and freed from obstacles by putting to work the roots of good  by rousing his courage in three ways  by eliminating four blockages  by being zealous in a continuous and respectful effort applied to tranquility and insight concerning the texts ands theses i The bodhisattva thinksInnumerable human beings in innumerable universes reach supreme perfect enlightenment each moment This reflection consitutes the first stimulant for courage ii He thinks It is with these intentions that beings practice generosity and the other perfections I too am going to attain such intentions By means of them I shall cultivate the perfections without too much trouble and I shall reach perfection This reflection consitututes the second stimulant As for myself admirably endowed with limitless moral good  why should I not obtain universal perfection at that moment This is the third reflection Here are some stanzas manuṣabhūtāḥ saṃbodhiṃ prāpnuvanti pratikṣaṇam aprameyā yataḥ sattvā layaṃ nāto dhivāsayet Since throngs of beings in human condition reach enlightenment at each instant discouragement should not be permitted The Victorious Ones who have acquired them can cultivate generosity etc After death good people obtain the perfections of their choice If the bodhisattva hears it said that the supreme perfect enlightenment is great  profound  vast and difficult to obtain  his courage sags This explains the third stimulant I who have cut through the obstacles ranged against it have acquired a moral goodness free of obstacles If he says I am incapable of reaching supreme perfect enlightenment that is timidity and weakness The author exhorts him not to say that he is incapable and consequently not to be discouraged Thus a stanza says Generosity is not practiced with a bad mind or a morally indeterminate mind etc Some people practice generosity with a bad mind a morally indeterminate mind or a distracted mind because they are looking for certain forms of existence or wealth he seeks only supreme perfect enlightenment The bodhisattvas are called victorious because they have already acquired these high intentions By means of them the perfections of generosity etc As for those very good ones who have cut through the obstacles ie who are good without any obstacles why should they not obtain the perfected perfections By abandoning reflection  the bodhisattva rejects the customary reflections of the ṣrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas By abandoning perplexity and hesitation  he rejects any doubt regarding the Greater Vehicle By abandoning adhesion to dharmas  he rejects adhesion to the belief in me and belief in mine in regard to dharmas heard and thought By abandoning concepts  he arrives at no longer meditating  no longer conceiving any object directly present or prepresented in concentration By suppressing perplexity and hesitation By abandoning adherence in regard to dharmas heard and thought he cuts through the belief in me and mine He enters as a result of mental discourse derived from the hearingpropensity resulting from correct attention  which has the appearance of texts and theses that are equipped with vision Why and how does he enter The author asks this question in order to explain the reason and manner of entering Since the stages of entering of which we have spoken above  come from the propensity of the Greater Vehicle we know that they come from the absolute nature This is to know correctly that the selfnature and characteristics attributed to the name or the thing are simply designations that there is no real object there that exists How is this entry into ConceptOnly made and what is it like One enters into unity  into duality pertaining to image and vision and into multiplicity One enters in the same way that one identifies a rope which seems in the darkness to be a snake Since it does not exist the snake seen in the rope is an illusion Those who have recognized that it does not exist reject the notion of snake and keep the notion of rope But the rope itself if reduced to its subtle elements  is an illusion itself for it has color  smell  taste and tactile as specific characteristics Thus when any reality has been denied to the six types of mental words which appear as phoneme or as thing just as the notion of snake is abandoned by means of the notion of rope the notion of ConceptOnly underlying the mental words should be abandoned by means of the notion of the absolute nature  just as the notion of rope is abandoned by means of the notion of color etc Here the author asks about the entry itself and about an example to which it can be compared by this comparison the author shows how one penentrates the three natures Similarly the notion of parikalpita ie the six objects is abandoned by means of the notion of paratantra which is defined as ConceptOnly Thus by entering into the mental speech which is the apparent object  the bodhisattva has entered into the imaginary nature by entering into ConceptOnly  he has entered into the dependent nature how does he enter into the absolute nature Then for the bodhisattva who has destroyed the notion of object  the mental words resulting from the propensity of the dharmas that have been heard have no possibility of arising in the appearance of an object and consequently no longer arise as an idea either When the bodhisattva abides in namewithoutconcept in regard to all objects  when he abides in the fundamental element by means of direct perception  then he attains the nonconceptual knowledge in which the object and the subject of consciousness are completely identical This is how the bodhisattva enters into the absolute nature he understands that ConceptOnly in contact with ignorance  although not an object appears as object thus he has entered into the dependent nature And consequently no longer arise as idea either because if the object of consciousness does not exist the subject of consciousness does not exist either ConceptOnly in turn cannot develop an object The domain where names are applied is here called all objects these are the various domains of name Now the author explains in this stanza the various objects belonging to name form  sensation  etc names occuring in the Buddhist teachings  eg Devadatta etc Dharmānusārin  etc uddhanāman  eg the āryas who have effaced the stains Thus this bodhisattva by entering into ConceptOnly  has entered into the natures of the knowable By means of this entry he has entered into the first bhūmi the Joyous  he penetrates thoroughly the fundamental element  he is born into the family of the Tathāgatas  he acquires the mind of equality in regard to all beings  in regard to all the bodhisattvas and in regard to all the Buddhas Such is the path of seeing Because the bodhisattva has the excellent knowledge concerning the dharmadhātu because he transforms his former individuality and acquires a new one he causes his seeds of Buddha to be unbroken He acquires the mind of sameness in regard to all beings because he sees that all these beings are alike without self He acquires the mind of equality with regard to all the bodhisattvas because he knows the identity of their predispositions These bodhisattvas are all prepared to bring about the welfare and happiness of all beings He acquires the mind of equality with regard to all the Buddhas because he knows their identity of dharmakāya Again for what reason does he enter into ConceptOnly By means of a supramundane cognition of tranquility and discernment concerning mixed dharmas  by a subsequent cognition of every type of concept  cutting all the seeds of the storeconsciousness with their images  the bodhisattva cultivates the seed of contact with the dharmadhātu This subsequent cognition  which considers every creation coming from the storeconsciousness and every object of concept as a magic show  etc is in its essence free of errors Thus in the same way that the magician is free of doubt about the things produced by magic  so this bodhisattva is always unmistaken when he speaks of cause and result This cognition concerning tathatā penetrates the nature of all dharmas He acquires omniscience ie the immaculate unhindered knowledge of the Buddha This subsequent cognition is likewise free of concepts and is unstained In the course of this entry into ConceptOnly  there are four factors leading to penetration which rest on four concentrations In the course of the four correct cognitions  the entry into ConceptOnly and the certainty of the nonexistence of the object constitute the concentration penetrating a part of reality it is the basis of the patient acceptance furthering the truth Penetration means complete understanding factor of penetration means the patient acceptance of the nonexistence of self of dharmas  When this certainty is present one enters into ConceptOnly which appears like a name etc one understands with certainty that there is no object Thus the bodhisattva has entered into the bhūmis has acquired the path of seeing and has entered into ConceptOnly How does he practice the path of meditation In the ten bodhisattva bhūmis as they are described and that are the totality of all the sūtras the bodhisattva practices  over the course of many thousands of cosmic periods  the supramundane gnosis of tranquility and discrimination concerning mixed dharmas  as well as the subsequent cognition In that way he transforms his basis then he exerts himself to attain the three bodies of the Buddha it concerns the general characteristic and does not have concepts as object It is a supramundane cognition ie an nonconceptual wisdom The subsequent cognition is a descriptive cognition We cannot say that it is simply mundane because it is not exercised in the world Nor can we say that it is exclusively supramundane because it manifests in conformity with the world That is why it cannot be defined with precision over the course of many periods  he cultivates nonconceptual wisdom and subsequent cognition and thus reaches the transformation of the support  ie the purification of his mental series Then he exerts himself to attain the three bodies of the Buddha What is the difference between the two realizations  that of the śrāvakas and that of the bodhisattvas The abhisamaya of the bodhisattva is distinguished from that of the śrāvakas by way of ten superiorities lambanaviśeṣa by its object because it concerns the Greater Vehicle Nirvāṇaviśeṣa by its nirvāṇa because it takes possession of of the nonstable nirvāṇa Svaparasamacittatāprāptiviśeṣa by the acquisition of the mind of equality with respect to self and others because it never ceases to endeavor to ripen beings Upapattiviśeṣa by its appearances because it always appears in the assemblies surrounding the Buddhas Phalaviśeṣa by its results because it bears fruit having innumerable qualities the ten powers  the fearlessnesses  the attributes special to the Buddha The bodhisattva abhisamaya using both compassion and wisdom as means  has as nirvāṇa the fact of not dwelling in either saṃsāra or nirvāṇa The bodhisattva abhisamaya cuts through the afflictions with their predispositions it is able to purify all the buddhafields The object being nonexistent the threefold concept does not exist either and we enter into the three natures This is a matter of the four correct cognitions resulting from the four investigations And we enter into the three natures as was said above  we enter into the three natures By seeing that the name and the entity are independent of each other we enter into the imaginary nature By seeing that their selfnature and their specifications are mere concept  mere designation  we enter into the dependent nature i The concentrated bodhisattva sees that images are merely mind ii Abiding thus in the inner mind  he knows that the cognized object does not exist consequently he knows that the cognizing subject does not exist either Later he experiences nonperception Bh bc bh ab U ab ba i The concentrated bodhisattva sees that images are merely mind he sees that the images perceived in concentration in the appearance of texts and theses are just his inner mind As the sūtra comments Here bodhisattva means the one who sees ii Thus he abides in the inner mind ie at this moment his mind dwells in mind itself He understands that the cognized object does not exist i saṃbhṛtya saṃbhāram anantapāraṃ jñānasya puṇyasya ca bodhisattvaḥ dharmeṣu cintāsuviniścitatvāj jalpānvayām arthagatiṃ paraiti Having collected a limitless accumulation of wisdom and merit having reached complete certainty of the texts by reflection the bodhisattva understands that the object has its origin in speech The wise person who has understood the nonexistence of duality settles into the fundamental element that is beyond this duality iv akalpanājñānabalena dhīmataḥ samānuyātena samantataḥ sadā tadāśrayo gahvaradoṣasaṃcayo mahāgadeneva viṣaṃ nirasyate In the wise person by the power of the conceptfree cognition that always accompanies equality everywhere the basis a mass of errors like a thicket is driven out just as poison is expelled by a powerful antidote i Having collected a limitless accumulation of merit and wisdom The first three perfections  generosity  etc are the accumulation of merit The sixth the perfection of wisdom  is the accumulation of wisdom Zeal  effort penetrates both accumulations The bodhisattva having reached perfect certainty in the texts he understands that all objects are only mental words and have concepts as cause when he has recognized that all objects are just mental words  he settles his mind and dwells in ConceptOnly of which the many developments in the semblance of an object Having penetrated the nonexistence of the object being settled in ConceptOnly he is able to suppress the duality of grāhya and grāhaka and directly perceive nonduality  the absolute  the dharmadhātu because the arising of the certainty of his cognition is based on the dharmadhātu By means of his intellect he understands that that nothing other than his mind exists that is why he recognized the nonexistence of mind itself He knows that nowhere is there any perceived object outside of the mind Since this object does not exist the mind which perceives it does not exist either The wise person who has understood the nonexistence of duality Seeing an identity of nature like space in the dharmas sūtras etc this knowkedge accomapanies equality It accompanies it always  ie throughout all time By support is meant the cause of defiled dharmas It is a heap of faults because the propensities of the faults  ie the defiled dharmas are piled up there It is like a thicket because it is hard to penetrate v Established in the good law prescribed by the Muni established in the holy dharma proclaimed by the venerable Muni the Buddha by means of realization which is gradually developed by nonconceptual knowledge and subsequent cognition  the bodhisattvas rapidly attain the perfection of all the qualities  ie By means of the six mundane virtues generosity  morality  patience  zeal  meditation and wisdom How does one enter into ConceptOnly by means of these six virtues how do the six virtues result from this entry The bodhisattva is not attached to pleasures  does not transgress against morality  is not disturbed by suffering  is not lazy in practice abandoning the causes of distraction and fixing his mind onepointedly  he correctly analyzes dharmas and based on these six virtues he enters into ConceptOnly Having entered into ConceptOnly the bodhisattva acquires the six virtues contained in the high pure aspiration Thus without even making an effort to practice the six virtues the bodhisattva develops the six virtues in a continous uninterrupted manner by means of his adherence to the teachings  by means of his contemplation of kindness  acceptance and rejoicing  and arrives at perfection At the time of the preparatory practice  the cause of entry into ConceptOnly is the six mundane virtues  even though the relative teaching on the six virtues is very profound  the bodhisattva has faith in it Previously and at present in the unfolding of the law they see the Buddhas They understand that enlightenment is close and they attain it without difficulty first at the stage where faith is practiced  they gather the accumulations When this kṣānti is present there is superior patient acceptance the object of the high aspiration is the profound and vast doctrine of the Greater Vehicle It is profound because its object is subtle this is the nonexistence of self of dharmas Previously ie prior to the purity of aspiration now ie during this purity of aspiration They see the Buddhas this is the prediction In the unfolding of the law ie in the state of absorption In this state they see that enlightenment will soon be acquired Using superior means  they attain it without difficulty Why are there only six pāramitās There are six because they were established to counteract the opposing vices  because they are the source of acquiring all the Buddha attributes and because they promote the ripening of all beings The virtues of generosity and morality counteract the causes of not setting out on the journey  which are attachment to pleasures and attachment to ones family The causes of withdrawing are the pain resulting from the bad treatment imposed on transmigrating beings and the fatigue resulting from the long practice of the good Thus the virtues are established as six in number in order to counteract the opposing vices Nondistraction in the virtues or the virtue of meditation is ensured by the first four virtues the causes of nondistraction As a result of this nondistraction one understands completely and perfectly the reality of dharmas this is the virtue of wisdom thus one acquires the attributes of Buddha Since these virtues are the source of acquiring all the attributes of Buddha therefore they are are fixed in number as six thus by these beneficial causes  beings gain the aptitude for maturation Next by the virtue of meditation which concentrates the unconcentrated mind  and by the virtue of wisdom which liberates the concentrated mind  these beings who have listened to the preaching are ripe Thus since these virtues promote the maturation of all beings  they are fixed as six in number As consisting of six excellences i Excellence of support  because they have the mind of enlightenment as basis iii Excellence of function  because they have as their duty the welfare and happiness of all beings  iv Excellence of skilful means  because they are contained in intuitive wisdom v Excellence of application  because they are applied to supreme perfect enlightenment vi Excellence of purity  because they ensure the suppression of the obstacle of desire and the obstacle to wisdom Ordinary people śrāvakas as well etc are also familiar with generosity this is why it is absolutely necessary to clarify what nature makes generosity a virtue ii Excellence in resource Not everyone puts to work all inner and outer resources Only the bodhisattva can put them to work Thus generosity is triply pure  because it rejects any concept about the thing given  the donor and the receiver Here are the four envisaged alternatives for example morality provided with the six excellences for example morality lacking the six excellences Order of the pāramitās Why are the virtues given in this order Because the earlier ones promote the arising of the later ones By transcending all the wholesome roots  generosity  etc of ordinary people  of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas they come to the other shore i It drives away avarice and poverty it brings great wealth and an accumulation of merit this is generosity iv It frees from laziness  from wrongsoing and unwholesome dharmas it ensures the growth of innumerable wholesome dharmas v It drives away distractions it ensures the return of the mind to itself this is meditation vi It suppresses all erroneous views and all wrong knowledge it understands dharmas correctly and in all ways this is wisdom by transcending all the roots of good of ordinary people of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas they reach the other shore This is why they are called pāramitā Pāramitā is synonymous with excellence Thus generosity at the moment of cause  drives away avarice and poverty at the moment of fruit  it brings great riches and an accumulation of merit In brief  there are five cultivations i cultivation preparatory to practice  ii development of faith  iii development of contemplation  iv development of skill in means  v development of the accomplishment of the virtues to be practiced For the first four cultivations see above the spontaneous activity of the Buddhas is uninterrupted they cultivate the virtues even when their virtues are perfected i Considering all the incalculable periods that extend up until the attainment of supreme complete enlightenment as one single moment the bodhisattva would like to sacrifice his own body at every moment filling universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges with the seven jewels the bodhisattva would like to offer them as a gift to the Tathāgatas such is his conduct until he is seated on the throne of enlightenment because the disposition for generosity of the bodhisattva is insatiable yad bodhisattva yāvanto saṃkhyeyakalpā yair anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhāv abhisaṃbudhyate tāvata ekakṣaṇīkṛtya pratikṣaṇam ātmabhāvaṃ parityajet evaṃ ca gaṅgānadīvālukāsamān lokadhātūn

in the trichiliomegachiliocosm filled with fire even deprived of every resource he would wish to keep the thought of morality patience zeal meditation wisdom in his mind such is his conduct until he is seated on the throne of enlightenment for the bodhisattvas disposition for morality patience zeal meditation wisdom is insatiable Such is the bodhisattvas insatiable disposition Until he sits on the throne of enlightenment the bodhisattva does not abandon this insatiable disposition Such is his longenduring disposition By helping beings by means of the six virtues the bodhisattva is more joyful than the beings whom he has helped It is not the same for the latter Such is the bodhisattvas joyful disposition The bodhisattva considers the beings whom he helps by means of the six virtues as more beneficent than himself and thinks of himself as less beneficent than them Such is the beneficent disposition of the bodhisattva The bodhisattva applies all the roots of good that he has thus accumulated by means of these six virtues to beings so that they may obtain the reward they wish for Such is the bodhisattvas magnanimous disposition The bodhisattva shares all the roots of good that he has thus accumulated by means of the six virtues among all beings and applies them to supreme complete enlightenment Such is the holy disposition of the bodhisattva This is how the bodhisattva cultivates the contemplation of kindness incorporated into the six dispositions ii The bodhisattva is in agreement with the roots of good of the innumerable bodhisattvas who devote themselves to developing these six dispositions This is how the bodhisattva cultivates the contemplation of sympathetic joy incorporated into the six dispositions iii Finally the bodhisattva rejoices in seeing all beings cultivate the six virtues contained in these six dispositions and wishes that he himself will never abandon the development of these six virtues as long as he is not seated on the throne of enlightenment This is how the bodhisattva cultivates the contemplation of rejoicing incorporated in the six virtues All who hear about the development of contemplation by the bodhisattva a development incorporated in the six dispositions and who produce a mind of faith  acquire infinite merit and destroy all the obstacles of their wrongdoings What then could be said of the bodhisattvas themselves Bh bc bh ab U bc u bb Cultivation is repeated pratice That donor is excellent who endowed with faith  gives with respect  at the desired time  with his own hand  etc iv The development of skillfulness in means is the development contained in nonconceptual knowledge  as was said above Each is of three types i Generosity of the Dharma  material generosity and generosity of safety ii Morality of abstention  morality of collecting the wholesome dharmas and morality for the service of others iii Patience to bear abuse  patience to accept suffering and patience to contemplate the Dharma iv Zeal with which to arm oneself  zeal to exert oneself and zeal without timidity stepping back or satiety vi Preparatory nonconceptual wisdom  fundamental nonconceptual wisdom and subsequent nonconceptual wisdom Generosity of the Dharma serves to strengthen the roots of good in others Material generosity to offer vital provisions with an undefiled mind Material generosity serves to strengthen the body of others supporting the activity of beings in conformity with the Dharma sharing irreproachable actions equally  it ripens beings iii Patience to bear abuses Patience to accept suffering the cause for the quality of Buddha because without withdrawing it bears the various sufferings eg cold  heat  hunger thirst the basis for the two preceding patiences This explains the first word of the sūtra  Sthāmavān ie vigorous It is without timidity because it does not step back in the face of fatigue it is without withdrawal because its courage does not yield before the insults of another it is insatiable because in the interval leading up to enlightenment it energetically develops the wholesome without yielding to laziness v Meditation of abiding it aims at attaining a present fortunate abode For this threefold wisdom see chap These virtues contain all the wholesome dharmas insofar as they have virtue as their nature they promote the virtues and are their outcome It is asked how these virtues and the wholesome dharmas are mutually inclusive Here by wholesome dharmas is meant all the factors of awakening thus the six superknowledges  the ten powers and the other qualities are derived from the virtues How do the vices opposing the virtues include all the defilements Insofar as they have these vices as their nature  that they are their cause and their fruit Having explained how the virtues include all the pure dharmas  the author is now going to explain how the vices opposing these virtues include all the defiled dharmas they have desire  etc They are the cause of these vices they are the cause of avarice etc ie lack of faith  wrong views  etc are the cause of avarice etc They are the fruit of these vices they are the fruit of avarice immorality anger etc In the course of transmigration  the bodhisattvas take possession of the following benefits mastery  high birth  great entourage of followers and servants  successful efforts in a great work  absence of torment and the weak afflictions  skill in the arts letters and classical sciences this happiness is impeccable  lasts until the attainment of the throne of enlightenment  is devoted to the service of all beings it consitutes the benefits of the bodhisattvas By contrast the marvelous fruits which come from the virtues are dedicated to the service of all beings The Bhagavat designated all the virtues sometimes by the name of generosity  sometimes by the name of morality  sometimes by the name of patience  sometimes by the name of zeal  sometimes by the name of meditation and sometimes by the name of wisdom What was his intention In the Trimśatikāprajñāpāramitāsūtra it is said When one speaks of one virtue one is speaking of all the virtues What does that mean Thus when one practices generosity  one disciplines the body and the speech thus there is the involvement of the virtue of morality  and so on up to References on the pāramitās In the Hīnayāna dasa pāramīyo Jātaka I p Law Anthologies of the Pāli Canon III  p A In Chapter IV the cause and result of entry into the characteristics of the knowable has been explained How should the diverse cultivations of this cause and fruit be understood As the ten stages of the bodhisattva What are they B Why is their number fixed as ten Because they counteract the ten opposing kinds of ignorance In fact ten kinds of ignorance arise opposing the tenfold dharmadhātu that is to be known What is the tenfold dharmadhātu that is to be known Here are some stanzas a Universal reality and excellent reality reality with excellent outcome ungraspable reality reality with no difference in series b Reality beyond defilement and purification reality free of multiplicity reality free of decrease and increase and support of the fourfold mastery c The ignorances relative to the dharmadhātu constitute the ten undefiled obstacles The bhūmis counteract the ignorances opposing the ten bhūmis These ignorances are undefiled for the śrāvakas but defiled for the bodhisattvas Bh ac bh bb U ba u bb Questions and answers relating to the various cultivations of the cause and result What is the tenfold dharmadhātu that is to be known and in the tenth as reality supporting mastery of action and mastery of dhāraṇī and samādhimukha In each bhūmi there is a special dharmadhātu to be understood but the power of ignorance does not allow it to be known In order to counteract these ignorances the ten bhūmis are established The opposing obstacles being of ten types ten bhūmis are established What are these ten opposing obstacles In Tibetan these ten obstacleignorances are this dharmadhātu of the first bhūmi is omnipresent because there is no dharma that is nonsubstantial this dharmadhātu of the second bhūmi is excellent in all its qualities The person who knows this enters into the second bhūmi The doctrine of the Greater Vehicle which follows from this dharmadhātu of the third bhūmi is excellent this dharmadhātu of the fourth bhūmi cannot be conceived of as mine or taken as ones own it is like an individual from Uttarakuru who cannot be imprisoned in this dharmadhātu of the fifth bhūmi there is no difference in nature it is like the eye etc which in the various series of beings separately shows no differences in this dharmadhātu of the sixth bhūmi there is no defilement from the beginning because it is naturally nondefiled although the texts sūtras etc may have given all kinds of definitions for this dharmadhātu of the seventh bhūmi nevertheless it is without differences this dharmadhātu of the eighth bhūmi does not diminish when the defilement decreases and does not increase when the purity increases this dharmadhātu is the support of the mastery over characteristics The mastery over characteristics that is obtained is called mastery of marks because the characteristics of gold silver etc appear at will this dharmadhātu of the ninth bhūmi is the support of the mastery of analytical knowledge The person who knows this enters into the ninth bhūmi These ignorances are undefiled in the śrāvakas because they do not wish to enter into the bhūmis i Why is the first bhūmi called Joyous Because thanks to it for the first time one obtains for the first time the faculty of ensuring ones own interest and that of others ii Why is the second bhūmi called Stainless Because it avoids the stains of immorality iii Why is the third bhūmi called Shining Because with the immutable meditative stabilizations and absorptions assupport  it is the support of the great brilliance of the Dharma iv Why is the fourth bhūmi called Blazing Wisdom Because the auxiliary dharmas of enlightenment burn away all the obstacles v Why is the fifth bhūmi called Difficult to Conquer Because it is difficult to realize on account of the mutual opposition between knowledge of the truth and mundane knowledge vi Why is the sixth bhūmi called Revealed vii Why is the seventh bhūmi called FarGone Because it reaches the end of the practice of effort viii Why is the eighth bhūmi called Immovable ix Why is the ninth bhūmi called Excellent Intelligence x Why is the tenth bhūmi called Cloud of Dharma Because it attains a combined knowledge of all the dharmas which includes all the dhāraṇi and samādhimukhas hides the broad obstacles as the cloud hides space and fulfills the dharmakāya i Pramuditā Joyous because thanks to it for the first time the faculty of ensuring ones own interest and that of others At the moment of full realization  the bodhisattvas obtain the higher faculty of ensuring their own personal interest and that of others and thereby experience great joy The śrāvakas etc who at the moment of full realization obtain only the faculty of ensuring their own personal interest do not experience such joy that is why there is no question of the Joyous bhūmi for them In this expression all the auxiliary dharmas of enlightenment are called fire because they burn away the obstacles This knowledge is wisdom  hence the name sādhumatī Moreover like a great cloud hides space  this combined knowledge of all dharmas hides the two obstacles the obstacle of the passions and the obstacle to knowledge which are broad and infinite like space Here hide means to suppress  to cut c Finally just as a great cloud causes clear fresh water to rain down which fills space  so this combined knowledge of all dharmas emanates innumerable excellent qualities which fill In four ways i By acquiring convinced adherence  by adhering to the bhūmis ii By acquiring the practices  by acquiring the ten textual practices relating to these bhūmis iii By acquiring penetration  for when the fundamental element is penetrated in the first bhūmi all the other bhūmis are penetrated iv By acquiring the achievement  by reaching the summit of the development of these bhūmis iv By acquiring the achievement by reaching the summit of development of these bhūmis when one has cultivated the bhūmis one reaches the summit The bodhisattva who bhūmi by bhūmi cultivates tranquility and discernment  cultivates them in five ways What are these five ways He cultivates them i by combined cultivation  ii by signless cultivation  iii by effortless cultivation  iv by intensive cultivation  v by insatiable cultivation By means of this fivefold cultivation the bodhisattva produces five results  The satisfaction found there is called pleasure in the garden of the Dharma He penetrates precisely the brilliance of the infinite teaching which is without limit in the ten directions The tenth bhūmi is called fulfillment of the dharmadhātu abiding in the Buddha bhūmi is called attainment of the dharmadhātu As the main statement  ten virtues are cultivated in the ten bhūmis one main virtue for each bhūmi In the first six bhūmis the six virtues referred to in chapter IV  are practiced on the last four bhūmis the four following virtues i The virtue of skill in means Sharing amongst all beings the roots of good accumulated by the six virtues they are applied to supreme perfect enlightenment By formulating various vows  one unites the causes of the virtues for a later time  The six virtues are ceaselessly active by the power of contemplation and of meditation  The six virtues esrablish the knowledge by means of which enjoyment of the Dharma is experienced and beings are ripened Furthermore these four virtues come from the nonconceptual knowledge and subsequent knowledge of the virtue of wisdom This teaching is contained in the Pāramitāpiṭaka Bh ca bh ab U bc u aa As the main statement the ten virtues are cultivated in the ten bhūmis In each bhūmi in particular the ten virtues are cultivated at one and the same time this is why it cannot be said strictly that each particular bhūmi cultivates one particular virtue alone in the first six bhūmis Pramuditā etc the six virtues generosity  etc are cultivated In the last four bhūmis the following four virtues in the next four bhūmis Dūraṃgamā etc the following four virtues skillfulness of means  etc i Skillfulness of means To share amongst all beings the roots of good accumulated by the first six virtues in the interest of beings  not to abandon them this is not to abandon saṃsāra One seeks the causes of the virtues in the world to come I formulate the vow to go later and be reborn there where there are virtues This teaching is contained in the Pāramitāpiṭaka The entire doctrine of the Greater Vehicle is called the piṭaka of the virtues Here is a stanza When he is endowed with pure strength and with excellent power  when he is of strong mind and of advancing progress  it is said that the bodhisattva energetically cultivates the three incalculable periods he has obtained the excellent pure proclivity and zealously cultivates the practices When he abides on the first six bhūmis he is called nimittacārin when he abides on the seventh bhūmi he is called animittacārin On the eighth bhūmi effortless practice has not been achieved In the ninth and tenth bhūmi this practice has come to its achievement When he is endowed with pure strength and excellent power The power of the roots of good is called pure power ie the bodhisattva is endowed with the power of the roots of good Endowed with the power of the roots of good he is able to conquer the opposing roots endowed with the power of great vows he is always attached to spiritual friends When he is of strong mind and advancing progress While skilfully abandoning bad friends  he never abandons the great mind of enlightenment The good dharmas which he cultivates in the present and the future continue to increase  never diminishing When the bodhisattva is endowed with the power of the roots of good and the power of great vows  when his great bodhicitta is solid and irreversible when the good dharmas that he has cultivated increase from moment to moment  when he is not satified with what he has already obtained then it is said that he cultivates the three incalculable periods in an excellent way As it is said in the Bodisattvabhūmi in the chapter on Acceptance of the Bodhisattva Discipline In brief  it is superior because of four superiorities i superiority of types  ii superiority consisting of shared and unshared rules  iii superiority of extent  iv superiority of depth Bh c bh a U ab u ba Superiority of types  because it consists of the morality of abstention  the morality of gathering the good dharmas and the morality of service to beings The morality of abstention is the basis of the other two moralities The morality of gathering good dharmas is the basis for acquiring the attributes of Buddha The morality of service to beings is the basis for ripening of beings i The rule of the bodhisattvas is shared with the śrāvakas insofar as it is forbidden to the bodhisattvas to commit natural wrongdoings ii The rule of the bodhisattvas differs from that of the śrāvakas insofar as the bodhisattvas can commit wrongdoings of disobedience According to this latter rule there where the śrāvaka commits a wrongdoing  the bodhisattva does not there where the bodhisattva commits a wrongdoing the śrāvaka does not iii The morality of the bodhisattva is on the physical  vocal and mental levels that of the śrāvakas extends only to the physical and vocal levels For this very reason the bodhisattva commits wrongdoings of mind whereas the śrāvaka does not In summary  the bodhisattva can accomplish and observe any physical vocal or mental action favorable to beings provided that he is blameless i Killing  theft  illicit sex  etc resulting from lust etc are natural wrongdoings ii Cutting plants  etc which is not the result of concupiscence is a wrongdoing of disobedience The bodhisattva who sees in these wrongdoings of disobedience the benefit of beings is blameless on committing them and can accomplish all of them This is not so for the śrāvaka According to this last rule there where the śrāvaka commits a wrongdoing the bodhisattva does not thus the śrāvaka who leaves during the rainy season commits a wrongdoing It may happen that while favoring beings the action is not blameless for example having illicit sex with a woman belonging to someone else To avoid this type of action the author says provided that he is blameless the rules observed by the bodhisattvas are both many and immense by means of them they ensure the ripening and service of all beings ii Scope consisting of increase of immense merits the bodhisattvas gain an immense accumulation of merit This is lacking in the śrāvakas encouraging beings to practice the wholesome is called inclination to work for the benefit wishing that a certain person  by means of this benefit will gain a higher fruit is called inclination to work for the happimness iv Scope consisting of establishing supreme complete enlightenment by this morality the bodhisattvas establish supreme perfect enlightenment This is lacking in the śrāvakas i Finally superiority of depth is the fact that by virtue of his skillful means even if he commits the ten types of evil actions the bodhisattva does not incur any blame but gains immense merit and quickly attains complete perfect enlightenment ii Moreover fabricated actions of body and speech should be thought of as the profound morality of the bodhisattva By means of these actions the bodhisattva exerts kingship and by imposing all kinds of torments on beings he introduces them into the discipline iii Exhibiting all kinds of Jātakas he causes torment to some beings grants his favors to others and having inspired faith in them he assures their maturation Such is the superiority in depth of the bodhisattvas morality Bh bc bh ab U ca u ab i Superiority in depth is the fact that by virtue of his skillful means the bodhisattva etc Here the power of the skillful means belonging to the bodhisattva is explained The bodhisattva knows the evil intention of this person by means of his knowledge of others minds Having no other method of deterring this person from this action and knowing well that the person in question by this action is going to fall away from his good destiny and fall into an unfortunate destiny  the bodhisattva says to himself I am going to commit this action By killing him I will cause him a small suffering for a moment but I will do it so that later on he will experience much joy Then the bodhisattva like a physician  arms himself with courage and kills this person By doing that he incurs not the slightest blame Indeed he earns much merit and by means of this merit quickly arrives at supreme complete enlightenment Such a discipline is profound By means of them the bodhisattva exerts kingship and while causing all kinds of torment to beings he introduces them into the discipline eg the Viśvantarajātaka where the Bodhisattva gives his son and daughter to the brahmin He causes torment to some beings and grants his favors to others in the final analysis bodhisattvas do not torment some and favor others seq Daśabhūmivyākhyāna T  k CHAPTER VII OBSERVANCE OF EXCELLENT MIND  The superiority of excellent morality has been explained in chapter VI How should the superiority of excellent mind be conceived U b u a The doctrine of the Greater Vehicle ie the profound and vast doctrine contained in the Bodhisasattvapiṭaka The adhicitta is superior to the concentrations of the śrāvakas who do not have such an object The concentration in which the entire doctrine of the Greater Vehicle shines brilliantly is the Mahāyānāloka Indeed the propensity seeds of the defiled dharmas that reside in the storeconsciousness are coarse and the counteracting path able to eradicate them is subtle Superiority of capability because while abiding in the bliss of dhyāna and without falling away from bliss he takes birth according to his choice wherever he sees usefulness for beings  for his samādhi lends itself to action Superiority in products because the power of concentration produces all types of unobstructed superknowledges in all the universes an infinite number of great chiliocosms to shake He introduces all rūpa into his body  in the presence of a large company that recognizes itself as having entered into his body He causes the creatures of all the realms to come go stop speak according to his will The Tathāgata surpasses the magical power of all the magicians He emits rays of light that pacify the sufferings of hell beings summon the Buddhas and bodhisattvas These ten achievements are i The achievement of vows  because he undertakes the vows of great enlightenment ii The achievement of not withdrawing  because he does not withdraw before the sufferings of transmigration iii The achievement of not turning his back  because he does not turn his back on the bad conduct of all beings v The achievement of being unstained because while living in the world he is unstained by human circumstances vi The achievement consisting of convinced adherence  because even without understanding it he adheres to the vast and profound doctrine of the Greater Vehicle vii The achievement consisting of penetrating  because it penetrates the nonexistence of self of the individual and of things viii The achievement consisting of understanding  because he understands the profound enigmatical words of the Tathāgatas ix The achievement of not quitting and not being defiled  because he does not abandon saṃsāra but is not defiled by it x The achievement of effort  because the Buddhas who are established in the removal of all the obstacles exert themselves until the end of saṃāra to spontaneously render service to all beings To render them service without considering their mistakes is very difficult ix Dwelling in saṃsāra without entering into error is very difficult Concerning the avabodhaduṣkaracaryā  what is the nature of these enignatic words of the Buddhas that the bodhisattva comes to understand A sūtra says the following i How does the bodhisattva practice generosity When without giving anything he practices generosity widely in the innumerable universes of the ten directions ii How does he love generosity iii How does he believe in generosity When he practices generosity without having faith in the Tathāgatas iv How does he activate generosity vi How is his generosity widespread vii How is his generosity pure When he produces avarice viii How does his generosity come to an end ix How is he master of generosity When he has no sovereignty over generosity x How is his generosity indestructible What is said here about generosity should be applied likewise to the other virtues from morality to wisdom i When without giving anything he practices generosity widely The bodhisattvas include all beings in their own selfnature because they have penetrated the identity of themselves and others When others practice generosity it is the bodhisattvas who are giving that is why it is said that they practice generosity when they give nothing All thoughts such as I am giving to the supplicant so that he will give to me later on or I am giving if he has already given to me are repugnant to the bodhisattva iii When he practices generosity without having faith in the Tathāgatas He does not have to make an effort in order to compel others and encourage them to give v When he never gives anything ie when he has always given everything The word utpa has as its obvious meaning to produce and as its hidden meaning to eradicate Not like the śrāvakas who have tranquility as the one vehicle  the bodhisattva does not stop at the end at nirvāṇawithoutresidue ix When he has no sovereignty over generosity ie when avarice and the other vices opposing generosity do not dominate him ii How is he the thief who takes what has not been given When without anyone having given him anything he appropriates to himself all beings iii How does he misbehave in love iv How is he a teller of lies When he calls a lie a lie v How is he a slanderer vi How does he have harmful speech When he is on the other bank of knowledge vii How does he have thoughtless speech viii How is he full of envy When he attains supreme dhyāna many times ix How is he full of wickedness x How is he full of wrong views O monks I am a murderer etc If this hidden meaning is adopted the answer is in accordance  whereas if one keeps to the obvious meaning it is not in accordance when he is on the other shore of knowledge The profound attributes of the Buddha are spoken of What are they i The eternal dharmas are attributes of the Buddha because the dharmakāya of the Buddha is eternal ii The dharmas of abandonment are attributes of the Buddha because the Buddha has cut all the obstacles iii The dharmas of arisng are attributes of the Buddha because the apparitional body of the Buddha takes birth iv The dharmas of acquisition are attributes of the Buddha because the  behaviors of beings and their antidotes are acquired by the Buddha v The dharmas connected with lust are attributes of the Buddha because the Buddha recognizes his fundamental equality in respect to lustful beings vi viii For the same reason the dharmas connected with hatred are attributes of the Buddha the dharmas connected with ignorance are attributes of the Buddha and the dharmas of ordinary people are attributes of the Buddha ix The dharmas free of stains are attributes of the Buddha because the true nature fully realized by the Buddha is not stained by any obstacle x The dharmas free of stains are attributes of the Buddha because while dwelling in the world he is not soiled by any human situation That is why the dharmas of the Buddha are profound Bh b bh ba U ab u ba It is a matter here of another sūtra saying that the eternal dharmas are the attributes of Buddha and so on up to the dharmas free of dirtiness are the attributes of the Buddha There is a hidden meaning which the author is going to explain i Because the dharmakāya of the Buddha is eternal The dharmakāya has the transformation of the support Finally the development of the virtues  the ripening of beings  the purification of the buddhafields and the production of the attributes of the Buddha should be considered as so many special actions belonging to the bodhisattvas samādhis They can also purify the buddhafields by transforming them into gold and other precious substances according to their wishes On knowledge in regard to the combined object see notes to chap CHAPTER VIII THE OBSERVANCE OF EXCELLENT WISDOM  The superiority of excellent mind has been explained in Chapter VII How should the superiority of excellent wisdom be conceived Nonconceptual knowledge should be considered to be the superiority of excellent wisdom The selfnature of nonconceptual knowledge  its basis  its cause  its object  its aspect  refutation of objections raised against it Its role of maintenace  its associates  its retribution  its necessary consequence  its deliverance  its end  the advantages of preparatory  nonconceptual and subsequent knowledge the types of nonconceptual knowledge examples illustrating nonconceptual and subsequent knowledge the effortless accomplishment of its role  its profundity Here the wisdom of investigation is the first excellent wisdom introspective wisdom is the second excellent wisdom and sustaining wisdom is the third excellent wisdom But this knowledge comprises a cause and a result speculative wisdom is the cause of this knowledge subsequent knowledge is the result of this knowledge In the bodhisattva the selfnature of nonconceptual knowledge avoids five characteristics It is not a description of reality Bh ca bh ba U c u ba Dealing with the selfnature of this knowledge the author says that it avoids five characteristics i If absence of thinking were nonconceptual knowledge sleep and drunkenness where one does not think would be nonconceptual knowledge ii If the level surpassing investigation and analysis were nonconceptual knowledge all ordinary people  the śrāvakas etc in levels above the second dhyāna would possess nonconceptual knowledge when in fact they do not have this nonconceptual knowledge iii If cessation of identification and sensation were nonconceptual knowledge the essential characteristic of this knowledge ie its mental factor nature which makes it a knowledge would be difficult to establish in the unconscious state  etc In fact without a mind that supports them there are no mental factors iv If matter were nonconceptual knowledge there would be no nonconceptual knowledge because it would be like a substance derived from the four great elements In the bodhisattva the support of nonconceptual knowledge is neither mind nor nonmind because it does not think and is not the result of thought Bh ab bh ab U ca u ab The selfnature of this knowledge functions by depending on something This nonconceptual knowledge someone may say depends on a mind or on a nonmind If one says that it depends on a mind then it could think  and in its quality of mind functioning in dependence on a mind it would not be nonconceptual On the other hand if it depends on a nonmind it is not a knowledge In order to avoid these two kinds of mistakes the author gives the stanza The support of this knowledge is not a mind because this knowledge does not think Because it does not think and is not the result of a thought In the bodhisattva the cause of nonconceptual knowledge is the hearingpropensity coming from speech and correct thinking There follows a stanza on the cause of this knowledge  For the bodhisattva the object of nonconceptual knowledge is the inexpressible nature of things  the true nonsubstantial nature Bh b bh b U a u b What is the object of this knowledge The following stanza explains What is this inexpressibility The imaginary  the individual and the dharmas are without selfnature this is what is called selfnonexistence And the essence consisting of this selfnonexistence is called the true nature  This knowledge prior to having an object  the following stanza deals with the object of knowledge For the bodhisattva the aspect of nonconceptual knowledge is the absence of marks that manifest in its object That is to say this knowledge is the same as the true nature and this identity marks it with the characteristic of absence of marks which is no different from tathatā and constitutes the very aspect of nonconceptual Thus when the eye grasps a color  it takes on a blue mark  and this blue mark is no different from the color grasped by the eye a If all dharmas are inexpressible  what is conceived Meaning having the connection of phonemes as selfnature is conceptual and nothing else That is to say meaning  which has the joining of phonemes as selfnature is conceived and nothing other than that this is why the author says When the phonemes are mutually joined there is a meaning of connection Thus the two phonemes cha kṣus when they are not separated  express the meaning eye b Why are we sure that all dharmas are inexpressible Without a designation knowledge on the thing designated does not operate If one does not know the designation  the notion of the thing designated is not produced If truly there were an object of which one could speak it would be that a knowledge similar to language would arise on this object independently of the name designating it Since the designation and the thing designated are of different natures  their selfnature differs Everything is inexpressible the logical consequence is that every designation and everything is inexpressible Of what is nonconceptual knowledge the support By the knowledge acquired subsequent to the insight  the bodhisattva practices are obtained these practices rest on nonconceptual knowledge Because it tends to develop them because it makes these bodhisattva practices increase  nonconceptual knowledge is the support of these practices The practices acquired subsequently these are the various bodhisattva practices acquired in the course of the knowledge subsequent to insight For the bodhisattva the auxiliaries to nonconceptual knowledge are the two paths that have as their nature the first five virtues The two paths are the path of accumulation and the path of support The path of accumulation consists of the virtues of generosity  morality  patience and zeal the path of support is the virtue of meditation For the bodhisattva the retribution of nonconceptual knowlege takes place in the two Buddha assemblies  in view of preparation and acquisition In the two Buddhaassenblies  namely in the assembly of the enjoyment body and in the assembly of the apparitional body What is the outcome of nonconceptual knowledge For the bodhisattva the outcome of nonconceptual knowledge is its progression in the course of successive existences in the course of successive existences in the great assemblies of the two bodies of the Buddha which have been spoken of above the continuous progression of the nonconceptual knowledge practiced during these existences constitutes its fruit of outcome What is the deliverance of nonconceptual knowledge For the bodhisattva the outcome etc That which goes to the end is called deliverance it is the movement towards the great nirvāṇa Nonconceptual knowledge as it is acquired and perfected first this knowledge is gained and this is is what is called acquired then after countless hundreds of thousands of great periods  this knowledge is perfected This outcome is to be sought in the ten levels starting from the first bhūmi up to the tenth bhūmi in order In the first bhūmi this knowledge is acquired only following that it is perfected over a long time This is why bodhisattvas spend incalculable periods to attain nirvāṇa After this time they finally come to the end For the bodhisattva the outcome of nonconceptual knowledge is the attainment of the three bodies in the pure state and the attaining of the excellent masteries Bh b bh ab U a u a The attainment of the three bodies in the pure state ie the attainment of the three pure bodies of the tathāgata It is a question of pure body because on the first bhūmi the three bodies are obtained but it is not until the tenth bhūmi that they are pure this nonconceptual knowledge has as its outcome not only the attainment of the three bodies in the pure state but also the attainment of the ten kinds of mastery selfnature  of which we will learn more later What are the benefits of nonconceptual knowledge First there are three types of nonconceptual knowledge namely preparatory nonconceptual knowledge  fundamental and subsequent nonconceptualknowledge nonconceptualknowledge Initially the bodhisattva listens to others talk about absence of concept Next unable himself to see this absence of concept he accords it his adherence This preparatory nonconceptual knowledge has the advantage of immaculateness In order to show that which does not stain it the author says by any kind of heavy wrongdoing In order to show the cause by means of which it is unstained he says because of faith alone and adherence because by delighting in faith in the absence of concept he accords it his adherence That is why this knowledge can counteract any kind of bad destiny  and this explains that wrongdoings do not soil it c Finally the subsequent nonconceptual knowledge has the benefit of immaculateness What is the example To show the different aspects of these three the author proposes the following examples Just as a mute person while trying to understand an object cannot understand it and cannot speak about it so the preparatory nonconceptual knowledge  while trying to realize the tathathā can neither realize it nor speak about it Just as a mute person who has understood the object cannot speak about it so the fundamental nonconceptual knowledge  which has realized the tathatā avoids all vain proliferation Just as a nonmute person who has understood the object sets about to speak about it so the subsequent nonconceptual knowledge  which has understood the tathatā and has realized its object  sets out to teach it b The stanza about the idiot is explained in the same way c Like the first five consciousnesses trying to understand an object These two stanzas show the difference between the fundamental and the subsequent knowledge The examples of the eyes closed and the eyes open of space and forms show that these two knowledges are respectively without concepts and furnished with concepts  identical and nonidentical aghaṭṭitebhyas tūryebhyo yathā syāc śabdhasaṃbhavaḥ tathā jine vinābhogaṃ deśanāyāḥ samudbhavaḥ yathā maṇer vinā yatnaṃ svaprabhāvanidarśanam buddheṣv api vinābhogaṃ tathā kṛtyanidarśanam Let us accept that this nonconceptual knowledge realizes the state of buddhahood but if it is free of effort and free of thought  how could it accomplish its activity of working for the benefit and happiness of beings A cintāmaṇi  although without concepts  is able to fulfill the rle desired by the beings who possess it A celestial musical instrument  even without being struck  can produce all kinds of sounds according to the aspirations of those close by a Not concerning either here or elsewhere it is neither nonknowledge nor knowledge Not being different from its object  this knowledge is nonconcpt What are the errors in these hypotheses If it pertains to concepts its nature of noonconceptual knowledge is not explained if it pertains to another object since this other object does not exist in any way what would it then have as object Bearing upon neither here nor elsewhere on another object because then it would have as object the Tathāgata the dharmatā of dependent and imagined dharmas But one can state neither identity nor differernce between these dharmas and their dharmatā Furthermore the fundamental nonconceptual knowledge either is or is not a knowledge What are the faults in these hypotheses If it is a knowledge then as knowledge is it without concepts If it is not a knowledge why is it called nonconceptual knowledge This shows that the fundamental nonconceptual knowledge is not really a knowledge because it does not arise like preparatory conceptual knowledge Neither is it a nonknowledge because it derives its birth from this preparatory conceptual knowledge Because here ie in itself concepts do not exist it is called nonknowledge but because it functions on the dharmatā of concepts and not elsewhere it is a knowledge In this explanation the first and last members of the phrase are connected to each other It is not like the preparatory nonconceptual knowledge which although functioning with objects and subjects of consciousness  is called nonconceptual b In another sūtra the Bhagavat has said that all dharmas are without concept To explain this absence of concept the author follows with stanza b But if all dharmas are originally without concept because the thing conceived does not exist why do not beings attain deliverance from the very beginning But when the knowledge of the true nature bearing on the absence of concept of the dharmas arises in them when they realize the absence of concepts of dharmas then they will attain deliverance But if this knowledge does not arise they will not attain delverance ii Fundamental nonconceptual knowledge is of three types according to whether it is intuition of satiation  nonerror  or nonproliferation iii Subsequent intuitive knowledge is of five kinds according to whether it is analysis of penetration  memory  preaching  combined  or success from the power of the lineage when the lineage is the cause of its arising from the projecting power of previous births when practice carried out in the course of previous births is the cause of its arising from the power of present practice when the power of individual activity in the course of the present existence is the cause of its arising Thus the bodhisattvas who dwell in the realm of ordinary beings and who have reached the end of hearing  reflecting and understanding experience satiation say to themselves The hearing and reflecting of fools extend only so far It is in this sense that the nonconceptual knowledge of satiety is spoken of There is yet another meaning because we know that the world also has an nonconceptual knowledge of satiety Thus beings who have reached the peak of existence and who see nirvāṇa experience satiety for the rest and say to themselves There is no further sphere to be sought beyond this nirvāṇa This is what is called satiation We know that by penetrating the true nature  they obtain the knowledge free of the four errors that consists of taking the transitory as eternal etc Indeed the bodhisattvas who have attained enlightenment of all dharmas avoid any vain proliferation The true nature attested by their knowledge transcends the ways of discourse and surpasses the objects of worldly knowledge As it cannot be expressed in words no worldly knowledge can understand it This is to preach to others what one has penetrated Analysis of combination The knowledge of the combined object sees that all dharmas have one and the same nature and leads towards the transformation of support When this support has been transformed this knowledge is reproduced Analysis of success By means of this analysis earth etc is transformed into gold In order to obtain this success this analysis is made that is why the analysis of success is spoken of Some say that it is because of this analysis that one obtains success i Hungry ghosts  animals  humans and gods have different notions of the same object according to their respective capabilities Therefore it is concluded that objects do not exist ii Thus in the past  etc in dream and in the reflection in a mirror  there is no object of consciousness and yet perception takes place iii If the object were truly an object there would be no nonconceptual knowledge if that were the case the acquisition of buddhahood would be impossible iv For bodhisattvas possessing the masteries and also for ecstatics  earth etc is transformed into any substance they wish by the power of convinced adhesion vi When nonconceptual knowledge is functioning  not a single object appears Thus we know that there is no object and the object being absent there is no concept i Hungry ghosts animals humans and gods etc There where humans see water  hungry ghosts see hills of dry earth There where humans see dung  animals see pure food There where humans see an impure substance  animals see a pure food There where humans see pure food gods see a rotten impure substance But since it is impossible that opposite things can be in the same place we know that the imaginary object does not exist iii If the perceived object were truly an object there would be no nonconceptual knowledge because there would be concepts if the intuitive knowledge were truly lacking it would be impossible to attain Buddhahood and this would be a very serious error For the bodhisattvas in possession of the masteries for the bodhisattvas who have attained the great masteries by the power of convinced adhesion ie by the power of aspiration  earth is transformed into whatever substance they wish they change earth into gold  etc v For bodhisattvas versed in analysis endowed with samādhi There is no difference between the virtue of wisdom and nonconceptual knowledge ie they are identical because nonconceptual knowledge is the virtue of wisdom The bodhisattva who abides in the virtue of wisdom by means of nonabiding ensures the fulfillment of the development of the other virtues Why is that i He avoids abiding in the belief in the self of the heretics Heretics dwell in the belief in self they say Since the bodhisattva avoids such a dwelling the method of nonabiding is spoken of A stanza says iii He avoids abiding in the two extremes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa Worldly people dwell in the extreme of saṃsāra because they have the belief in a self Buddhists dwell in the extreme of nirvāṇa because they have cut through the afflictions It is not the same for the bodhisattva that is why it is said that by avoiding the two extremes  he observes the method of nonabiding iv He avoids the abiding which consists of being content with cutting just the obstacle of the afflictions The śrāvakas believe that the power of meditation should be aimed only at cutting the obstacle of the afflictions and that then they have done all there is to be done v He avoids abiding in the nirvāṇawithoutresidue element with disregard for the interest of beings The bodhisattva avoids such a dwelling What is the difference between the two lnowledges that of the śrāvakas and that of the bodhisattvas i It is distinguised by the absence of concepts because it does not conceptualize the dharmas viz aggregates  etc ii It is distinguished by its nonmediocrity because by fully understanding reality  by penetrating all the aspects of the knowable and by referring to all beings  it is not mediocre iii It is distinguished by its nonabidingness  because it is fixed in nonabiding nirvāna iv It is distinguished by its infinitude  because it does not become extinguished in the nirvāṇawithoutresidue element v It is distinguished by its supremacy because above it there is no other vehicle superior to it On the other hand for the bodhisattva the knowledge of nonerror on all objects to be known must arise in order that it may be said that they have attained their goal and that they have done what had to be done On the other hand the bodhisattva by considering all beings seeks perfect enlightenment This shows the great difference between the nirvāṇa of the śrāvakas and that of the bodhisattvas It is also by this difference that the knowledge of the bodhisattva is distinguished v Niruttaraviśeṣa Above the vehicle of the śrāvaka there is the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha and above that is the Greater Vehicle The vehicle of the bodhisattva is the vehicle of the Buddhas and there is none higher this is a matter of the five types of differences already spoken of Worldly and supraworldly perfections the dhyānas and the formless concentrations are called worldly perfections the nirvāṇa acquired by the śrāvaka etc is called supraworldly perfection Since this knowledge transcends them it is put at the head of the list If the bodhisattvas are thus endowed with the qualities and perfections of excellent morality  excellent mind  and excellent wisdom  if they have attained sovereignty over all riches  why is it that there are beings deprived of resources Because they see some beings feel disgust for the riches Because they see some beings to whom riches have been granted set up obstacles to the arising of wholesome dharmas The bodhisattvas see certain beings who experience no disgust for the riches but who once in possession of abundant riches become careless and produce no wholesome dharmas Then the bodhisattvas have this thought It would be better for these beings actually to be poor for a short time rather than to be poor for a long time in future existences Because they see some beings to whom riches have been granted accumulate unwholesome dharmas The bodhisattvas see that some beings to whom opulent wealth has been given give themselves up to carelessness and accumulate all sorts of unwholesome dharmas That is why they do not give the riches which they have at their disposal Because they see some beings to whom wealth has been given make trouble for countless other beings That is why they do not give them the riches they have at their disposal They think It would be better that a person undergoes the suffering of poverty rather than trouble many other beings Seeing the repugnance obstacle orientation etc tathatālambanaṃ jñānam The superiority of excellent wisdom has been explained in chapter VIII how should one conceive of the superiority of the cessation that is the fruition of the three śikṣās Cessation is the nonabidingnirvāṇa of the bodhisattva it has as nature this twofold tranformation of support which consists of rejecting the defilements and not abandoning transmigration i First transmigration is the defiled portion of the dependent nature ii Nirvāṇa is the pure portion of the dependent nature iii The two aspects of the support is the dependent nature as it is included in both parts at the same time iv The transformation of the support consists of the expulsion of the defiled portion of the dependent nature when its antidote arises and it is reduced to its pure portion What are saṃsāra nirvāṇa the basis and its transformation this is the imaginary part composed of a mind and mental factors disturbed by afflictions and the uninterruptedness of the misery of birth and death ii Nirvāṇa is the purity part of the dependent nature It is the absolute part involving the transformation or complete suppression of the imaginary iii The support with two aspects is the dependent nature insofar as it is included in both portions at the same time the tranformation of penetration It is the transformation of the bodhisattvas who have entered onto the bhūmis Actually the appearance and disappearance of the real and the unreal takes place up to and including the sixth bhūmi Actually there is the disappearance of all concepts and appearance of the real up to and including the tenth bhūmi Actually they penetrate only the nonexistence of self of the individual they turn their back completely on transmigration and completely abandon this transmigration This is the transformation of the bodhisattvas Actually they penetrate further the nonexistence of self of dharmas and considering saṃsāra as peace  they cut through the defilements but do not abandon saṃsāra What disadvantagess do the bodhisattvas get from the lesser transformation By scorning the interest of others  they go against their quality of bodhisattva and share in the deliverance of the practitioners of the Lesser Vehicle What benefits do the bodhisattvas derive from the extensive transformation Having transformed their own basis they obtain sovereignty over all the dharmas of saṃsāra Appearing in all the destinies in the bodies of all kinds of beings  they exercise their skill in various disciplinary means in order to discipline and establish beings who are to be converted into happiness and the three vehicles these are the benefits of this transformation when one abides in the level where adherence is practiced the power of the hearingpropensity is stabilized this is how this transformation of support is obtained And by the presence of shame in this state  when the afflictions are active  one is completely ashamed and then the afflictions are only slightly or not at all active this transformation extends up to the sixth bhūmi Sometimes it is the cause for the appearance of the real sometimes when emerging from concentration it is the cause for the appearance of the unreal It is that of the bodhisattvas freed from the obstacles They are free of the obstacles because they have no further obstacle There is appearance of the very pure reality for the same reason with this transformation as support  they gain mastery over things and according to their aspirations  they procure the benefit and happiness of beings Penetrating the two nonexistences of a self  they cut the defilements but seeing peace in saṃsāra they do not abandon it Since the bodhisattvas have obtained mastery in all the destinies with the body appropriate to these destinies and their inhabitants By means of their skill in various disciplinary means  they confirm those beings into the discipline They establish them in happiness and in the three vehicles By happiness the fortunate worldly existences should be understood akhyānakhyānatā jñeyā asadarthasadarthayoḥ āśrayasya parāvṛttir mokṣo sau kāmacārataḥ The disappearance and appearance of the false and the real is the transformation of the basis deliverance for one acts as one wishes When the knowledge that knows the sameness of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa has been produced then saṃsāra becomes nirvāṇa As a result one does not give up or hold onto saṃsāra one does not attain or miss nirvāṇa In order ro explain the transformation of the basis  the author gives several stanzas By the power of ignorance everything that is not real appears in its entirety As a result the appearance and disappearance of the real and the false etc That is to say the disappearance of the false and the appearance of the real are called transformation of the support this transformation of the basis is deliverance independence one acts as one wishes in the world  since by deliverance is meant a sovereignty in action in accordance with desires and not the fact of giving up the life of the body as if one were going to be beheaded Since saṃsāra is nirvāṇa one does not abandon it but since the notion of saṃsāra no longer applies to saṃsāra one does not keep saṃsāra nirvāṇaṃ yatra na pratiṣṭhīyate apratiṣṭhito nirvāṇe animittam iti vikalpasyāpravṛttir anutpādo nirvāṇam iti vadāmi saṃsāranirvāṇasamatā p The superiority of the cessation that is the result of the three śikṣās has been explained in Chapter IX how should one conceive the superiority of the knowledge concerning this result The three bodies of the Buddha the essential body  the body of enjoyment and the apparitional body consitute the superiority of the knowledge of this result i First the essential body is the dharmakāya of the Tathāgata because it is the basis of sovereignty over all the dharmas ii The body of enjoyment is based on the dharmakāya and is characterized by all the types of assemblies of the Buddha because it experiences the very pure buddhafields and the enjoyment of the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle Because it is the basis of sovereignty over all dharmas A knowledge arises in the great bodhisattvas who have entered into the great bhūmis which manifests the very pure buddhafields and the enjoyment of the doctrine of the Great Vehicle What is the characteristic of the dharmakāya of the Buddhas i The transformation of the basis Having destroyed all the obstacles and the dependent nature in its defiled portion  it is free of all obstacles it secures mastery of all the dharmas  and it is transformed into the purity portion of the dependent nature ii Its nature is that of being constituted of white dharmas because it has attained the ten masteries by means of the fulfillment of the six virtues Mastery of life  mastery of mind and mastery of provisions have been acquired by means of fulfillment of the virtue of generosity Mastery of action and mastery of birth have been acquired by the fulfillment of the virtue of morality Mastery of miraculous powers pertaining to the five superknowledges has been acquired by fulfillment of the virtue of dhyāna Mastery of knowledge and mastery of Dharma have been acquired by fulfillment of the virtue of wisdom iii It is nondual It has the nature of nonduality of existence and nonexistence in other words it is neither existent nor nonexistent as on the one hand all dharmas are nonexistent and on the other hand emptiness exists really in other words it is neither conditioned nor unconditioned as on the one hand it is not fabricated by action or by afflictions and on the other hand it has the sovereign power of appearing in the aspect of the conditioned in other words it is neither many nor one because on the one hand the basis of all the Buddhas does not consist of divisions and on the other hand numberless mental series reach enlightenment Since belief in a self does not apply to the basie there are no different supports in the base but as various entries into the possession of this support have taken place in the past and are referred to  it is asserted that there are different supports iv It is eternal in nature  for it has purification of the true nature as nature it is the result of an earlier vow  and its activity is never exhausted v It is inconceivable in nature  for this purification of the true nature is known by introspection  has no equal in the world and is not an object accessible to speculation Having destroyed all the obstacles and the defiled portion of the dependent nature having rejected by means of revolution  the defiled part of the dependent nature along with its pseudoobjects and subjects of consciousness and having prevented them from rearising it has acquired liberation from all the obstacles by means of transformation It assures sovereignty over all the dharmas and is transformed into the puure part dependent naturet On the other hand the transformation of the basis acquired by the bodhisattva thanks to the complete development of the six virtues  has as its nature the ten masteries that are the very nature of the white dharmas Mastery of life consists of abandoning life at will Mastery of mind consists of not being defiled while in the midst of saṃsāra Mastery of birth consists of being able to take birth at will in any destiny one wishes it is by previously having joyfully cultivated concentration and adjusting oneself to the interest of beings by entering into all kinds of dhyānas and concentrations that one now attains this mastery of miraculous powers derived from concentration It does not have a nature of existence because all dharmas are imaginary and nonexistent neither does it have a nature of nonexistence  because the selfnature composed of emptiness exists Because it is not conditioned by action and afflictions  it does not have the nature of the conditioned Because it has acquired the mastery of appearing as conditioned dharmas and because repeatedly at many times  it appears as conditioned it does not have the nature of the unconditioned Since innumerable persons attain it each in turn it does not have the nature of uniqueness This absence of plurality and of singleness is called the nature of nonduality If that is so why are there several Buddhas Since various entrances into the possession of this basis by the bodhisattvas are referred to it is asserted that there are different Buddhas If there were only one Buddha reaching enlightenment while the others do not the accumulations accumulated by these others would be vain and sterile Embracing all beings to be converted separately the Tathāgatas assure their welfare and happiness  ie they establish them in the three vehicles as appropriate But if there were but one Buddha they could not assure these beings or introduce them into the buddhavehicles  for there is not a second Buddha Thus the buddha activity carried out by these Tathāgatas would never succeed In view of nonbeginning  there is not just one single Buddha It has the purification of the true nature as nature this shows that the true nature is eternal and immutable But the Buddha has acquired the dharmakāya as selfnature That is why it is eternal It is the result of an earlier vow But various categories of beings do not reach nirvāṇa and thus the result projected by this vow is never interrupted That is why it is eternal How is this dharmakāya attained for the first time by contact iv By means of the diamondlike samādhi which serves to break the subtle obstacles that are so difficult to break Immediately after this samādhi one is freed of all the obstacles The diamondlike samādhi that serves to break subtle obstacles that are so difficult to break this gives the reason why this concentration is like a diamond By how many masteries does the dharmakāya acquire sovereignty ii By the transformation of the sensation aggregate  it acquires sovereignty over the blissful abodes  irreproachable  immense and vast iii By the transformation of the perception aggregate  it acquires the sovereign power of explaining every collection of words  collection of phrases and collection of phonemes iv By the transformation of the formations aggregate  it acquires sovereignty over creation  transformation  the reunion of assemblies and accumulation of white dharmas v By the transformation of the consciousness aggregate  it acquires sovereignty over the mirrorlike knowledge  the knowledge of sameness  the knowledge of contemplation and the knowledge of the accomplishment of what had to be done By transformation of the five aggregates  five sovereignties are acquired i By means of transformation of the form aggregate it acquires the sovereign power of manifesting the buddhafields for in accordance with the wishes of beings it manifests buddhafields in gold  silver  etc it acquires the sovereign power of manifesting its own body for in accordnce with the aspirations it manifests in all kinds of great assemblies in conformity with the individual capacities of the beings who are to be disciplined it acquires the sovereign power of manifesting the major marks and minor marks for according to wishes  it manifests all the major marks and minor marks it acquires the twofold sovereign power of manifesting infinite sounds and invisible marks of the head  for the sounds of the Buddha have an infinite range  and its cranial marks are invisible ii By means of the transformation of the sensation aggregate it acquires sovereignty over the blissful abodes irreproachable immense and vast With such an accumulation as cause by means of the transformation it acquires this special power thanks to which it possesses mastery over the collections of words etc according to wishes iv By means of the formations aggregate it acquires sovereignty over creation transformation reunion of assemblies and accumulation of white dharmas Sovereignty over creation consists of creating according to wishes Sovereignty over transformation consists of transforming things according to wishes earth into gold etc Sovereignty over reunion of assemblies consists of reuniting great assemblies of gods  etc according to aspirations Sovereignty over accumulation of white dharmas brings it about that the pure dharmas may be present according to aspirations even though the objects that are known may not be present  it cannot forget them it is not limited in time and space This cognition having as its object the sameness of all beings is acquired at the first moment of full understanding of the truths  ie at the start of the path of seeing or darśanamārga cf Of how many things is the dharmakāya the basis In brief it is the support of three things i It is the support of the various abodes of Buddha Here are some stanzas Since the Buddhas have attained their own element  they have gained the fivefold satisfaction Those who have not attained this element are deprived of satisfaction That is why those who desire this satisfaction must acquire this element The power and accomplishment of duty  the flavor of the texts  the perfection of theses and the perfection of the qualities are immense Seeing these ever nonperishable benefits  the Buddhas gain supreme irreproachable satisfaction ii It is the support of the various bodies of enjoyment  for it assures the maturing of the bodhisattvas iii It is the support of the various apparitional bodies  for it assures the maturation mainly of the śrāvakas The author asks of how many dharmas is the dharmakāya the basis i It is the support of the various buddha abodes the dharmakāya attained by the Tathāgata serves as basis for all kinds of abodes  divyavihāra āryavihāra and brāhmavihāra the Tathāgatas who have acquired their own fundamental element abide in joy in the five satisfactions but the śrāvakas etc who go to nirvāṇa as to a beheading  are deprived of this higher satisfaction The perfecting of qualities that is the perfection of qualities such as the superknowledges  etc This is why their satisfaction is supreme and irreproachable supreme because the obstacle of the defilements and the obstacle to knowledge along with their traces have been completely cut off the bodies of enjoyment exist with the dharmakāya as ruling condition It ensures the maturation of the śrāvakas mainly The author says mainly in order to include the bodhisattvas of the level where convinced adherence is practiced By how many Buddha attributes is the dharmakāya constituted In brief it conists of six kinds of attributes i The attribute of purity  for it is by transforming the storeconsciousness that the dharmakāya is obtained ii The attribute of retribution  for it is by transforming the material organs that the knowledge of retribution is obtained iii The attribute of abode  for it is by transforming the abodes such as the life of pleasure etc that the abode of immense knowledge is obtained iv The attribute of sovereignty  for it is by transforming the various profitable actions that the sovereignty consisting of abhijñā unimpeded in all the universes is obtained v The attribute of conduct  for the sovereignty consisting of a knowledge that charms the minds of all beings is obtained by transforming conduct ie that which is seen heard felt understood vi By the attribute of expelling  for the knowledge that drives away the torments and faults of all beings is obtained by transforming all the torments and faults The dharmakāya consists of these six Buddha attributes Bh ca bh missing U ca The Buddha attribute of purity constitutes the selfnature of the dharmakāya because the dharmakāya is pure by nature What purifies it what transforms it so that it is pure The Buddha attribute of retribution consitutes the selfnature of the dharmakāya By transforming the material organs ie the organs endowed with matter such as the eye etc the knowledge of retribution is acquired By the example of the material organs of retribution formerly obtained the real knowledge actually obtained is also metaphorically called of retribution The Buddha attribute of conduct constitutes the selfnature of the dharmakāya By transforming worldly conduct  sovereignty over what is seen heard felt understood is acquired By means of that the wonderful knowledge which charms the minds of all beings is acquired The torments etc eg sadness  suffering inflicted by a kings court  etc in the world They can be pacified by friends or by wealth In the same way here the wonderful knowledge that pacifies all torments and all the faults of all beings is acquired by transformoing these torments Since their bases  their intentions and their actions are identical it may be said that the dharmakāyas are identical But since their bases are different the saṃbhogakāyas are different for they exist in numberless supports It is the same for the apparitional bodies as for the bodies of enjoyment Since in numberless different individuals the bodhisattvas become Buddhas the dharmakāyas are not different as has been explained at length above With how many qualities is the dharmakāya associated It is associated with the very pure qualities which are the four immeasurables  the eight

qualities powers  fearlessnesses  etc which are inexhaustible and unequalled On the other hand he is completely invisible to gods and men  for the dharmakāya of the Buddhas is not seen by men gods etc The dharmakāya of the Buddhas is profound  very profound How should this profundity be conceived Here are the verses i The Buddha has nonarising as arising  nondwelling as dwelling all his actions are done without effort he has the fourth nutriment as food ii The Buddhas are one but innumerable their activity is immeasurable  but one they have a changeable and unchangeable action for the Buddhas are endowed with three bodies Knowing attachment and unattachment  he has penetrated the nature of attachment v The Buddha has transcended the aggregates  but dwells in the aggregates The latter are neither identical to the first ones nor different from them Although not abandoning them the Buddhas are completely pacified vi The actions of the Buddhas are homogeneous  they are like the waters of the ocean The Buddhas do not worry themselves about serving beings  saying I have done that I am doing that or I will do that vii It is the fault of beings if the Buddha does not appear like the moon which does not appear in a broken pot viii Sometimes the Buddha manifests enlightenment  sometimes he is nirvanized it is like fire He is never nonexistent for the body of the Tathāgata is eternal ix With regard to ordinary dharmas  with regard to human destinies and the bad destinies  with regard to nonreligious dharmas  the Buddha has a higher essence and a higher abode Although they appear everywhere they are not perceived by the six senses xi Among the Buddhas the defilements have been corrected but not cut off like a poison corrected by a magical spell It is by means of the afflictions that they attain the destruction of the afflictions and attain the omniscience of a Buddha kleśo bodhyaṅga āpanno mahopāyaprayoginaḥ saṃsāro py upaśantyātmā tato cintyas tarthāgataḥ In the Buddhas endowed with great means the defilements become auxiliaries of enlightenment and saṃsāra is identical with nirvāṇa These depths are twelve in number depth of arising establishment activity and subsistence depth of taking possession of number and of activity depth of enlightenment depth of detachment depth of elimination of the aggregates depth of the ripening activity used on beings depth of appearance depth of the manifestation and of nirvāṇa depth of abode depth of manifestation of their selfessence depth in the cutting off of defilements depth of inconceivability Bh aa bh aa U ba u ab The dharmakāya of the Buddhas is profound ie the dharmakāya of the Buddhas has a selfnature difficult to understand and the intellect of the sages of this world is unable to comprehend it This depth is described in brief in twelve stanzas i This stanza explains the profundity of arising  establishment  activity and subsistence The Buddha has nonarising as arising although they have no arising the Buddhas seem to have an arising That is the profundity of arising The nutriments are four in number the nutriments that sustain an impure person thus the person bound by all the bonds sustains his body by means of the four foods foodbythemouthfuls etc On the other hand the srotaāpannas in their quality as śaikṣas are also both pure and impure but are sustained by the four nutriments The nutriments that sustain a person who is exclusively pure thus the arhats etc are sustained by these four foods The nutriments that sustain an obviously pure person thus the Buddha Bhagavat evidently receives and uses the four foods foodbythemouthfuls etc but when the Bhagavat eats he does not in reality experience eating ii This stanza explains the profundity of taking possession  of number and of activity this explains the profundity of taking possession Because the dharmakāya of the Buddhas is undivided  the Buddhas are one but as innumerable people reach enlightenment the Buddhas are innumerable Although the Buddhas may be innumerable they have the same single activity Hence their profundity They have unstable and stable activity for the Buddhas are endowed with three bodies iii This stanza explains the profundity of the Enlightened One this shows that the true nature is existence and nonexistence and that the Buddhas are constituted by this true nature iv This stanza explains the profundity of detachment Since he has no attachment he is not unattached either Because sensual attachment is necessary for one to be able to be detached from it Since this attachment does not exist in him he is not unattached If he had not kept the traces of desire he would have entered into parinirvāṇa like the śrāvakas etc Knowing attachment and unattachment he has penetrated the nature of detachment Understanding that this imaginary sensual attachment has no nature of attachment he has understood the true nature of attachment v This stanza explains the profundity of elimination of the aggregates The Buddhas have gone beyond all the imaginary aggregates  the aggregate of form etc  for they understand completely that that which is imaginary does not exist It cannot be said that they are identical for the imaginary aggregates are afflicted and consequently are distinct from the aggregates of true nature which have been purified by not abandoning these aggregates of true nature the Buddhas have attained nirvāṇa par excellence vi This stanza explains the profundity of ripening action The actions of the Buddhas are homogeneous the activity of the Tathāgatas consists of actions dedicated to the welfare and happiness of beings thus the waters that flow into the reservoir of the ocean have one and the same flavor are mixed together and all maintain the wellbeing of the fish  etc vii This stanza explains the profundity of appearance The people of the world do not see the Buddha and yet it is said that the body of the Buddha is eternal If the body of the Buddha is eternal why cannot it be seen It is the fault of beings if he does not appear like the moon which does not appear in a broken jar water does not remain in a broken jar and since the water does not remain in the jar the moon cannot be reflected there the same among beings the water of tranquility being absent the moon of Buddha does not appear Actually the Buddha does not show himself in the world but he penetrates everywhere by his buddha activity  by preaching the doctrine sūtra geya etc Like the light of the sun that penetrates the entire world he fulfills his buddha activity and ripens beings yathodabhājane bhinne candrabimbaṃ na dṛiśyate tathā duṣṭeṣu buddhabimbaṃ na dṛiśyate viii This stanza explains the profundity in the manifestation of enlightenment and nirvāṇa Sometimes the Buddha manifests enlightenment sometimes he is nirvanized it is like fire Fire in this world blazes at some moments and is extinguished at other moments It is the same for the Buddha to those whose roots of good are not ripe  he manifests enlightenment in order to ripen these beings and lead them quickly to deliverance to those whose roots of good are ripe and who are already delivered  the Buddha manifests parinirvāṇa for he has nothing further to do In regard to ordinary dharmas the Buddha has a superior essence and abode in respect to bad dharmas  the Buddha has a superior essence and a superior abode His abode is superior for it is by abiding in the concentrations on emptiness  wishlessness and signlessness that he is supported on these bad dharmas and abides there In respect to human destinies and bad destinies he has superior essence and abode x This stanza explains the profundity of the very essence although their apparitional bodies take birth in all places the Buddhas are not perceived by the six senses because from the absolute point of view  the eternal dharmakāya does not present the possibility of arising and is not grasped by the damned or by similar beings xi This stanza explains the profundity of cutting off the afflictions In the Buddhas the afflictions are corrected but not cut off in the state of bodhisattva they have corrected the afflictions without cutting them off In the way that a poison is corrected by a spell corrected by a magicians spell  a poison keeps its nature but is unable to harm Thus it is thanks to the afflictions that they reach the destruction of the afflictions and attain omniscience By retaining the defilements in the state of traces  the Buddhas reach the definitive destruction of the defilements and attain the omniscience of a Buddha instead of entering into parinirvāṇa at once like the śrāvakas because omniscience is attained when the afflictions are destroyed xii This stanza explains the profundity of inconceivability The defilements become auxiliaries of enlightenment  and the suffering of saṃsāra is the same as nirvāṇa When the bodhisattvas recollect the dharmakāya of the Buddhas by how many recollections do they recollect it In brief  the bodhisattvas practice seven methods of recollecting the Buddhas i They recollect them by saying The Buddhas enjoy sovereignty over all dharmas  for in all the universes they have acquired unhindered superknowledges Here is a stanza The Buddas do not have sovereignty over the entire world of beings who are prevented by obstacles  deprived of the cause and bound by the twofold fate The body of the Tathāgatas is eternal  for the Tathāgatas are always without stain The Tathāgatas are absolutely blameless  for they are free of any obstacle of affliction and any obstacle to knowledge The Tathāgatas have no effort to make  for being free of effort any activity of the Buddha knows no interruption The Tathāgatas have great enjoyment  for the pure Buddha fields are a great enjoyment The Tathāgatas are free of stains  for they are not stained by any human situation while appearing in the world The Tathāgatas have great usefulness  for by manifesting enlightenment and nirvāṇa they ripen beings who are not yet ripe and deliver beings who are already ripe This passage explains how the bodhisattvas recollect the qualities of the dharmakāya of the Buddhas i The Buddhas enjoy sovereignty over all dharmas as a result of repeated practice  the Tathāgatas have attained sovereignty over all dharmas at their will  the fulfillment of all the qualities is manifested in them Objection If the Tathāgatas in all the immense and infinite universes enjoy the unhindered superknowledges  why do not all beings reach parinirvāṇa Because these beings are prevented by the obstacles and deprived of the cause of nirvāṇa Having shown that the Buddha enjoys sovereignty over all the dharmas in a general way then the author is going to explain in a more specific way why the Buddha does not have sovereignty over beings this is why he says the stanza They are deprived of the cause because they do not have the cause for nirvāṇa because they do not have the family ii The Tathāgatas body is eternal because he has the very pure tathatā as selfnature because it is unalterable and immovable v The Tathāgatas have great enjoyment for they enjoy the blooming of the qualities of the pure buddhafields which are the great enjoyment of the Dharma By manifesting enlightenment and nirvāṇa they render the greatest service to beings according to needs  they ripen them or deliver them These are the seven recollections of the Buddhas Two stanzas summarize these ideas The perfection consisting of wanting the welfare of many beings summarizes the seventh recollection In regard to all these Buddhas ie towards the perfections and the qualities of the Tathāgatas the wise ones ie the bodhisattvas should practice the recollections How should the pure buddhafield of the Buddhas be understood As it is said in the introduction to the Sūtra in One Hundred Thousand Lines of the bodhisattvapiṭaka viii It is the refuge of the great bodhisattvas The enjoyment of this pure buddhafield is absolutely pure  absolutely blissful  absolutely irreproachable and absolutely efficacious This passage concerns the pure buddhafields of the Buddha The buddhakṣetra of the Buddha is brilliant with light and has seven jewels as ornaments These seven jewels are gold  silver  lapislazuli  catseye  emerald including indranīla  mahānīla etc red pearl which is an extract of a red insect  chrysoberyl Or else the pure buddhakṣetra itself emits a great light which fills infinite universes for it penetrates infinite universes by its nature  These two phrases which concern the pure buddhakṣetra explain its perfection of color The pure buddhakṣetra arises having the supramundane roots of good and the supreme roots of good previously acquired as cause Mahoraga means the great boa constrictors This phrase explains the perfection of retinue of the buddhakṣetra In this pure buddhafield there are no torments caused by the afflictions This phrase explains the perfection of absence of fear of the buddhakṣetra Great intellect is the wisdom that comes from reflecting Great practice is the wisdom that comes from meditation Just as the circle of earth rests on the ciircle of wind  so this pure buddhafield is supported by a priceless kinglotus adorned with innumerable collections of qualities This lotus  being far superior to other flowers is called the priceless kinglotus The enjoyment of this pure buddhakṣetra is absolutely pure this kṣetra is without dirt because it is free of dung It is absolutely blissful for in it there is no sad feeling or intermediate feeling It is absolutely irreproachable for in it there is no bad element or ethically indeterminate feeling Moreover this fundamental element of the Buddhas carries out five activities at all times i It protects beings from torments  for by its view alone  it protects against the torments of blindness  deafness  madness  etc ii It protects against bad destinies  for it makes one abandon bad states and introduces one into good states iii It protects from bad methods  for by preventing heretics from seeking deliverance by bad means  it introduces them into the holy Dharma of the Tathāgata iv It protects from satkāya for it provides a path transcending the threefold world v It protects from the lower vehicles for it introduces bodhisattvas who are attached to other vehicles and śrāvakas etc who are of uncertain family into the practice of the Greater Vehicle All Buddhas have the same activity concerning these five activities of protection Here is a stanza Since the causes  supports  functions  intentions and modes of operation differ in the world differences in activity are assumed Since these diversifying forces are not present in them the masters of the world do not have different activities Bh bc bh ba U ca bb This fundamental element of the Buddhas is the dharmakāya By the sight of the Buddha the blind recover their sight the deaf their hearing and madmen thier reasoning etc In making one abandon the bad destinies it introduces one into the good states and this is what is called protection for if the cause no longer exists the result does not exist either It concerns the impure dharmas of the threefold world From the point of view of these five activities the Buddhas are all the same In order to explain this idea the author adds a stanza In the world  when the causes differ differences of activity are assumed thus the divine cause is a peculiar cause the human cause the demonic cause etc are peculiar causes This is why the activities are different Because they differ the activities differ Thus Devadatta and Yajñadatta who are different individuals have different activities Because the functions differ the activities are different Thus the farmer has a perculiar function the merchant has a peculiar function and so on In the world when intentions differ differences in activity are assumed Intention means the pursued aim In the world when the modes of operation differ different activities are assumed This is not the case for the Buddhas Since all their activity is carried out without effort  their activities are not different Since these diversifying forces do not exist among them the masters of the world do not have different activities since these five diversifying forces cause  etc do not exist among them there are no differences in the fivefold activities among the masters of the world If this dharmakāya of the Buddhas associated with such qualities and such perfections  does not occur among the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas with what intention did the Buddha proclaim a single vehicle ca nirmāṇāt paryantād ekayānatā By virtue of the identity of dharmas the nonexistence of self and deliverance by virtue of the difference in families acquisition of two convictions transformations and preeminence there is but one single vehicle To attract some he attracts the śrāvakas of indeterminate family and arranges it so that they enter into the Greater Vehicle Because he wants the śrāvakas of indeterminate family to reach parinirvāṇa by means of the Greater Vehicle To support others he maintains the bodhisattvas of indeterminate family and arranges it so that they remain in the Greater Vehicle Because he wants the bodhisattvas of indeterminate family not to leave the Greater Vehicle and not to use the vehicle of the śrāvakas to reach parinirvāṇa The Buddha proclaims a single vehicle for these reasons By Dharma is meant the true nature The vehicles the vehicle of the śrāvakas etc although they are different lead alike to tathatā and as this tathatā towards which they go is the same  the Buddha proclaims the single vehicle In these vehicles the nonexistence of self of the individual is the same As the Buddha said There is no difference between deliverance and deliverance For this reason the Buddha proclaims the single vehicle because a twofold conviction has been acquired The Buddhas acquire the conviction of being the same as all beings they say They are me and I am them Moreover in this assembly there are some bodhisattvas who have the same names as these śrāvakas who receive the same prediction Thus one and the same word of the Buddha bears a twofold advantage In fact the Buddha said O monks I remember that at one time at many hundreds of times I attained parinirvāṇa by means of the vehicle of the śrāvakas There is a hidden meaning in this phrase It is in order to convert beings of the śrāvaka category who are to be converted that the Buddha created bodies and manifested a parinirvāṇa in accord with the śrāvaka vehicle That is why the Buddha proclaims the single vehicle If the Buddhas have one and the same dharmakāya how do we know that there are many Buddhas Now the author will explain why it must be assumed that the Buddhas are one and many at the same time while having all the same dharmakāya They are one because their dharmakāya is the same The Buddhas have the same dharmakāya for selfnature and as this dharmakāya is unique there is but one Buddha Moreover there is but one Buddha because there are never two Buddhas appearing simultaneously in one and the same universe Therefore there is but one Buddha In the stanza it is shown that the Buddhas are one and many at the same time In the same world there are not two Buddhas this phrase shows that there is one single Buddha In the same universe  two Buddhas do not appear simultaneously The other phrases in the stanza show that the Buddhas are many Innumerable beings complete their accumulations at the same time innumerable bodhisattvas complete their accumulations at the same time If these bodhisattvas who have completed their accumulations of merit and wisdom at the same time did not become Buddha at the same time these accumulations would be vain and sterile But as numerous bodhisattvas finish the accumulations at the same time it must be acknowledged that there are many Buddhas at the same time But since innumerable beings end their accumulations at the same time and since the arising in succession of the Buddhas is impossible the plurality of the Buddhas is asserted How do we know that in the dharmakāya the Buddhas are neither absolutely parinirvanized nor absolutely nonparinirvanized Here is a stanza Because they are free of all obstacles  because their activity has not ended  the Buddhas are absolutely nirvanized and absolutely nonnirvanized at one and the same time b bh ba U c u ba Other adepts claim that the Buddhas are absolutely parinirvanized they are referring to the nirvāṇawithresidue element Those who reason correctly should say that the Buddhas are neither absolutely nirvanized nor absolutely nonnirvanized Having succeeded in freeing themseves from all the obstacles the Buddhas are absolutely nirvanized Bur since the activity which they practice has not come to a final end  the Buddhas are not absolutely nirvanized Why is not the body of enjoyment the essential body The enjoyment body has a material appearance whereas the essential body does not have a material appearance The essential body is unchanging in nature This is why the enjoyment body is not the essential body v The enjoyment body is always mixed with all kinds of assemblies of bodhisattvas of śrāvakas devas etc whereas the essential body is not mixed with assemblies of this kind This is why the enjoyment body is not the essential body In view of these six discordances the enjoyment body is not the essential body Why is the apparitional body not the essential body For eight reasons i It is impossible that the Bodhisattva who a long time ago  acquired imperishable concentrations  should take birth among the Tuṣitas and among humans iii It is impossible that the Bodhisattva who for a long time has known the doctrine badly proclaimed or well proclaimed should go to find the heretics iv It is impossible that the Bodhisattva who for a long time has known the right way of the three vehicles  should take up the wrong practice of asceticism v It is impossible that the Bodhisattva neglecting hundreds of thousands of Jambudvipas should be content with one single place to reach enlightenment and turn the wheel of Dharma vi If without manifesting enlightenment  the Bodhisattva used only apparitional bodies to accomplish the deeds of a Buddha everywhere else but in Tuṣita it must be that he would have attained enlightenment only among the Tuṣita gods vii Why not accept that the Buddhas are born simultaneously in all the Jambudvipas There is no scriptural text or argument that prevents that assumption viii Even if there are many simultaneous appearances of Buddhas that does not contradict the sūtra which affirms that there are not two Buddhas appearing at the same time in one and the same world because in speaking of one and the same world  the sūtra means one and the same universeoffourcontinents In the same way two cakravartin kings do not appear simultaneously in one and the same world Here is a stanza Subtle apparitional bodies of numerous Buddhas enter into wombs simultaneously and function to illustrate omnigeneric enlightenment i It is impossible that the Bodhisattva who has acquired undying concentrations for a long time and who never regresses  should take birth in the desire realm  among the Tuṣita gods and even more so  among humans for it is impossible that having cultivated for ages the undying concentrations he should obtain a result in the desire realm Thus it is proved that the apparitional body differs from the essential body iiiv It is impossible that the Bodhisattva who for a long time has the memory of his previous abodes For this reason the apparitional body is not the essential body vii If you think that attaining enlightenment in one single Jambudvīpa and manifesting an apparitional body elsewhere is not impossible why was the Buddha unable to attain enlightenment only when he dwelt among the Tuṣita gods and to manifest his apparitional body in all the Jambudvīpas of the universesoffourcontinents If reaching enlightenment in all the cāturdvīpakas indiscriminately can be denied there is no scriptural text or argument allowing the affirmation that there are Jambudvīpas where the Buddha does not appear If you agree that many Buddhas appear simultaneously in all the Jambudvīpas you are in contradiction to the sūtra Indeed this same sūtra adds that likewise two cakravartin kings are not born simultaneously If you deny that many Buddhas appear simultaneously in different cāturdvīpas you must also deny that many cakravartins appear simultaneously in different cāturdvīpas Furthermore the stanza mentions many Buddhas and illustrates omnigeneric enlightenment subtle apparitional Buddha bodies etc Just as the apparitional body of the Buddha descends into the womb of his mother and accomplishes the other deeds of the Buddha in the same way many fictitious śrāvakas such as āriputra etc with their distinctive characteristics descend into the wombs of their mothers simultaneously at the same time It is in the service of all beings that the Buddha made his vows dedicated his efforts and attained great enlightenment These vows and these efforts have in view only the service of all beings As long as this work is not completed it is impossible that the Buddha is parinirvanized in complete annihilation  for his vows and his efforts would both be sterile If that were so why would he not assume a retribution body separately in a higher place in all places accomplishing his work of conversion by means of apparitional bodies Since the enjoyment body and the apparitional body are both transitory  how can the sūtra say the the body of the Tathāgata is eternal Because the resultant body and the apparitional body both depend on the eternal dharmakāya Although these two bodies in question are transitory they depend on the dharmakāya and as the dharmakāya is eternal they also are proclaimed to be eternal An eternal body is eternal by its nature or eternal by means of its basis This shows that the resultant body and the apparitional body are eternal by equivalence and not eternal by nature In regard to the enjoyment body the enjoyment is never interrupted compare the phrase it always experiences happiness In a similar way people say about X he always experiences happiness Here people say about X he always gives food even though X does not give food uninterruptedly However as he gives many times and his generous intention persists it is said that he always gives food Here are two stanzas For these six reasons the apparitional body of the Buddha does not last eternally In order to summarize the ideas explained above the author says the stanzas Because his activity etc There are six reasons why the Buddha Bhagavats do not dwell eternally as nirmāṇakāya i Because their activity is complete when they have delivered beings who are already ripened But the Buddha wants them to reject the idea of parinirvāṇa and to seek to attain the eternal body of the Buddha iii In order to remove any erroneous thought they may have with regard to the Buddhas and in order to lead them to penetrate the profound tathatādharma and the subāṣitadharma iv In order that these beings experience feelings of interest towards the body of the Buddha and not be satisfied by seeing him continually v In order that these beings exert their energy personally by knowing that the teacher of the Dharma is going to disappear vi In order that these beings quickly reach the ripened state by preventing them from abandoning the energy the yoke of which they bear Objection The dharmakāya of the Buddhas is without beginning  is homogeneous and infinite therefore it is not necessary to acquire it to make efforts Answer Here is a stanza If the state of Buddha which is homogeneous and infinite caused beings to neglect the efforts necessary to obtain it this state of Buddha would be always acquired without cause But to remove such a cause is not permissible The Mahāyānasaṃgraha the work of master saṅga is now completed An objection is raised here The dharmakāya of the Buddhas is without beginning  is homogeneous and infinite it is the cause of obtaining buddhahood This is why it is not permitted to suppress the cause ie the necessity of effort These bodhisattvas sought buddhahood and used their efforts to ensure the service of all beings In the Abhidharmamahāyānasūtra in the presence of the Bhagavat in order to show the greatness of the Great Vehicle the bodhisattva Greatly Practiced in the Great Vehicle  said In relation to to the Great Vehicle the speech of the Buddha Bhagavats is distinguished by ten superiorities Bh b bh ba U ac ubb This paragraph has been translated according to H the versions differ slightly According to P For what purpose does he teach Bh prefaces its commentary by a general consideration of the canonical literature  taken from the commentary on the Sūtrālaṃkāra XI The three baskets are Sūtra Vinaya and Abhidharma These three baskets divided into the Lesser Vehicle and the Greater Vehicle  which make up the basket of the rāvaka and the basket of the Bodhisattva Regardless of whether they are three or two why are they called baskets Because they contain it should be understood that they contain everything to be understood Why are there three baskets For nine reasons The Sūtra is remedy for perplexity or doubt Wherever there is a doubt about something the Sūtra supplies a precise solution The Vinaya is antidote to habitual tendencies that constitute the two extremes By prohibiting culpable pleasures  it remedies loose habitual patterns by authorizing innocent pleasures it remedies austerity The Abhidharma is remedy for heretical views  because it clarifies the true nature of dharmas Furthermore the Sūtra teaches the three trainings the Vinaya executes the first two ie higher morality and higher mind  because the ethical person  going beyond regret  attains meditative stabilization Tathā hi Vinayapiṭaka visisena adhisīlasikkhā vuttā Suttantapiṭake adhicittasikkhā Abhidhammapiṭake adhipaññāsikkhā But here according to ḥgyod pa la rab tu ḥdas pas it should be read as vipratisārātikrameṇa The Vinaya accomplishes the texts and theses because the person who has disciplined their afflictions penetrates the former and the latter The Abhidharma excels in cutting through arguments about the texts and theses For these nine reasons they are enumerated as three baskets Furthermore they have as their purpose liberation from saṃsāra How then do they liberate They liberate by predisposition  intellection  pacification and penetration By hearing  the mind is predisposed by reflection  one understands by cultivating tranquility  one becomes peaceful by discernment  one penetrates Furthermore in brief  Sūtra Vinaya and Abhidharma each has a fourfold etymology by the understanding of which the bodhisattva acquires omniscience as for the śrāvaka by understanding the meaning of a simple stanza he acquires the destruction of his defilements In what way does each have a fourfold etymology The scene here means the place where the Sūtra has been preached by whom and to whom The nature is the nature of conventional reality and the nature of absolute truth The entities are the aggregates  the bases of consciousness the elements  dependent origination  sustenance  the trances  the immeasurables  the eight liberations  the spheres of mastery  the spheres of totality  the factors favorable to enlightenment  the emancipated special knowledges  etc iv The purpose is application The Abhidharma is thus called because it comprises direction  repetition  mastery and access The Dharma that leads to nirvāṇa is the Abhidharma because it teaches the truths  the factors favorable to enlightenment  the doors of liberation  etc The Dharma of repetition is the Abhidharma because it supplies much detailed information for each dharma  eg etymology  specific nature  shared nature  etc It has supremacy hence its name Abhidharma because it triumphs over opposing theses by treating controversial points By means of it there is access to the meanings of the Sūtras  hence its name Abhidharma The Vinaya may be understood from the point of view of wrongdoing  the cause of wrongdoing  the elimination of wrongdoing and liberation Wrongdoing consists of five

bh ab U ca u bb The support of the knowable that which can be known is called the knowable namely the defiled dharmas and the pure dharmas also the three natures The natures of the knowable namely the three natures imaginary  dependent and absolute The various cultivations of the cause and fruition of this entry cause and fruition consist of different cultivations This ongoing repeated practice being perfected in the stages  one speaks of various cultivations these are the ten stages Superior discipline contained in these various cultivations in the ten stages training in the matter of discipline is called higher discipline this is the discipline of the bodhisattvas who have not even a thought of wrongdoing Superiority of cessation superiority  classification or intuition cut off the obstacle of the afflictions and the obstacle to knowledge this is the nonabiding nirvāṇa Superiority of knowledge knowledge without obstacle this is consonant with nonconceptual knowledge The Buddhas knowledge is free of any trace of obstacle How is that shown According to this passage ten topics of which there is no mention in the Vehicle of the rāvakas are treated in the Great Vehicle i The storeconsciousness is called support of the knowable v The ten stages of the bodhisattva are the various cultivations of the cause and result of this entry vi The discipline of the bodhisattvas is the superior discipline contained in these various cultivations viii Nonceptual knowledge is the superior wisdom contained in these various disciplines ix The nonabiding nirvāṇa is the cessation which is the result of these three observances x The three bodies of the Buddha  namely essence body  enjoyment body and apparitional body  are the knowledge of the result of these three trainings The ten topics mentioned here show that the Great Vehicle is distinct from the Vehicle of the rāvakas Furthermore they show the superiority of the Great Vehicle The Bhagavat reserves the preaching of it for bodhisattvas Therefore relative to the Great Vehicle alone the speech of the Buddha Bhagavats is distinguished by ten superiorities when one has entered into the three natures by means of ConceptOnly the mundane virtues of generosity etc are called the cause of purity because they envisage the supramundane virtues After having entered into the stages these same virtues of generosity etc become supramundane and are called result of purity v The ten stages of the Bodhisattva are the various cultivations of the cause and result of this entry the ten stages of the bodhisattva are the various cultivations of the two ie of the cause and of the result which are the aforementioned virtues for the śrāvaka the absence of concept consists of not conceiving of any of the four errors for the bodhisattva the absence of concept consists of not conceiving of any dharma whatsoever this is the difference between the two absences of concepts ix The nonabiding nirvāṇa is the fruit of cessation this concerns the cessation which is the fruition of the three trainings  namely the cessation of the obstacle of the afflictions and the obstacle to knowledge x The three bodies is the knowledge of the result If there were no essencebody  the Dharma body would not exist as in the case of the eye If there were no Dharma body the body of enjoyment would not exist as in the case of the visual consciousness Here the supporter and the support should be thought of as equal If the enjoyment body did not exist after having entered into the higher stages the bodhisattvas would have no pleasure in enjoying the Dharma Without this pleasure the accumulations of enlightenment would not be complete  as in the case of color If there were no body of appearance  the bodhisattvas on the stage of application of faith and the śrāvakas of lesser faith would fail in their undertaking That is why it is necessary that there be three bodies The ten topics mentioned here show that the Great Vehicle is distinct from the Vehicle of the rāvakas since they are not treated in the Vehicle of the rāvakas Because the speech of the Tathāgata is characterized by ten superiorities  why is it asserted that the Great Vehicle is truly the speech of the Buddha and why is it denied that the Vehicle of the rāvakas is mingled with the Great Vehicle Actually the ten topics in question are not treated in the Vehicle of the rāvakas but are dealt with in the Great Vehicle These ten topics confirm great enlightenment and are fully justified by  consonant with and noncontradictory to the attainment of omniscience these are the superiorities of the Great Vehicle b Such topics are not seen elsewhere Because it is the cause of higher enlightenment  the conclusion is that the Great Vehicle is the word of the Buddha Because it explains the ten subjects it is superior These ten topics assure great enlightenment they are the cause capable of producing great enlightenment Why are the ten tpics treated in this sequence i From the very start  by their skill in the cause of dharmas  bodhisattvas must acquire skill in dependent origination ii Next in order to succeed in suppressing the extremes which are the faults of superimposition and negation  they must acquire skill in the natures of dependently produced dharmas iii Bodhisattvas trained in this way must penetrate the natures that they have understood in that way they will liberate their minds from obstacles iv Next after having understood the natures of the knowable  and by depending on the six virtues previously practiced  they must acquire purity of the highest intention v Next having spread the six virtues contained in the purity of highest intention over the ten levels  they must practice them for three incalculabl periods viviii Next they must fulfill the three trainings of the bodhisattva to perfection ixx Having fulfilled them they must reach the nirvāṇa which is their result and attain complete and perfect enlightenment That is why these ten topics are treated in this order Then because one has superimposed onto the nonexistent to deny the absolute true nature is called negation Suppression of these two extreme defects consitutes skillfulness in the natures of the dharmas iv Then having entered into ConceptOnly they must bring to perfection by way of the absolute the six mundane conventional virtues and integrate them into the highest pure intention v Then in the ten levels   they must practice these virtues for three incalculable great periods This is different from the śrāvakas who practice the remedy for three lifetimes and then arrive at deliverance viviii Then in the course of this cultivation  they must completely fulfill the three trainings of higher morality  etc ixx Finally they must realize nirvāṇa which is the fruit of the three trainings the cessation of the afflictions supreme perfect enlightenment and the three bodies of the Buddha NOTES  First of all  at the very beginning  it was said that the storeconsciousness is the support of the knowable In the Abhidharmasūtra Bhagavat spoke this verse anādikāliko dhātuḥ sarvadharmasamāśrayaḥ tasmin sati gatiḥsarvā nirvāṇādhigamo pi ca It is the beginningless element it is the common support of all dharmas Given this consciousness there exists every destiny and entry into nirvāṇa Bh ab bh b U a u ba This storeconsciousness is also the common basis of all dharmas in the capacity of support and not as cause Since there is a basis common to all dharmas there exists every destiny every destiny of saṃsāra destiny ie fruit of retribution  it is necessary that there be defilements in order that there be access to nirvāṇa I have revealed it to the virtuous ones ie to the great bodhisattvas Why is this consciousness called storeconsciousness It is a store consciousness because all defiled dharmas of those who are born are lodged within it as fruit  and it itself is lodged in the dharmas as cause Or again  it is a storeconsciousness because beings are lodged in it as if in their self Now the author explains the name store applied to this consciousness Defiled dharmas in order to exclude pure dharmas This consciousness is also called appropriating consciousness Profound because it is difficult to be probed by the intellect of clearsighted worldly people subtle because it is difficult to understand by the śrāvakas etc Like a violent current it proceeds along with all the seeds the series of its moments is never interrupted it is like the current of a river Because it appropriates all the material organs and because it is the support of the grasping of all the existences Why is that The material organs appropriated by this consciousness do not perish as long as life lasts Furthermore at the moment of reincarnation  because it grasps their production  this consciousness appropriates the states of existence That also is why it is called appropriating consciousness Because it appropriates all the material organs The phrase the material organs appropriated by it do not perish The material organs the eye etc appropriated by the appropriating consciousness do not undergo the state of decomposition of a corpse But the moment of death having come this consciousness abandons them and thus these organs fall into decomposition Therefore it is known with certainty that this consciousness appropriates the organs and for this reason until the end of life they do not perish The states of existence of a given lifespan  likewise are grasped by this consciousness because the seeds of these ekāvadhyātmabhāva reside in this appropriating consciousness This consciousness is also called mind Thus the Bhagavat said Mind  manas and consciousness Among these three manas is twofold ii The second is the afflicted manas  always associated with the four afflictions  ie wrong view of the self  pride of the self  attachment to the self and ignorance The consciousnesses arise because of the first manas as support the second one is defilement Because it cognizes the object  the manas is a consciousness as antecedent  as thinking  the manas is of two kinds Bh b bh ab U c u ba In relation to the mental consciousness which immediately follows it the consciousness that has just passed is the immediately preceding condition and support of arising it is called the first manas ii The second is the afflicted manas because it is afflicted by four passions Under its influence there comes pride of self when one depends on me and mine one becomes proud These three afflictions all have ignorance as cause Ignorance is notknowing  the opposite of knowingness  because the consciousness that has just disappeared and which is called manas gives up its place to the consciousness that is about to arise and thus acts as support for its birth The second one is defilement because it is a manas associated with the four afflictions since it believes in a self etc it defiles As antecedent as thinking the manas is of two types this justifies its name of Manas As it gives up its place to the mental consciousness it is called the first manas as it brings defilement through belief in a self  it is called the second manas How do we know the existence of the defiled manas If it did not exist i unmixed ignorance would not exist and this would be a fault Indeed the five groups of consciousnesses have the eye etc for their simultaneous support and the mental consciousness likewise must have a simultaneous support which is the manas iv There would be no difference between the absorption of nonidentification and the absorption of cessation  and this would be a fault Indeed whereas the absorption of nonidentification is characterized by a defiled manas the absorption of cessation is not Otherwise  these two absorptions would not be different v Among those beings without conceptuality  there would be neither belief in a self nor pride in a self for the entire duration of their nonconceptualizing existence they would not be afflicted vi Because in states of mind that are wholesome  unwholesome or indeterminate  we notice that belief in a self is always present Otherwise if the defiled manas did not exist the affliction called pride of self would be present by association with unwholesome states of mind alone whilst it would not exist in wholesome or indeterminate states Here are some stanzas Unmixed ignorance similarity with the five difference between the concentrations and the etymology would be lacking and this would be a fault During nonconceptualizing existence belief in a self would be absent and this would be a fault But the unmixed ignorance ever present always creates an obstacle to the mind Being afflicted  the manas is defiled and indeterminate it is always associated with four afflictions Like the afflictions of the material and nonmaterial domains  it is included in the defiledindeterminate i If the existence of the defiled manas is denied there would not be any unmixed ignorance Let us define the nature of unmixed ignorance it is a mistake which poses an obstacle to the birth of true knowledge It cannot be said that it resides in the five consciousnesses because these places do not contain any remedy for ignorance Wherever there is a remedy there is also that which is to be remedied Ignorance is not found in the nonafflicted mental consciousness  because the mental consciousness would be afflicted in its nature on account of this ignorance If it is claimed that the mental consciousness is afflicted as a consequence of this affliction which is ignorance it must be accepted that it is absolutely afflicted in its nature which is false If it is claimed that passionignorance exists with wholesome states of mind it would necessarily be associated with wholesome states of mind and the other states of mind would not exist It is not possible that the afflicted mental consciousness would produce the remedy for the ignorance which renders it afflicted But if it is claimed that various wholesome states of mind capable of bringing the remedy for ignorance exist with the manas if it is claimed that when the remedy arises that which is remedied ie the Manas and its ignorance disappears then the reasoning is correct ii There would be no similarity with the five and this would be a fault The similarity between the five consciousnesses visual consciousness etc and the mental consciousness ie that they arise from two conditions would be contradicted if the afflicted manas did not exist for the mental consciousness would not have an empowering condition as simultaneous support from its own side What is there to be said These six consciousnesses cannot be the support for the consciousness that follows them immediately because they have already been destroyed when the former succeeds them In this case how could the two absorptions be substantially different at least that they differ only by the presence or absence of the manas v Moreover among the gods having no conceptualizing  for the entire duration of an existence there would be no belief in a self If these gods did not have afflicted manas they would be free of belief in a self during the course of their existence Those who say that there is separately a mind simultaneous with belief in a self and support of this belief avoid these faults vi Without the manas the persistence in all situations of the belief in a self could not be explained if the existence of the manas is denied the truth of the ongoing peristence is no longer confirmed The commentaries do not explain the last line There would be no third category called mind outside of the storeconsciousness Thus it is proved that the storeconsciousness is of the category mind If the storeconsciousness did not exist through lack of a third category the word citta could designate only these two things namely the manas and the vijñānas Why is the storeconsciousness also called mind the dharmas that result from active consciousnesses of various categories Why is this mind not called storeconsciousness or appropriating consciousness in the Vehicle of the rāvakas But the bodhisattvas are instructed to recognize all phenomena that is why the storeconsciousness is taught to them Without this knowledge it would not be easy for them to acquire omniscience Bh c bh a U ac u ba The versions differ this shows that the storeconsciousness is at the same time profound and subtle and the object to be understood But all these things are sought by the bodhisattvas this is why they are taught the storeconsciousness In order to destroy the ultimate basis when someone preaches the Dharma to them they wish to hear it and lend an ear to it they seek perfect knowledge and are in possession of the path of truth When the Tathagata appeared in the world  this marvelous extraordinary Dharma appeared in the world In certain places and at certain times  matter and mind are interrupted but in the storeconsciousness their seeds are never interrupted They are in possession of the path of truth Dharma means that which should be realized anudharma means the path  because it is favorable to Dharma In the same way that the tree depends on its root the storeconsciousness is the root cause of all the consciousnesses In the same way the trees root is the cause of the leaves etc and without the root the leaves would not exist By contrast the seeds of matter and of mind contained in the storeconsciousness can never be interrupted as long as the path that counteracts them does not arise Thus this support of the knowable called storeconsciousness  appropriating consciousness  mind  ultimate basis  no i Some think that  the words citta  manas and vijñāna are one and the same thing  but that the syllables are different According to the interpretations current in the Vehicle of the rāvakas these interpretations of the name of the ālaya do not hold Why is this preferable Pleasant feeling joined with desire does not exist in and beyond the fourth dhyāna It would be absurd that beings who experience it would take it to be ultimate basis because it annoys them Considering the storeconsciousness as their own substance  beings born into very painful destinies want to eliminate the painful elements Beings born in the fourth dyāna or beyond are opposed to pleasant feeling joined with desire The instinct of selfpreservation is supported by it Just as the Vaiśeṣikas contradict their own system by setting up some tattvas so the rāvakas contradict themselves by interpreting the word ālaya in that way In brief  its natures are three in number ie selfnature  nature of being cause and nature of being fruit by virtue of the predispositions of all the afflictive dharmas that perfume it the storeconsciousness is the generating cause of these dharmas since it has the ability to contain the seeds this storeconsciousness furnished with all its seeds is always present as the cause of these afflictive dharmas idam tāvād ālayavijñānasya paryāyavyavasthāpanam atas tasya lakṣaṇa vyavasthāpanaṃ kathaṃ

selfnature is separated from the inherent natures since the inherent natures of cause and fruit are different from the selfnature Arising and ceasing with the dharmas of beings  it undergoes perfuming by them The principal cause is the seeds Having the power of perfuming  the storeconsciousness has the nature of cause The storeconsciousness is generated by the perfumings of the active afflictive dharmas lust etc which come from the active consciousnesses That is its nature of fruit That which by simultaneous birth and destruction of the dharma is the generating cause of this particular dharma is what is called propensity Thus sesame seeds perfumed by a flower sesame seeds and flower arise and perish at the same time but the sesame seeds arise as the cause reproducing the scent of the flower In this way also among desirous people  the propensity of desire arises and perishes at the same time as the desire but their state of mind arises as the cause engendering this desire That which by simultaneous birth and destruction of the dharma is the generating cause of this particular dharma that which is perfumed arises and perishes at the same time as that which perfumes Do the seeds of afflictive dharmas contained in the storeconsciousness constitute a category substantially different or nondifferent from this consciousness Substantially these seeds are neither different nor nondifferent from the storeconsciousness If they were different from the storeconsciousness the seeds would differ part by part By the power of the wholesome or unwholesome propensities  the seeds would be wholesome or unwholesome But it is accepted that they are indeterminate If they were not different how could there be a number of them Thus these two hypotheses present difficulties Furnished with these potentialities it is called consciousness endowed with all the seeds The wheat seed  because it has the power to give rise to the shoot  has the nature of seed It has powers giving rise to afflictive dharmas endowed with these powers it is called consciousness endowed with all the seeds It is like the case of a lamp the arising of the flame and the combustion of the wick are mutual and simultaneous Or like two bundles of reeds which simultaneously leaning on each other do not fall down the storeconsciousness is the cause of the defiled dharmas in the same way the defiled dharmas are the cause of the storeconsciousness That is the true definition of the causal condition because another causal condition does not exist b bh a U ab u ba Let us take a lamp for example at a given moment the lamps wick gives rise to the flame and the lamps flame consumes the wick they are mutually cause and result Similarly the storeconsciousness and the active consciousnesses are simultaneously and mutually cause and fruit How can the nondifferent and nonvariable propensities be the cause of different and variable dharmas when it is coated it does not show any variation but when it is dipped into the dyebath  then many different rainbowhued colors appear at the moment of impregnation it is not varied but when it is dipped into the dyebath which is the arising of the fruit  a crowd of various dharmas manifests It penetrates it when it is seized by the conditions At the time of impregnation it shows no difference or variety but when it has reached the stage of retribution  it appears as the very cause of multiple dharmas Here in the Greater Vehicle there is dependent origination which is subtle and very profound i The production of dharmas by virtue of the storeconsciousness is the pratītyasamutpada that which apportions the selfnatures since it is the same condition of the distribution the various selfnatures ii The twelvemembered pratītyasvabhāva is that which apportions pleasantness and unpleasantness since it is the same condition that differentiates pleasant and unpleasant existences in the wholesome and unwholesome destinies The storeconsciousness apportions the selfnatures for it apportions the defiled nature of everything that arises by differentiating it Here those who are mistaken about the first dependent origination ie storeconsciousness think that the origin of things is to be sought in selfnature  or in previous actions  or in a transformation of the creator  or in the Self or else they think that there is neither cause nor condition Those who are mistaken about the second dependent origination imagine a self that is actor and enjoyer Let us suppose there is a group of people who are blind from birth  who have never seen an elephant and who one day are presented with an elephant The first blind person touches the trunk of the elephant the second its tusks  the third its ears  the fourth its feet  the fifth its tail  the sixth its side Someone asks them what is the elephant like and the first answers that it is like a plow  the second like a wooden leg  the third like a winnowing basket  the fourth like a pillar  the fifth like a broom and the sixth like a rock In the same way here those who are ignorant about these two dependent originations blinded by ignorance are ignorant about the storeconsciousness which here is comparable to the elephant are ignorant about its selfnature  its nature as cause and its nature as result They think that the cause of things is the selfnature or previous actions or a creator or a Self or else that there is production without any cause In short etc The outer seed is the wheat  etc the inner seed is the storeconsciousness this is a matter of the outer seed and the inner seed or of the fruit and the cause The conventional seed is the external seed wheat etc because it is just a development of the storeconsciousness All the seeds have six characteristics They are momentary the two kinds of seeds perish as soon as they are born It is impossible that an eternal dharma could be seed because its nature remains unchanged from what it was at the beginning They are simultaneous with their fruit A past dharma a future dharma or a dharma dissociated from its fruit cannot be seed Because the fruit is born at the precise moment when the seed exists The storeconsciousness lasts up until its obstruction arises the seeds of outer dharmas last until the formation of the root or until maturity They are determinate they are individually determined Everything is not born from everything each substance is born from the seed appropriate to it these seeds require their own conditions in order to produce their fruit Anything does not give rise to anything whatsoever but at given times and given places when the seeds encounter their proper conditions at these places and times their fruit takes birth They are the authors of an appropriate fruit a given seed produces only the fruit appropriate to it Thus the storeconsciousness produces only the storeconsciousness and wheat seed produces only the wheat fruit The union of the perfumed and the perfuming is necessary so that the nature belonging to the seed and to the possesser of the seed be established In order to be perfumed it is not enough to be stable it must also be indeterminate Thus substances of neutral odor can be perfumed but not odoriferous substances like agallochum or malodorous substances like garlic  etc any substance that is perfumable or that is capable of concentrating perfumes and the parts of which are are in mutual cohesion is called perfumable Gold stone etc are not perfumable because their parts are not in mutual cohesion In order to be perfumed it is necessary not only to be perfumable but also to be in strict relationship with the perfumer The storeconsciousness alone which has these four qualities merits the name perfumed and none other these consciousnesses have a mobile activity Their respective three natures are in opposition each of them functions with a special support  a special object and a special act of attention there are no two moments that exist at the same time But it is said these consciousnesses belong to the same type Even though they are not in contact they share the same type the type consciousness The organs  eye etc being of the same type of rūpaprasāda  should also be mutually perfumed in the sense that the two organs eye and ear together having a subtle characteristic  should be mutually perfumed Now you cannot accept that because despite the subtle element common to them these organs have distinct series and consequently cannot perfume one another It is the same for the consciousnesses despite the characteristic of consciousness common to them how could they perfume one another The two seeds in question ie the outer seed and the inner seed are both generating cause and projecting cause First the outer seed is generating cause until the ripening of the fruit the inner seed is generating cause until the end of life The inner seed projects the corpse after death It is thanks to the projecting cause that the shoots and the corpse last long enough If the two seeds were generating cause only as soon as the cause disappears the fruit would perish and would not last for even an instant If the moments followed one another if the subsequent moment arose because of the previous moment there would never be a final term That is why the projecting cause necessarily exists These two seeds are cause in the same way that the string that is released and the bow that is bent cause the arrow not to fall but to travel a long distance As for the other consciousnesses the active consciousnesses  they are enjoyers throughout all the existences and destinies They are enjoyers To explain this idea the author cites a verse from the Madhāntavibhaṅgasūtra as proof of his theory At the moment when the storeconsciousness is the cause of dharmas at that very moment the latter are its result at the moment when the storeconsciousness is the result of dharmas at that very moment the latter dharmas are its cause If in the first dependent production  these two consciousnesses are mutually conditional cause  of which condition is it a question in the second conditioned production Of the dominant condition Of how many conditions are the six active consciousnesses the outcome They are the outcome of the dominant condition the object condition and the condition as equal and immediate antecedent The three dependent productions saṃsāra pleasant or unpleasant destinies and complete enjoyment  include these four conditions The six consciousnesses come from three conditions Thus concerning the visual consciousness the eye is the dominant condition color is the object condition the consciousness that has just disappeared is the antecedent condition How does one know that these names and characteristics apply exclusively to the storeconsciousness and not to the active consciousnesses Without a storeconsciousness defined in this way defilement and purification are impossible passionaffliction  actionaffliction and birthaffliction are impossible mundane purification and supramundane purification are impossible Bh c bh b U a u a If the names and natures in question are applied to something other than the storeconsciousness affliction and purification are impossible Because the nature consisting of being the seed the nature realized by the perfuming of the afflictions and subafflictions does not belong to the six groups of active consciousnesses i Indeed let us suppose a visual consciousness arising and perishing with the afflictions and subafflictions lust etc It is this visual consciousness perfumed by the propensity of lust etc that must be the seed of lust and not another consciousness auditory consciousness etc But when the visual consciousness perfumed by lust is destroyed and replaced by another consciousness auditory consciousness etc there is no longer the propensity of lust and the support of this propensity namely the visual consciousness does not exist It is impossible that from this visual consciousness previouely destroyed there could arise a second visual consciousness provided with the aforesaid lust  etc In the same way from a past action presently without selfnature there cannot arise a retributive result This is why the visual consciousness cannot be perfumed by impregnation by afflictions and subafflictions lust etc The same reasoning that is valid here for the visual consciousness will be applicable mutatis mutandis to the other active consciousnesses i In the same way a retributive result cannot arise from a past action presently without sefnature like the Sautrāntika masters that the past is without selfnature  and that the retributive result is projected by an propensity presently existing But the Vaibhāṣika masters believe that the retributive result arises from a past action that is impossible Because the past does not exist Therefore he accepts that that the visual consciousness arising with the lust etc may be perfumed by the lust If there cannot be impregnation in the visual consciousness that arises with lust etc how could there be impregnation in what arises later than this visual consciousness Being a mental event  lust depends on the consciousness iii Neither does the propensity reside in the other consciousnesses the impregnation cannot reside in the auditory consciousness etc Because the supports of these consciousnesses are distinct Since their supports are distinct none of them can arise and perish together Indeed the visual consciousness depends on the eye the auditory consciousness depends on the ear and so on up to the mental consciousness which depends on the manas Since the supports are separate  it is impossible that the impregnation of one of them be found in the other iv Finally the impregnation does not reside in the visual consciousness itself the visual consciousness likewise cannot perfume the visual consciousness because two consciousnesses cannot arise at the same time Since there are not two simultaneous birth and destruction definitely does not occur Furthermore amongst those who fall from a higher level the ones without identification  etc and are reborn here in the realm of desire the first consciousness  which is afflicted by the afflictions and subafflictions of the realm of desire and which appears at the very beginning of the reincarnation pratisaṃdhi will be reborn without seed Indeed the propensity of afflictions and subafflictions along with the consciousness that supports it is past and no longer exists Lacking a storeconsciousness it would then be born without seed When the consciousness that counteracts the afflictions is born all the other mundane consciousnesses are destroyed Thus lacking a storeconsciousness it is impossible that this counteracting consciousness would contain the seeds of the afflictions and subafflictions because it is free in nature  for it does not arise and does not perish with the afflictions and subafflictions If the storeconsciousness did not exist when a mundane consciousness arises later it arises without seed for the propensity of passion and its supportconsciousness are past and have long ago ceased to exist Consequently if the storeconsciousness did not exist the passiondefilement would be impossible when in the rya who possesses the fruit of streamentry the path counteracting the afflictions that are to be cut by seeing arises for the first time all the other consciousnesses the mundane consciousnesses are immediately destroyed Then if there were no storeconsciousness where would the seeds of the afflictions that are to be cut by meditation reside This shows that the counteracting consciousness cannot be the seed of the afflictions If the storeconsciousness does not exist why is actionaffliction impossible ii Because lacking a storeconsciousness existence conditioned by grasping is impossible Given the consciousness perfumed by the aforesaid mental factors it is by the power of grasping that the propensities develop and give existence i If it was the mental consciousness of the intermediary existence that became coagulated there would be in the mothers womb a second mental consciousness depending on the coagulated mental consciousness Thus two mental consciousnesses would exist simultaneously in the mothers womb ii Furthemore the coagulated vijñāna cannot be a mental consciousness because the mental consciousness always has a defiled support since if it were the coagulated vijñāna it would never be interrupted and would have an imperceptible object iii Supposing that the coagulated vijñāna is a mental consciousness then either it is the coagulated mental consciousness that is equipped with all the seeds  or it is another mental consciousness arisen in dependence on this coagulated vijñāna that is equipped with all the seeds If it is the coagulated mental consciousness that is equipped with all the seeds then what we call mental consciousness is in reality synonymous with storeconsciousness If on the other hand it is the mental consciousness dependent on the coagulated vijñāna that is equipped with all the seeds then the support causal consciousness would not be equipped with all the seeds whereas the supported fruitional consciousness would be equipped with all the seeds which is completely impossible Consequemtly it is proved that the coagulated vijñāna is not a mental consciousness but a retributive consciousness equipped with all the seeds the realm of desire dependent on the active mind in the intermediate existence between death and birth  an afflicted mental consciousness ii Furthermore the coagulated vijñāna cannot be a mental consciousness The mental consciousness has the manas defiled by the afflictions  lust  etc as support  for it has birth as object Since it has something that is afflicted as support we say that it has an afflicted support But here the retributive vijñāna does not have an afflicted support because this vijñāna is indeterminate Furthermore the coagulated vijñāna is never interrupted because it undergoes the mechanism of activity The object of the mental consciousness is perceptible  ie the dharmas But the coagulated vijñāna does not have a perceptible object of this kind That is why the coagulated vijñāna cannot be a mental consciousness Thus the coagulated vijñāna cannot be a mental consciousness In those who are reborn the grasping of the material organs is impossible without a retributive conscousness  for the consciousnesses other than this last one have their specific support and are not stable this shows that lacking a storeconsciousness the six organs eye etc would not have a single dharma to appropriate all at once Indeed the visual consciousness depends only on the eye the auditory consciousness depends only on the ear and so on Each of them can appropriate only its own organ it cannot appropriate a foreign organ Thus a storeconsciousness is necessary to appropriate all the organs at once Then lacking a storeconsciousness the eye and the other organs deprived of an appropriator would perish The Bhagavat said Nameandform has vijñāna as condition By name here is meant the four nonmaterial aggregates by form here is meant the embryo The vijñāna which is condition for nameandform can be nothing other than the storeconsciousness If by name the active consciousnesses was already understood then what is meant by vijñāna if not the storeconsciousness With the exception of the retributive consciousness  no other consciousness can be the nutrimentconsciousness of which the Bhagavat speaks for beings already born Indeed we do not see any one of the six active consciousnesses forming a nutriment for beings born in the three worlds According to the Bhagavat there are four nutriments the nutriment which consists of foodbythemouthfuls contact mental activity and consciousness The nutriment of foodbythemouthfuls is digestion because digestion comforts the body nutriment of contact is the grasping of the object because merely seeing the object the color etc is a source of strength for the body nutriment of mental activity is aspiration because aspiration comforts the body thus when one sees water in the distance even though one may be thirsty one does not die nutriment of consciousness is appropriation because by this appropriation the body subsists for a long time Otherwise like a corpse  the body would soon decompose Thus it must be accepted that consciousness is a nutriment since it comforts the body In this list nutriment of contact refers to the six active consciousnesses nutriment of mental activity refers to the greedy manas Then what special consciousness except the storeconsciousness could be called nutriment Moreover in the states deprived of mind sleep  swoon blackout  the absorption of cessation the six groups of consciousnesses are destroyed What then is this other consciousness except the storeconsciousness that appropriates the body so that it does not decompose Abandoned by the storeconsciousness the body would perish But in regard to the nonabsorbed and afflicted mind of the higher levels nothing other than the retributive consciousness can constitute a seed The author has already shown how lacking a storeconsciousness the bond of rebirth in the realm of desire is impossible this is what the author is going to show delight in concentration  etc form the bond of rebirth which in the past had been realized in the course of earlier existences is not a seed because there was no other consciousness to undergo the perfuming A storeconsciousness therefore must necessarily be accepted in which resides the eternal propensity of the mind returning from of the higher realms Among beings born in the formless realm  when there is an afflictedwholesome mind  without a retributive consciousness furnished with all the seeds  it too would be born without seed and without base of enjoyment and of concentration would be born without seed Another meaning if this twofold mind were without seed from what would it arise If it were without base upon what would it depend in order to function In this same realm when the supramundane mind appears  the other minds the mundane minds  disappear Thus the destiny in this realm would be annihilated Thus the birth in this realm would be annihilated because the retribution contained in this destiny in the formless realm would not take place and the nirvāṇa without residue would be acquired without preparatory effort by itself Some beings born in the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification produce a supramundane mind of the sphere of nothingness But then lacking a storeconsciousness the two destinies that these two spheres constitute would be annihilated Indeed this supramundane consciousness cannot have as support either destiny in the naivasaṃjñānāyatana or destiny in the akiṃcanyāyatana or destiny in nirvāṇa The supramundane mind cannot have either the first sphere or the second sphere as destinysupport because these two spheres are mundane Finally this supramundane mind cannot have nirvāṇa as destinysupport because it has another support namely sopadhiśeṣanirvāṇadhātu None of these three things can be its destinysupport If one does not believe in the existence of the storeconsciousness what then is the destinysupport of this supramundane mind At the moment of death  beings who have accomplished good actions and beings who have committed bad actions experience a gradual cold feeling in the lower or the upper part respectively of the body which without a storeconsciousness would be impossible Consequently the birth affliction also lacking a retributive consciousness furnished with all the seeds would be impossible At the moment of death  those who have carried out good actions experience a gradual cooling in the lower part of their body those who have committed bad actions experience it in the opposite part  because those who have carried out good actions must rise whereas those who have committed bad actions must descend Without a storeconsciousness capable of appropriating the body how could the body gradually become cold Why is the mundane purification impossible in the absence of a storeconsciousness i Those who have not rejected the lust of the desire realm and who have not yet acquired the mind of the form realm endeavor to liberate themselves from the lust of the desire realm by a good mind of the desire realm But this mind of effort belonging to the desire realm is not born does not perish with the mind of the desire realm thus it is not perfumed by the latter and cannot be the seed ii The preceding mind of the form realm is a past mind in the course of numerous earlier existences  it has been separated by other minds it no longer exists As a result it cannot be the seed of the absorbed mind  ie of the mind of the form realm that occupies us Consequently the retributive consciousness furnished with all the seeds which proceeds in a continuous series is the causal condition of the absorbed mind in the form realm whereas the good mind of effort is its dominant condition Thia is what has been proved The same reasoning may be applied mutatis mutandis to all realms exempt from lust He will now show that mundane purification is impossible as well i The mind of effort and the good mind the one belonging to the desire realm and the other to the form realm do not arise and do not perish together ii The good mind of the form realm already obtained in the course of other existences in eternal saṃsāra is not the seed of the present good mind of the form realm because it is past and for many existences has been replaced by many minds belonging to the desire realm Since it does not actually exist this past good mind cannot be the seed of of the actual good mind of the form realm it is only a dominant condition and not a causal condition It is from the power of its dominance that the mind of the form realm is born Why would the supramundane purification be impossible The Bhagavat said The words of others and correct inner reflection are the causes of correct seeing Words of others and correct reflection perfume either the auditory consciousness or the mental consciousness or both together However at the time of correct mental reflection on the texts  the auditory consciousness does not arise and similarly the mental consciousness is replaced by other consciousnesses distracted consciousnesses At the moment when the supramundane mind associated with correct reflection  ie correct seeing  arises the mental consciousness perfumed by the propensity of hearing together with the propensity of hearing is destroyed  past  finished long ago Not existing any longer how could it be the seed able to give birth subsequently to the supramundane mind associated with correct reflection The mundane mind associated with correct reflection does not arise does not perish with the supramundane mind associated with correct seeing thus it is not perfumed by the latter not being perfumed by it it cannot be the seed Consequently the supramundane purification also would be impossible in he absence of a retributive consciousness furnished with all the seeds Indeed the impregnation of hearing which occurs in the mundane mental consciousness cannot contain the seed of the supramundane mind How can the retributive consciousness furnished with all the seeds  the cause of affliction  be the seed of the supramundane mind that counteracts this affliction The supramundane mind is foreign thus its propensity does not yet exist Not having a propensity from what seed could it be said to arise Answer It comes from the seed that is the propensity of hearing  issuing from the very pure dharmadhātu The retributive consciousness the cause of that which is counteracted  ie the affliction cannot be the cause of the antidote  ie purity the pure mind has not yet been realized how could it arise without an appropriated cause It is the propensity of hearing issuing from the very pure dharmadhātu To show that the dharmadhātu is unknown to the śrāvakas etc it is qualified as very pure indeed this dharmadhātu attested to by the Buddha Bhagavats cuts through the attachment obstacle and the obstacle to knowledge Since we understand these sūtras without error  we speak of hearing The propensity coming from this hearing is called propensity of hearing or again the hearing itself constitutes propensity hence the expression propensityhearing This propensityseries residing as an foreign principle in the storeconsciousness is the cause capable of producing the supramundane mind That is why it is said that this mind comes from this seed which is the hearing propensity resulting from the very pure dharmadhātu Is the hearing propensity the same as the storeconsciousness or is it not the same as the storeconsciousness If it is identical with the storeconsciousness how is it the seed producing the antidote to this consciousness If it is not identical with the storeconsciousness where could a support to this hearing propensity seed be found Until the enlightenment of the buddhas is attained  this hearing propensity according to whether it resides in any place of functioning whatsoever that serves it as support  resides temporarily in the retributive consciousness  becomes united with it functions with it like water and milk However it is not the storeconsciousness because it is its seed If the hearing propensity is identical with the storeconsciousness how could it be the seed of the antidote to the storeconsciousness If it is not identical with the storeconsciousness it must have a support distinct from the storeconsciousness Until the enlightenment of the Buddha is attained until one acquires the supreme enlightenment acquired by the Buddhas  until one acquires the destiny that serves as support for stainless emancipated wisdom  this hearing propensity depending on whether it has any series whatsoever as place of functioning resides temporarily in the retributive consciousness is joined to it functions with it like water and milk although the hearing impregnation is not the storeconsciousness it resides in this consciousness and functions with it From the small propensity is derived the medium propensity  from the medium propensity is derived the great propensity indeed hearing  contemplating and meditating comprise a progression Issuing from the supramundane and very pure dharmadhātu even though it is worldly  it is the seed of the supramundane mind Even before the supramundane mind arises it counteracts the explosion of the afflictions it counteracts the hell destinies it is the antidote that supresses all bad actions It favors meeting with the Buddhas and bodhisattvas Although worldly it pertains to the dharmakāya of the beginning bodhisattvas it also comes out of the vimuktikāya of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas To the extent that the hearing propensity small medium or great develops successively to that extent the retributive consciousness diminishes and transforms its support Having completely transformed its support the retributive consciousness although supplied with all the seeds  becomes deprived of seeds and completely cut off It counteracts the explosion of the passions it is a cause capable of cutting through the excessive activity of sensual desire  etc It counteracts the hell destinies having cut through the explosion of the passions it is able to counteract the bad destinies of hell It is the cause that suppresses these actionstobeexperiencedlater as a result of which one is reborn in the bad destinies In summary  it is the counteragent of all bad conduct  past  future and present It favors the meeting with the Buddhas and bodhisattvas According to bh ma ḥoṅs pa na dge baḥi bśes gñen daṅ bdag phrad pa thob paḥi rgyu ñid kyaṅ yin no It is also the cause which will permit one later to become connected to spiritual friends It is like the milk drunk from water by a goose In the same way when the mundane attachment is eliminated the propensity of the nonabsorbed levels decresases little by little whereas the propensity of the absorbed levels develops little by little and thus one arrives at the transformation of the basis Bh bc bh missing U b u a Let us return to the example given above of water and milk mixed when geese drink this mixture the milk disappears and the water reamins to show this the Bhagavat said that amongst them the vijñāna does not leave the body the production of nirodhasamāpatti does not counteract this consciousness because the object and the aspect of the storeconsciousness are not different Since a vague and indistinct consciousness does not hinder the nirodhasamāpatti in its subsiding the latter does not counteract the storeconsciousness because it does not destroy that which it does not hinder In those who emerge from nirodhasamāpatti the vijñāna is not produced anew This is not true because on leaving the absorption the vijñāna is not produced anew This vijñāna which is fruit of retribution  does not rearise once it is interrupted except to be reborn and take on a new existence Some think that the absorption of cessation is provided with mind because it contains a mental consciousness But even from their point of view such a mind is impossible ii The object and the aspect of the absorption vijñāna are not perceived iii Since the mental consciousness cannot be described here as an unwholesome or morally indeterminate consciousness it would be associated with the roots of good iii The vijñāna of this absorption is definitely not a mental consciousness because this mental consciousness would be associated with the roots of good The mind of entry into this absorption is definitely neither unwholesome nor morally indeterminate But without the roots of good nonattachment  etc this wholsome mind would not exist It is by association that it is good But if these roots of good exist how would the two mental factors concept and senation not be present That is why there would be contact in the nirodhasamāpatti In this absorption it is only concept and sensation that are destroyed but mind remains If this mind contained in the nirodhasamāpatti were not destroyed volition faith and the other roots of good would be present In order to avoid all the kinds of difficulties enumnerated above and to avoid contradicting the āgamas some scholars are content to exclude the mental factors i Because it is impossible to separate the things supported from their support the support is the mind the things supported are the mental factors Support and things supported ie mind and mental factors have been inseparable from one another since beginningless saṃsāra because they mutually attract one another This is why if the absorption of cessation is equipped with a mind it will necessarily bring along nonattraction and the other roots of good inseparable from the mind Objection But you may say the absorption and the means of absorption are in opposition to nonattachment and the other roots of good Therefore in this absorption the roots of good do not exist and the wholesome mind alone exists If at the time of its cause the absorption is associated with these mental factors it would remain associated with them at the time of the fruition of result Therefore the objection does not hold ii Neither does it hold because there are examples The Bhagavat has said In those who dwell in the absorption of cessation the factors of the body  speech and mind are destroyed Here the factors of the body are the inbreath and the outbreath the factors of speech are examination and judgment the factors of mind are volition  conceptualization  etc If examination and judgment were destroyed speech could not arise It is the same for the mind if the factors are destroyed it does not arise Objection But you may say if the factors of the body perish when one enters into absorption the body persists and does not perish It is the same for the mind the mental factors are destroyed but the mind persists and does not perish The Bhagavat has said When the body factors are suppressed there is still another cause for the susbsistence of the body food  drink  the vital organ  consciousness  etc Thanks to these although the inbreath and outbreath may have disappeared the body persists But it is not the same for the mind If the mental factors are suppressed there is no further particular cause supporting the mind so that it can subsist Thus since the absorption of cessation would not have a mental consciousness it would be necessary to call it absorption without mind But since the retributive consciousness remains in this absorption the Bhagavat has stated that the vijñāna does not leave the body and it is from this vijnāna supplied with all the seeds that coming out of absorption  the active consciousnesses arise This is why the storeconsciousness necessarily exists Since it cannot be wholesome  unwholesome or morally indeterminate  this mental consciousness is not in conformity with the absorption of cessation Bh ca bh ab U ab u bb How could contact be separated from the univeral mental factors sensation etc b Nor by reason of its original cause a wholesome mind of effort That contradicts the sūtra for which every mind is wolesome by virtue of an association with the roots of good Moreover who forces us to believe that if the mind of effort the condition for absorption is wholesome by association with noncovetousness and the other roots of good it is not the same for the mind of absorption which is the result that that resembles the cause iii Neither could it be morally indeterminate  for it is not the avyākṛta relating to conduct or to the arts or to magical creations This is why the vijñāna residing in this absorption is the retributive consciousness and not the mental consciousness The theory according to which the continuous production of matter and of mind would be the seed of the dharmas is inadmissible as we have seen above It would be impossible to fall from the formless realm or from the heaven of the nonidentifying ones  and to emerge from the absorptionof cessation The last mind of the arhat would not be explicable unless the earlier mind with respect to the later mind would be an immediately preceding condition and and not a causal condition When one falls from the formless realm and is reborn into the form realm  it is impossible that the earlier form is the generating seed of the actual form because the earlier form has long since been destroyed When the mind falls from the heaven of the nonidentifying ones to be reborn into an identifying world when the mind reappears to leave the absorption of cessation etc it is impossible that the earlier mind could be the generating seed of the later mind because the earlier mind has long since been destroyed Indeed this ultimate mind would be the seed which as immediately preceding condition  gives rise to another mind the result would be that the sphere of nirvāṇawithoutresidue would never occur Consequently lacking a retributive consciousness supplied with all the seeds  defilement and purification would be impossible Therefore the existence of a storeconsciousness showing the characteristics that we have described is proven With the help of innumerable arguments explained above  the author has proved that the storeconsciousness exists necessarily i If there was only one good mind among the bodhisattvas ie a mental consciousness that is whollesome but impure  apart from the first five active consciousnesses and distinct from the other mental consciousness the unwholesome impure consciousness  how would this mind transform its support Besides if the counteragent were the cutting cause and result would be indistinguishable But since this mind no longer exists these two losses are nonexistent and your claimed transformation is impossible These three stanzas explain how by confining oneself to the active consciousnesses  the transformation of the support would not take place i If among the bodhisattvas there were only one good mind a wholesome mental consciousness associated with the counteragent of the afflictions and supramundane  separate from the five the first five consciousnesses visual consciousness etc and distinct from the other from the unwholesome impure and afflicted mental conscousness the author who has already spoken of a good mind adds here that it is distinct from the other with the aim of distinguishing it from the wholesome but impure if you believe in the existence of the storeconsciousness you could call transformation of the support the phenomenon that causes all the seeds of affliction that it contains to lose the quality of seed But if you do not believe in it what would this transformation consist of ii You say that the arising of the counteragent is the transformation But the counteragent is not this cutting because it is merely the cause of the cutting If it were the cutting itself the cause and the result would not be different The result ie nirvāṇa is the cutting the cause ie the noble path  is the counteragent If the counteragent were the cutting the result and the cause would be one and the same thing and on the arising of the counteragent there would be nirvāṇa You would perhaps admit that the loss of the seeds or the loss of its nature of seed applied to the active consciousness constitutes the transformation of the support The mind in which the numerous seeds of defilement are accumulated would be without seeds and you would consider that to be the transformation of the support or else its nature of seed would disappear and you would consider that to be the transformation of the support But since this mind no longer exists these two gates are nonexistent and your claimed transformation is impossible But if it no longer exists it cannot be said that it loses its seeds or its nature of seed The two losses that you call transformation of the support are impossible then although the afflicted active consciousnesses no longer exist in the state of absorption their seeds reside in the storeconsciousness which can be deprived of seeds or of its nature of seeds by transforming it Since thus your claimed transformation of the support is not explicable in the hypothesis of the existence of only the active consciousnesses it is necessary to believe in the existence of a storeconsciousness In short the storeconciousness is threefold or fourfold Firstly it is threefold in regard to the three types of propensities i the propensity of speech  ii the propensity of the view of self  iii the propensity of the factors of existence Without this projecting storeconsciousness the consciousness conditioned by the factors and the existence conditioned by attachment would be impossible Without this retributionconsciousness there would be no seed and as a result the dharmas destined to arise could not arise Without it the belief in a self belonging to the manas would have no object The store consciousness is the object of the view of self and the belief in the self that resides in the afflicted manas But it should be known that it is the result resembling the cause When it is shared  the storeconsciousness is the seed of the worldreceptacle when it is unshared  it is the seed of the individual bases of consciousness Shared it is the seed of the insensate world unshared it is the seed of the sensate world Thus by reason of diverse aspirations  the yogins have different visions of one and the same thing Because the outer world is vast the yogins have different views of it Because the buddhafields are pure  the vision of the Buddhas is pure Lacking such a shared and unshared storeconsciousness the distinction between receptacleworld and animate world would be impossible Shared it is the seed of the insensate world As weak it is the seed of the defilements and the minor kleśas valid it is the seed of the impure but wholesome dharmas Without this twofold storeconsciousness the distinction between inaptitude and aptitude a distinction that comes from retribution would be impossible it is exhausted or it is nonexhausted As exhausted it is the wholesome or unwholesome seed that once retributed is retributed for the good As nonexhausted it is the seed of propensity of speech  because throughout eternity  it is the seed that engenders the multiplicity of discursiveness Without this  the good or bad actions already accomplished would not be exhausted by giving their result and would become retributed indefintely the production of a new propensity of speech would be impossible iii The storeconsciousness has also a nature of similarity  because the storeconsciousness is like an illusion  a mirage  a dream and an optical illusion  Among those who have rejected the mundane attachments  it is reduced Among the śaikṣas śrāvakas and bodhisattvas it is partially suppressed Among the arhats pratyekabuddhas and Tathagatas it is free of all obstacles of passion Mutatis mutandis  it is the same for freedom from all obstacles of passion and all obstacles to knowledge Validity is quite the opposite it is synonymous with aptitude  with lightness  with good physical constitution ii As exhausted it is the good or bad seed which once retributed etc As nonexhausted it is the seed of the speech impregnation this seed which develops according to conditions is a cause capable of giving rise to the multiplicity of discursiveness  are a cause capable of producing wrong views it is the same for the storeconsciousness Why is the storeconsciousness which is the retribution of wholesome and unwholesome dharmas  a nonafflicted and morally indeterminate retribution Because being nonafflicted and indeterminate it opposes neither good nor bad it is the good and the bad that oppose each other If the retribution were good or bad instead of being nonafflicted and indeterminate the disappearance of the afflictions would be impossible because being nonafflicted and indeterminate it opposes neither the good nor the bad with which it is in the relationship of cause and result If the retribution were not nonafflicted and indeterminate the disappearance of the afflictions would be impossible since the good arises from good and the bad from bad the process of saṃsāra would have no end Compare the references in  seq Aṅguttara III p On the lakṣaṇas of the ālaya cf What are these concepts the concept which is known by the preceding the concept which produces the distinction between self and other The support of the appearance of a nonexistent and fictitious thing is called the dependent nature This is the concept which manifests with the appearance of discourse this is their dependent nature Their true nature which is characterized as the complete absence of parikalpita in the paratantra consitutes their absolute nature Among the concepts listed in  the concept of body of the possessor of the body and of the enjoyer is the six inner elements  eye etc The concept cognized by the preceding ones is the six outer elements  color etc The concept that cognizes the preceding one is the six elements visual consciousness etc What is the example for that The dream  etc can be used as an example Thus in a dream where there is no object  nothing but a bare consciousness  various objects colors  sounds  smells  tastes and tangibles  houses  forests  lands and mountains appear however there is no real object there By this comparison it will be understood how not only in the dream but everywhere else  there is nothing but concept In the phrase the dream etc can be used as example the word etc should be understood as including other examples Let us agree that in the awake state as in the dream state  everything comes down to conceptonly But on emerging from the dream one has the feeling that the dream was just a concept Why does the same feeling not arise equally in the awake state It appears in those who are awakened by means of the knowledge of reality Just as the feeling of the nonobjectivity of the dream visions is lacking during the dream but appears after waking up in the same way the feeling of the nonobjectivity of the visions of the waking state is lacking in those who have not been awakened by the knowledge of reality but does appear in those whom this knowledge has awakened How can those who have not yet been awakened by the knowledge of reality understand the existence of concept only by deduction By scripture and by reasoning In the Daśabhūmika  the Bhagavat said This threefold world is nothing but mind And in the Saṃdhinirmocana  Maitreya asked Bhagavat are the images perceived during concentration different or not different from the mind that perceives them I have said that the object of consciousness is formed by concept only thus there is no external object Bhagavat if the images perceived during concentration are not different from the mind how can the mind grasp the mind itself The form and the image that one sees appear as two distinct things  whereas the image is nonexistent Similarly the mind that arises thus from causes and conditions and the images erceived in concentration seem to be different things whereas they are two aspects the one passive the other active of one and the same mind ii The reasoning is given as well by this āgama Thus when the mind is in concentration  whatever dharma image  blue  etc is seen it is the mind itself that is seen By means of this reasoning the Bodhisattva is able to deduce that at the basis of all notions  there is concept only and not objective reality At the basis of the image blue etc there can be no consciousness of memory because the object perceived in concentration is immediately present Arising from hearing and pondering  the consciousness of memory has the past as object therefore what it sees is concept only By this deduction  even if he is not yet awakened by the knowledge of reality  the bodhisattva can deduce the existence of concept only Bh ca bh ba U c u a At the basis of the image blue etc there can be no consciousness of memory because the object perceived in concentration is immediately present If the image perceived in concentration were the memory of some past day one ought to remember the particular place where the thing had been seen earlier as well as the earlier perception The knowledge resulting from meditation or concentration is a consciousness of the present the object seen by it is distinct and immediately present Objection If the distinctive feature of memory is to be a consciousness associated with the wisdom stemming from hearing and with the wisdom stemming from contemplation  its twofold object is distinct from consciousness Among the eleven concepts  ideas that are like a dream  we understand that the concept of the visual consciousness etc is mere concept  but how do we know that material ideas  eye etc If these are concept only why do they have a material appearance and form homogeneous and solid series Otherwise if these concepts arose without material appearance the error that consists of taking as an object that which is not an object would not occur If the error would not occur the afflictions constituting the obstacle of desire and the obstacle of knowledge would not occur If the afflictions would not occur purification also would not occur That is why it is necessary that these concepts arise in this way with a material appearance Here is a verse ca rūpavijñaptir iṣyate arūpiṇī ca vijñaptir abhāvāt syān na cetarā The cause of illusion and the illusion itself are respectively material concept and nonmaterial concept The cause of illusion is the concepts that develop similar to rūpa the illusion itself is the concepts of the nonmaterial development If causeconcepts did not develop in rūpa resultconcepts nionmaterial would not exist because without viṣaya there is no viṣhayin Briefly  according to a threefold aspect i According to unicity  because they have no object ii According to duality  because these concepts are supplied with image and vision iii According to arising as multiplicity  because they arise simultaneously with different aspects i Thus all these concepts are uniquely concept since they have no object ii They are twofold since they are supplied with image and vision Thus the concept of the eye etc has as image  the concept of color etc  as vision  the concept of visual consciousness  and so on up to the concept of body consciousness iii The concept of manas has as image all the concepts from the concept of eye up to that of dharma as vision it has the concept of mental consciousness  because the mental consciousness is concept and arises similar to all the concepts Here the prose and the verse explain how concept only is established because of three characteristics ii Because of duality The author establishes image and vision in one and the same consciousness In one and the same concept  there is one part that is image and a second part that is vision This is why the visual consciousness etc is twofold As image it has all the concepts from that of the eye which is the dominant power  to that of of dharma this is its image part The concept of mental consciousness which cognizes the object is its vision part  because this mental consciousness is universal concept and arises similar to all concepts In this third point relative to the mental consciousness only is there variety because the object which it grasps is not determinate The other consciousnesses have a determinate object and lack conceptualization But the mental consciousness is conceptual Therefore one attributes the third point to it alone namely the multiplicity of images and visions This is why it is enough to show that this consciousness is concept only arising on any support whatsoever the mental consciousness together with its various aspects takes on a twofold appearance namely the appearance of just an object and the appearance of a concept In the two worlds endowed with form  the mental consciousness relies on the body consequently as the material organs which are different from it and which rely on the body it appears everywhere in the aspect of the tangible The manas senses the object perceived by the five organs the manas is their refuge iii Similarly it is said Among the twelve āyatanas in question the six groups of consciousnesses are the manaāyatana Bh cb bh ab U cb u aa Some people think According to whether it relies on such and such an organ eye etc it takes such and such a name visual consciousness up to mental consciousness at the moment of its arising The conceptimages  being the image generating the vision  appear as object and play the rle of support of arising in regard to vision How does one explain that although it manifests the object does not exist As the Bhagavat has said When bodhisattvas have four qualities  ie four knowledges they understand the nonobjectivity of all concepts i Viruddhavijñānanimittatvajñāna knowledge that one and the same object is the cause of opposing consciousnesses Thus hungry ghosts  animals  humans and gods have differing concepts of one and the same thing Thus the past  the future  dream  reflection are perceived in the absence of any object For bodhisattvas and those in the dhyāna states who have attained mastery of mind  objects appear as they want them by the power of their aspiration Thus because of the close correspondence of the object with this threefold knowledge and for the other reasons given above it is proved that the object does not exist The Sautrāntikas have proved that the past and the future are cognized without being objects If one accepts that objects are really such as they are perceived one would understand the truth and beings would be delivered effortlessly Who have attained mastery of the mind who have attained aptitude of mind Because it calms the distractions of the mind  śamatha is tranquility who by a practice subsequent to tranquility  practice vipaśyanā of the dharmas sūtras etc one and the same object according to how it is considered appears to them with its set of characteristics impermanence suffering etc If the object really existed the acquisition of nonceptual knowledge would no longer be explained because the object would be seen as it is from the start i If the dependent nature is the conceptonly basis of the object  how is it dependent and why is it called dependent Because it stems from its own propensity seeds  it is dependent on conditions Because it is incapable of lasting by itself for a single moment after its arising it is called dependent ii If the imaginary nature is this manifestation of nonobject as object that is based on the dependent nature  how is it imaginary and why is it called imaginary Because it is the generating cause of errors of the mental consciousness of innumerable aspects or imagination  it is imaginary Because it has no nature of its own and is present as a pure imagination  it is called imaginary Because it is immutable  it is absolute Because it is the object of the purified mind and the quintessence of all good dharmas  it is rightly called absolute The absolute nature which is defined as the absence of parikalpita in the paratantra is the tathatā the true inalterable nature and the object of the nonerroneous mind An imagination and something imagined are required for an imaginary nature How does the imagination imagine It takes its object by means of the name it apprehends the characteristics in the dependent nature it adheres to them by wrong views  it emits voice by inspection it speaks by fourfold speech that which is seen etc  it imputes by attributing existence to a nonexistent thing This is how it imagines ii The imagined thing is the dependent nature because a part of this dependent nature the eye and the other nimittas is what is fabricated it adheres to its own mark because the grasping of characteristics is conceptualization  and it is in conformity with this conceptualization that it engages itself in speech It is after having inquired and judged that one speaks not without having inquired not without having judged It speaks by fourfold speech that which is seen etc it speaks by fourfold discourse that which is seen heard felt cognized Are these three natures different or are they the same They are neither different nor the same Insofar as it depends on something else ie the arising of the propensity seeds  Insofar as it does not exist in the absolute sense in the way it is imagined Bh c bh ab U ab u ab They are not different because the dependent nature and the imaginary nature are respectively existent and nonexistent It is the same for the dependent nature and the absolute nature which are impure and pure by nature respectively How many types are there in the dependent nature It is dependent because of this twofold dependency The imaginary nature also is twofold because it is imagined by the imagination creating a selfnature and by the imagination creating specifications Dependence consisting of a fundamental nondifferentiation in regard to defilement and purification because at the time of concept it is of defiled nature in the absence of concept  it is of purified nature The imagination creating a selfnature is that which seizes broadly the substrate furnished with attributes  the eye etc the imagination creating specifications is that which seizes in detail the various attributes of the thing The absoluteness of selfnature is the stained true nature the absoluteness of purity is the unstained true nature The mental construction belonging to wellendowed beings is that which belongs to beings who are skilled in speech The mental construction belonging to poorlyendowed beings is that which belongs to beings not skillful in speech ii Furthermore there are five mental constructions Nāma niśrityārthasvabhāvaparikalpaḥ by starting from the name to imagine the thing ie suchandsuch a word has suchand such a meaning by starting from both to invent both ie a thing of suchandsuch a type has suchandsuch a nature and suchandsuch a name those who having already used speech have at their disposal an instrument to express their mind poorlyendowed is the opposite this is in regard to oxen etc Although they have an imagination oxen are unable to express themselves in phonemes the concept which is the modification of that which has the aspect of an object ie the modifications brought about in the nimittābhāsa or the consciousnesses by the preceding modifications the distractionconcept ie the ten concepts of the bodhisattvas Bh ab bh ba U cb u ab these are the conceptions of visual consciousness etc equipped with their supports because they take the aspect of the object Modification of old age etc because old age modifies ideas to the material appearance includes sickness and death Modification by pleasant sensation etc because pleasant sensation modifies the body Modification by lust etc Thus it is said that the body changes under the action of cold It is the same for the modifications resulting from lust agony and the changes of the seasons Similarly among the damned and in the desire realm when the body changes the consciousness changes likewise In the formless realm also there are transformations caused by feelings etc These two vikalpas are associated the first with wrong views and the second with right views  respectively ix The vikalpa associated with the types of views which have as cause the wrong view of self is the vikalpa of the words earlier later and middle which is treated by the Brahmajālasūtra Those are the ten vikalpas of the bodhisattvas i In order to counteract the concept of nonexistence  it is said A bodhisattva being truly a bodhisattva ii In order to counteract the concept of existence  it is said sees no bodhisattva in the absolut sense does not see in the absolute sense the name of bodhisattva or the virtue of wisdom or whether he acts or does not act or form or feeling or perception or formation or consciousness v In order to counteract the concept of identity  it is said The emptiness of form is not form vi In order to counteract the concept of difference  it is said Outside of emptiness there is no form form is emptiness emptiness is form vii In order to counteract the concept of selfnature  it is said There is no arising no cessation no defilement no purification of selfnature ix In order to counteract the concept that is attached to interpreting the thing according to the name  it is said The name is fabricated But about the dharma of their conception they discuss it in exotic terms and they adhere to it as a result of this discursiveness x In order to counteract the conception that is attached to interpreting the name according to the thing  it is said Thus the entire content of the Prajñāpāramitās consists of an explanation about the distractions that are counteracted and the nonconceptual wisdom that counteracts them If in one sense the dependent nature merges with the three natures  why are these three natures not identical It is impossible that the thing is merged with the name because the notion does not exist prior to the name  because the name is multiple whereas the thing cannot be multiple because the name is indeterminate whereas the thing cannot be composite a Since the notion does not exist prior to the name since the name is multiple and indeterminate it is proved that the thing cannot be merged with the name that it is not multiple and that it is not composite ca niḥsaṃkleśaviśuddhitā māyādisadṛśī jñeyā ākāśasadṛī tathā The dharma does not exist but it is seen it has no stain but there is purification It is like magic etc  it is like space Because prior to the name the idea did not exist in the name it is impossible for the thing to merge with the name If the dependent and the imaginary were identical  it would be necessary that one would have the notion of the thing independently from the name  as for example for the pitcher If the word pitcher and the pitcher were identical the notion of pitcher would exist but since they are not identical this notion does not exist prior to the word Consequently it is contradictory that the name and the thing merge Here by name we mean the imaginary nature and by thing we mean the dependent nature It is by the power of the word that the dependent is imagined Moreover there are several names for a single thing If the name and the thing were identical the thing like the name should be multiple In this case the thing would have several natures But it is impossible that one and the same thing could have several natures Therefore if the two merged a second contradiction would result Finally the name is indeterminate the word puṅgava may be applied to nine different things If it were admitted that the name and the thing are identical it would be that several different things would constitute one and the same nature Thus there would result a third contradiction because it would have to be admitted that very different things  cows etc make up one and the same nature this first part of the stanza is explained to students by the example of magic If the dharma does not exist how can it be seen in the absence of stain how can there be purification Two examples answer these questions It is like magic etc The magical elephant does not exist as a true elephant nevertheless it is seen It is the same for things they are seen and yet they do not exist It is like space Space is not soiled by fog  etc because it is pure by nature nevertheless when the fog dissipates we say that space is purified It is the same for dharmas They are not stained because they are pure by nature nevertheless when the obstacles and adventitious stains are destroyed we say that the dharmas are purified If it does not such exist as it appears why is the dependent nature not completely nonexistent If the dependent and absolute natures did not exist defilement and purification would be absent But defilement and purification do exist Thus it is wrong that everything would be nonexistent Here is a stanza If the dependent and the absolute did not exist at all defilement and purification would not take place because stains are necessary for there to be purification In the Greater Vehicle the Buddha Bhagavats taught the Vaipulyasūtras in this teaching  it is said i How should the imaginary nature be conceived It should be conceived by proclaiming it as nonexistent ii How should the dependent nature be conceived iii How should the absolute nature be conceived It should be conceived by proclaiming the fourfold pure dharma The fourfold pure dharma is The essential purity  ie the true nature  emptiness  the utmost point of reality  the signless  the absolute  the fundamental element The stainless purity  ie the same essential purity as being free of all obstacles The purity of the object destined to give rise to the path  ie the teaching of the true Dharma of the Greater Vehicle Because this teaching is the cause for purity  it is not imaginary because it is the outflow of the pure fundamental element  it is not dependent All the pure dharmas result from from this fourfold purity śuddhiḥ prakṛtivaimalyam ālambanaṃ ca mārgatā viśuddhānāṃ hi dharmāṇāṃ caturvidhagṛhītatvam The purities are the essental purity the stainless purity the purity of the path and the purity of the object Indeed the pure dharmas come from these four natures The prakṛtivyavadāna is the true selfnature of ordinary people The tathatā being unchangeable  is the shared nature of all dharmas Why is the dependent nature proclaimed to be like a magic show etc In order to dispel all unjustified hesitation about this dependent nature in other people Why do others experience unjustified hesitations about it How can the mind and mental factors which have no object arise To dispel this hesitation the sūtra compares the dependent nature to an image In the absence of an object how can the different kinds of speech arise To dispel this hesitation the sūtra compares the dependent nature to an echo To dispel this hesitation the sūtra compares the dependent nature to the reflection of the moon in water viii They wonder In the absence of an object how can the bodhisattvas whose mind is unerring be reborn at will for the service of beings To dispel this hesitation the sūtra compares the dependent nature to a magic show i The magical elephant is not a real thing and yet it is perceived It is the same for the object ii Here the mind and mental factors play the rle of mirage and the object plays the role of the water While the mirage does shimmer  there is no real water  and yet the notion of real water is produced In the same way when the mind and mental factors shimmer there is no real object and yet the notion of object is produced iii In the dream there is no real object nevertheless one knows that various pleasant and unpleasant feelings are experienced it is not vii The moons reflection in water is not a real thing and yet thanks to the clearness and clarity of the water it is seen in the water It is the same for the concentrated mind The objects it perceives are not real things yet they are perceived Here concentration plays the part of the water because it is fresh and clear There is yet another meaning to these eight comparisons of the Bhagavat The example of the magic show serves to reject the six inner bases of consciousness  The example of the mirage serves to reject the receptacle world  The example of the dream serves to reject the objects of enjoyment color etc The example of the echo serves to reject the result of vocal action  The example of the reflection serves to reject the result of the mental action of nonconcentrated stages The example of the moon reflected in water serves to reject the result of mental action of the concentrated stages the commentary of Sūtrālaṃkāra XI With what intention did the Bhagavat say in the Brahmaparipṛcchā  that the Tathāgata does not see saṃsāra and does not see nirvāṇa Since the dependent nature is imaginary on the one hand and absolute on the other hand  by expressing himself in this way the Bhagavat had in mind the identity of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa Indeed in its imaginary part  this dependent nature is saṃsāra in its absolute part it is nirvāṇa However here we are talking about complete relativity  nondifference in order to destroy the erroneous adherence of foolish people to a difference in nature between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa In the Abhidharmasūtra the Bhagavat said There are three dharmas that which is part of defilement  that which is included in purity and that which is included in both What did he mean by speaking in this way The example of goldbearing clay Thus in goldbearing clay three things are noticed the earth element  the earth and the gold In the earth element the earth which is not there is seen  whereas the gold which is there is not seen When one has burned the earth element by means of fire  the earth does not appear whereas the gold appears The earth element when it appears as earth has a false appearance when it appears as gold it has a true appearance Consequently the earth element falls into both parts Similarly when one has not burned concept by the fire of nonconceptual wisdom the false imaginary nature contained in this concept appears whereas the true absolute nature does not appear When one has burned concept by the fire of nonconceptual wisdom  the true absolute nature contained in this concept appears while the false imaginary nature does not appear Consequently the dependent nature which consists as idea to wrong mental construction is included in both parts and is similar to the earth element in the goldbearing clay Thus in goldbearing clay The earth element is solidity the earth is form and appearance  respectively ordinary matter and derived matter the gold is the seed of gold In some places  the Bhagavat said that all dharmas are eternal elsewhere he said that they are transitory  and yet elsewhere he said that they are neither eternal nor transitory What was his intention in proclaiming them to be eternal The dependent nature is eternal in its absolute part  transitory in its imaginary part  neither eternal nor transitory in its two parts together It was with this intention that the Bhagavat spoke in this way happiness  sadness and their advaya goodness  malice and their advaya emptiness  nonemptiness and their advaya the self  the nonself and their advaya tranquility  nontranquility and their advaya the thing with selfnature  the thing without selfnature and their advaya that which arises  the nonarisen and their advaya that which has been destroyed  the nondestroyed and their advaya primordial tranquility  primordial nontranquility and their advaya the essentially nirvanized  the nonessentially nirvanized and their advaya saṃsāra nirvāṇa and their advaya etc In these distinctions  all the enigmas posed by the Bhagavats should be understood in the light of the three selfnatures as the teaching on the eternal noneternal etc Here are some stanzas Since dharmas are nonexistent since they appear in many aspects  there is neither dharma nor adharma Thus nonduality is proclaimed On the one hand  it is proclaimed that they do not exist on the other hand ot os proclaimed that they do exist From both sides it is proclaimed that they are neither existent nor nonexistent They are not such as they appear this is why they are proclaimed to be nonexistent But because nevertheless they do appear for this reason they are proclaimed to be existent niḥsvabhāvatayā siddhā uttarottaraniśrayāt anutpādānirodhāḍiśantiprakṛtinirvṛtiḥ The fact results gradually from their absence of selfnature that they have neither arising nor destruction that they are primordially tranquil and essentially nirvanized On the one hand ie from the one extreme  it is asserted that they do not exist that they are without selfnature from the other extreme it is asserted that they do exist that they do have selfnature From both sides it is asserted that they are neither existent nor nonexistent by considering the paratantra that partakes of both natures at the same time  it is asserted that they are neither existent nor nonexistent this is why they are asserted to be nonexistent but because it is said that they exist insofar as they are simply appearance  they are asserted to be existent for this reason Now it will be shown in what sense it is asserted that all dharmas are without selfnature Because they do not exist in themselves because all dharmas do not arise by themselves  independent of conditions that is the first meaning of the expression without selfnature Because they do not exist by way of their selfnature Because once they are destroyed since the dharmas do not rearise out of their own nature of self  they are without selfnature that is another meaning of the expression without selfnature Because they do not persist in their selfnature Because once arisen they do not have the power to last for a single moment afterwards they are without selfnature These three absences of selfnature of dharmas are shared with the śrāvakas The dharmas do not exist with the imaginary nature which foolish people cling to And it is in this sense that here in the Greater Vehicle we say that all dharmas are without selfnature From their absence of selfnature there results the fact from the fact that all dharmas are without selfnature it results that they are unborn etc indeed that which is without selfnature is unborn that which is unborn is unceasing that which is unborn and unceasing is primordially tranquil that which is primordially tranquil is essentially nirvanized Furthermore all of the Buddhas words should be understood in the light of four purposes and four intentions By merely invoking the name of the Tathāgata Bahuratna one is predestined to supreme complete enlightenment bahuratnasya tathāgatasya nāmadheyagrahaṇamātreṇa niyato bhavaty anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau When one will have served as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges then one will understand the Greater Vehicle iyato gaṅgānadīvālukāsamānabuddhān paryupāsya mahāyāne vabodha utpadyate intention dealing with the individuals dispositions eg when he criticized in one person the gift which he had praised in another person yat tad eva dānaṃ kasyacit pudgalasya praśaṃsate kasyacid vigarhate These are the four intentions the motive of introduction when in the Vehicle of the śrāvakas and in the Greater Vehicle from the point of view of conventional truth  he deals with the existence respectively of the individual  of the selfnature and of the specifications of dharmas the motive of nature when in speaking of the nature of dharmas he explains their threefold selfnature asāre sāramatayo viparyāse ca susthitāḥ kleśena ca susaṃkliṣṭā labhante bodhim uttamām Taking as solid that which is not solid completely stuck in error completely stained by desire they attain supreme enlightenment When the Buddha first cognizes the thing and then says it to someone else that is abhiprāya When from this clarification  he succeeds in introducing it into the holy doctrine  that is abhisaṃdhi Similarly when one discovers a resemblance with someone else one says Thats me But it is clear that the Buddha Vipaśvin of the past is not the actual akyamuni Bhagavat It is not enough to invoke a name to attain supreme enlightenment definitively Similarly when we say that a paṇa is worth a thousand paṇas we mean that some day or at some other time this paṇa will be the cause of a thousand paṇas When you have served as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges you will understand the Greater Vehicle because the holy Dharma  knowable by ones own intuition  is difficult to understand By these words the Bhagavat forbade the literal interpreting of the Greater Vehicle First the Bhagavat praises a gift made by the miser  then he criticizes the same gift made by a generous man First the Bhagavat praises the discipline of the undisciplined person  then he criticizes the same displine of the honest person in order to lead the latter to the cultivation of a higher category of good A certain meditation ie worldly meditation As introduction into the Greater Vehicle and as reassurance to those who fear annihilation  he says that the mind is eternal etc The motivation of interpretation is the wish to say somthing other than what one is saying Because concentration is not strong and because distraction is difficult to overcome concentration is called asāra The phrase viparyāse ca susthitāḥ means well settled in the opposite of errors Taking that which is not eternal to be eternal  etc is error taking that which is not eternal to be noneternal is the opposite of error That is what they are well established in In the phrase kleśena susaṃkliṣṭāḥ kleśa means effort  fatigue completely fatigued by effort and by the length of the time they have set for themselves in the interest of beings This is as in the phrase He abides in the long kleśa of saṃsāra but only out of great compassion The phrase labhante bodhim uttamām is easy to understand He who wishes to explain the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle in brief must express himself in three points i he must give an explanation of dependent production  ii an explanation of the nature of dharmas resulting from dependence and iii an explanation of the meaning of the discourses i First an explanation of dependent production  by saying for example Dharmas result from speechpropensities and the latter from the former ii The dharmas that are active consciousnesses have concept equipped with image and vision as nature As characteristics  they have the basis  the imaginary nature and the absolute nature  the nature of things this is how the characteristics of the threefold selfnature itself are explained as for example when one says Resulting from concept furnished with image and vision these dharmas have three natures How should the natures of these dharmas be explained In the dependent nature  the imaginary nature does not exist but the absolute nature is present Thus by someone who does not see the truth and by someone who does see it these two natures imaginary and absolute are simultaneously not perceived or perceived as existent and nonexistent respectively That is why when it arises if one perceives its imaginary nature one does not perceive its absolute nature if one perceives its absolute nature one does not perceive its imaginary nature In the dependent the imaginary is absent but the absolute is present there That is why in the dependent these two natures imaginary and absolute nonperceived and perceived are the same Of these two natures the first is nonexistent the second is existent He who has not seen the truth sees the parikalpita but does not see the pariniṣpanna He who has seen the truth  sees at one and the same moment the pariniṣpanna and does not see the parikalpita This idea has been explained in the stanza Now the meaning of the uttered phrases must be explained according to the intention of the authors The Buddhas intellect is very pure this first phrase is explained by the other phrases for a good explanation consists of explaining one and the same quality by numerous qualities This is not like the śrāvakas etc their wisdom is twofold sometimes encountering an obstacle sometimes not encountering an obstacle or it moves in duality This tathatā possesses an absolute nature  it does not possess imaginary nature it does not have a nature of nonexistence because it really exists it does not have a nature of existence because it is not as it is imagined this pertains to the high purity of the tathatā for of all the dharmas it occupies first place because it is free of all adventitious stains the Buddha dwells in the abodes of Buddha The Buddha does not exert any effort in all his activities and he can abide amongst beings uninterruptedly as is suitable in a stable manner in the abodes of the āryas devas and Brahma Identity of activities because all the Buddhas procure the interest of others by means of their saṃbhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya Having practiced the noble path which counteracts every obstacle of passion every obstacle to knowledge and which consists of universal knowledge and mastery of concentration  the Buddha has reached a state that is the basis of the suppression of any traces of obstacles the domain of the Buddha cannot be diminished The inconceivability of what the Buddha establishes is a quality connected as above the Buddha penetrates the sameness of the three times the knowledge of the Buddha concerns everything without there being any doubt In the equalized dharmakāya the virtues that are in the fruitional state are perfected The Buddha not having this twofold samudācāra possesses the perfection of knowledge Wishing to explain the perfection of altruism and to show that the Buddha possesses the means to counteract all the obstacles that fetter the beings to be disciplined  next it is said To remove this doubt it is then said he has reached the summit of the unadulterated liberating knowledge of the Tathāgata Purity and absence of all empty proliferation are the natures of the dharmadhātu a They do not abandon beings given to good or bad practices they have precise language they esteem the truth they are preceded by the mind of enlightenment The phrase They have as their lofty predisposition the accomplishing of benefit and happiness for all beings is explained by sixteen actions  which are b Disinterested action defined by the three phrases of no It consists of absence of selfinterested views  absence of fondness for benefactors and aversion for evildoers  continuity in later existences b Equality of action in regard to fortunate unfortunate neither fortunate nor unfortunate beings b Action without retreating b Action of perfect effort defined by the eight phrases of It consists of serving good people  hearing the true doctrine  living in the forest  fleeing from bad distractions  the quality of reflection defined in no There can be happiness without there being benefit eg among beings of desire who enjoy all kinds of reprehensible objects What shall I do so that all beings may obtain benefit and supreme happiness They introduce beings into omniscience this is explained by the action of successive effort  like a lamp that transmits the flame to a thousand lamps By virtue of this action the lofty predisposition of working for the benefit and happiness of beings succeeds in manifesting this is explained by the action of personal effort independent of others invitation If lovingkindness is practiced while one is based on biased affection one experiences fondness for ones friends and revulsion for ones enemies the predispositions are not impartial They express themselves in moderate words with a smiling face this is explained by the twofold action of body and speech conforming to the lofty predisposition of working for the welfare and happiness of all beings Their great compassion is unlimited this is explained by equal action towards unfortunate fortunate and neither fortunate nor unfortunate beings If they felt compassion only for the unfortunate and not for the fortunate or indiffererent beings as well their action would not be equal for they would be acting with bias this is explained by action that does not turn back  for the bad actions of beings to be converted cannot deter them from acting in conformity with their lofty predisposition of working for the welfare and happiness of beings They are insatiable in listening and insatiable to the doctrine this is explained by action that consists of providing oneself with means They see the faults of their own errors and reprimand the faults of others without anger this is explained by action tending to expel that which is to be counteracted this is explained by the action consisting of ceaselessly reflecting on this thought  for they continually cultivate the mind of enlightenment in all their activities Thus it is said in the Gocarapariśuddhisūtra The six phrases of b To do that is to avoid the evil preoccupations associated with desire  etc They practice the four immeasurables  they play with the five supernatural faculties  they take refuge in knowledge this is explained by perfect action Individual knowledge is called refuge in knowledge this is not the awareness of a simple object  but it is taking refuge in ones own vijñāna like the other phrases of a this one is explained by stabilizing action and the four phrases of The stabilization of the lofty predisposition of acting for the welfare and happiness of beings is an action that is why one speaks of the stabilizing action Sending away dishonest people and gathering honest people bodhisattvas wish alike to cause them to leave the bad states and introduce them into the good states this is not to abandon them To accumulate wealth or to accumulate the doctrine is the same thing Embraced by the mind of enlightenment bodhisattvas in all their activities are without desire and do not seek the offerings of others etc sarvavyavahārāṇām eva prag brahātmatāvijñanāt satyatvoppatteḥ svapnavyavahārasyeva prāk prabodhāt idem ad Brahmasūtra  III  The thesis of Asaṅga is repeated by Dharmapāla who refers to Saṃgraha cf On the development of the ālaya cf ālayavijñānaṃ

into the natures of the knowable The bodhisattva who has perfumed his mental series by means of the great hearing of the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle who has served innumerable Buddha avatars  who with single faith  has fully accumulated the roots of good  and has thus fully accomplished the accumulations of merit and wisdom with the great hearing derived from the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle he has perfumed his series Who has served innumerable Buddha avatars thanks to this series thus perfumed he has been able to meet and serve the avatars of the Buddas having served the Buddhas he has developed profound faith in the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle from which bad friends are unable to turn him away For these three reasons ie great hearing of the Greater Vehicle etc he has accumulated innumerable roots of good Thus he is called a bodhisattva endowed with merit and wisdom Now the author is going to explain the categories and aspects of the entry These mental words have the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle as the cause of their arising ie this doctrine is the cause which gives birth to them Others enter into the path of seeing because they penetrate this word correctly To penetrate correctly is to understand that it is without dharma or artha without grāhya or grāhaka by putting to work the roots of good  by rousing his courage in three ways  by eliminating four blockages  by being zealous in a continuous and respectful effort applied to tranquility and insight concerning the texts ands theses How does he enter By putting to work the powers of the roots of good etc continuous  ie eternally used respectful  ie deferential The expression sātatyasatkṛtyaprayoga occurs in Sūtrālaṃkāra X  p i The bodhisattva thinksInnumerable human beings in innumerable universes reach supreme perfect enlightenment each moment It is with these intentions that beings practice generosity and the other perfections I too am going to attain such intentions By means of them I shall cultivate the perfections without too much trouble and I shall reach perfection This reflection consitututes the second stimulant As for myself admirably endowed with limitless moral good  why should I not obtain universal perfection at that moment This is the third reflection In order to counteract the threefold discouragement it suffices to practice the threefold stimulant If the bodhisattva hears it said that the supreme perfect enlightenment is great  profound  vast and difficult to obtain  his courage sags To counteract this discouragement he practices the stimulants This explains the first stimulant This explains the second stimulant By means of them without too much trouble I will cultivate the virtues and come to perfection This explains the third stimulant It is with the intentions of a pure mind that generosity is practiced etc Generosity is not practiced with a bad mind or a morally indeterminate mind etc Some people practice generosity with a bad mind a morally indeterminate mind or a distracted mind because they are looking for certain forms of existence or wealth The Victorious Ones who have acquired them can develop generosity etc The bodhisattvas are called victorious because they have already acquired these high intentions By means of them the perfections of generosity etc Good people after their death etc As for those very good ones who have cut through the obstacles ie who are good without any obstacles why should they not obtain the perfected perfections By abandoning perplexity and hesitation  he rejects any doubt regarding the Greater Vehicle By abandoning adhesion to dharmas  he rejects adhesion to the belief in me and belief in mine in regard to dharmas heard and thought By abandoning concepts  he arrives at no longer meditating  no longer conceiving any object directly present or prepresented in concentration Now the author explains the abandonment of the four blockages  he rejects the thoughts customary to the Vehicles of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas By suppressing perplexity and hesitation he suppresses perplexity  error and doubt concerning the depth and vastness of the Greater Vehicle By abandoning adherence in regard to dharmas heard and thought he cuts through the belief in me and mine He enters as a result of mental discourse derived from the hearingpropensity resulting from correct attention  which has the appearance of texts and theses that are equipped with vision Thus the bodhisattva who makes the effort to enter into Conceptonly understands  with regard to mental words that appear as phonemes and theses  that the namephoneme is only a mental word he understands that the entity based on this namephoneme is only a mental word he understands that the selfnature and the specifications attributed to this name or this entity are mere designations When he sees the name and phoneme as merely a simple mental word he sees that the selfnature and characteristics attributed to this name or this entity are purely designations since the selfnature and the characteristics are without objective nature  they are also nonexistent First one finds that the selfnature and the characterstics attributed to the name or the thing are mererly designation next one knows correctly that all of that is nonexistent absolutely At the moment of the discovery  there is examination at the moment one knows correctly that that does not exist there is the fourfold correct knowledge One enters in the same way that one identifies a rope which seems in the darkness to be a snake Since it does not exist the snake seen in the rope is an illusion Those who have recognized that it does not exist reject the notion of snake and keep the notion of rope But the rope itself if reduced to its subtle elements  is an illusion itself for it has color  smell  taste and tactile as specific characteristics Thus when any reality has been denied to the six types of mental words which appear as phoneme or as thing just as the notion of snake is abandoned by means of the notion of rope the notion of ConceptOnly underlying the mental words should be abandoned by means of the notion of the absolute nature  just as the notion of rope is abandoned by means of the notion of color etc Duality of image and vision means the consciousness furnished with image and vision That which appears as the cause or the object of the consciousness is called image this consciousness which is single manifests in the form of various aspects These manifestations are simultaneous it is not a question of separate manifestations in accordance with an accelerated process These three points constitute the entrance by this comparison the author shows how one penentrates the three natures Similarly the notion of parikalpita ie the six objects is abandoned by means of the notion of paratantra which is defined as ConceptOnly Thus by entering into the mental speech which is the apparent object  the bodhisattva has entered into the imaginary nature by entering into ConceptOnly  he has entered into the dependent nature how does he enter into the absolute nature He enters by abandoning even the notion of ConceptOnly Then for the bodhisattva who has destroyed the notion of object  the mental words resulting from the propensity of the dharmas that have been heard have no possibility of arising in the appearance of an object and consequently no longer arise as an idea either When the bodhisattva abides in namewithoutconcept in regard to all objects  when he abides in the fundamental element by means of direct perception  then he attains the nonconceptual knowledge in which the object and the subject of consciousness are completely identical This is how the bodhisattva enters into the absolute nature he understands that it is the mental speech that appears as object and that the imaginary object does not exist thus he has entered into the imaginary nature And consequently no longer arise as idea either because if the object of consciousness does not exist the subject of consciousness does not exist either ConceptOnly in turn cannot develop an object Thus it is said that everything is but a name and that this name can produce everything these are the various domains of name names occuring in the Buddhist teachings  eg Devadatta etc Dharmānusārin  etc sūtra geya etc the vowels and consonants that are the cause of language Aśuddhanāman  eg uddhanāman  eg the āryas who have effaced the stains prajñāpāramitā the ten bhūmis etc which have as object a mixture Thus this bodhisattva by entering into ConceptOnly  has entered into the natures of the knowable By means of this entry he has entered into the first bhūmi the Joyous  he penetrates thoroughly the fundamental element  he is born into the family of the Tathāgatas  he acquires the mind of equality in regard to all beings  in regard to all the bodhisattvas and in regard to all the Buddhas Such is the path of seeing Bh b bh b U b u ab He is born into the family of the Tathāgatas he causes his Buddhafamily to be unbroken By family of the Tathāgatas is meant the dharmadhātu of the Buddha Because the bodhisattva has the excellent knowledge concerning the dharmadhātu because he transforms his former individuality and acquires a new one he causes his seeds of Buddha to be unbroken He acquires the mind of sameness in regard to all beings because he sees that all these beings are alike without self He acquires the mind of equality with regard to all the bodhisattvas because he knows the identity of their predispositions These bodhisattvas are all prepared to bring about the welfare and happiness of all beings He acquires the mind of equality with regard to all the Buddhas because he knows their identity of dharmakāya Again for what reason does he enter into ConceptOnly By means of a supramundane cognition of tranquility and discernment concerning mixed dharmas  by a subsequent cognition of every type of concept  cutting all the seeds of the storeconsciousness with their images  the bodhisattva cultivates the seed of contact with the dharmadhātu This subsequent cognition  which considers every creation coming from the storeconsciousness and every object of concept as a magic show  etc is in its essence free of errors Thus in the same way that the magician is free of doubt about the things produced by magic  so this bodhisattva is always unmistaken when he speaks of cause and result In the end he answers that it is aimed at obtaining the omniscience needed to bring about the welfare and happiness of beings to be converted he establishes that the dharmas with their nature of cause and result whether of inferior or superior order are merely concepts of grāhya and grāhaka In speaking of every object of concept he mentions result The subsequent cognition that takes them as a magical show etc is free of error by essence because by considering in accordance with the truth the dependent nature as a magical show etc one avoids error In the course of this entry into ConceptOnly  there are four factors leading to penetration which rest on four concentrations By the four investigations during the lesser patient acceptances regarding the nonexistence of the object  there is a concentration called acquisition of light which is the basis for the factor leading to penetration called heat During the greater patient acceptance regarding the nonexistence of the object  there is a concentration called increase of light which is the basis of the summit state In the course of the four correct cognitions  the entry into ConceptOnly and the certainty of the nonexistence of the object constitute the concentration penetrating a part of reality it is the basis of the patient acceptance furthering the truth Next  the abandonment of the concept of ConceptOnly constitutes the concentration immediately preceding the path of seeing it is the basis of the highest worldly dharmas Everywhere at the time of arriving at complete understanding  there are four factors leading to penetration  Concentration is the support ie the cause of this factor of penetration Penetration means complete understanding factor of penetration means the patient acceptance of the nonexistence of self of dharmas  Thus the bodhisattva has entered into the bhūmis has acquired the path of seeing and has entered into ConceptOnly How does he practice the path of meditation In the ten bodhisattva bhūmis as they are described and that are the totality of all the sūtras the bodhisattva practices  over the course of many thousands of cosmic periods  the supramundane gnosis of tranquility and discrimination concerning mixed dharmas  as well as the subsequent cognition In that way he transforms his basis then he exerts himself to attain the three bodies of the Buddha Bh a bh ab U b u a In the ten bodhisattva bhūmis as they are described in the ten bodhiattva bhūmis according to the decription given it concerns the general characteristic and does not have concepts as object It is a supramundane cognition ie an nonconceptual wisdom The subsequent cognition is a descriptive cognition We cannot say that it is simply mundane because it is not exercised in the world Nor can we say that it is exclusively supramundane because it manifests in conformity with the world That is why it cannot be defined with precision over the course of many periods  he cultivates nonconceptual wisdom and subsequent cognition and thus reaches the transformation of the support  ie the purification of his mental series Then he exerts himself to attain the three bodies of the Buddha this will be explained at length below What is the difference between the two realizations  that of the śrāvakas and that of the bodhisattvas The abhisamaya of the bodhisattva is distinguished from that of the śrāvakas by way of ten superiorities lambanaviśeṣa by its object because it concerns the Greater Vehicle Nirvāṇaviśeṣa by its nirvāṇa because it takes possession of of the nonstable nirvāṇa Pariśuddhiviśeṣa by its purity because it abandons the propensities of the passions and purifies the buddhafields Svaparasamacittatāprāptiviśeṣa by the acquisition of the mind of equality with respect to self and others because it never ceases to endeavor to ripen beings Janmaviśeṣa by its arising because it arises in the tathāgata family Upapattiviśeṣa by its appearances because it always appears in the assemblies surrounding the Buddhas Phalaviśeṣa by its results because it bears fruit having innumerable qualities the ten powers  the fearlessnesses  the attributes special to the Buddha The bodhisattva abhisamaya using both compassion and wisdom as means  has as nirvāṇa the fact of not dwelling in either saṃsāra or nirvāṇa The bodhisattva abhisamaya cuts through the afflictions with their predispositions it is able to purify all the buddhafields ii By correct cognition  we see that the object does not exist that there is just a threefold concept The object being nonexistent the threefold concept does not exist either and we enter into the three natures In these two stanzas the author recapitualtes the investigations and their results the yathābhūtaparijñana in order to facilitate understanding i Investigation concerns the mutual independence of the name and the entity the name is independent of the entity and likewise the entity is independent of the name This is not the theory of those who want the word and the entity to be always joined  arising simultaneously ii By means of correct cognition This is a matter of the four correct cognitions resulting from the four investigations as was said above  we enter into the three natures Stanzas of instruction taken from the Yogavibhaṅgaśāstra i The concentrated bodhisattva sees that images are merely mind Driving away the notion of object  he understands that just his mind exists ii Abiding thus in the inner mind  he knows that the cognized object does not exist consequently he knows that the cognizing subject does not exist either Later he experiences nonperception i The concentrated bodhisattva sees that images are merely mind he sees that the images perceived in concentration in the appearance of texts and theses are just his inner mind As the sūtra comments Here bodhisattva means the one who sees ii Thus he abides in the inner mind ie at this moment his mind dwells in mind itself He understands that the cognized object does not exist consequently he knows that the cognizing subject does not exist either i saṃbhṛtya saṃbhāram anantapāraṃ jñānasya puṇyasya ca bodhisattvaḥ dharmeṣu cintāsuviniścitatvāj jalpānvayām arthagatiṃ paraiti Having collected a limitless accumulation of wisdom and merit having reached complete certainty of the texts by reflection the bodhisattva understands that the object has its origin in speech ii arthān sa vijñāya ca jalpamātrān saṃtiṣṭhate tannibhacittamātre pratyakṣatām eti ca dharmadhātus tasmād viyukto dvayatakṣaṇena Having recognized that objects are nothing other than words he settles into ConceptOnly appearing as object The wise person who has

mahāgadeneva viṣaṃ nirasyate In the wise person by the power of the conceptfree cognition that always accompanies equality everywhere the basis a mass of errors like a thicket is driven out just as

law prescribed by the Sage fixing his mind in the fundamentalelementroot understanding that the activity of memory is only concept the brave bodhisattva rapidly reaches the other shore of the ocean of qualities The first three perfections  generosity  etc are the accumulation of merit The sixth the perfection of wisdom  is the accumulation of wisdom Zeal  effort penetrates both accumulations Indeed the bodhisattva has attained certainty By means of his intellect he understands that that nothing other than his mind exists that is why he recognized the nonexistence of mind itself He knows that nowhere is there any perceived object outside of the mind Since this object does not exist the mind which perceives it does not exist either Saṃtiṣṭhā means to rest in equality Completely free of grāhya and grāhaka the dharmadhātu is beyond duality The dharmadhātu perceived in this way is not false it is a true dharmadhātu iv In the wise person by the power of nonconceptual cognition akalpanājñānabalena dhīmataḥ by the power contained in this nonconceptual cognition of the bodhisattvas Seeing an identity of nature like space in the dharmas sūtras etc this knowkedge accomapanies equality It accompanies it always  ie throughout all time It is a heap of faults because the propensities of the faults  ie the defiled dharmas are piled up there It is like a thicket because it is hard to penetrate As poison is expelled by a powerful antidote He fixes his mind on the holy dharma that is welltaught  taught by the Buddha and on the dharmadhāturoot The brave bodhisattva rapidly attains the other shore of the ocean of qualities by means of realization which is gradually developed by nonconceptual knowledge and subsequent cognition  the bodhisattvas rapidly attain the perfection of all the qualities  ie buddhahood List of six abhisamayas in Vikhyāpanā T  k The bodhisattva is not attached to pleasures  does not transgress against morality  is not disturbed by suffering  is not lazy in practice abandoning the causes of distraction and fixing his mind onepointedly  he correctly analyzes dharmas and based on these six virtues he enters into ConceptOnly Having entered into ConceptOnly the bodhisattva acquires the six virtues contained in the high pure aspiration Thus without even making an effort to practice the six virtues the bodhisattva develops the six virtues in a continous uninterrupted manner by means of his adherence to the teachings  by means of his contemplation of kindness  acceptance and rejoicing  and arrives at perfection this is to say In the future I hope that I and others will never abandon these virtues and will bring them to perfection Previously and at present in the unfolding of the law they see the Buddhas They understand that enlightenment is close and they attain it without difficulty These stanzas explain the group of characteristics of the pure aspiration in its eight aspects  namely accumulation  patient acceptance  object  reflection  antidote  selfnature  prediction and advantages The lines of the stanzas should be understood in this order the object of the high aspiration is the profound and vast doctrine of the Greater Vehicle Their zeal and adherence being pure their aspiration is pure Previously and at present in the unfolding of the law they see the Buddhas Previously ie prior to the purity of aspiration now ie during this purity of aspiration They see the Buddhas this is the prediction ie in the state of absorption they understand that enlightenment is close for they attain it without difficulty In this state they see that enlightenment will soon be acquired Using superior means  they attain it without difficulty Why are there only six pāramitās There are six because they were established to counteract the opposing vices  because they are the source of acquiring all the Buddha attributes and because they promote the ripening of all beings The causes of withdrawing are the pain resulting from the bad treatment imposed on transmigrating beings and the fatigue resulting from the long practice of the good The causes of destruction are distraction and false wisdom Thus the virtues are established as six in number in order to counteract the opposing vices Since these virtues are the source of acquiring all the attributes of Buddha therefore they are are fixed in number as six thus by these beneficial causes  beings gain the aptitude for maturation Next by the virtue of meditation which concentrates the unconcentrated mind  and by the virtue of wisdom which liberates the concentrated mind  these beings who have listened to the preaching are ripe Thus since these virtues promote the maturation of all beings  they are fixed as six in number Nature of the pāramitās How is their nature to be thought of As consisting of six excellences i Excellence of support  because they have the mind of enlightenment as basis iii Excellence of function  because they have as their duty the welfare and happiness of all beings  iv Excellence of skilful means  because they are contained in intuitive wisdom v Excellence of application  because they are applied to supreme perfect enlightenment vi Excellence of purity  because they ensure the suppression of the obstacle of desire and the obstacle to wisdom These four alternatives apply in turn to the other virtues in the same way as to generosity Ordinary people śrāvakas as well etc are also familiar with generosity this is why it is absolutely necessary to clarify what nature makes generosity a virtue ii Excellence in resource Not everyone puts to work all inner and outer resources Only the bodhisattva can put them to work Thus generosity is triply pure  because it rejects any concept about the thing given  the donor and the receiver Here are the four envisaged alternatives Order of the pāramitās i It drives away avarice and poverty it brings great wealth and an accumulation of merit this is generosity ii It calms immorality and the bad destinies it brings good destinies and the concentrations this is morality iii It destroys anger and enmity it accomplishes good for self and others this is patience iv It frees from laziness  from wrongsoing and unwholesome dharmas it ensures the growth of innumerable wholesome dharmas this is zeal vi It suppresses all erroneous views and all wrong knowledge it understands dharmas correctly and in all ways this is wisdom by transcending all the roots of good of ordinary people of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas they reach the other shore This is why they are called pāramitā Thus generosity at the moment of cause  drives away avarice and poverty at the moment of fruit  it brings great riches and an accumulation of merit In brief  there are five cultivations i cultivation preparatory to practice  ii development of faith  iii development of contemplation  iv development of skill in means  v development of the accomplishment of the virtues to be practiced For the first four cultivations see above the spontaneous activity of the Buddhas is uninterrupted they cultivate the virtues even when their virtues are perfected The development of contemplation consists of cultivating the contemplations of kindness  of symapthetic joy and of rejoicing  by incorporating them into the six dispositions insatiable disposition  disposition lasting for a long time  joyous disposition  beneficent disposition  magnanimous disposition and holy disposition i Considering all the incalculable periods that extend up until the attainment of supreme complete enlightenment as one single moment the bodhisattva would like to sacrifice his own body at every moment filling universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges with the seven jewels the bodhisattva would like to offer them as a gift to the Tathāgatas such is his conduct until he is seated on the throne of enlightenment because the disposition for generosity of the bodhisattva is insatiable yad bodhisattva yāvanto saṃkhyeyakalpā yair anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhāv abhisaṃbudhyate tāvata ekakṣaṇīkṛtya pratikṣaṇam ātmabhāvaṃ parityajet evaṃ ca gaṅgānadīvālukāsamān

postures in the trichiliomegachiliocosm filled with fire even deprived of every resource he would wish to keep the thought of morality patience zeal meditation wisdom in his mind such is his conduct until he is seated on the throne of enlightenment for the bodhisattvas disposition for morality patience zeal meditation wisdom is insatiable Such is the bodhisattvas insatiable disposition Until he sits on the throne of enlightenment the bodhisattva does not abandon this insatiable disposition Such is his longenduring disposition By helping beings by means of the six virtues the bodhisattva is more joyful than the beings whom he has helped It is not the same for the latter Such is the bodhisattvas joyful disposition The bodhisattva considers the beings whom he helps by means of the six virtues as more beneficent than himself and thinks of himself as less beneficent than them Such is the beneficent disposition of the bodhisattva The bodhisattva applies all the roots of good that he has thus accumulated by means of these six virtues to beings so that they may obtain the reward they wish for Such is the bodhisattvas magnanimous disposition The bodhisattva shares all the roots of good that he has thus accumulated by means of the six virtues among all beings and applies them to supreme complete enlightenment Such is the holy disposition of the bodhisattva This is how the bodhisattva cultivates the contemplation of kindness incorporated into the six dispositions ii The bodhisattva is in agreement with the roots of good of the innumerable bodhisattvas who devote themselves to developing these six dispositions This is how the bodhisattva cultivates the contemplation of sympathetic joy incorporated into the six dispositions iii Finally the bodhisattva rejoices in seeing all beings cultivate the six virtues contained in these six dispositions and wishes that he himself will never abandon the development of these six virtues as long as he is not seated on the throne of enlightenment This is how the bodhisattva cultivates the contemplation of rejoicing incorporated in the six virtues All who hear about the development of contemplation by the bodhisattva a development incorporated in the six dispositions and who produce a mind of faith  acquire infinite merit and destroy all the obstacles of their wrongdoings What then could be said of the bodhisattvas themselves Bh bc bh ab U bc u bb Cultivation is repeated pratice There are five kinds of cultivation i Cultivation prepratory to practice This is the nonerroneous practice of generosity etc ii The development of aspiration is to produce aspiration by means of faith and zeal  by adhering trustfully to the holy doctrine of the Buddha and by showing zeal Each is of three types i Generosity of the Dharma  material generosity and generosity of safety ii Morality of abstention  morality of collecting the wholesome dharmas and morality for the service of others iii Patience to bear abuse  patience to accept suffering and patience to contemplate the Dharma Each virtue is subdivided into three types and the author explains their specific characteristics Generosity of the Dharma serves to strengthen the roots of good in others material generosity serves to strengthen the body of others and generosity of safety serves to strengthen the minds of others Patience to contemplate the Dharma the basis for the two preceding patiences at the time of acting  to develop the effort conforming to aspirations It is without timidity because it does not step back in the face of fatigue it is without withdrawal because its courage does not yield before the insults of another it is insatiable because in the interval leading up to enlightenment it energetically develops the wholesome without yielding to laziness Utsāhi dṛdhaparākramo anikṣiptadhuraḥ kuśalehu dharmeṣu ie courageous firm in its march not rejecting the the yoke of accomplishing wholesome dharmas For this threefold wisdom see chap These virtues contain all the wholesome dharmas insofar as they have virtue as their nature they promote the virtues and are their outcome Here by wholesome dharmas is meant all the factors of awakening thus faith  truth  etc promote virtue thus the six superknowledges  the ten powers and the other qualities are derived from the virtues Insofar as they have these vices as their nature  that they are their cause and their fruit they have desire  etc as their characteristic They are the cause of these vices they are the cause of avarice etc ie lack of faith  wrong views  etc are the cause of avarice etc They are the fruit of these vices they are the fruit of avarice immorality anger etc In the course of transmigration  the bodhisattvas take possession of the following benefits mastery  high birth  great entourage of followers and servants  successful efforts in a great work  absence of torment and the weak afflictions  skill in the arts letters and classical sciences this happiness is impeccable  lasts until the attainment of the throne of enlightenment  is devoted to the service of all beings it consitutes the benefits of the bodhisattvas Bh bc bh ab U c u ba this is not so for the heretics they have happiness but it is reprehensible Moreover their happiness is transitory whereas the fruits of the virtues are eternal it is affirmed that they last until the attainment of the throne of enlightenment Furthermore in the heretics happiness is concerned solely with personal interest and not with the interest of all beings they are not dedicated to the service of all beings Thus the virtues bear fruits of marvellous benefits irreproachable fruits etc The Bhagavat designated all the virtues sometimes by the name of generosity  sometimes by the name of morality  sometimes by the name of patience  sometimes by the name of zeal  sometimes by the name of meditation and sometimes by the name of wisdom What was his intention What does that mean References on the pāramitās pāramitānāmadhheyaṃ ca labhante CHAPTER V THE VARIOUS DEVELOPMENTS OF CAUSE AND FRUIT  As the ten stages of the bodhisattva What are they Because they counteract the ten opposing kinds of ignorance In fact ten kinds of ignorance arise opposing the tenfold dharmadhātu that is to be known What is the tenfold dharmadhātu that is to be known a Universal reality and excellent reality reality with excellent outcome ungraspable reality reality with no difference in series b Reality beyond defilement and purification reality free of multiplicity reality free of decrease and increase and support of the fourfold mastery c The ignorances relative to the dharmadhātu constitute the ten undefiled obstacles The bhūmis counteract the ignorances opposing the ten bhūmis These ignorances are undefiled for the śrāvakas but defiled for the bodhisattvas Bh ac bh bb U ba u bb Questions and answers relating to the various cultivations of the cause and result What is the tenfold dharmadhātu that is to be known In the first bhūmi it should be known as universal reality and in the tenth as reality supporting mastery of action and mastery of dhāraṇī and samādhimukha Being of ten types this dharmadhātu is to be known that is why it is called the tenfold dharmadhātu to be understood In each bhūmi there is a special dharmadhātu to be understood but the power of ignorance does not allow it to be known In order to counteract these ignorances the ten bhūmis are established The opposing obstacles being of ten types ten bhūmis are established What are these ten opposing obstacles Pṛthagjanatva the quality of the ordinary person Mithyāpratipatti bad behavior in respect to beings reprehensible physical acts etc Dhandhatva slowness or failure of memory in regard to the dharmas of hearing  contemplating and meditating In Tibetan these ten obstacleignorances are Sarvatragārtha this dharmadhātu of the first bhūmi is omnipresent because there is no dharma that is nonsubstantial The person who knows this enters into the first bhūmi this dharmadhātu of the second bhūmi is excellent in all its qualities The person who knows this enters into the second bhūmi Niṣyandārtha The doctrine of the Greater Vehicle which follows from this dharmadhātu of the third bhūmi is excellent The person who knows this enters into the third bhūmi this dharmadhātu of the fourth bhūmi cannot be conceived of as mine or taken as ones own it is like an individual from Uttarakuru who cannot be imprisoned When one attains this dharmadhātu one cannot say It is mine The person who knows this enters into the fourth bhūmi in this dharmadhātu of the fifth bhūmi there is no difference in nature it is like the eye etc which in the various series of beings separately shows no differences in this dharmadhātu of the sixth bhūmi there is no defilement from the beginning because it is naturally nondefiled Anānātvārtha although the texts sūtras etc may have given all kinds of definitions for this dharmadhātu of the seventh bhūmi nevertheless it is without differences The person who knows this enters into the seventh bhūmi this dharmadhātu of the eighth bhūmi does not diminish when the defilement decreases and does not increase when the purity increases this dharmadhātu is the support of the mastery over characteristics The mastery over characteristics that is obtained is called mastery of marks because the characteristics of gold silver etc appear at will The person who knows this enters into the eighth bhūmi Jñānavaśitāśrayārtha this dharmadhātu of the ninth bhūmi is the support of the mastery of analytical knowledge The person who knows this enters into the ninth bhūmi this dharmadhātu of the tenth bhūmi is the support of the mastery of action physical activities etc  and the support of the mastery of dhāraṇi and samādhimukha The person who knows this enters into the tenth bhūmi These ignorances are undefiled in the śrāvakas because they do not wish to enter into the bhūmis i Why is the first bhūmi called Joyous Because thanks to it for the first time one obtains for the first time the faculty of ensuring ones own interest and that of others ii Why is the second bhūmi called Stainless Because it avoids the stains of immorality iii Why is the third bhūmi called Shining Because with the immutable meditative stabilizations and absorptions assupport  it is the support of the great brilliance of the Dharma iv Why is the fourth bhūmi called Blazing Wisdom Because the auxiliary dharmas of enlightenment burn away all the obstacles v Why is the fifth bhūmi called Difficult to Conquer Because it is difficult to realize on account of the mutual opposition between knowledge of the truth and mundane knowledge vi Why is the sixth bhūmi called Revealed vii Why is the seventh bhūmi called FarGone Because it reaches the end of the practice of effort viii Why is the eighth bhūmi called Immovable ix Why is the ninth bhūmi called Excellent Intelligence Because it attains the higher liberated knowledges x Why is the tenth bhūmi called Cloud of Dharma Because it attains a combined knowledge of all the dharmas which includes all the dhāraṇi and samādhimukhas hides the broad obstacles as the cloud hides space and fulfills the dharmakāya i Pramuditā Joyous because thanks to it for the first time the faculty of ensuring ones own interest and that of others At the moment of full realization  the bodhisattvas obtain the higher faculty of ensuring their own personal interest and that of others and thereby experience great joy The śrāvakas etc who at the moment of full realization obtain only the faculty of ensuring their own personal interest do not experience such joy that is why there is no question of the Joyous bhūmi for them If this joy is absent in the first bhūmi it will be absent also in the following bhūmis because it is the first ii Vimalā Stainless because it avoids the stains of immorality In this expression all the auxiliary dharmas of enlightenment are called fire because they burn away the obstacles When these auxiliaries of enlightenment are abundant the defilements are entirely consumed As the knowledge of absolute truth and the knowledge of contingent truth are in opposition  it is difficult to produce them by bringing them together This bhūmi which joins them so that they do not contradict each other in any way is very difficult to overcome In this bhūmi the exertion of effort is complete But even though all the marks of the dharmas are immobilized  there is still effort in the signless viii Acalā the Immovable because all the marks and all the practices of will cease to disturb the mind This knowledge is wisdom  hence the name sādhumatī The dhāraṇi and samādhimukhas are like pure water This knowledge contains them like the cloud contains water for it has the excellent faculty of giving rise to them Moreover like a great cloud hides space  this combined knowledge of all dharmas hides the two obstacles the obstacle of the passions and the obstacle to knowledge which are broad and infinite like space c Finally just as a great cloud causes clear fresh water to rain down which fills space  so this combined knowledge of all dharmas emanates innumerable excellent qualities which fill ii By acquiring the practices  by acquiring the ten textual practices relating to these bhūmis iii By acquiring penetration  for when the fundamental element is penetrated in the first bhūmi all the other bhūmis are penetrated iv By acquiring the achievement  by reaching the summit of the development of these bhūmis How should the cultivation of these bhūmis be understood The bodhisattva who bhūmi by bhūmi cultivates tranquility and discernment  cultivates them in five ways What are these five ways i by combined cultivation  ii by signless cultivation  iii by effortless cultivation  iv by intensive cultivation  v by insatiable cultivation By means of this fivefold cultivation the bodhisattva produces five results  At each moment the bodhisattva melts away the support of all the weaknesses He achieves the suppression of multiple concepts and thus achieves pleasure in the garden of Dharma He understands completely the brilliance of the Dharma immense and of limitless aspect These five types are combined cultivation etc To feel this pleasure is to find pleasure in the garden of the Dharma He understands completely the brilliance of the Dharma immense and of limitless aspect He penetrates precisely the brilliance of the infinite teaching which is without limit in the ten directions Because he illumines the practices  he is called the brilliance of the law He is like the light derived from the study of a text The signs auxiliaries of purity nonfabricated manifest in him For the fulfillment and the attainment of dharmadhātu he makes use of the ever most perfect cause The tenth bhūmi is called fulfillment of the dharmadhātu abiding in the Buddha bhūmi is called attainment of the dharmadhātu The cause that produces this bhūmi of the Buddha being excellent  is called the perfect cause Being an accumulation of earlier causes it is called the ever most perfect As the main statement  ten virtues are cultivated in the ten bhūmis one main virtue for each bhūmi In the first six bhūmis the six virtues referred to in chapter IV  are practiced on the last four bhūmis the four following virtues i The virtue of skill in means Sharing amongst all beings the roots of good accumulated by the six virtues they are applied to supreme perfect enlightenment ii The virtue of vow The six virtues esrablish the knowledge by means of which enjoyment of the Dharma is experienced and beings are ripened This teaching is contained in the Pāramitāpiṭaka Bh ca bh ab U bc u aa As the main statement the ten virtues are cultivated in the ten bhūmis in the first six bhūmis Pramuditā etc the six virtues generosity  etc are cultivated In the last four bhūmis the following four virtues in the next four bhūmis Dūraṃgamā etc the following four virtues skillfulness of means  etc ii By formulating various vows one unites the causes of the virtues for a later time In this virtue of power it is said that there is a twofold power and the other powers are included in it as well If ten virtues are posited the sixth wisdom  is only fundamental nonconceptual knowledge if six virtues are posited the sixth gives rise at one and the same time to both nonconceptual knowledge and subsequent knowledge because in the course of the subsequent knowledge the last four virtues occur equally in the sixth virtue that contains them The entire doctrine of the Greater Vehicle is called the piṭaka of the virtues How long a time does it take to reach the completion of the development of the ten bhūmis Five individuals reach the completion after three incalculable periods The person who adheres to the Dharma reaches the completion of his development after the first incalculable period The person who is inspired by excellent pure proclivity  whether he courses in the signs during the first six bhūmis or whether he courses in the signless during the seventh reaches the completion of his development after the second incalculable period Finally the person who courses in spontaneous activity comes to the completion of his development after the third incalculable period going from the eighth to the tenth bhūmi Here is a stanza When he is endowed with pure strength and with excellent power  when he is of strong mind and of advancing progress  it is said that the bodhisattva energetically cultivates the three incalculable periods he has obtained the excellent pure proclivity and zealously cultivates the practices When he abides on the first six bhūmis he is called nimittacārin when he abides on the seventh bhūmi he is called animittacārin On the eighth bhūmi effortless practice has not been achieved Endowed with the power of the roots of good he is able to conquer the opposing roots endowed with the power of great vows he is always attached to spiritual friends When he is of strong mind and advancing progress While skilfully abandoning bad friends  he never abandons the great mind of enlightenment The good dharmas which he cultivates in the present and the future continue to increase  never diminishing de La Valle Poussin Dure de la carrire du Bodhisattva Sidhi p How should the superiority of excellent morality be conceived As it is said in the Bodhisattvabhūmi in the chapter on acceptance of the bodhisattva discipline as this text explains it at length in the chapter on the śīlapāramitā cf Bodhisattvabhūmi śīlapaṭala p The morality of abstention is the basis of the other two moralities The morality of gathering good dharmas is the basis for acquiring the attributes of Buddha The morality of service to beings is the basis for ripening of beings This is why the bodhisattvas are superior to the śrāvakas Superiority consisting of shared and unshared rules i The rule of the bodhisattvas is shared with the śrāvakas insofar as it is forbidden to the bodhisattvas to commit natural wrongdoings According to this latter rule there where the śrāvaka commits a wrongdoing  the bodhisattva does not there where the bodhisattva commits a wrongdoing the śrāvaka does not iii The morality of the bodhisattva is on the physical  vocal and mental levels that of the śrāvakas extends only to the physical and vocal levels For this very reason the bodhisattva commits wrongdoings of mind whereas the śrāvaka does not In summary  the bodhisattva can accomplish and observe any physical vocal or mental action favorable to beings provided that he is blameless This is how the superiority consisting of shared and unshared rules is to be conceived i Killing  theft  illicit sex  etc resulting from lust etc are natural wrongdoings They are forbidden to both bodhisattvas and śrāvakas ii Cutting plants  etc which is not the result of concupiscence is a wrongdoing of disobedience According to this last rule there where the śrāvaka commits a wrongdoing the bodhisattva does not On the contrary when he sees a benefit for beings in leaving and does not leave the bodhisattva commits a wrongdoing if he does leave he does not commit a iii For this very reason the bodhisattva commits wrondoings of mind whereas the śrāvaka does not In summary the bodhisattva can accomplish and observe any physical vocal or mental action favorable to beings provided that he is blameless ie any action that ensures the welfare and happiness of beings without thereby arousing the passions lust etc It may happen that while favoring beings the action is not blameless for example having illicit sex with a woman belonging to someone else To avoid this type of action the author says provided that he is blameless the rules observed by the bodhisattvas are both many and immense by means of them they ensure the ripening and service of all beings ii Scope consisting of increase of immense merits the bodhisattvas gain an immense accumulation of merit This is lacking in the śrāvakas iii Scope consisting of increase of inclinations to work for the benefit and happiness of all beiongs encouraging beings to practice the wholesome is called inclination to work for the benefit wishing that a certain person  by means of this benefit will gain a higher fruit is called inclination to work for the happimness iv Scope consisting of establishing supreme complete enlightenment by this morality the bodhisattvas establish supreme perfect enlightenment This is lacking in the śrāvakas i Finally superiority of depth is the fact that by virtue of his skillful means even if he commits the ten types of evil actions the bodhisattva does not incur any blame but gains immense merit and quickly attains complete perfect enlightenment ii Moreover fabricated actions of body and speech should be thought of as the profound morality of the bodhisattva iii Exhibiting all kinds of Jātakas he causes torment to some beings grants his favors to others and having inspired faith in them he assures their maturation Such is the superiority in depth of the bodhisattvas morality Bh bc bh ab U ca u ab i Superiority in depth is the fact that by virtue of his skillful means the bodhisattva etc Here the power of the skillful means belonging to the bodhisattva is explained For example a bodhisattva knows that a certain person is about to commit an evil deed an action of immediate retribution  etc By killing him I will cause him a small suffering for a moment but I will do it so that later on he will experience much joy Then the bodhisattva like a physician  arms himself with courage and kills this person By doing that he incurs not the slightest blame Indeed he earns much merit and by means of this merit quickly arrives at supreme complete enlightenment Such a discipline is profound By means of them the bodhisattva exerts kingship and while causing all kinds of torment to beings he introduces them into the discipline That which has change as selfnature is called fabricated eg the Viśvantarajātaka where the Bodhisattva gives his son and daughter to the brahmin He causes torment to some beings and grants his favors to others in the final analysis bodhisattvas do not torment some and favor others This is what is called superiority in depth In brief  it is by virtue of the fourfold superiority that the bodhisattvas moral discipline is superior By virtue of these aspects  the various observances of the bodhisattva are infinite  as is said in the Vinayaghoṣavaipulyasūtra The superiority of excellent morality has been explained in chapter VI How should the superiority of excellent mind be conceived Bh c bh ba U b u a The doctrine of the Greater Vehicle ie the profound and vast doctrine contained in the Bodhisasattvapiṭaka The adhicitta is superior to the concentrations of the śrāvakas who do not have such an object Superiority as counteragent  because the knowledge that bears on all the dharmas in a combined way  just as one nail is driven out by another nail  eradicates all obstacles and weaknesses occurring in the storeconsciousness Indeed the propensity seeds of the defiled dharmas that reside in the storeconsciousness are coarse and the counteracting path able to eradicate them is subtle Superiority of capability because while abiding in the bliss of dhyāna and without falling away from bliss he takes birth according to his choice wherever he sees usefulness for beings  for his samādhi lends itself to action Such capability of concentration does not occur in the śrāvakas etc Superiority in products because the power of concentration produces all types of unobstructed superknowledges in all the universes causing something to shake  flaming  illuminating  making visible  transforming  going and coming  concentrating and developing  introducing all rūpa into his body  taking on the ways of those whom he meets  appearing and disappearing  subjugating to his will  subduing the magical power of others  giving the light of intellect  giving memory  giving bliss  emitting light rays an infinite number of great chiliocosms to shake He introduces all rūpa into his body  in the presence of a large company that recognizes itself as having entered into his body The Tathāgata surpasses the magical power of all the magicians For a time he gives material comfort  thanks to which creatures freed from obstacles are able to hear the Dharma obstacles that are produced by the turmoil of the elements  by demons attacks  etc He emits rays of light that pacify the sufferings of hell beings summon the Buddhas and bodhisattvas Superiority in actions as well because the adhicitta comprises and produces the ten achievements as well These ten achievements are i The achievement of vows  because he undertakes the vows of great enlightenment ii The achievement of not withdrawing  because he does not withdraw before the sufferings of transmigration iii The achievement of not turning his back  because he does not turn his back on the bad conduct of all beings iv The achievement of devoting himself lit facing up to  because he devotes himself to doing whatever benefit is possible to evil beings v The achievement of being unstained because while living in the world he is unstained by human circumstances vi The achievement consisting of convinced adherence  because even without understanding it he adheres to the vast and profound doctrine of the Greater Vehicle vii The achievement consisting of penetrating  because it penetrates the nonexistence of self of the individual and of things viii The achievement consisting of understanding  because he understands the profound enigmatical words of the Tathāgatas ix The achievement of not quitting and not being defiled  because he does not abandon saṃsāra but is not defiled by it x The achievement of effort  because the Buddhas who are established in the removal of all the obstacles exert themselves until the end of saṃāra to spontaneously render service to all beings ix Dwelling in saṃsāra without entering into error is very difficult Concerning the avabodhaduṣkaracaryā  what is the nature of these enignatic words of the Buddhas that the bodhisattva comes to understand A sūtra says the following i How does the bodhisattva practice generosity When without giving anything he practices generosity widely in the innumerable universes of the ten directions When he practices generosity without having faith in the Tathāgatas vii How is his generosity pure The bodhisattvas include all beings in their own selfnature because they have penetrated the identity of themselves and others When others practice generosity it is the bodhisattvas who are giving that is why it is said that they practice generosity when they give nothing The bodhisattva practices generosity with this personal knowledge and this intimate conviction that allows him to directly perceive the true nature of things He is not content with believing others The bodhisattva practices generosity spontaneously He does not have to make an effort in order to compel others and encourage them to give v When he never gives anything ie when he has always given everything Taken in its hidden meaning the phrase means that the bodhisattva practices generosity with a mind free of distraction  ie in samādhi or mind concentration The word utpa has as its obvious meaning to produce and as its hidden meaning to eradicate Taken in its hidden meaning the phrase means that the bodhisattva practices generosity by suppressing avarice viii When he does not quit at the end Not like the śrāvakas who have tranquility as the one vehicle  the bodhisattva does not stop at the end at nirvāṇawithoutresidue ix When he has no sovereignty over generosity ie when avarice and the other vices opposing generosity do not dominate him x When he is not fixed in the indestructible Having arrived at perfection  at indestructible sovereignty  at definitive buddhahood  the bodhisattva is not fixed there How is that ii How is he the thief who takes what has not been given iv How is he a teller of lies When he calls a lie a lie When he always abides in the supreme dwelling of emptiness When he is on the other bank of knowledge vii How does he have thoughtless speech viii How is he full of envy ix How is he full of wickedness the sūtra where it is said O monks I am a murderer etc Here the author explains the hidden meaning of these texts i When he takes beings out of transmigration Its hidden meaning is eternal supreme emptiness indeed pai stands for parama śu stands for śūnya and ni stands for nitya If this hidden meaning is adopted the answer is in accordance  whereas if one keeps to the obvious meaning it is not in accordance As its obvious meaning pāruṣya is harmful speech as hidden meaning to be on the other shore Adopting this hidden meaning the author is saying when he is on the other shore of knowledge x When he sees the omnipresent falseness very well ie when he sees that everything has deceit imagination falseness as nature The profound attributes of the Buddha are spoken of What are they i The eternal dharmas are attributes of the Buddha because the dharmakāya of the Buddha is eternal ii The dharmas of abandonment are attributes of the Buddha because the Buddha has cut all the obstacles iii The dharmas of arisng are attributes of the Buddha because the apparitional body of the Buddha takes birth iv The dharmas of acquisition are attributes of the Buddha because the  behaviors of beings and their antidotes are acquired by the Buddha v The dharmas connected with lust are attributes of the Buddha because the Buddha recognizes his fundamental equality in respect to lustful beings vi viii For the same reason the dharmas connected with hatred are attributes of the Buddha the dharmas connected with ignorance are attributes of the Buddha and the dharmas of ordinary people are attributes of the Buddha ix The dharmas free of stains are attributes of the Buddha because the true nature fully realized by the Buddha is not stained by any obstacle x The dharmas free of stains are attributes of the Buddha because while dwelling in the world he is not soiled by any human situation That is why the dharmas of the Buddha are profound Bh b bh ba U ab u ba It is a matter here of another sūtra saying that the eternal dharmas are the attributes of Buddha and so on up to the dharmas free of dirtiness are the attributes of the Buddha There is a hidden meaning which the author is going to explain i Because the dharmakāya of the Buddha is eternal iv Because the  behaviors of beings and their antidotes are acquired by the Buddha ix The dharmas free of stainst are the attributes of the Buddha because the pure tathatā is not stained by any obstacle The rest is easily understood there is no need to explain it Finally the development of the virtues  the ripening of beings  the purification of the buddhafields and the production of the attributes of the Buddha should be considered as so many special actions belonging to the bodhisattvas samādhis The concentrations obtained by the bodhisattvas have moreover a fourfold activity By being themselves based on these concentrations they are able to cultivate all the virtues and ripen all categories of beings because utilizing the means they have at their disposal magical powers  etc they establish beings in the holy Dharma They can also purify the buddhafields by transforming them into gold and other precious substances according to their wishes They are able to acquire all the Buddha attributes such as the powers  the fearlessnesses  etc The superiority of excellent mind has been explained in Chapter VII How should the superiority of excellent wisdom be conceived Its role of maintenace  its associates  its retribution  its necessary consequence  its deliverance  its end  the advantages of preparatory  nonconceptual and subsequent knowledge the types of nonconceptual knowledge examples illustrating nonconceptual and subsequent knowledge the effortless accomplishment of its role  its profundity The author will now explain excellent wisdom He affirms that nonconceptual knowledge  excellent wisdom is of three kinds preparatory nonconceptual knowledge or speculative wisdom  fundamental nonconceptual knowledge or wisdom of realization  and subsequent nonconceptual knowledge or applied wisdom Here the wisdom of investigation is the first excellent wisdom introspective wisdom is the second excellent wisdom and sustaining wisdom is the third excellent wisdom But this knowledge comprises a cause and a result speculative wisdom is the cause of this knowledge subsequent knowledge is the result of this knowledge By demonstrating it both of the others are demonstrated at the same time The avoidance of these five characteristics constitutes the selfnature of noncopnceptual knowledege In the bodhisattva the selfnature of nonconceptual knowledge avoids five characteristics It is not a description of reality Bh ca bh ba U c u ba i If absence of thinking were nonconceptual knowledge sleep and drunkenness where one does not think would be nonconceptual knowledge ii If the level surpassing investigation and analysis were nonconceptual knowledge all ordinary people  the śrāvakas etc in levels above the second dhyāna would possess nonconceptual knowledge when in fact they do not have this nonconceptual knowledge iii If cessation of identification and sensation were nonconceptual knowledge the essential characteristic of this knowledge ie its mental factor nature which makes it a knowledge would be difficult to establish in the unconscious state  etc In fact without a mind that supports them there are no mental factors iv If matter were nonconceptual knowledge there would be no nonconceptual knowledge because it would be like a substance derived from the four great elements v If the description of reality were nonconceptual knowledge this knowledge would not be nonconceptual or without concept because in the description of reality recourse made to concepts by saying In the bodhisattva the support of nonconceptual knowledge is neither mind nor nonmind because it does not think and is not the result of thought Bh ab bh ab U ca u ab The selfnature of this knowledge functions by depending on something This nonconceptual knowledge someone may say depends on a mind or on a nonmind If one says that it depends on a mind then it could think  and in its quality of mind functioning in dependence on a mind it would not be nonconceptual On the other hand if it depends on a nonmind it is not a knowledge In order to avoid these two kinds of mistakes the author gives the stanza The support of this knowledge is not a mind because this knowledge does not think It is not a nonmind because it is induced by a thought the support of its arising is a derivative of mind In the bodhisattva the cause of nonconceptual knowledge is the hearingpropensity coming from speech and correct thinking Bh b bh b U a u b There follows a stanza on the cause of this knowledge  Cause is synonymous with efficient cause sābhilāpa because it comes from the words of others concerning the Greater Vehicle śruta because it listens to these words and nothing else vāsanā ie special potentiality produced by this hearing Correct thinking is the mental discourse arising from this hearingpropensity which is its cause For the bodhisattva the object of nonconceptual knowledge is the inexpressible nature of things  the true nonsubstantial nature Bh b bh b U a u b What is the object of this knowledge The following stanza explains Inexpressible nature of things being imaginary in nature  all dharmas are inexpressible What is this inexpressibility And the essence consisting of this selfnonexistence is called the true nature  For the bodhisattva the aspect of nonconceptual knowledge is the absence of marks inherent in its object of awareness Bh b bh ba U ab u ba The following stanza explains the aspect of nonconceptual knowledge inherent in its object For the bodhisattva the aspect of nonconceptual knowledge is the absence of marks that manifest in its object That is to say this knowledge is the same as the true nature and this identity marks it with the characteristic of absence of marks which is no different from tathatā and constitutes the very aspect of nonconceptual Thus when the eye grasps a color  it takes on a blue mark  and this blue mark is no different from the color grasped by the eye a Having the connection of phonemes as selfnature  the meaning is conceptual and nothing else b Without a designation  knowledge about the thing designated does not operate Since there is a difference between the two there is no designation Thus everything is inexpressible a If all dharmas are inexpressible  what is conceived In order to explain this the author says Meaning having the connection of phonemes as selfnature is conceptual and nothing else How to show that When the phonemes are mutually joined there is a meaning of connection When the separate phonemes are pronounced in series  this gives a meaning that has a connection meaning Thus the two phonemes cha kṣus when they are not separated  express the meaning eye b Why are we sure that all dharmas are inexpressible If one does not know the designation  the notion of the thing designated is not produced This is why all dharmas are inexpressible In order to refute that the author adds Since there is a difference between the two there is no designation Since the designation and the thing designated are mutually different and have a different nature  the designation and the thing designated are inexpressible For this reason it is said that all dharmas are inexprssible This is why dharmas are inexpressible Of what is nonconceptual knowledge the support By the knowledge acquired subsequent to the insight  the bodhisattva practices are obtained these practices rest on nonconceptual knowledge Because it tends to develop them because it makes these bodhisattva practices increase  nonconceptual knowledge is the support of these practices For the bodhisattva the auxiliaries to nonconceptual knowledge are the two paths that have as their nature the first five virtues The two paths are the path of accumulation and the path of support The path of accumulation consists of the virtues of generosity  morality  patience and zeal the path of support is the virtue of meditation For the bodhisattva the retribution of nonconceptual knowlege takes place in the two Buddha assemblies  in view of preparation and acquisition In the two Buddhaassenblies  namely in the assembly of the enjoyment body and in the assembly of the apparitional body If nonconceptual knowledge is at the preparatory stage  it is in the assembly of the apparitional body that one takes birth and one enjoys the fruit of retribution but if one has already acquired nonconceptual knowledge it is in the body of enjoyment that one takes birth and one enjoys the fruit of In order to mark this idea the author adds For the bodhisattva the outcome of nonconceptual knowledge is its progression in the course of successive existences For the bodhisattva the outcome of nonconceptual knowledge is its progression in the course of successive existences in the course of successive existences in the great assemblies of the two bodies of the Buddha which have been spoken of above the continuous progression of the nonconceptual knowledge practiced during these existences constitutes its fruit of outcome What is the deliverance of nonconceptual knowledge For the bodhisattva the outcome etc That which goes to the end is called deliverance it is the movement towards the great nirvāṇa Nonconceptual knowledge as it is acquired and perfected first this knowledge is gained and this is is what is called acquired then after countless hundreds of thousands of great periods  this knowledge is perfected This outcome is to be sought in the ten levels starting from the first bhūmi up to the tenth bhūmi in order In the first bhūmi this knowledge is acquired only following that it is perfected over a long time This is why bodhisattvas spend incalculable periods to attain nirvāṇa After this time they finally come to the end For the bodhisattva the outcome of nonconceptual knowledge is the attainment of the three bodies in the pure state and the attaining of the excellent masteries Bh b bh ab U a u a The attainment of the three bodies in the pure state ie the attainment of the three pure bodies of the tathāgata It is a question of pure body because on the first bhūmi the three bodies are obtained but it is not until the tenth bhūmi that they are pure The attainment of the excellent masteries this nonconceptual knowledge has as its outcome not only the attainment of the three bodies in the pure state but also the attainment of the ten kinds of mastery selfnature  of which we will learn more later What are the benefits of nonconceptual knowledge First there are three types of nonconceptual knowledge namely preparatory nonconceptual knowledge  fundamental and subsequent nonconceptualknowledge nonconceptualknowledge a First the preparatory nonconceptual knowledge Initially the bodhisattva listens to others talk about absence of concept Next unable himself to see this absence of concept he accords it his adherence Because it gives rise to fundamental nonconceptual knowledge it too is given the name nonconceptual In order to show that which does not stain it the author says by any kind of heavy wrongdoing In order to show the cause by means of which it is unstained he says because of faith alone and adherence because by delighting in faith in the absence of concept he accords it his adherence That is why this knowledge can counteract any kind of bad destiny  and this explains that wrongdoings do not soil it From what is it liberated It is liberated from any kind of obstacle How is it liberated in fact in the bhūmis it is only acquired and it must be perfected in order to be cause for the suppression of the obstacles c Finally the subsequent nonconceptual knowledge has the benefit of immaculateness The śāstra gives stanza By the power of this subsequent knowledge the bodhisattva considering the interest of beings  thinks about coming down here and he takes birth here but having taken birth he is not stained by human circumstances a The three knowledges are like a mute person trying to understand an object  a mute person who has understood the object a nonmute person who has understood the object b The three knowledges are like an idiot trying to understand an object an idiot who has understood the object an intelligent person who has understood the object c The three knowledges are like the first five consciousnesses trying to understand an object the first five consciousnesses having understood the object the manas which has understood the object d The three knowledges the preparatory knowledge  etc are like a person who does not understand a treatise and tries to understand it then by grasping the letter  tries to understand it and finally by grasping the meaning  tries to understand it To show the different aspects of these three the author proposes the following examples Just as a mute person while trying to understand an object cannot understand it and cannot speak about it so the preparatory nonconceptual knowledge  while trying to realize the tathathā can neither realize it nor speak about it this is similar Like a mute person who has understood the object Just as a mute person who has understood the object cannot speak about it so the fundamental nonconceptual knowledge  which has realized the tathatā avoids all vain proliferation this is similar Like a nonmute person who has understood the object Just as a nonmute person who has understood the object sets about to speak about it so the subsequent nonconceptual knowledge  which has understood the tathatā and has realized its object  sets out to teach it this is similar b The stanza about the idiot is explained in the same way The first five consciousnesses visual consciousness etc try to understand an object but despite the attempt they lack any concept The mental consciousness which has grasped the object is also able to imagine it d The stanza on the treatise Like a man who does not understand a treatise but who seeks to understand it such is the preparatory nonconceptual knowledge a The fundamental nonconceptual knowledge is like a man with his eyes closed the subsequent knowledge is like the same man with his eyes open b The fundamental nonconceptual knowledge is like space the subsequent knowledge is like the forms that manifest in this space a The first stanza shows the difference between the two knowledges their selfnatures can be known since it includes the emptiness having a single taste in all the dharmas  it is allinclusive since it is not stained by any dharma it is unstained since it itself is without concept  it is nonconceptualizing since it is not conceived of by others it is nonconceptual b The fundamental nonconceptual knowledge is like space Just as precious gems and celestial music accomplish their own activity without thought so it is always without thought that the Buddhas accomplish their kinds of activity A cintāmaṇi  although without concepts  is able to fulfill the rle desired by the beings who possess it A celestial musical instrument  even without being struck  can produce all kinds of sounds according to the aspirations of those close by In the same way the nonconceptual knowledge of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas although without concepts can accomplish all kinds of rles a Not concerning either here or elsewhere it is neither nonknowledge nor knowledge Not being different from its object  this knowledge is nonconcpt What are the errors in these hypotheses If it pertains to concepts its nature of noonconceptual knowledge is not explained if it pertains to another object since this other object does not exist in any way what would it then have as object on another object because then it would have as object the Tathāgata the dharmatā of dependent and imagined dharmas But one can state neither identity nor differernce between these dharmas and their dharmatā This means that the fundamental nonconceptual knowledge pertains to neither concepts nor anything else Furthermore the fundamental nonconceptual knowledge either is or is not a knowledge What are the faults in these hypotheses If it is a knowledge then as knowledge is it without concepts If it is not a knowledge why is it called nonconceptual knowledge The author replies to this question by saying Without being a knowledge it is a knowledge This shows that the fundamental nonconceptual knowledge is not really a knowledge because it does not arise like preparatory conceptual knowledge Neither is it a nonknowledge because it derives its birth from this preparatory conceptual knowledge There is yet another meaning to the phrase Neither here nor elsewhere without being a knowledge it is a knowledge Because here ie in itself concepts do not exist it is called nonknowledge but because it functions on the dharmatā of concepts and not elsewhere it is a knowledge Not being different from its object this knowledge is intuition It is not like the preparatory nonconceptual knowledge which although functioning with objects and subjects of consciousness  is called nonconceptual It should be known that all dharmas are originally free from concept ie that all dharmas in their original nature  are without concept But if all dharmas are originally without concept because the thing conceived does not exist why do not beings attain deliverance from the very beginning Nonconceptual knowledge is lacking ie these beings do not have nonconceptual knowledge and even though the dharmas in their original nature are without concepts these beings are not liberated from the very beginning But when the knowledge of the true nature bearing on the absence of concept of the dharmas arises in them when they realize the absence of concepts of dharmas then they will attain deliverance But if this knowledge does not arise they will not attain delverance Knowledge of the true nature is this same nonconceptual knowledge i First the preparatory nonconceptual knowledge is of three types according to whether it arises from cause  projection  or practice ii Fundamental nonconceptual knowledge is of three types according to whether it is intuition of satiation  nonerror  or nonproliferation Thus the bodhisattvas who dwell in the realm of ordinary beings and who have reached the end of hearing  reflecting and understanding experience satiation say to themselves The hearing and reflecting of fools extend only so far It is in this sense that the nonconceptual knowledge of satiety is spoken of There is yet another meaning because we know that the world also has an nonconceptual knowledge of satiety Thus beings who have reached the peak of existence and who see nirvāṇa experience satiety for the rest and say to themselves There is no further sphere to be sought beyond this nirvāṇa This is what is called satiation It is that of the śrāvakas etc We know that by penetrating the true nature  they obtain the knowledge free of the four errors that consists of taking the transitory as eternal etc The suppression of concepts comprising this fourfold error about the eternal etc is called the nonconceptual knowledge of nonerror Nonconcept of nonproliferation This belongs to the bodhisattvas Indeed the bodhisattvas who have attained enlightenment of all dharmas avoid any vain proliferation The true nature attested by their knowledge transcends the ways of discourse and surpasses the objects of worldly knowledge As it cannot be expressed in words no worldly knowledge can understand it iii Subsequent knowledge is of five types analysis of penetration analysis of memory analysis of preaching analysis of synthesis and analysis of success Analysis of memory Emerging from this penetration one remembers and says to oneself I have penetrated absence of concepts Analysis of preaching This is to preach to others what one has penetrated The knowledge of the combined object sees that all dharmas have one and the same nature and leads towards the transformation of support Analysis of success Everything suucceeds according to aspirations By means of this analysis earth etc is transformed into gold In order to obtain this success this analysis is made that is why the analysis of success is spoken of Some say that it is because of this analysis that one obtains success i Hungry ghosts  animals  humans and gods have different notions of the same object according to their respective capabilities ii Thus in the past  etc in dream and in the reflection in a mirror  there is no object of consciousness and yet perception takes place iii If the object were truly an object there would be no nonconceptual knowledge if that were the case the acquisition of buddhahood would be impossible iv For bodhisattvas possessing the masteries and also for ecstatics  earth etc is transformed into any substance they wish by the power of convinced adhesion vi When nonconceptual knowledge is functioning  not a single object appears Thus we know that there is no object and the object being absent there is no concept i Hungry ghosts animals humans and gods etc There where humans see water  hungry ghosts see hills of dry earth There where humans see dung  animals see pure food There where humans see pure food gods see a rotten impure substance If there is no real object  how is a consciousness without object produced ii For you the Sautrāntikas there is no past or future object then how can there be a consciousness in regard to them The bedroom of the dreamer cannot really contain the mountains  rivers and elephants that are perceived by the consciousness of the dreamer iii If the perceived object were truly an object there would be no nonconceptual knowledge because there would be concepts Intuitive knowledge being absent the acquisition of Buddhahood would be impossible if the intuitive knowledge were truly lacking it would be impossible to attain Buddhahood and this would be a very serious error For the bodhisattvas in possession of the masteries they change earth into gold  etc v For bodhisattvas versed in analysis endowed with samādhi vi When nonconceptual knowledge is operating no object whatsoever appears This is in relation to the preceding discussion concerning the nonreality of the object by way of conclusion  there is no perceived object and hence no notion cognizes We have already discussed this argument previously in the detailed explanation on the characteristics of the knowable The bodhisattva who abides in the virtue of wisdom by means of nonabiding ensures the completion of the development of the other virtues How by the method of nonabiding  does he ensure this fulfillment In the sūtra it is said The bodhisattva who abides in the virtue of wisdom by means of nonabiding ensures the fulfillment of the development of the other virtues Since the bodhisattva avoids such a dwelling  the method of nonabiding is spoken of Since the bodhisattva avoids such a dwelling the method of nonabiding is spoken of iii He avoids abiding in the two extremes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa Worldly people dwell in the extreme of saṃsāra because they have the belief in a self Buddhists dwell in the extreme of nirvāṇa because they have cut through the afflictions It is not the same for the bodhisattva that is why it is said that by avoiding the two extremes  he observes the method of nonabiding Dwelling in the unfortunate destinies does not set up as great an obstacle to attaining supreme bodhi as does dwelling in the levels of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas v He avoids abiding in the nirvāṇawithoutresidue element with disregard for the interest of beings What is the difference between the two lnowledges that of the śrāvakas and that of the bodhisattvas ii It is distinguished by its nonmediocrity because by fully understanding reality  by penetrating all the aspects of the knowable and by referring to all beings  it is not mediocre iii It is distinguished by its nonabidingness  because it is fixed in nonabiding nirvāna iv It is distinguished by its infinitude  because it does not become extinguished in the nirvāṇawithoutresidue element v It is distinguished by its supremacy because above it there is no other vehicle superior to it Here the author is going to show that the knowledge of the bodhisattva is distinguished from that of the śrāvaka by five aspects i Nirvikalpaviśeṣa The knowledge of the śrāvaka is absence of concepts relative to the four errors the knowledge of the bodhisattva is absence of concepts of all the dharmas up to enlightenment The śrāvakas etc enter into the seeing of reality  penetrating only the nonexistence of self of the individual On the other hand for the bodhisattva the knowledge of nonerror on all objects to be known must arise in order that it may be said that they have attained their goal and that they have done what had to be done The śrāvakas etc who seek only their own personal interest  zealously cultivate the knowledge of suppression of the afflictions and of nonproduction On the other hand the bodhisattva by considering all beings seeks perfect enlightenment It is by these three types of nonmediocrity that the knowledge of the bodhisattva is distinguished from that of the śrāvaka This shows the great difference between the nirvāṇa of the śrāvakas and that of the bodhisattvas Worldly and supraworldly perfections the dhyānas and the formless concentrations are called worldly perfections the nirvāṇa acquired by the śrāvaka etc is called supraworldly perfection If the bodhisattvas are thus endowed with the qualities and perfections of excellent morality  excellent mind  and excellent wisdom  if they have attained sovereignty over all riches  why is it that there are beings deprived of resources This is because the bodhisattvas give nothing to some beings because they see that these beings feel loathing for the riches because they see some beings to whom riches have been granted who are setting up obstacles to the arising of wholesome dharmas because they see some beings whose riches are exhausted who are turning towards dislike because they see some beings to whom riches have been granted who are accumulating unwholesome dharmas because they see some beings to whom riches have been granted who are causing suffering to innumerable other beings Seeing the disgust  obstacle  turning away  accumulation and wickedness  we understand why some beings do not obtain any of the riches of the bodhisattvas Here the author is going to show why the bodhisattvas although they have sovereignty over riches  do not give anything to certain beings When the bodhisattvas see some beings experience disgust for the riches they do not give them any Because they see some beings to whom riches have been granted set up obstacles to the arising of wholesome dharmas The bodhisattvas see certain beings who experience no disgust for the riches but who once in possession of abundant riches become careless and produce no wholesome dharmas Then the bodhisattvas have this thought It would be better for these beings actually to be poor for a short time rather than to be poor for a long time in future existences The bodhisattvas see some beings whose riches are exhausted turn towards disgust for saṃsāra and seek deliverance But if they have fortune  they take to drunkenness That is why the bodhisattvas do not give them the riches they have at their disposal thinking It would be better for them to be poor and turn their mind ceaselessly to disgust for saṃsāra rather than to be rich and give themselves up to pleasure  to carelessness  without experiencing disgust for saṃsāra and without producing wholesome dharmas Because they see some beings to whom riches have been granted accumulate unwholesome dharmas The bodhisattvas see that some beings to whom opulent wealth has been given give themselves up to carelessness and accumulate all sorts of unwholesome dharmas That is why they do not give the riches which they have at their disposal Thus a stanza says Because they see some beings to whom wealth has been given make trouble for countless other beings The bodhisattvas see some beings once in possession of fortune  who trouble countless beings That is why they do not give them the riches they have at their disposal They think The text is easy to understand there is no need to explain it The superiority of excellent wisdom has been explained in chapter VIII how should one conceive of the superiority of the cessation that is the fruition of the three śikṣās Cessation is the nonabidingnirvāṇa of the bodhisattva it has as nature this twofold tranformation of support which consists of rejecting the defilements and not abandoning transmigration i First transmigration is the defiled portion of the dependent nature ii Nirvāṇa is the pure portion of the dependent nature iii The two aspects of the support is the dependent nature as it is included in both parts at the same time iv The transformation of the support consists of the expulsion of the defiled portion of the dependent nature when its antidote arises and it is reduced to its pure portion What are saṃsāra nirvāṇa the basis and its transformation The support with its two aspects is the dependent nature in all its complexity What is the transformation of the basis When its antidote arises ie when the nonconceptual knowledge arises the dependent nature expels its defiled part it destroys its disturbed part  which is formed by all the objects and subjects of consciousness  and is reduced to its purity part In brief  this transformation of the basis is of six types Indeed by the stability of the hearingpropensity due to the power of convinced adherence  and by the presence of shame  the afflictions are but slightly or not at all active ii Prativedhaparāvṛtti the tranformation of penetration It is the transformation of the bodhisattvas who have entered onto the bhūmis Actually the appearance and disappearance of the real and the unreal takes place up to and including the sixth bhūmi Actually there is the disappearance of all concepts and appearance of the real up to and including the tenth bhūmi Actually they penetrate only the nonexistence of self of the individual they turn their back completely on transmigration and completely abandon this transmigration This is the transformation of the bodhisattvas Actually they penetrate further the nonexistence of self of dharmas and considering saṃsāra as peace  they cut through the defilements but do not abandon saṃsāra What disadvantagess do the bodhisattvas get from the lesser transformation By scorning the interest of others  they go against their quality of bodhisattva and share in the deliverance of the practitioners of the Lesser Vehicle these are the drawbacks of this transformation What benefits do the bodhisattvas derive from the extensive transformation Having transformed their own basis they obtain sovereignty over all the dharmas of saṃsāra Appearing in all the destinies in the bodies of all kinds of beings  they exercise their skill in various disciplinary means in order to discipline and establish beings who are to be converted into happiness and the three vehicles these are the benefits of this transformation It breaks the strength of the afflictionpropensities contained in the storeconsciousness and increases the power which counteracts them By the stability of the hearingpropensity due to the power of confirmed adherence when one abides in the level where adherence is practiced the power of the hearingpropensity is stabilized this is how this transformation of support is obtained in this state  when the afflictions are active  one is completely ashamed and then the afflictions are only slightly or not at all active This is the transformation of the support obtained by entering into the bhūmis The appearance and disappearance of the real and the unreal  etc this transformation extends up to the sixth bhūmi Sometimes it is the cause for the appearance of the real sometimes when emerging from concentration it is the cause for the appearance of the unreal They are free of the obstacles because they have no further obstacle There is appearance of the very pure reality for the same reason with this transformation as support  they gain mastery over things and according to their aspirations  they procure the benefit and happiness of beings This transformation which procures both the personal interest of the bodhisattva and that of others is extensive They cut through the defilements but do not abandon saṃsāra Penetrating the two nonexistences of a self  they cut the defilements but seeing peace in saṃsāra they do not abandon it What disadvantages do they incur in the lower transformation etc tattvaṃ saṃcchādya bālānām atattvaṃ khyāti sarvataḥ tattvaṃ tu bodhisattvānāṃ sarvataḥ khyāty apāsya tat Amongst foolish people the unreal concealing the real pushing aside the real appears on all sides akhyānakhyānatā jñeyā asadarthasadarthayoḥ āśrayasya parāvṛttir mokṣo sau kāmacārataḥ The disappearance and appearance of the false and the real is the transformation of the basis deliverance for one acts as one wishes When the knowledge that knows the sameness of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa has been produced then saṃsāra becomes nirvāṇa As a result one does not give up or hold onto saṃsāra one does not attain or miss nirvāṇa Bh ca bh missing U c u b In order ro explain the transformation of the basis  the author gives several stanzas By the power of ignorance everything that is not real appears in its entirety That is to say the disappearance of the false and the appearance of the real are called transformation of the support This is deliverance the transformation of the support is called deliverance For one acts as one wishes this transformation of the basis is deliverance independence one acts as one wishes in the world  since by deliverance is meant a sovereignty in action in accordance with desires and not the fact of giving up the life of the body as if one were going to be beheaded When the knowledge that knows the identity of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is produced etc The imaginary nature is called saṃsāra Since saṃsāra is nirvāṇa one does not abandon it but since the notion of saṃsāra no longer applies to saṃsāra one does not keep saṃsāra Since nirvāṇa is not attained outside of saṃsāra one does not acquire nirvāṇa but since nirvāṇa is experienced within saṃsāra one does not lack nirvāṇa animittam iti vikalpasyāpravṛttir anutpādo nirvāṇam iti vadāmi The superiority of the cessation that is the result of the three śikṣās has been explained in Chapter IX how should one conceive the superiority of the knowledge concerning this result The three bodies of the Buddha the essential body  the body of enjoyment and the apparitional body consitute the superiority of the knowledge of this result i First the essential body is the dharmakāya of the Tathāgata because it is the basis of sovereignty over all the dharmas ii The body of enjoyment is based on the dharmakāya and is characterized by all the types of assemblies of the Buddha because it experiences the very pure buddhafields and the enjoyment of the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle in the very pure buddhafields they experience the many joys of the doctrine of the Greater Vehicle  because they understand their meaning This is how peculiar ideas having the aspect of a person  a person who is accomplishing the stereotyped career of the Buddha ākyamuni arise in the mental series of beings What is the characteristic of the dharmakāya of the Buddhas In brief it has the following five characteristics i The transformation of the basis Having destroyed all the obstacles and the dependent nature in its defiled portion  it is free of all obstacles it secures mastery of all the dharmas  and it is transformed into the purity portion of the dependent nature ii Its nature is that of being constituted of white dharmas because it has attained the ten masteries by means of the fulfillment of the six virtues Mastery of life  mastery of mind and mastery of provisions have been acquired by means of fulfillment of the virtue of generosity Mastery of action and mastery of birth have been acquired by the fulfillment of the virtue of morality Mastery of miraculous powers pertaining to the five superknowledges has been acquired by fulfillment of the virtue of dhyāna On the other hand the transformation of the basis acquired by the bodhisattva thanks to the complete development of the six virtues  has as its nature the ten masteries that are the very nature of the white dharmas Mastery of life consists of abandoning life at will Mastery of mind consists of not being defiled while in the midst of saṃsāra Mastery of provisions consists of accumulating supplies at will drink  food  etc Mastery of activity consists of acquiring great mastery over actions Mastery of birth consists of being able to take birth at will in any destiny one wishes it is enough that on earth he forms an aspiration to change earth into gold etc it is by previously having joyfully cultivated concentration and adjusting oneself to the interest of beings by entering into all kinds of dhyānas and concentrations that one now attains this mastery of miraculous powers derived from concentration Mastery of knowledge consists of realizing knowledge in accordance with all types of speech iii Bhāvābhāvādvayalakṣaṇa It does not have a nature of existence because all dharmas are imaginary and nonexistent neither does it have a nature of nonexistence  because the selfnature composed of emptiness exists Saṃskṛtāsaṃskṛtādvayalakṣaṇa Because it is not conditioned by action and afflictions  it does not have the nature of the conditioned Because it has acquired the mastery of appearing as conditioned dharmas and because repeatedly at many times  it appears as conditioned it does not have the nature of the unconditioned Since innumerable persons attain it each in turn it does not have the nature of uniqueness This absence of plurality and of singleness is called the nature of nonduality If that is so why are there several Buddhas Since various entrances into the possession of this basis by the bodhisattvas are referred to it is asserted that there are different Buddhas since the original cause has divisions there is but one single Buddha Embracing all beings to be converted separately the Tathāgatas assure their welfare and happiness  ie they establish them in the three vehicles as appropriate But if there were but one Buddha they could not assure these beings or introduce them into the buddhavehicles  for there is not a second Buddha That is why it is necessary to admit that there are several Buddhas In view of nonbeginning  there is not just one single Buddha The appearances of the Tathāgatas on the earth have had no beginning  just like saṃsāra On the other hand it cannot be asserted that there may be several Buddhas given the absence of divisions in the stainless basis That is why the author says There is neither singleness nor plurality of Buddha See below  This characteristic is attributed to it for three reasons It has the purification of the true nature as nature this shows that the true nature is eternal and immutable But the Buddha has acquired the dharmakāya as selfnature But various categories of beings do not reach nirvāṇa and thus the result projected by this vow is never interrupted That is why it is eternal The Buddhas are not grasped by it that is why they are inconceivable How is this dharmakāya attained for the first time by contact the melting at each moment of the base of all the imperfections the suppression of numerous notions and thus pleasure in the garden of the Dharma the complete understanding of the Dharmas brilliance in its immense and unlimited aspect the appearance of the marks the auxiliaries of purity nonimagined the taking possession of the ever most perfect cause for the perfecting and achievement of the dharmakāya  The diamondlike samādhi that serves to break subtle obstacles that are so difficult to break this gives the reason why this concentration is like a diamond By how many masteries does the dharmakāya acquire sovereignty In brief  it acquires it in five ways i By the transformation of the form aggregate  it acquires sovereignty over the buddha fields  the body  the marks  the minor marks  infinite phonemes  the invisible cranial marks ii By the transformation of the sensation aggregate  it acquires sovereignty over the blissful abodes  irreproachable  immense and vast iii By the transformation of the perception aggregate  it acquires the sovereign power of explaining every collection of words  collection of phrases and collection of phonemes iv By the transformation of the formations aggregate  it acquires sovereignty over creation  transformation  the reunion of assemblies and accumulation of white dharmas v By the transformation of the consciousness aggregate  it acquires sovereignty over the mirrorlike knowledge  the knowledge of sameness  the knowledge of contemplation and the knowledge of the accomplishment of what had to be done By transformation of the five aggregates  five sovereignties are acquired i By means of transformation of the form aggregate it acquires the sovereign power of manifesting the buddhafields for in accordance with the wishes of beings it manifests buddhafields in gold  silver  etc it acquires the sovereign power of manifesting its own body for in accordnce with the aspirations it manifests in all kinds of great assemblies in conformity with the individual capacities of the beings who are to be disciplined it acquires the sovereign power of manifesting the major marks and minor marks for according to wishes  it manifests all the major marks and minor marks it acquires the twofold sovereign power of manifesting infinite sounds and invisible marks of the head  for the sounds of the Buddha have an infinite range  and its cranial marks are invisible ii By means of the transformation of the sensation aggregate it acquires sovereignty over the blissful abodes irreproachable immense and vast These abodes are irreproachable because they are free of afflictions they are immense because there are many of them they are vast because they surpass all the pleasures of the three worlds Ideas have as selfnature  the grasping of characteristics With such an accumulation as cause by means of the transformation it acquires this special power thanks to which it possesses mastery over the collections of words etc according to wishes Sovereignty over accumulation of white dharmas brings it about that the pure dharmas may be present according to aspirations even though the objects that are known may not be present  it cannot forget them it is not limited in time and space This cognition having as its object the sameness of all beings is acquired at the first moment of full understanding of the truths  ie at the start of the path of seeing or darśanamārga cf The transformation of the five consciousnesses assures the cognition of the accomplishment of duty in all the universes situated in the ten directions  it manifests creations beginning with the going forth from the divine palace of the Tuṣitas up to attaining nirvāṇa it accomplishes its activity dedicated to the service of all beings Of how many things is the dharmakāya the basis In brief it is the support of three things i It is the support of the various abodes of Buddha Here are some stanzas Since the Buddhas have attained their own element  they have gained the fivefold satisfaction Those who have not attained this element are deprived of satisfaction That is why those who desire this satisfaction must acquire this element The power and accomplishment of duty  the flavor of the texts  the perfection of theses and the perfection of the qualities are immense Seeing these ever nonperishable benefits  the Buddhas gain supreme irreproachable satisfaction ii It is the support of the various bodies of enjoyment  for it assures the maturing of the bodhisattvas iii It is the support of the various apparitional bodies  for it assures the maturation mainly of the śrāvakas The author asks of how many dharmas is the dharmakāya the basis In brief it is the basis of three things i It is the support of the various buddha abodes the dharmakāya attained by the Tathāgata serves as basis for all kinds of abodes  divyavihāra āryavihāra and brāhmavihāra The Buddhas have gained the fivefold satisfaction etc because they have acquired their own element their own fundamental element The Buddhas have satisfaction seeing the immensity of this power Duty means action  the activity consisting of procuring the benefit of all beings by establishing them suitably and according to their capabilities in the three vehicles They gain great satisfaction in seeing the immensity of the flavor of the texts the immensity of the perfecting of the theses and of the qualities It ensures the maturation of the śrāvakas mainly The author says mainly in order to include the bodhisattvas of the level where convinced adherence is practiced By how many Buddha attributes is the dharmakāya constituted In brief it conists of six kinds of attributes i The attribute of purity  for it is by transforming the storeconsciousness that the dharmakāya is obtained ii The attribute of retribution  for it is by transforming the material organs that the knowledge of retribution is obtained iii The attribute of abode  for it is by transforming the abodes such as the life of pleasure etc that the abode of immense knowledge is obtained iv The attribute of sovereignty  for it is by transforming the various profitable actions that the sovereignty consisting of abhijñā unimpeded in all the universes is obtained v The attribute of conduct  for the sovereignty consisting of a knowledge that charms the minds of all beings is obtained by transforming conduct ie that which is seen heard felt understood vi By the attribute of expelling  for the knowledge that drives away the torments and faults of all beings is obtained by transforming all the torments and faults The dharmakāya consists of these six Buddha attributes Bh ca bh missing U ca i Viśuddhi The Buddha attribute of purity constitutes the selfnature of the dharmakāya because the dharmakāya is pure by nature What purifies it what transforms it so that it is pure The Buddha attribute of retribution consitutes the selfnature of the dharmakāya By transforming the material organs ie the organs endowed with matter such as the eye etc the knowledge of retribution is acquired Since that which was abandoned by transformation was of retribution that which is acquired by transformation is likewise metaphorically of retribution The Buddha attribute of abode consitutes the selfnature of the dharmakāya The Buddha attribute of sovereignty constitutes the selfnature of the dharmakāya The Buddha attribute of conduct constitutes the selfnature of the dharmakāya By transforming worldly conduct  sovereignty over what is seen heard felt understood is acquired By means of that the wonderful knowledge which charms the minds of all beings is acquired In the same way here the wonderful knowledge that pacifies all torments and all the faults of all beings is acquired by transformoing these torments Should we say that the Buddha Bhagavats are different  or should we say that they are identical Since their bases  their intentions and their actions are identical it may be said that the dharmakāyas are identical But since their bases are different the saṃbhogakāyas are different for they exist in numberless supports Since their bases their intentions and their actions are identical the darmakāyas of the Buddhas are identical Since all have the same intention of working for the benefit and happiness of all beings  their intentions are identical Since all accomplish various activities likewise for the welfare of others mainly such as attaining enlightenment  entry into parinirvāṇa etc their actions are identical With how many qualities is the dharmakāya associated It is associated with the very pure qualities which are the four immeasurables  the eight liberations  the eight sovereign views of the object  the ten totalities of the object  the power of preventing the arising of defilement in another  the knowledge resulting from resolve the four liberated knowledges  the six superknowledges  the thirtytwo marks of the Great Man  the eightyfour minor marks  the four omniform purities  the ten powers  the four fearlessnesses  the three things

niṣpannaparamārtho si sarvabhūmiviniḥsṛtaḥ sarvasattvāgratāṃ prāptaḥ sarvasattvavimocakaḥ i You have completely achieved the Absolute ii you have emerged from all the bhūmis iii you have attained the first place among all beings iv you are the liberator of all beings ca sarvathā devamānuṣaiḥ v You are endowed with inexhaustible and unequaled qualities vi you show yourself equally in the universes and in the assemblies but you are completely invisible to gods and men Bh c bh missing U a u ba i You have completely achieved the Absolute the dharmakāya of the Buddha has completely achieved the Absolute it consists of the true nature This indicates that the dharmakāya is associated with a quality of selfnature iii You have attained the foremost place among all beings this concerns omniscience which ensures supremacy among all beings these are the qualities with which he is associated for he is endowed with infinite and unique qualities powers  fearlessnesses  etc which are inexhaustible and unequalled these two bodies are visible On the other hand he is completely invisible to gods and men  for the dharmakāya of the Buddhas is not seen by men gods etc This passage shows the difference between the three bodies of Bhagavat by noting their function The dharmakāya of the Buddhas is profound  very profound Here are the verses i The Buddha has nonarising as arising  nondwelling as dwelling all his actions are done without effort he has the fourth nutriment as food i This stanza explains the profundity of arising  establishment  activity and subsistence The Buddha has nonarising as arising although they have no arising the Buddhas seem to have an arising That is the profundity of arising his establishment consists of not being established in either saṃsāra or nirvāṇa he is established in nonabiding nirvāṇa That is the profundity of establishment He has the fourth nutriment as food The nutriments are four in number the nutriments that sustain an impure person thus the person bound by all the bonds sustains his body by means of the four foods foodbythemouthfuls etc The nutriments that sustain a person who is both pure and impure On the other hand the srotaāpannas in their quality as śaikṣas are also both pure and impure but are sustained by the four nutriments The nutriments that sustain a person who is exclusively pure thus the arhats etc are sustained by these four foods The nutriments that sustain an obviously pure person thus the Buddha Bhagavat evidently receives and uses the four foods foodbythemouthfuls etc but when the Bhagavat eats he does not in reality experience eating ii This stanza explains the profundity of taking possession  of number and of activity Because the dharmakāya of the Buddhas is undivided  the Buddhas are one but as innumerable people reach enlightenment the Buddhas are innumerable Their activity is immense but single this explains the profundity of number Although the Buddhas may be innumerable they have the same single activity Hence their profundity They have unstable and stable activity for the Buddhas are endowed with three bodies iii This stanza explains the profundity of the Enlightened One The Enlightened One does not exist for the pudgala and the dharmas are nonexistent but conventionally it is said that all the Buddhas are enlighened How do we know that the Buddhas are enlightened At every moment there are innumerable Buddhas This shows that at each instant innumerable Buddhas reach enlightenment They are constituted of existence and nonexistence this shows that the true nature is existence and nonexistence and that the Buddhas are constituted by this true nature iv This stanza explains the profundity of detachment Since sensual attachment is absent in him it is said that he is not attached Since he has no attachment he is not unattached either Since this attachment does not exist in him he is not unattached It is by way of attachment that he has attained release for it is by eliminating the explosion of desire but by keeping the traces of desire that he has attained definitive release If he had not kept the traces of desire he would have entered into parinirvāṇa like the śrāvakas etc Knowing attachment and unattachment he has penetrated the nature of detachment Understanding that this imaginary sensual attachment has no nature of attachment he has understood the true nature of attachment v This stanza explains the profundity of elimination of the aggregates It cannot be said that they are identical for the imaginary aggregates are afflicted and consequently are distinct from the aggregates of true nature which have been purified by not abandoning these aggregates of true nature the Buddhas have attained nirvāṇa par excellence vi This stanza explains the profundity of ripening action The actions of the Buddhas are homogeneous the activity of the Tathāgatas consists of actions dedicated to the welfare and happiness of beings It is asked what these actions resemble and the author replies that they are like the waters of the ocean thus the waters that flow into the reservoir of the ocean have one and the same flavor are mixed together and all maintain the wellbeing of the fish  etc The Buddhas do not worry about serving others saying vii This stanza explains the profundity of appearance The people of the world do not see the Buddha and yet it is said that the body of the Buddha is eternal If the body of the Buddha is eternal why cannot it be seen It is the fault of beings if he does not appear like the moon which does not appear in a broken jar water does not remain in a broken jar and since the water does not remain in the jar the moon cannot be reflected there the same among beings the water of tranquility being absent the moon of Buddha does not appear Here concentration is compared to the water for it is clear by nature Actually the Buddha does not show himself in the world but he penetrates everywhere by his buddha activity  by preaching the doctrine sūtra geya etc Like the light of the sun that penetrates the entire world he fulfills his buddha activity and ripens beings This seventh stanza is very close to Sūtrālaṃkāra IX yathodabhājane bhinne candrabimbaṃ na dṛiśyate tathā duṣṭeṣu buddhabimbaṃ na dṛiśyate viii This stanza explains the profundity in the manifestation of enlightenment and nirvāṇa Sometimes the Buddha manifests enlightenment sometimes he is nirvanized it is like fire Fire in this world blazes at some moments and is extinguished at other moments It is the same for the Buddha to those whose roots of good are not ripe  he manifests enlightenment in order to ripen these beings and lead them quickly to deliverance to those whose roots of good are ripe and who are already delivered  the Buddha manifests parinirvāṇa for he has nothing further to do the meaning is easy to understand In regard to ordinary dharmas the Buddha has a superior essence and abode in respect to bad dharmas  the Buddha has a superior essence and a superior abode His abode is superior for it is by abiding in the concentrations on emptiness  wishlessness and signlessness that he is supported on these bad dharmas and abides there In respect to human destinies and bad destinies he has superior essence and abode His abode is superior because it is by abiding in the dhyānas and the concentrations that he knows these destinies and abides there x This stanza explains the profundity of the very essence The Buddhas go everywhere their subsequent nonconceptual knowledge goes everywhere Where do they go To diverse objects  good  bad  indeterminate  impure  pure  conditioned  unconditioned although their apparitional bodies take birth in all places the Buddhas are not perceived by the six senses because from the absolute point of view  the eternal dharmakāya does not present the possibility of arising and is not grasped by the damned or by similar beings xi This stanza explains the profundity of cutting off the afflictions in the state of bodhisattva they have corrected the afflictions without cutting them off In the way that a poison is corrected by a spell corrected by a magicians spell  a poison keeps its nature but is unable to harm the power of mindfulness and knowledge corrects their eruption but the traces of the afflictions subsist By retaining the defilements in the state of traces  the Buddhas reach the definitive destruction of the defilements and attain the omniscience of a Buddha instead of entering into parinirvāṇa at once like the śrāvakas because omniscience is attained when the afflictions are destroyed xii This stanza explains the profundity of inconceivability The defilements become auxiliaries of enlightenment  and the suffering of saṃsāra is the same as nirvāṇa When the bodhisattvas recollect the dharmakāya of the Buddhas by how many recollections do they recollect it In brief  the bodhisattvas practice seven methods of recollecting the Buddhas i They recollect them by saying The Buddhas enjoy sovereignty over all dharmas  for in all the universes they have acquired unhindered superknowledges ii They recollect them by saying The body of the Tathāgatas is eternal  for the Tathāgatas are always without stain The Tathāgatas are absolutely blameless  for they are free of any obstacle of affliction and any obstacle to knowledge The Tathāgatas have no effort to make  for being free of effort any activity of the Buddha knows no interruption The Tathāgatas have great enjoyment  for the pure Buddha fields are a great enjoyment The Tathāgatas are free of stains  for they are not stained by any human situation while appearing in the world The Tathāgatas have great usefulness  for by manifesting enlightenment and nirvāṇa they ripen beings who are not yet ripe and deliver beings who are already ripe The perfection of independent movement  the perfection consisting of wanting the welfare of beings Wise people should practice the recollections with regard to all these Buddhas This passage explains how the bodhisattvas recollect the qualities of the dharmakāya of the Buddhas as a result of repeated practice  the Tathāgatas have attained sovereignty over all dharmas at their will  the fulfillment of all the qualities is manifested in them If the Tathāgatas in all the immense and infinite universes enjoy the unhindered superknowledges  why do not all beings reach parinirvāṇa Because these beings are prevented by the obstacles and deprived of the cause of nirvāṇa Over the entire world of beings hindered by the obstacles and deprived of the cause They are deprived of the cause because they do not have the cause for nirvāṇa because they do not have the family The Buddha has no sovereignty allowing him to introduce the beings in question into nirvāṇa this is why after having shown in general that the Tathāgata enjoys sovereignty over all dharmas the author is forced to say more specifically that he does not have sovereignty over beings ii The Tathāgatas body is eternal because he has the very pure tathatā as selfnature because it is unalterable and immovable v The Tathāgatas have great enjoyment for they enjoy the blooming of the qualities of the pure buddhafields which are the great enjoyment of the Dharma These are the seven recollections of the Buddhas Two stanzas summarize these ideas In regard to all these Buddhas ie towards the perfections and the qualities of the Tathāgatas the wise ones ie the bodhisattvas should practice the recollections should practice the seven recollections This recollection consists of remembering the Buddha and recalling him without loss of memory How should the pure buddhafield of the Buddhas be understood The enjoyment of this pure buddhafield is absolutely pure  absolutely blissful  absolutely irreproachable and absolutely efficacious Bh cb bh ab U cb u bb This passage concerns the pure buddhafields of the Buddha These seven jewels are It emits a great light filling immense universes The seven brilliant jewels emit a great light which fills infinite universes Mahoraga means the great boa constrictors After eating this food it procures the interest of all beings In this pure buddhafield there are no torments caused by the afflictions xiii It drives away the māras It expels the four enemies  namely kleśamāra  skandhamāra  mṛtyumāra and devapūtramāra  This phrase explains the perfection of absence of fear of the buddhakṣetra Great practice is the wisdom that comes from meditation xvii For entryways it has the great gates of deliverance emptiness signlessness and wishlessness It has as support a priceless kinglotus adorned with innumerable collections of qualities The enjoyment of this pure buddhakṣetra is absolutely pure this kṣetra is without dirt because it is free of dung It is absolutely blissful for in it there is no sad feeling or intermediate feeling It is absolutely irreproachable for in it there is no bad element or ethically indeterminate feeling Moreover this fundamental element of the Buddhas carries out five activities at all times i It protects beings from torments  for by its view alone  it protects against the torments of blindness  deafness  madness  etc ii It protects against bad destinies  for it makes one abandon bad states and introduces one into good states iii It protects from bad methods  for by preventing heretics from seeking deliverance by bad means  it introduces them into the holy Dharma of the Tathāgata iv It protects from satkāya for it provides a path transcending the threefold world v It protects from the lower vehicles for it introduces bodhisattvas who are attached to other vehicles and śrāvakas etc who are of uncertain family into the practice of the Greater Vehicle All Buddhas have the same activity concerning these five activities of protection Here is a stanza Since the causes  supports  functions  intentions and modes of operation differ in the world differences in activity are assumed Since these diversifying forces are not present in them the masters of the world do not have different activities Bh bc bh ba U ca bb By the sight of the Buddha the blind recover their sight the deaf their hearing and madmen thier reasoning etc In making one abandon the bad destinies it introduces one into the good states and this is what is called protection for if the cause no longer exists the result does not exist either From the point of view of these five activities the Buddhas are all the same In order to explain this idea the author adds a stanza thus the divine cause is a peculiar cause the human cause the demonic cause etc In the world when the supports are different differences in activity are assumed By supports is meant the individuals Because they differ the activities differ Thus Devadatta and Yajñadatta who are different individuals have different activities By functions here is meant the diverse occupations practiced Because the functions differ the activities are different Thus the farmer has a perculiar function the merchant has a peculiar function and so on Since their function ie the service to beings is identical among all of them their activities are not different In the world when intentions differ differences in activity are assumed In the world when the modes of operation differ different activities are assumed Because the efforts differ the activities are different This is not the case for the Buddhas Since all their activity is carried out without effort  their activities are not different If this dharmakāya of the Buddhas associated with such qualities and such perfections  does not occur among the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas with what intention did the Buddha proclaim a single vehicle ākarṣaṇārtham ekeṣām anyasaṃdhāraṇāya ca deśitāniyatānāṃ hi saṃbuddhair ekayānatā In order to attract some and to maintain others the single vehicle has been preached by the Buddhas to people of indeterminate family ca nirmāṇāt paryantād ekayānatā By virtue of the identity of dharmas the nonexistence of self and deliverance by virtue of the difference in families acquisition of two convictions transformations and preeminence there is but one single vehicle Two stanzas explain the intention of the Buddha in proclaiming a single vehicle To attract some he attracts the śrāvakas of indeterminate family and arranges it so that they enter into the Greater Vehicle Because he wants the śrāvakas of indeterminate family to reach parinirvāṇa by means of the Greater Vehicle he maintains the bodhisattvas of indeterminate family and arranges it so that they remain in the Greater Vehicle Because he wants the bodhisattvas of indeterminate family not to leave the Greater Vehicle and not to use the vehicle of the śrāvakas to reach parinirvāṇa The Buddha proclaims a single vehicle for these reasons By virtue of identity of the Dharma By Dharma is meant the true nature The vehicles the vehicle of the śrāvakas etc although they are different lead alike to tathatā and as this tathatā towards which they go is the same  the Buddha proclaims the single vehicle If there really were different pudgalas there could be different vehicles eg that of the śrāvakas and that of the bodhisattvas By virtue of the identity of deliverance Insofar as they deliver from the obstacle of the afflictions  the three vehicles are identical As the Buddha said There is no difference between deliverance and deliverance By virtue of the difference of families rāvakas of indeterminate family are of different kinds In the crowds of śrāvakas moving towards enlightenment there are both the family of the śrāvakas and the family of the Buddhas Since this one has become Buddha  those will become Buddha also That is the first conviction In the assembly of Saddharmapuṇḍarīka the Bhagavat made a prediction to the śrāvakas such as ariputra predicting that they would become Buddha cf Moreover in this assembly there are some bodhisattvas who have the same names as these śrāvakas who receive the same prediction Thus one and the same word of the Buddha bears a twofold advantage the śrāvakas acquire the conviction of being the same as the Buddha and the bodhisattvas receive the revelation of it In fact the Buddha said O monks I remember that at one time at many hundreds of times I attained parinirvāṇa by means of the vehicle of the śrāvakas It is in order to convert beings of the śrāvaka category who are to be converted that the Buddha created bodies and manifested a parinirvāṇa in accord with the śrāvaka vehicle Other vehicles are not absent but there is no other vehicle superior to it Alone this single vehicle is far superior That is why the Buddha proclaims the single vehicle If the Buddhas have one and the same dharmakāya how do we know that there are many Buddhas Now the author will explain why it must be assumed that the Buddhas are one and many at the same time while having all the same dharmakāya They are one because their dharmakāya is the same The Buddhas have the same dharmakāya for selfnature and as this dharmakāya is unique there is but one Buddha Moreover there is but one Buddha because there are never two Buddhas appearing simultaneously in one and the same universe In the stanza it is shown that the Buddhas are one and many at the same time In the same world there are not two Buddhas this phrase shows that there is one single Buddha In the same universe  two Buddhas do not appear simultaneously This is why it is said that there is but one single Buddha The other phrases in the stanza show that the Buddhas are many Innumerable beings complete their accumulations at the same time innumerable bodhisattvas complete their accumulations at the same time If these bodhisattvas who have completed their accumulations of merit and wisdom at the same time did not become Buddha at the same time these accumulations would be vain and sterile But as numerous bodhisattvas finish the accumulations at the same time it must be acknowledged that there are many Buddhas at the same time But since innumerable beings end their accumulations at the same time and since the arising in succession of the Buddhas is impossible the plurality of the Buddhas is asserted How do we know that in the dharmakāya the Buddhas are neither absolutely parinirvanized nor absolutely nonparinirvanized Here is a stanza Because they are free of all obstacles  because their activity has not ended  the Buddhas are absolutely nirvanized and absolutely nonnirvanized at one and the same time b bh ba U c u ba There are adepts of the Greater Vehicle who say that the Buddhas are absolutely nonparinirvanized they are referring to the nirvāṇawithoutresidue element Other adepts claim that the Buddhas are absolutely parinirvanized they are referring to the nirvāṇawithresidue element These two opinions are inadmissible Having succeeded in freeing themseves from all the obstacles the Buddhas are absolutely nirvanized Why is not the body of enjoyment the essential body ii Because it appears differently in numberless Buddha assemblies This is why the enjoyment body is not the essential body This is why the enjoyment body is not the essential body iv The enjoyment body is changeable by nature and of diverse appearances The same spectator first sees the enjoyment body in one aspect  then he sees it in another aspect This is why the enjoyment body is not the essential body v The enjoyment body is always mixed with all kinds of assemblies of bodhisattvas of śrāvakas devas etc whereas the essential body is not mixed with assemblies of this kind This is why the enjoyment body is not the essential body Indeed it is by transforming the storeconsciousness that the essential body is acquired and it is by transforming the active consciousnesses that the enjoyment body is acquired This is why the enjoyment body is not the essential body In view of these six discordances the enjoyment body is not the essential body Why is the apparitional body not the essential body For eight reasons i It is impossible that the Bodhisattva who a long time ago  acquired imperishable concentrations  should take birth among the Tuṣitas and among humans ii It is impossible that the Bodhisattva who for a long time has had the memory of his former abodes  should not know writing  oral arithmetic calculation  carving  the arts  the sciences  as well as the enjoyment of desirable objects perfectly iii It is impossible that the Bodhisattva who for a long time has known the doctrine badly proclaimed or well proclaimed should go to find the heretics iv It is impossible that the Bodhisattva who for a long time has known the right way of the three vehicles  should take up the wrong practice of asceticism v It is impossible that the Bodhisattva neglecting hundreds of thousands of Jambudvipas should be content with one single place to reach enlightenment and turn the wheel of Dharma vi If without manifesting enlightenment  the Bodhisattva used only apparitional bodies to accomplish the deeds of a Buddha everywhere else but in Tuṣita it must be that he would have attained enlightenment only among the Tuṣita gods viii Even if there are many simultaneous appearances of Buddhas that does not contradict the sūtra which affirms that there are not two Buddhas appearing at the same time in one and the same world because in speaking of one and the same world  the sūtra means one and the same universeoffourcontinents Here is a stanza Subtle apparitional bodies of numerous Buddhas enter into wombs simultaneously and function to illustrate omnigeneric enlightenment It is in the service of all beings that the Buddha made his vows  devoted his efforts and attained great enlightenment His complete parinirvāṇa is therefore impossible  for then his vows and his efforts would be sterile The author establishes the impossibility of the apparitional body being identical with the essential body by means of eight reasons  i It is impossible that the Bodhisattva who has acquired undying concentrations for a long time and who never regresses  should take birth in the desire realm  among the Tuṣita gods and even more so  among humans for it is impossible that having cultivated for ages the undying concentrations he should obtain a result in the desire realm Thus it is proved that the apparitional body differs from the essential body v It is impossible that the Bodhisattva neglecting hundreds of koṭis of Jambudvipas should utilize only one place in order to reach enlightenment and turn the wheel of the Dharma because all these places are all the same For this reason the apparitional body is not the essential body only in our Jambudvipa does he really attain enlightenment it is by means of the apparitional bodies that he accomplishes the deeds of a Buddha everywhere else Why not assume that he truly attains enlightenment among the Tuṣita gods and that his apparitional bodies descend into all the universesoffourcontinents in order to accomplish the deeds of a Buddha vii If you think that attaining enlightenment in one single Jambudvīpa and manifesting an apparitional body elsewhere is not impossible why was the Buddha unable to attain enlightenment only when he dwelt among the Tuṣita gods and to manifest his apparitional body in all the Jambudvīpas of the universesoffourcontinents If reaching enlightenment in all the cāturdvīpakas indiscriminately can be denied there is no scriptural text or argument allowing the affirmation that there are Jambudvīpas where the Buddha does not appear If you agree that many Buddhas appear simultaneously in all the Jambudvīpas you are in contradiction to the sūtra For this sūtra speaking of one and the same world  means the same unique universeoffour continents  and not a universeofathousandcontinents Furthermore the stanza mentions many Buddhas and illustrates omnigeneric enlightenment Just as the apparitional body of the Buddha descends into the womb of his mother and accomplishes the other deeds of the Buddha in the same way many fictitious śrāvakas such as āriputra etc with their distinctive characteristics descend into the wombs of their mothers simultaneously at the same time It is in order to illustrate the superiority of this omnigeneric enlightenment that the Buddha created these fictions These vows and these efforts have in view only the service of all beings As long as this work is not completed it is impossible that the Buddha is parinirvanized in complete annihilation  for his vows and his efforts would both be sterile That is why his body is an apparitional body and not an essential body or a body of enjoyment Since the enjoyment body and the apparitional body are both transitory  how can the sūtra say the the body of the Tathāgata is eternal Since the enjoyment is never interrupted and appearances are always reoccuring we know that the body of the Tathāgata is eternal A sūtra says The body of the Tathāgata is eternal But the enjoyment body and the apparitional body of the Buddha are transitory Then how can the body of the Tathāgata be eternal Although these two bodies in question are transitory they depend on the dharmakāya and as the dharmakāya is eternal they also are proclaimed to be eternal An eternal body is eternal by its nature or eternal by means of its basis This shows that the resultant body and the apparitional body are eternal by equivalence and not eternal by nature it always experiences happiness In a similar way people say about X he always experiences happiness Although the happiness experienced by X is neither eternal nor uninterrupted  it is said nevertheless that he always experiences happiness Here people say about X he always gives food even though X does not give food uninterruptedly However as he gives many times and his generous intention persists it is said that he always gives food i because its activity ends when he has liberated the beings destined to be ripened ii to prevent the rejecting of nirvāṇa under the pretext of seeking the eternal body of the Tathāgata iii to prevent one fromn despising the Buddhas and so that one becomes attached to understanding the exposition of the profound Dharma iv in order to arouse interest with regard to the Buddha He is afraid that actually those who see him continually might feel disdain for him vi in order that beings ripen quickly by not giving up the yoke of their personal energy Here are two stanzas Because his activity is complete  in order to prevent rejection of nirvāṇa in order to prevent disdain for the Buddhas in order to stimulate interest in regard to the Buddha b in order to stimulate the personal energy of beings and in order to ripen them quickly  the apparitional body of the Buddha is not present definitively Here are some stanzas Taish  p There are six reasons why the Buddha must abandon his nirmāṇakāya i When the activity of the nirmāṇakāya of the Tathāgata has come to an end this nirmāṇakāya does not exist any longer Objection The dharmakāya of the Buddhas is without beginning  is homogeneous and infinite therefore it is not necessary to acquire it to make efforts Answer Here is a stanza If the state of Buddha which is homogeneous and infinite caused beings to neglect the efforts necessary to obtain it this state of Buddha would be always acquired without cause But to remove such a cause is not permissible The dharmakāya of the Buddhas is without beginning  is homogeneous and infinite it is the cause of obtaining buddhahood The dharmakāya is without beginning is homogeneous and infinite one single Buddha suffices to assure the service of all beings thus it is unnecessary to exert oneself to become Buddha if the state of Buddha  without beginning homogeneous and infinite caused beings to neglect the efforts necessary to obtain buddhahood  this state of Buddha would always be acquired without cause This is why it is not permitted to suppress the cause ie the necessity of effort Objective Content of Cognitive Acts Verse Ia  Everything perceived   These two really do not exist but consciousness evolves into these two  representations  Subjective Content of Cognitive Acts  Next we shall explain the three kinds of perceiver       Retributive o r Karmic Consciousness  Exegesis  The retributive consciousness is called retributive because it is derived from defilement and karma  It is also called the fundamental consciousness  because all seeds  of conditioned phenomena are dependent upon it and  the abode consciousness because it is the place where all seeds rest   It is also called the storehouse consciousness because it is the place  where all seeds are concealed  What kind o f aspects  does this consciousness  have Its aspects and objects cannot be  discriminated  because they are identical and are  not different   If that is so how do we know that it  exists Because of its processes we know that this consciousness exists  This consciousness can produce all defilement karma and retribution  Take ignorance for example  It  must generate ignorance  Is it possible to discriminate  between its aspects and its objects   If they can be discriminated from each other then we do not refer to this state as ignorance    If they cannot be discriminated from each other then you might deny the existence   Yet we do affirm the existence  and deny their nonexistence  Because of the existence of hate greed   and other processes we know that ignorance exists  The fundamental consciousness is also similar in that its aspects and objects are not distinguished from each other   But because of its processes we know that it  exists   There are eight different names for this consciousness  Verse IIIc Exegesis  Three variablessense organs sense data and consciousnesscombine to produce  contact  When the mind is continually active then it is called attentive  Sensation is only neutrality    Exegesis  Volition calculates what can and cannot be done urging the mind to be correct or incorrect This is called volition Attention is like a galloping horse and volition is like the rider A horse only gallops straight ahead but cannot avoid a wrong place or head toward the right place  Because of the rider a horse can avoid the wrong and head toward the right place  Volition  thus can enable ones attention to avoid reckless actions  This consciousness and its mental states are indeterminate  in nature  It constantly flows moment by moment like the current and waves in a river Exegesis  The fundamental consciousness is like the current and the five  states are like the waves   until the attainment of Arhatship   Exegesis  The current and waves of the  states are not eliminated  This is called the first  consciousness   This  consciousness is associated with four defilements   This consciousness is called hidden  but indeterminate    Exegesis  There are also five kinds of associated mental states that have the same names as the above  but are more coarse  This consciousness and its associated  states are eliminated in the Arhat stage being ultimately eliminated upon entering cessationmeditation    Exegesis  When the path of insight   of the sixteen practices  then it  is ultimately eliminated  The residual  that has not been eliminated belongs only to  volition This is called the second  consciousness   Sense Consciousnesses   The third   or consciousness of sense data  is the evolution of consciousness that appears as sense data  developing into six kinds   Exegesis  The evolution of consciousness appearing a s sense data was mentioned above   Their essence is connected with the three qualities   and is associated with ten mental states  ten kinds of good and bad actions together with maj or  of defilement All are composed of three types of sensation   Mental States  The ten kinds of mental states are the previously mentioned fiveVerse Xa   contact etc which are only the most coarse forms  The latter five are   Among these understanding as traditionally explained is resolve   The ten good acts are noninjury ahisa   These ten pervade the mind of the triple world  and the mind  without outflows  and are classified as the great mental elements Their nature is intrinsically good  Bad Mental States  The opposite of these ten are the intrinsically evil   There are ten kinds of major defilements    There are twentyfour kinds of minor defilements   Exegesis  There are two types within these minor defilements   in the sixth consciousnessthe intellect Verse XVb   the fundamental consciousnesso Exegesis  and the appropriating consciousness these three  faculties Verse XVc  ensue from causes and conditions   Having attention as the  cause and external sense data   as the  condition consciousness occurs If ones attention at first desires to apprehend the two sense data of form lit color  and sound then vision and hearing occur simultaneously and there will be two types of sense data   If ones attention is directed toward a certain locus to see forms hear sounds and to smell odors then these three  occur simultaneously and there will be three types of sense data  and so on all the five  consciousnesses may occur simultaneously or sequentially in a similar fashion When there is the occurrence of only a single  consciousness there will be a single sense datum  They ensue from causes and conditions Therefore they  are not the same  The seven consciousnesses occur in interaction with each other in the tilayavijfitina just as groups of forms and images are reflected together in a mirror or Verse XVd  j ust as many waves are all in one body of water On what occasions does this intellect  not arise Verse XVI  Except for these six states meditation without conceptualization  dreamless sleep drunken stupor unconsciousness or a comathe others always have it   Verse XVlIa  The evolution of consciousness is Exegesis   not separate from two principles Since the discriminated  does not exist Exegesis  the discriminator also does not exist Without a sense obj ect to be grasped consciousness cannot occur  Verse XVlIc  Therefore the principle of ConsciousnessOnly can be upheld Definition of ConsciousnessOnly   What does it mean to establish the principle of ConsciousnessOnly The meaning   fundamentally is to dispense with sense obj ects and to dispense with the mind Now if the objective world does not exist ConsciousnessOnly would also be destroyed  This is what I mean by the principle of ConsciousnessOnly is upheld  This is called the pure component  because both defilements and the objective world do not exist   Moreover when I explain that the principle of ConsciousnessOnly is upheld I mean that As for the consciousness containing the seeds of all phenomena   it creates and evolves from one to another   evolving from each other onward and onward into varieties of discriminations and discriminated objects through mutual interaction   Exegesis  For this reason outside of consciousness no events can take place  This is why it is called the impure component for only the prior sense obj ect is dispensed with but not consciousness itself Commentary    As for the consciousness containing the seeds of all phenomena this refers to the alayavijiiana which with all its seeds of phenomena and seeds from the other seven consciousnesses produces various sorts of unlimited phenomena according to their respective types  Thus it is called the consciousness containing seeds of all phenomena   Onward and onward means that because of these consciousnesses one can evolve and produce unlimited phenomena  Some evolve into the sense organs and some evolve into sense data  Some evolve into an ego others into consciousnes s  Such a variety of dissimilar kinds are the products of ConsciousnessOnly It creates and evolves onward and onward From one  to another  through mutual interaction    From one means the five aggregates   evolve  from form to consciousness inclusive  To another means that friends enemies and acquaintances evolve a variety of different kinds   From the perspective of ones own five  aggregates  one calls them other Thus from one  to another evolving from each other means consecutive moments are not the same  Therefore one says through mutual interaction All the various constructs are  consciousness without an obj ective world  Into varieties of discriminations means that in each single  consciousness there is both a discriminator and a discriminated obj ect The discriminator is identical to consciousness and the discriminated  is identical to the sense object The discriminator is the nature of dependence   Therefore one says into varieties of discriminations and discriminated objects   For this reason outside of consciousness there are no other sense objects  But only the existence of consciousness is maintained  Since dispensing with consciousness has not been explained yet delusions and confusion have not yet been eliminated  Therefore it is called the impure component   If one dispenses with sense objects but retains consciousness then one can say that there is a principle of ConsciousnessOnly But if both the sense object and consciousness are to be dispensed with how can consciousness  be maintained One establishes that ConsciousnessOnly temporarily dispenses with the sense obj ect but retains the  mind In the final analysis however one dispenses with sense objects in order to empty the mind This is the correct meaning Therefore  both the sense object and consciousness are dissolved this principle is upheld  both the sense obj ect and consciousness are dissolved this  is identical to the true nature   The true nature is identical to Pure Consciousness    Additionally we can say in the final analysis that this is Pure Consciousness Causes for Positing a Discriminating Subject versus a Discriminated Object  The text says   two kinds of latent impressions from past karma  and two kinds of latent forces can become the origin  bringing about birth and death    The two kinds of latent impressions from past karma are identical to the seeds of karma attachment to the latent impressions from past karma  Latent impressions from past karma are identical to the discriminated  and are discriminated in nature  Attachment to the influences from past karma is identical to the discriminator and is dependent in nature  The  obj ect is the sense object the discriminator is consciousness  These two kinds of karma are called the conventional truth of the origin  bringing about the production of the five skandhas   The two kinds of latent forces are defilement the primitive  latent force  The aspects are the essence of defilement that is dependent in nature and can include previous representations   The primitive  are defilement that is discriminated in nature being the gross manifestation of an objective world  These two defilements are called the absolute truth  because they can accumulate and direct the future five skandhas   From these  there are both kinds of truth of the origin  the conventional truth and the absolute truth If past karma has already been extinguished but one still receives other  retribution then one is still firmly positioned in life and death   Commentary   As for the two kinds of latent impressions from past karma each impression has two principles  the discriminator which is the attachment to the latent impressions from past karma  The object is the nature of discrimination that can produce a panorama of phenomena generated from seeds   This panorama of phenomena is called the latent impression from past karma  It has a name but no essence  The discriminator is the nature of dependence  It is the seed that generates karma and is called the attachment to latent impressions from past karma  It has an essence but is not absolute
